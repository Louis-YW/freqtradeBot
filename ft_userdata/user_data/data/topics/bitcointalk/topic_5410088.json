But QI blockchain is yet to confirm if it’s a scam or not, surely it’s not a professional project but we don’t know their attentions yet. And warning users about it is the right thing to do for now until the prove it wrongPlus they are running promoting campaigns here and with a non trusted promoter so it’s kind of suspicious.

So, you could reconsider, because I know how frustrating it is for a genuine project struggling to see the light being faced with scam accusations without proves.First of all, I'm surprised with your stance. As a senior member of this community, I think you should know better by now. You say, I might be correct about plagiarism? Please review the evidence first and let me know if I'm wrong about that. I welcome the opportunity to listen to and consider new information and opposing viewpoints, and admit when I am wrong.Second, we seem to disagree on semantics, so let's get some facts straight. Plagiarizing other people's work without permission or attribution is a deceptive and fraudulent act that is not only detrimental to the community, but it is also illegal, and according to the English dictionary:Quote from: merriam-webster.comscam noun\\ ˈskam  \\: a fraudulent or deceptive act or operationQuote from: scam definition - google searchscam noun\\ ˈskam  \\: a dishonest scheme; a fraud.So, can you explain to me, in which sense you can call a fraudulent project that steals ideas and content from someone else's work a \"genuine\" one? It's not a genuine project. It just copies another project, and tries to fool people into thinking it's something new and innovative when in fact it is neither. Therefore, it's just a scam. And I find it odd that you think this practice is acceptable. It's not. Plagiarism is stealing, and theft is wrong.",

This sentence from their whitepaper will show you how mindless team behind QiBlockchain is when they didn't even adjust the BTC price lol and instead they just copy/pasted text. Anyone remembers last time BTC was  at ~$250?Quote from: https://qiblockchain.online/images/QI-blockchain_whitepaper.pdfThe standard fee per bitcoin transaction is currently BTC 0.0001 (2.5 cents at $250/bitcoin) and is collected by the miner of the block in which that transaction isconfirmed.Flag supported and nice find FatFork!",

I have just asked for one question from the OP, if what I am promoting it's fake then kindly he can share the real project here with us. Don't just check one thing, we need strong proof of what he wrote.You are constantly asking that if this is a fake project then tell you which is the real project. I think you fail to understand. To clear things I mean to say that QI Blockchain is the only project and it is a scam. There is no other QI Blockchain project. I hope now it is clear. Also, if you ask for proof, then there are 99% of projects who have Plagiarized whitepaper, they were scams. Tell me any project which had a Plagiarized white paper and it was a trusted good project?",

      "body": "Quote from: FatFork on August 17, 2022, 08:10:54 AMFirst of all, I'm surprised with your stance. As a senior member of this community, I think you should know better by now. You say, I might be correct about plagiarism? Please review the evidence first and let me know if I'm wrong about that. I welcome the opportunity to listen to and consider new information and opposing viewpoints, and admit when I am wrong.Second, we seem to disagree on semantics, so let's get some facts straight. Plagiarizing other people's work without permission or attribution is a deceptive and fraudulent act that is not only detrimental to the community, but it is also illegal, and according to the English dictionary:You don't have to be surprised at my stance on this unless you don't get me right.What I'm saying in essence is that a plagerist is not a scammer and these are two different crimes in the forum. Ironically you would even see a scammer tolling the forum with some few red tags while a plagiarist wouldn't be that lucky. Plagiarism is an offence whose consequence is permanent ban. My stance on this is; instead of alleging a scam that hasn't even happen and which might not happen, why not project plagiarism and then the account might be banned outrightly.I see that Jawadu is a bounty manager who might have promoted a scam project before in the forum, so that is not enough to conclude that the QI Blockchain is a scam project, unless you have some reserved evidences which you may want to show the community. Report in the thread for plagiarism, Report to moderators and then the account might not survive it.Quote from: Rikafip on August 17, 2022, 08:45:06 AMAn obvious plagiarism is not \"tangible\" enough for you? Beside, what do you think will happen with a project where team is not capable of writing their own whitepaper and instead they have to copy/paste from someone else's? An obvious plagiarism of whitepaper is surely a red flag. A scam project is always hasty to get their project running and hence uses any available tools to set up their platform as fast as possible.",
