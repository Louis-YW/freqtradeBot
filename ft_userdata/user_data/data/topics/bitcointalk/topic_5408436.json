      "body": "No the import tariffs are be paid as the products enter the country. They are already in the price. Now they have to charge sales tax too. The only good thing about it is that is a domestic ship so you should get it in a week at most.However if difficulty and BTC price remain flat you are still a year out for paying off the cost of the miners even with free electric.Still not a great deal.-Dave",
