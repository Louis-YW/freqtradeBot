  "content": "I am selling a big piece of land on the moon which I bought in 2000 from Lunar Embassy (Lunarembassy.com). This a cool way to symbolically send your BTC to the moon. Area A-1 / Quadrant Golf, Lot 471I bought this deed in 27-12-2000 from Lunar Embassy. This company has claimed ownership of the moon at the UN in 1980 after the UN put in the law that no country can claim ownership of the moon. Dennis M. Hope found a loophole and claimed the Moon of Earth. The ownership is controversial and made the news many times. He sold million of pieces of land even to many celebrities. Some think it is a scam, and maybe it is. I found it interesting and bought 3 lots back then. People still buy these lots as a novelty gift or just to claim land on the moon for the future (who knows what this will bring). This offer represents 10 sercas of land on our moon, which is equal to 1777.58 acres. Back in 2000 the lots were sold per 10 secras, nowadays the Lunar Embassy is only selling lots per 1 acre for $34,99. So this Lunar Deed has a theoretical value of $62.197,52. You can subdivide the lot in maximum 10 pieces, according to Bill of Rights. The lot is named \"Doarla @ the moon\" by myself and my friend. This is transferable on your name. I am selling one of my three Lunar Deeds. I want to keep two for myself for the future. Who knows what the future will bring in the space race, besides that it‚Äôs a cool novelty gift. You can buy my Lunar Deed for 0,1 BTC. This includes: - Lunar Deed (A3 size, signed)- Lunar Map (A3 size)- Lunar Constitution Bill of Rights (A3 size, signed)- The short story:‚ÄùYou own what?‚Äù- Copy of the original Declaration of Ownership filed with the United Nations general AssemblyThe location of this lot 471: Latitude 60¬∫ - 64¬∫ N, Longitude 66¬∫ - 70¬∫ WThe property is located 22 squares south and 9 squares east of the extreme northwest corner of the Lunar chart. I will send you the Lunar Deeds by courier for free. You can contact me for more information by sending me a personal message. Kind regards, Farl",

Looks like you can still buy these scam papers at their website: https://lunarembassy.com/product/buy-land-on-the-moon/Why would we send you bitcoin for this?Yes, the idea is controversial for sure. Lunar Embassy (owner Dennis M. Hope) claimed the moon, because of a loophole in the law the UN created called the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 (OST). In the nineties thousands of these deeds were sold. I did so too, you never know.¬†  Same when I bought BTC and LAND in Decentraland in the beginning. People called me a fool.¬† Because of Lunar Embassy stopped selling lots of 10 secras, but 1 acres per lot, the value is now $62.197,52 per Lunar Deed. This could be a reason for people to buy it from me.",

After all we are all buying/ selling/ storing imaginary coins and millions of lives depend on them. This is normal.Ps, I like how you smile in your avatar, like nothing is wrong with the world kind of smile. Lol",
