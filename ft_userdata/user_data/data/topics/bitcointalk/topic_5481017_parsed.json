So let’s just wait and see in the next days and months.",

What are they trying to do—channel the attack on those who file for bitcoin ETF? Or are the hackers trying to manipulate the market with the news? I have so many questions to ask regarding this incident.",

But how possible it is for SEC Twitter account to be hacked at a critical time when everyone is glued to hear about the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF, well just like you said Bitcoin will and is still gaining more recognition with or without ETF approval so no matter how they try to compromise or disapprove spot Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin maintains it's volatility.",
