      "body": "Regarding Putin and the war on Ukraine, Putin's reasons for it were a police action, just like the US has done all around the world loads of times since WW2.Consider... Who is the bigger aggressor? Is it Russia, that shut down the USSR, giving a bunch of Soviet countries their freedom?Or is it the US who has military bases around the world in all kinds of countries, gradually forcing them to pay income taxes to the US banking system?Just the idea of the US boldly going into Ukraine for the purposes of breaking Russia up, and selling her off to the highest bidder, shows you that the US is the far bigger aggressor. And by being the kind of aggressor that they are, they are forcing into being the New-World-Order made up of the members of BRICS and the forty+ nations that are applying for membership. Why is there a BRICS? Because nations around the world see and understand US aggression, even if the American people don't.I mean, the US talks freedom, and then goes out and tries to conquer the whole world through its lying, thieving, fiat money system. And people listen to the talk rather than think about what is really happening.",

It is treachery for the American legislature to successfully achieve its aim of reducing or stopping the financing of Ukraine in this war against Russia.  Was it, not the same House and Senate that gave President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a standing ovation after he addressed them at the beginning of the war? They promised to give Ukraine all the support. Withdrawing support now is like sending them to the battlefield but withdrawing supplies of arms and ammunition. The truth is that American support is one of the main reasons why the war started and they shouldn't withdraw their support until they help in ending the war maybe through negotiations.  QuoteI in the other hand think it's a threat to the whole world. We owe the next generation a sustained working system of governance. This war is a test for freedom. As an independent  nation,  are you really independent to make your own choice? No one should assume the position of ominipowerful. It's too risky to allow such abnormally. There have been several wars that have threatened world peace. The recent war in Ukraine is the current example and the world would have been peaceful if powerful nations stopped invading weaker ones. The leaders of the Western and Eastern bloc should give smaller nations the freedom to determine their future and not impose leaders or forms of government on them. Russia and the US are guilty of the crime of invading nations and causing more problems while claiming that they are solving them. QuoteIn the other hand, there are  concerns  about age of President Biden. A lot of threat has been written about it already but I will keep it simple. There are medical facts on the functionality of human minds when the get older. Mental health problems are common among old people such as isolation, anxiety disorders, dementia, and psychosis, among others. Some also suffer from sleep and behavioral disorders, cognitive deterioration or confusion states as a result of physical disorders or surgical interventions.Most of the decisions Joe Biden makes are not from his thoughts,  he has an army of advisers that assist him in making policies. And with his age, we could say he has a lot of experience.  But I am not a fan of grandfathers becoming presidents. If Americans think he is not competent, it should be reflected in the forthcoming elections.",
