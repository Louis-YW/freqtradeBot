  "content": "Hello, uh so I was wondering about the security of the wallet I am choosingRight now, I am using Exodus, which I heard here is a ticking time bomb. I am aware, and I responded saying that if I ever came across a sizable amount of money I would get a better wallet.Some irl stuff happened too don't wanna get into detail of that, unrelated to this thread but whatever. This will probably be my last threadSo, now that time has come. I quit this website since I have no use for it anymore, I am living a far more mentally healing life after a year and a half of pure struggling, LITERAL HELL and over 30-40 cases of bad luck and complete bs to say the least. I am fed up and now I am far away from the dumpster fire of the life I had, which you may see by just viewing my previous threads here, some of which was so bad I just had to edit it out/try to remove completely. $40-80 a week is nice but now I have alot more opportunities and I'm not struggling for the next half a year trying to earn \"merit\" to rank up. That was so annoying especially with all the unnecessary bs of people accusing me of being an alt and stuff. If I ever come back in the future hopefully no one tries some verification bs \"account sold, account hacked!! respond with a signed message of ur wallet!!\" because I will not ever.I need to find a good wallet without ordering anything to my house. I was thinking of Trezor/Ledger (I still need to be educated on the pros cons and differences about them), until I realized that I would have this sent to my house.Is there any other safe alternative option that doesn't involve this?",

But just wanted to tell you that the Forum isn't responsible for any of your bad lucks. That's how life is sometimes so you have to deal with it.So for your question about wallet, I guess since you are so worried about exposing your location and keeping your privacy (I guess). Then you should try out some software wallet thats safe for long term and secured. I'll recommend electrum as I've also been using it for years to store some good amounts ands far no troubles.

Everything I've had bad luck with was outside of this website. I actually learned alot about this site too and I'm grateful to even learn about this website. Also, there is always going to be people going through worse than what I went through. I tried to be \"grateful\" during the bad times but it's like really difficult especially at bad luck that seems to never end seemingly forever and ever til recently. I'm going to use my story and experience to try and help others when I am more prepared to. I actually do have a good reputation on another website non crypto related where I'm basically some \"trusted\" figure in their community for doing this type of stuff. I'm sorry for typing alot I just probably won't be using this website again anytime soon as soon as some random drama in the rep board is over, and I like to be happy during good times. The number 1 thing I always think about when I think about bitcointalk is all the people and friends I've met and came across over the years of my life who I will probably never speak to again sadly, due to the simple fact that I can't find them due to their inactivity, which is sad honestly.Quote from: Despairo on April 29, 2024, 08:21:12 AMIt's really depend on you.If you have a good understanding and technical skill in computer science, you can create your own air-gapped wallet using your own device, you can use Electrum https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlIf you don't want to spend time to learn and no have any idea about it, just choose to buy the hardware wallet instead, you can use PO BOX, so it will not send directly to your address.As for both responses, I will check Electrum out right now, thank you I only know about a long majority of the history of this forum and some small things here and there that's about it. Maybe I will learn someday, but right now until my exams are over I will just be focusing strictly with school.",

I'm going to improve my life as a whole and try to get the best outcome. I just do not want to put what's basically a second chance to waste. Electrum seems good so far and I'll definitely use it for the future. I'm grateful for what I've learned from this site over my time here, every minute spent here was not put to waste and there are always a majority of good community members here.",

But \"never say never.\" I think you understand what this phrase means?Also...close your threads to avoid spam after you leave.Initially, i was not planning to stay here for more than a couple of minutes. This was the first topic I posted when I first logged in, because I needed to find an answer to this question. I believe I have been answered this before when making a thread about Exodus but I completely forgot other than \"trezor\" and \"ledger\". I check my reputation and I see another false accusation from jollygood so now I might as well be back here until I clear it up fully with him. And I've also realized I accidentally left people here on read.No one is interested about my stories and life rants, I've made threads before about it and even when making them I made sure to add that in to show that I'm aware. Everything here is going to be forgotten and I'm probably never going to be remembered by anyone who's ever viewed either within a few years at most. \"never say never.\" Exactly I will listen to you. This thread will be closed now. Thank you as wellQuote from: Alphakilo on April 29, 2024, 09:33:30 AMSorry about your experience.

In the end, the decision is up to you. I am not quitting due to accusation,(I was already inactive prior for a while) I am quitting because I was only here to make money, but $40-80 a week isn't enough. It's just that this nothing that I can really do here anymore except learn more about crypto and the evils of gambling websites(I DO NOT GAMBLE it is horrifying). I am also aware that there is nothing I can do about my Rollbit wallet loss(which is why im here to begin with) and I'm warning people to this day to avoid my mistakes. I will still refer to people who are in need about this website because I believe this can still serve a purpose to those who need to make money or learn about crypto facts or security. I was mostly inactive recently due to me wanting to only focus on school and sad irl events that I do not want to state here and prior because of december exams.",
