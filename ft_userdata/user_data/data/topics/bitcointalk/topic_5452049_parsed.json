  "content": "It was a very tragic night for me but at the end, I still have to give thanks to the almighty creator  for this kindness and mercy on me.It all happened around 2am last night when I heard sudden movements within my compound and since I barely sleep early at night, I was curious to know who was walking  about by that ungodly hour because it wasn't sounding  like a step of just one person, so I had to pay close attention and to my greatest shock, my door was forced open without a single knock on the door and I was gripped in fear as I saw men with guns and daggers and deadly weapon and all I could hear is where is the money I was shocked because since last month I haven't  been active on the forum because of a little project I had in hand and I was hoping to save up and get a car for hire purchase that I could use for Uber business  but before I could even point where the money was, i was given the torture of my life and was stabbled mercilessly and they also took all I had including my phone and laptop and all the savings I had but in all that happened, I  returned all the glory and thanks to God and I'm currently  receiving treatment and I just want the forum to join me thank God  for another opportunity to be among the living.Below are some of the pictures",

I hope this incident will not happen to you again no it won't again but the problem here is that we can't not predict how things are happening, nowadays but with God protection we will surely be fine this incident happens on aware but God is under control of everything. And that's the reason why wes should always pray to God whenever we see the next day of our life's, because we don't really know what will happen to ourselves just like this incident it was unexpected but with God we are strong and good it's not by our power neither our strength to see the next day of our life's. Okay just earlier this morning when I was leaving for work I saw the cars hitting each other's one the car was so bad, that someone can't even survive it but non die on it. So it's something to give thanks to the Almighty God our creator in and our Savior for everything.",

I know that there are atheists in the forum and they won't understand and get convinced with what you say. But I am happy to see that you're grateful to the Almighty God and you're honoring Him through the protection given you. (no debate intended to the unbelievers)I was looking at the date of the thread and I thought that it happened recently but it's been a year already.What you have said is true, we don't hold what's with tomorrow so be grateful with what he have to Him.",
