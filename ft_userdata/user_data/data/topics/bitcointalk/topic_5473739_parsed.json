Like, what would be the variables to be considered in getting anything close to a risk to reward ration with minimum accuracy…? I don’t see how any variable come apply here as the crypto market don’t play by any particular set of rules but, whatever is consistent at a time.Your best bet would always be to consider every investment options independently and hope for the best.",

It's not a magic formula giving you the actual likelihood to win a trade or to lose it, it's just a tool that helps traders to manage their bankroll because money management is one of the most important thing in trading.The risk/reward ratio is actually the amount you risk for the amount you could potentially gain. So basically for a random trade it's the amount of money you will lose if your Stop Loss is triggered onto the amount you will earn if your Take Profit target is reached. So it's only you who is able to determine it with your trading targets.Small Stop Losses with high TP target trades are more likely to be lost but losses for each of those trades are smaller though.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskrewardratio.asp",

Assume you do something wrong, make bad decisions with altcoins, you will lose 10% of your capital.

From your entry price, you will have two possible exit prices: one for cut loss, another one for take profit. Entry > Cut loss : Entry > Take Profit should be 1: 3. If you see chance to take profit and profit is less than 3 times of your loss (if you cut loss), don't open that position.",

The market has not always the same direction, sometimes it goes down, sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes sideways, so why the RRR should be the same for every trend? When we are in a bear market, your Stop Losses are more likely to be triggered while when we are in a bull market they are less likely to be triggered and Take Profit targets are more likely to be reached so the RRR should be adapted to the current trend of the market if you want to have a smart money management IMO.",

One of the sites that sometimes i use for this purpose is https://calc.trade/Also, the trading view also provides the long and short position tool and when you apply it on the chart, it will show you the risk reward ratio and you can adjust it too.Screenshot of that tool when applied on the chart:-",

The number for reward is bigger, the better because your chance to get profit will be 3, 4 or 5 times bigger than risk to have loss or at price you have to cut loss.I understand your point that in a beginning of bear market like 2021, traders have big risk to lose money because altcoins can lose 80% or 90% from their all time highs. It's different in last two months when bear market is coming to an end and it's less risky to trade or invest in good altcoins and hold them. I see latest months are good times to have good RRR with altcoins.Risk with altcoins is always high.",

But at least in the case of casinos and especially sportsbooks, their RR is almost always very close to actual execution regardless of variance and upsets. Hence the house always wins. Because laws of probability in long term prove correct there.But in trading, it's impossible to know the probability, hence a skewed or biased RR. You know the risk, but you cannot know the probability of that risk happening.In gambling the risk and probability is almost aligned. e.g. 1:2 means 50/50. 1:3 means 33% chance.But trading 1:3, it's imperfect probability.",

I am only aware that some types of trading has a multiplier's involved.I mentioned gambling because gambling is often used as a reference for risk-reward ratios. This has been around for a relatively long time in the gambling sector, especially for sports betting. However, it quickly becomes clear why it works in sports in particular: The results are far easier to assess than in classic trading. You know the teams, know the injury status of the players and can also fall back on the results of the teams' previous matches. Such \"additional information\" is, of course, completely absent in trading; the most you can incorporate here is the general market sentiment (bullish vs. bearish) or global events such as wars and pandemics. However, deriving a risk/reward ratio from this is very risky and is therefore not really practiced.",

The more you rely on something other than you the more hard it becomes to keep up. Everything is evolving and we need to keep up with that. The information you feed that tool will only use that information and nothing else. But every day we need to come up with something new. In theory, it is possible but not the best choice. You should be better off doing it on your own manually. It's just some algorithm and calculations. If you can make it on your own, you should use it but never do something created by others because they're thinking of the market and you're thinking could never be same.
