      "body": "As the main author, I can reassure you that most of the functionality there is a wrapper around RPC of `monero-wallet-rpc`, which you may quickly check in the source. The main exceptions are:1. subaddress generation (instantly verifiable with an official wallet),2. output recognition,3. seed/wordlist operations.You may skip the latter two easily. If you're worried about anything particular, just ask.Cheers,",
