I receive control over your domain... the day of payments comes and... you vanish! Now I gotta sell your domain to recover my $700... but how easy is it for me to recover my money? Usually no one actually wants the domain and/or it isn't actually the $1000. Remember that someone has to pay for it. That's why I don't take domains as collateral, maybe others have a different opinion.",

Go through the topics and understand that no one will trust a person who has been here for several days, but getting negative trust is tantamount to leaving you forever with the stigma of a fraudster.

      "body": "I also contacted Sportsbet to offer them to work together. With the contact button on the left side, if I remember well. But that aside. People can end up in ridiculous situations.But suppose I'm a scammer with my own website. Not an affiliate website, but a website with loyal followers who come to our site because they are happy with what they read. They come for this. They donate for this. I have a mailing list of people who receive our newsletter.  (All visible, send the most famous Scambuster of the forum after me who smells BS directly, I have nothing to hide).All these people have a lot of trust in me, and rightly so because I am involved. I am the the person who also writes and answers the emails of readers. For years. These are also people of whom I know exactly what they want. Wouldn't I rather take advantage of this situation to get together what I urgently need (and much more if I want), instead of asking for a loan here as a newbie, relatively, little money?I can and will not obtain what I need that way.Why would you risk it here then, one might say? I know what I'm doing. I know what's coming in funds and I'm not risking anything because it can't go wrong on my side. I do not assume that a very well-known lender here will ruin my website to take advantage of it. That´s the only risk for me.There are many more things and maybe many more questions. But that´s for a lender(if there is someone who wants to help).There will certainly be a counter-answer or suspicions here again. Something I absolutely understand. Ofcourse I do. As I said, sometimes people can end up in ridiculous situations. And besides that, I gain more trust here when a transcaction is succesful. .This here is place where I want to build up a passive income. I have written something here that may a little insight into who I am.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457440.msg62455218#msg62455218English is not my motherlanguage. I do my very best.

      "body": "OP, If you are looking to get some work done, the best place to post your request is in the Services section. The lending board might not be the most suitable spot for that.Also, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about the type of services you are seeking. How do you expect someone to contact you if you haven't explained what kind of work it is? However, if you are not ready to offer payment, I do not know what you are expecting in return. While some of us are open to doing charitable work, we typically reserve it for noble causes. I have my doubts about whether your job qualifies as such, whatever it may be.Regarding your loan request, it has already been clearly explained to you. The policy is simple: no collateral, no loan! This especially applies to newcomers.Quote from: Freedom4All on June 26, 2023, 11:43:16 PM~If all of this is indeed true (although we are still lacking concrete evidence, so I will speak hypothetically), then your story becomes even more puzzling. If you genuinely are an honest person and not attempting any sort of scam here, and you find yourself in these \"ridiculous situations,\" wouldn't it make more sense to seek help from your family, friends, or someone else close to you? These are the people who truly know you and trust that you will repay them. (I mean, they could always resort to leg-breaking... just a joke, of course.) Wouldn't that be a more logical step than asking for money from complete strangers on a forum?",
