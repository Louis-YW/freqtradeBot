I am writing to you today with a humble request that holds the potential to make a significant impact on our shared mission of spreading the adoption of Bitcoin.I have a vision that I believe aligns perfectly with the values and aspirations of this community - to bring Bitcoin closer to everyday life, one street at a time. To bring this vision to life, I am embarking on a journey to launch a Bitcoin snack vending machine initiative. These vending machines will not only provide convenient snacks but will also promote the use of Bitcoin in a tangible way, fostering awareness and understanding of this groundbreaking technology.To get this project off the ground, I am in need of your support. I am kindly requesting donations ranging from $1 to $10, with the goal of raising $3000. This amount will be used to purchase the initial vending machine and secure the necessary domain for our venture.I want to emphasize that your contribution, no matter how small, will make a meaningful difference. I understand the value of your hard-earned Bitcoins and want to assure you that this investment in our project will not go unnoticed. As the vending machine business starts generating revenue, I am committed to returning the funds to our generous donors. This is not merely a request for charity; it is an opportunity to join me on a journey to promote Bitcoin in every corner of our communities.One unique aspect of our vending machine is that it will only accept Bitcoin payments through the Lightning Network, enhancing the overall user experience while demonstrating the efficiency and speed of Bitcoin transactions.To all the Bitcoin enthusiasts and believers in the power of cryptocurrency, I humbly request your support. Your small contributions will help us reach our goal and bring us one step closer to making Bitcoin an integral part of daily life.If you are willing to support our cause, please consider making a donation to the following Bitcoin address: 168FF9EoZA5Hj49zqZzYrFfRB7zGaXfj4bThank you in advance for your generosity and for believing in the potential of our project. Together, we can make Bitcoin accessible to everyone, and I am excited to embark on this journey with you.Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this initiative further, please feel free to reach out to me at lionswaq@icloud.comWith gratitude and optimism,Lion, BitcoinSnack",

Because I think you should have the capital to establish your own business before starting the business, nevertheless, what I am trying to say here is that, this respective forum is against beggingQuote7. No begging. [5]I understand that you come up with great idea to promote Bitcoin adoption, but you should have enough money to fund it.",

Asking for a donation of $1 or $10 makes me question your integrity. I do not think you are actually looking for investment in your project. I believe you are trying to scam people by using the word donation. I might be wrong too, that is why I would like advice to first come up with a prototype of your concept and then look for investors.",

I am not accusing or blindly judging you, in fact, I said it because, first you tried to use the Bitcoin adoption campaign as bait to get attraction, then you asked for donations to collect $3000, which my dear new member is impossible for you to collect from BTT in donations. Why? OGs will tell you that. After that, You said, once I will start to make money I will return the funds back. I mean, your own ideas are not clear, because if one BTC crazy ace has given you the donations then why would he need them back? He is not giving you some kind of loan, instead, he is donating it then why do you think you have to return it back to them? This indicates that you wanted to create situations for the respected members of this forum that will lure them into thinking that they should avail this opportunity. But that's wrong OP, and a single machine will not make that much impact while ETFs and banks are spending millions of dollars on buying BTC why would we give money to you while our work (adoption of BTC) has started? I hope you won't mind my words.",

Definitely showing a prototype or the concept on how the vending machine works because I assume that it will not just accept bitcoin or crypto but also cash too.If I am being honest, I don't think that anyone's going to donate you anything, they won't get anything out of it anyway and the only time I see someone do a donation in this forum is if it helps the forum or bitcoin big time.

Looking back I think I may have made a mistake in how I presented my idea on this platform. I've spoken to some friends even though they aren't well versed in cryptocurrencies. They've suggested considering options, for raising funds.Bitcointalk isn't the right place for fundraising, there are crowdfunding sites for that.You did come to the right place to discuss the idea though, but you'll have to do better than showing a fake picture. You'll have to be serious, which you are not. If you'd be serious, you'd know not to use a legacy address for receiving small transactions. If that's how you think you can run a Bitcoin vending machine, fees will eat up any profit you had.If you'd be serious, you'd come up with a business plan, cost break down, expected customers, locations, and profit sharing for your investors. Asking for donations for a commercial project is just bad.Back to the idea of vending machines: If I see one that accepts Bitcoin, I'll buy a cold beverage just to support the initiative. But most potential customers won't have Bitcoin, so you're fishing in a small pool. I also wouldn't use it often: I think we all know the feeling of paying a vending machine, seeing it move, and the product getting stuck up there. I've come to strongly dislike vending machines for this reason, and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone. Besides, those convenience-products are generally overpriced. That's great for your profit margin, but makes that I'm usually prepared to not need to buy those items on the road.So it's a higly competitive market, and if your only USP is accepting something that most people don't carry on them, you may be promoting Bitcoin but you won't be making any money.And don't even get me started on the inconvenience of waiting for a confirmation, or the risk of accepting zero-confirmation payments.",

Spending money on an already listed aged domain is just 10 times worse.Let's assume your intention is genuine you should start the other way around- have the software needed and test it- go and check the costs for installing one of those and how much you would need to pay out of your pocket assuming no sale (this includes the cost of the merchandise)- check the cost for your company (depends on the country) but you will need one - check how much a vending machine costs and how much it will be to modify it for Bitcoin LN paymentsWith those things and especially the data, draw the line and say I need x for investments, then you might find someone willing to help!But I guess that was too much work!Quote from: ETFbitcoin on September 21, 2023, 09:56:21 AMSome technical question,1.
