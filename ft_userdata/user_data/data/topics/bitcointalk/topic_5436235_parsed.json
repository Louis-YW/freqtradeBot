They say they got licensed in England in 2021 but on the footer of their site, they claim they are located in Denmark. Privacy policy also talks of Denmark Virtual Financial Asset Act.2. They claim to have launched in 2011 (2 years ago) but the domain name just got update 5 months ago. This is how the website looked like on the 21-June-2021, a couple of months after their said launch http://web.archive.org/web/20210621112216/https://crypto-hope.com/Code:Domain: crypto-hope.comRegistrar: NameCheap, Inc.Registered On: 2021-05-08Expires On: 2023-05-08Updated On: 2022-08-26",

Do you think I can trust them?how did you find this siteWhen I researched this site, I found nothing, and when I speak of not having found anything, I mean not having found a positive and negative review and some post on the entire internet, which leads me to question where you found this site that is unknown on the internet. of so many negative points of this site I want to add one more negative point, this one:any site that wants to have a good reputation and respect would not put a yobit image on its sitemy conclusion:this site was created by someone who is still an amateur in this industry, someone who is still not very familiar with many things, of course there is no doubt that the person has zero interest in running a serious business, he just wants to steal money and run away",

(Fortunately, I didn't give him the domain)Thank you very much!There's no such thing as deposit to verify an address you can do that by signing or verifying your address using Electrum or other wallets, but they did not recommend this because they want to scam you, it's not only on this exchange but it happens on may platforms they ask to deposit ownership, this is always a warning sign if they ask you to deposit, its good that you ask it here you find out the truth and many people learn how this crypto-hope.com operates, you can create a scam accusation on this platform and named it a potential scam because you have a first-hand experience on this platform.QuoteTo prove ownership of Bitcoin address you don’t actually have to spend coins from it. There is a feature called sign message that allows you to prove that you possess BTC without actually spending it and by never exposing your private keys.Most wallets such as Bitcoin core, electrum, MyEtherWallet and even hardware wallets such as Ledger & Trezor provide signing functionality.",

(Fortunately, I didn't give him the domain)Thank you very much!Yes, fortunately, you asked before falling into their trap. A person should always ask before doing anything he does not know. There is no need to send bitcoins to verify the wallet. This is a clear scam.Why do they basically need to verify the wallet? You can withdraw bitcoins to any address you want without having to verify that you own the wallet.",

(Fortunately, I didn't give him the domain)Thank you very much!Since you do not have any knowledge of crypto, you can hang around in the forum and learn more about crypto with time, that is if you have the time to stay here, you can also only come here to ask questions only when you need them and you will surely get answers, do whichever one that works for you.Any platform that asks you to deposit money to them before withdrawal is probably a scam, it doesn't matter if it is a crypto related platform or not, whenever you are asked to pay some money to withdraw your own money, or a money they claim you have won through giveaway or any other means, do not send anything, but investigate deeper into the platform or what they are offering you.",

If you send the domain to him and deposit the amount, you will lose: - your domain. - The amount of Bitcoin that you will deposit. - Your personal data and the cost of the domain you gave him for free.Therefore, there is no reason for you to sell your domain to an unreliable third party, no matter how tempting the amount they are trying to offer you.",
