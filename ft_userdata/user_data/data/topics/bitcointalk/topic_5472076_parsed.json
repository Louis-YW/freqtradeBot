The next day Instagram banned the account. Don't know if you also thought about that. I mean what would be the buyers faith after paying for the account and they get banned?",

They do this kind of thing where they grow an instagram account and build a bot following that's going to make it gain some real followers albeit not enough to make organic engagements. And once it's out of their hands, it's going to be a useless account with thousands of followers on the people that's bought the sold account.",
