More $$ means more hiring and SEC has already said it plans to add extra staff to its digital assets enforcement squad which has nearly doubled in size in a year.\"\"GaryGensler has submitted the @SECGov's congressional budget justification for FY 2024 and is asking for $2.436 billion, up from $2.149 billion in FY 2023. The @CFTC has requested $411 million, up from $365 million last year. Unlike the SEC, the CFTC has to compete with other agencies for their budget because they are not \"budget neutral\", meaning the money they make does not offset the cost of the appropriation. Gensler has claimed the SEC is budget neutral, but last year the agency under-collected their 31 fees by $414 million.\"___https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/15/sec-chairman-gensler-suggests-again-that-proof-of-stake-tokens-are-securities-report/SEC Chairman Gensler Suggests Again That Proof-of-Stake Tokens Are Securities: Report",

The SEC will fine a lot of cryptocurrency projects, and a lot of money will go to the budget in the form of fines. Therefore, I am sure that this budget will be approved. Maybe with changes, but not significant.",
