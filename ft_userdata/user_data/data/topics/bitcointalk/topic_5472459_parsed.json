However, without jobs, there isn't Bitcoin, as it's just a currency, a mean of payment people receive for their effort, deeds and skills. We can't expect to solve the poverty problem in the world by sharing free money with everyone. People still have to develop a career, to become proficient in something they can assist the society and then be paid for that. Only then Bitcoin comes into the play, as people can be paid through the digital currency, which is much more interesting thinking on future gains and fighting inflation than fiat ones.",

      "body": "Let's not look at bitcoins as an over-all problem solver; let's also think outside the box. The rate of poverty increasing day by day is both the cause of the government, whose citizens are below the poverty rate, and that of the citizens themselves. If the government fails to create jobs and other things that can keep the country moving and opportunities being created, what are you doing as a citizen? Most times people feel very reluctant, as if they can never do anything for themselves and escape poverty in a country that's not doing well. If you come from someone where the country doesn't care much about job creation, you as a citizen of such a place should focus on self-development and build yourself to a standard that people will need your service. You can, from your developed skills, employ many others, and from there you have been able to lift one or two people in your locality off the unemployment list. Is it not someone who has something to feed and is in good health who will be able to spare out a few dollars and invest in bitcoin, and even if they try and save out that little penny and invest, how long do you think it will take for it to give them profit, and how many times profit do you think they will get from it that will be enough to change one's financial status? What the people need now is to be more industrious, create jobs for themselves, or look for one and attach themselves? I don't see bitcoin lifting poverty from anyone's life currently.",

Bitcoin has a limited liquidity while the global poverty is more than the marketcap of Bitcoin. Even the government with unlimited supply fiat failed to address poverty.Bitcoin investment might help to get you some profit but it’s not sufficient to defeat poverty especially if you are only investing small amount of money on it. This is possible when we are on the initial phase of Bitcoin which the price is near a dollar each since the growth is exponential but right now the price is discovered and having even x10 gain is very hard to accomplish on the current price.Investing on Bitcoin is not bad if you are poor but don’t rely on it solely to getaway from poverty since you will need steady source of income to maintain consistent investment and purchasing your necessities.",

But been a poverty alleviation scheme I don’t see it been that, although many of its traders or investors have the advantage of getting profits because it generates ROI but that also comes with the risk of losing. Losing can only be avoided when you hodl for long but do an average or poor individual has that ability to turn an eye away? I doubt. A poverty alleviation scheme is something that employs people or give loans to people to start a business. Bitcoin is not that, although there are tech savvy people that could work and get paid by bitcoin but will that solve much of the problem No?. Bitcoin mining is only area where you can actually work and earn as business but even that requires funds and knowledge to set up",

Second, not all who hold bitcoin become successful, some experience the worst. And it takes time before to make profit, not because you did profit last month, it doesn't mean it will be the same in the new few weeks. Lastly, only those knowledgeable did make a progress and success. I doubt farmers just like you mentioned can grasps these kind of knowledge and it always takes time, I'm not saying they can't learn, but most who experience poverty priorities to find job instead of going to school, it is the same thought about it if you will think about it.",

People think that Bitcoin investment is only for the Rich because of its price, and most of them think they have to buy 1 BTC. Also, $10 a week isn't little, cause you're talking about poverty and not the state of being broke. In poverty, people barely see food to eat, they most definitely don't eat 3 times daily and sideline their wants.

Same goes for many people across the globe. Investments in bitcoin are intended for all segments of the population, regardless of their level of financial well-being. Invest at least $10, at least $1000, the profitability in both cases will be the same (I mean the multiple of the profit received).Bitcoin will not make poor people who invest $10 a week rich, but it will prevent them from slipping into deeper poverty. Although this sounds overly reassuring, in any case it is better than storing this money in cash.Quote from: adultcrypto on November 01, 2023, 04:12:00 PMBitcoin offers unique opportunities for people who want to make decent amount of money and I have the feeling that if these people start investing in Bitcoin, we will see a rapid decline in global poverty.  What do you think?Bitcoin offers a unique opportunity not only to speculators, but to all people in general and not only for making money. I think you are very wrong and bitcoin will not change the rapid decline in poverty. Yesterday  celebrated the 15th anniversary of the publication of the Bitcoin white paper, you can look at the corresponding topic, and so, in this white paper there is not a word that the bitcoin can or should solve problems related to poverty. It is just a unique form of electronic money used as an investment tool, not a magic wand to cure poverty.",

Your point of view is clear, but your assumptions appear to be ridiculous when we consider the many elements that surround it. For example, if all bitcoin have already been mined and the complete number of individuals in the globe living in poverty invest an equivalent amount of money in bitcoin, determine if it will lift all of those people out of poverty. Bitcoin can assist, but not as much as you might think in terms of lifting people out of poverty. To eliminate and limit the increase in poverty, all hands must be on deck.",

That's not the primary aim by which Bitcoin was created, because Bitcoin have longed time fulfilled its primary purpose and still fulfilling it by putting us in charge of our funds instead of the central banks, nor governments, and as such you shouldn't expect Bitcoin to eradicate poverty by people who barely knows how it works, nor have a clue how it operate as a digital currency.

I said it because if all of the people will adopt BTC and start to think that they can eliminate global poverty, then it is a dumb idea because I don't think that poverty at the global level can be eliminated even if you use BTC or any other approach.And investing $10 or $5 a week in BTC might look small, but it gives one hope—a hope to earn more and make some difference. I am poor, but not anymore since I got into BTC. If one invests $10 a week in BTC, he will make $20 sometime, double that amount, and so on.BTC provides a way for the poor to get out of poverty, but not for all, and not everyone can benefit from it, and that's the nature of life.
