If you also add the suffix \"ist\" To Bitcoin, you will get another cool sounds but I can't see the word on dictionary. My question is, between Bitcoin-er and Bitcoin-ist, which one sound better? Another question is, what can we call the study of Bitcoin?",

To be frank on this, bitcoinist sounds more being professional but you will only discover that people are using bitcoiner as the word with prefix in identifying someone who invest in bitcoin, but either of the two are good to hear and pronounce, just that many were already used to the word bitcoiner.Quote from: Mrbluntzy on May 18, 2024, 01:11:25 PMAnother question is, what can we call the study of Bitcoin?  I don't know if there is a grammatical word for the study of cryptocurrency like cryptopreneur and if at all any of these also exist for the study of bitcoin, you can imagine now that bitcoin only come to existence in 2009 and till now, i never get close to any other word used in its study, maybe we can have a clue from those in El-Salvador.",

In my opinion, bitcoiner, and that is because most of the community use bitcoiner and not bitcoinist, i don't think i have seen someone use the latter. However, bitcoinist may also be correct as the suffix -ist is added to words in order to form a noun, so it could be added to the word bitcoin, to form the noun bitcoinist, which would mean somone who uses bitcoin.Quote from: Mrbluntzy on May 18, 2024, 01:11:25 PMAnother question is, what can we call the study of Bitcoin?  I don't think there is a specific word that denotes this, but bitcoiner also sounds correct here, no?",

It's just a way of calling and whether we need to distinguish which is the most suitable, like you talk about the left eye and the right eye to see which eye is more beautiful, in terms of distinguishing from people. Likes to complicate matters that are actually simple. And I would like to suggest that you feel free to use whatever you think is appropriate, for me \"er\" or \"ist\" is not so important.",

Even though I feel like there should be a different word for this because it doesn't sound like the best.Bitcoinist sounds completely off, it almost makes it sound like the person is running Bitcoin or has control over it, or teaches Bitcoin, etc., but it doesn't sound like it can be used to call a person who either uses or makes investments in Bitcoin.So, conclusively, I would rather go with Bitcoiner than Bitcoinist because the first word sounds much better for this instance.",

It sounds not right to you because you have not been using it and your brain have only gotten used to one word which is Bitcoiner. Those other two names you mentioned are cool and doesn't sound strange. If you add the suffix \"preneur\" to a nouns, whether the word is in the dictionary or not, it will still make sense and add a different meaning to the nouns word and make it cool and easy to understand the topic of discussion. For example, bluntzy-preneur will make you think that I have the mindset or spirit of an entrepreneur.",

It is only the professionals in English language that will be able to tell the correct one to use but basically, I do not care about English language because I did not study it and so I believe that English language is for effective communication, and communication is complete when the person you are speaking to understands you. If I use English language wrongly and the person, I am speaking to is still able to understand me, I have still communicated. Bitcoiner or bitcoinist does not really matter which is the proper language for use, if it is too confusing, you can simply say Bitcoin enthusiast.",
