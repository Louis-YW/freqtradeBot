  "content": "Today I decided to take a walk down the road side. Normally I don't take anything with me as I walk but today I decided to go out with my mobile phone. While taking a walk I admired the environment and surroundings as beautifully made and was full of joy and happiness. On getting to the other end of the Street, I noticed some group of boys ( assumed to be in early teens age) walking pleading for help. So I stopped and called one of them inquiring to know what the matter was and he said that the others were his brothers and that they have not eaten anything yet today. I felt bad and I wondered what must have happened. Well I never bother asking them any question further because from the looks, things weren't alright with their parents. I had no money on me to give them neither do I have any money on me to buy food for them there and then. I had to invite them with me to a friend  whom owns a supermarket at the other end of the Street. I introduced him into Crypto a longtime ago. We had to walk a little distant as well. When we got to his supermarket, I bought some snacks and drinks for them and they were all happy. They thanked me for coming to their rescue in time and I was wondering if I had not taken a walk what would have happened to them maybe God wanted me to rescue them that was why I went out and with my phone. After they had gone, I turned to my friend and explained him how it all happened I pleaded with him to accept Crypto in payment and he accepted for the kind gesture I showed to the kids. There and then I paid the bill in Crypto with my phone.I was happy  to have rescued those innocent kids wondering about for help. Internally I had joy that filled me all through and secondly I was able to do that through Crypto payment.",

Especially during tough times, even the market is bloody. There's no reason to stop learning about cryptocurrency, there's also no reason to share the good news in cryptocurrency like sharing your knowledge with other people.To OP, I hope you also shared something good like the real use of cryptocurrency, not only the investment or money opportunity.",

I do not deny its importance in this case, but the issue you are raising is also great when you share your concern with those in need. As economic times become increasingly difficult, there will be more people becoming deprived of food and other necessities of life, and kindness is always appreciated. But anyway, next time I think you should carry a bit of cash with you so that everything is easily solved. The problem of accepting payments with crypto is not too common, so it is not too tight with the things you want that no one else has access to.",

I don't think that's necessary to delve into the world of Bitcoin to his friend or the boys, what they could think of the moment was just they can eat for a day or the supermarket friend was just thinking what he could profit for a day. The best thing that has been done there was that crypto was used and it's on them if they asked the OP out of curiosity or not.",

I must confess, I grew cold towards this over the years haven't met several pan handlers and the many children they deploy at several round abouts in my city. It turned to be an everyday culture for them and some way of making earns means and I don't very much support the idea. In recent times, I started seeing them with penny packs or purse and I wonder whats going on?Like, they completely give up on starting any form of minor trading and feel a lot comfortable prying on the masses compassion and feeding off them! The parents or guardians seats at a corner watching the kids they deploy along the road to interact with strangers in a bid to seek for aids and when you aid them in terms of money, they just collect, show appreciation and the next thing, they run down to their parent or guardian and hand it over. At times, should you choose to get them food, they would refuse and want money instead!I don't adorn the practice and I don't think buying them food or handing them money everyday would be the best way to help these people!Funny enough, these poor families seems to birth more children than an average rich man. I guess its out of spending more time with there partners as they've always got a lot of energy reserves, lol!",

Every month I see young people clashing over garbage containers, children going door to door looking for food, public appeals from parents seeking help for their sick children who have to receive expensive drugs or be treated abroad - and all this in a country that has been a proud member of the EU for almost 10 years.A survey conducted in my country a few years ago on children attending primary school showed that as many as 30 000 children come to school without their parents being able to provide them with anything for breakfast. A law that would allow them to get at least one hot meal at school was rejected in the national parliament and would cost only 200 000 EUR a year...",

I see this every day when I talk to my friends. Most of them have taken bank loans and now everything they earn each month goes to pay the bills and to cover the loan. They have no savings, no investments. In case something random happens like they get fired or have a child they'll be forced to start selling things they own. Good job OP. You managed to help people in need and popularize bitcoin at the same time (at least I hope it was bitcoin because you said crypto).Quote from: Lucius on June 25, 2022, 09:40:55 AMA law that would allow them to get at least one hot meal at school was rejected in the national parliament and would cost only 200 000 EUR a year...These people probably earn at least 50k a year themselves and vote against feeding children?

The problem is that they only see how much more money they would make, but not how much more the average cost of living also will be. So many people actually change their live to the worse by moving somewhere, wehre they don't own anything and have to start from new.",
