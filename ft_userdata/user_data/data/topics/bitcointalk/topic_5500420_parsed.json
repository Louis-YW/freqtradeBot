  "content": "If you are wondering why a thread supposedly about quantum blockchains created by a forum newbie using the name Orleans19 was locked and his OP deleted, I think it was down to him realising he was going to be asked tough questions and if there were any nefarious intentions they would have been exposed very fast.This is the thread in question: QuantumLink and the QuantumChain Quote from: Orleans19 on June 18, 2024, 06:51:08 PMHello everyone,My curiosity and passion for technological innovation have brought me to this platform. Over the last few months, I have been deeply researching blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. This journey has led me to develop a practical and groundbreaking concept that forms the foundation of a new technology—QuantumChain and QuantumLink. This is blockchain reimagined, a complete revolution in decentralized technology.I am here to learn from the insightful posts of Satoshi and others, as I work on my highly decentralized system. QuantumChain and QuantumLink are designed to create a massive shift, providing a parallel system that enhances security, speed, and scalability beyond current blockchain capabilities. I believe this technology has the potential to reshape the digital landscape and bring about unprecedented advancements.I look forward to engaging with this community and gaining valuable insights as I continue to develop this revolutionary technology.I asked him to elaborate what his supposed genius plan was but he declined to share further details. The question arises why was he posting about something but not elaborating. He did send a PM of his own volition therefore I can share it:------------------------------QuantumChain is a cutting-edge, decentralized blockchain technology inspired by the black opal, offering unprecedented speed, security, and scalability. It seamlessly integrates blockchain, DAG, AI, quantum computing, and IoT, creating a hybrid system optimized for future advancements.Key Features:   •   Speed: QuantumChain can handle over 1 million TPS, outperforming Bitcoin (7 TPS) and Ethereum (30 TPS).   •   Security: Quantum-safe algorithms and advanced cryptographic methods ensure superior protection.   •   Scalability: Efficient consensus mechanisms and sharding allow limitless growth.   •   Decentralization: Eliminates central points, ensuring robustness and autonomy.   •   Ecosystem: Incorporates decentralized cloud, finance, smart contracts, and more.Advantages Over Bitcoin and Ethereum:   •   Faster Transactions: QuantumChain’s speed is exponentially higher.   •   Enhanced Security: Quantum-safe features outpace existing cryptographic methods.   •   Greater Scalability: No bottlenecks, unlike Bitcoin’s block limits and Ethereum’s gas issues.QuantumLink is the cryptocurrency built on QuantumChain, designed to be versatile and future-proof, supporting diverse applications from finance to healthcare and beyond.------------------------------In my opinion the now locked thread was the first step in what were going to be several steps in trying to scam gullible members under the guise of seeking funds. This is not a project, it is a figment of imagination from someone that has a wild imagination therefore if the member returns I would advise you to engage with him using caution.Orleans19 locked his post and tried to erase his claims about his quantum blockchain but this thread contains his claim and will remain open. Maybe he will take the opportunity an unlocked thread provides and will post here.",
