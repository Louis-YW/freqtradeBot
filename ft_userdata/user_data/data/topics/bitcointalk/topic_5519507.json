It was reported that this so called new department is task to \"dismantle government bureaucracy\". Nowhere to be found the word \"crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" on it.",

But you don't forget it is currently bull run, maybe positive side for Bitcoin. If the election had not come this season, would the price of Bitcoin not have increased?  If you have observed the bull run season in the past then definitely Bitcoin History 2010 till now you will know all the events and Bitcoin price rise.  (So now you believe that the price of Bitcoin has increased because of Donald Trump as proven above). If the price of Bitcoin is moving at its own pace then the true reflection is my belief that the price of Bitcoin will increase even more in the future.",

Your transactions are always public on Bitcoin Public Ledger, and you can practice carefully with your inputs, outputs, use Tor to secure your privacy and somewhat anonymity. Criminals will have more fear of more and tighter regulations and monitoring activities on their transactions that are used for something like money laundering.",

Most people even forgot that we were in a bull market because of how much chop and huge red days we had along the way. In as much as i will say that I will agree that the win was actually an added catalyst which pumped the price I will say that the market was definitely on his way up. Bitcoin market was predicted to actually pump within this last quarter of the year and it was positioned for that when late October it broke that $70k price barrier and was actually going to break the then all time high ($74k) but was in a ranging movement which is the thing a price does before breaking any major resistance. The question is without the win will the market have still broken the mark, I say yes because regardless of anything bitcoin market always pumps in the last quarter of the halving year, but the election win added the hype to the win and made the win impulsive as we have today",

I don't expect anything else from Mr.Donald and Mr.Mars, except to maybe shill one of their projects (shitcoin) here and there.",

But we need to know that he is not yet officially president and we still have no guarantee that he will keep his promises regarding cryptocurrencies. Therefore, we should not be too subjective or expect too much from a politician if we do not want to be too disappointed. There is no denying that his victory has had a positive impact on the markets but that is because the markets are putting their faith in him and still believe that he will treat us well. The recent market rally does not guarantee that he will keep his crypto-friendly promises.",

Add more cameras and advanced algorithms, and the U.S. could monitor everything effectively. With Elon involved, oversight and implementation could become smoother and more effective.As for Bitcoin, I wouldn’t expect Elon Musk to make any positive moves. He’s known for shilling meme coins, especially DOGE, so he’d likely just hype that even more. What I’m more curious about is Trump’s policy on Bitcoin.
