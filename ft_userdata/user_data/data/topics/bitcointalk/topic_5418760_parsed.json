Generally I learnt that mistakes go viral online.

But now things are different. Bitcoin is slowly becoming mainstream and will make its mark on history as one of the most important inventions in modern times. It's also one of the most secure forms of payment available today, which makes it a great choice for those looking to protect their assets. The world is changing, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this change, but Bitcoin's success is definitely due to its users. It's up to you whether you want to be a part of this change or not.",

The major reason why Bitcoin survive is because of its decentralization, consensus, block halving, and no censorship.These are what I believe make the trust and confidence of crypto enthusiasts in Bitcoin stand strong and once crypto gains the trust of crypto enthusiasts it is easy for the coin to survive.",

I guess that is the first thing that you will get, financial freedom, meaning because of your investment on bitcoin, you will have a good cash flow and you can do whatever you want, buy things for your and for your family. So it's going to be a good experience for you down the line, invest and hold and then wait for the next bull run to enjoy your profit.",

In a way, I'm proud to say that the reason why I bought my first Bitcoin is not anymore the same reason why I HODL them until today. That, for me, is good growth enough as far as understanding Bitcoin is concerned. That somehow signifies that my way of looking at Bitcoin has somehow matured so to speak.I guess the way to thank Bitcoin is to spread its awareness. But I have to admit that I'm not anymore as aggressive in talking about it as before. This is basically for security reasons and to avoid being wrongly judged. But I'm always more than willing to converse about it with somebody who is truly curious about it. I have very limited knowledge, though, so an exchange is certainly better than a lecture of some sort.",

I learned that people will not believe you if you don't have enough proof of good results engaging in Bitcoin.  Just like @Darker45, I was very excited to share Bitcoin when I first stumbled on it.  Most of the people I shared with just laugh at me and questioned the integrity of Bitcoin.  That was 7 years ago.  Only a few listened.  I learned that sharing things and knowledge about stuff is good but we should check whether the person is interested enough in the things we are sharing.Quote from: The Archive on October 29, 2022, 06:43:52 PMWhat is your reason behind Bitcoin's survival to this day and how do you thank Bitcoin.

With the development of technology, the emergence of the bitcoin phenomenon was only a matter of time, and the further development goes, the more likely it is that something like this will appear in the future, when home quantum computers appear and development tools become available, I think the time will come for something like superpositioncoin.",

Finally, making something is very easy but maintaining it is very difficult.I joined this forum last 2017 and my experience is nothing but exceptional- I became a part of this revolutionary innovation where it gave me the opportunity to invest for my future.The beauty behind cryptocurrency is its convenience compared to some of the traditional methods of investment. The fact that you can purchase BTC and HODL them makes you an ipso facto investor. The fact that you can also attract people into this seemingly complex, yet relatively easy platform should be the main trend that is happening. While the reputation of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are divided, the fact remains that this would change my future in the event my investments mature.",

They never thought it would get would get foothold in the world of finance but like we have it now, it stood and there's hardly anything that could be done to stop it.Some of the greatest strength to bitcoin is how free it is and the privacy it gives its holders. Not mention, its the only truly decentralized cryptocurrency that is. Bitcoin has been ale to use the funds about it for its publicity and the more anti-cryptos and government tries to drag it to the mould, the more curious it makes people and when they find out what it truly is and the opportunities that exists there in, it calls for a freewill investment and an escape from centralized system.Satoshi Nakamoto made a first good step by not being the center of it all but lving it to freewill and the activities of evey holder to decide its future.
