I was given a promo code to use for a site I'm lookin at called Blogxp.com, and I am having some trouble figuring out how to be able to transfer the funds to my actual bank account. Any help would be niceIt's a scam, mate... A stranger gives you a promo code and a link to the site he built. Once you enter the promo code, you will actually see some funds in your account, but the funds are not real and then when you try to withdraw, they will ask you to send Bitcoins in order to activate or verify your account, or sometimes they tell you that the bitcoin you are sending is a tax you are supposed to pay. Once you send those Bitcoins. That's how you get scammed. You will never receive anything.Quote from: Potato Chips on December 05, 2023, 10:27:17 PMCould tell us how did you stumble upon this website?Probably the same guy who gave him the promo code.",

      "body": "The domain, which the OP posted, might really be wrong – either spelling mistake or something else, but I think we understand, where the OP is heading. Someone online might have directed the OP to create an account on a broker site and hand him a promo code, which, when entered in the provided space in the OP's account, a specific amount will be funded in the account. The OP might be looking for means to withdrawal that audio money from his wallet or personal bank account.  Und if what I'm sensing is correct, then this is a total scam and the OPs need to be careful, as they will requires him to make some deposit in another for him to be allowed to withdrawal the awarded to him as promo, which we all know, how such ends. So, if you are to come back to this thread and you know someone gave you the code and requests you make payment before you can withdrawal, please disengage from it, as you will end up losing money. There is no free money on the Internet.",
