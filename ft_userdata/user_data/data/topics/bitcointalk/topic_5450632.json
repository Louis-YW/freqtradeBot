The fee for a transaction will be increased significantly.It does but the biggest problem is not about their size (although that is a big problem itself). The biggest problem is that the Ordinals Attack is creating an incentive to spam the blockchain by creating a possible parallel market where people scam each other by selling these transactions containing arbitrary data.If the said market grows, the resulting spam could quickly fill the blocks with transactions that could even pay very high fees. Fees that are higher than what a normal user is willing to pay.",

Bitcoin on-chain transactions had a record high today. I don't know if that's because of Bitcoin Ordinal. Suddenly, there are a lot of people talking about this everywhere. I'm managing a Facebook group and in the last few days, a lot of people are looking for information on this and they seem very much interested to check it out.",

This is crazy!That is not crazy, that is a lie. There is no correlations between the amount field of the output in a transaction and the data that is being injected into the witness script of the inputs of that transaction.It may be crazy but it is not a lie.Someone came up with an method of enumerating satoshis as well as a convention for maintaining the enumeration even while the satoshis are used in transactions. As a result, it is possible to give every satoshi an ID and to track it from transaction to transaction. Note that Ordinals is not the only way to do this, and it only works for those people using the Ordinals protocol.Now, the lie that @pooya87 is describing (beyond the basic lie about NFTs indicating anything more than an association) is the fact that if you don't agree to and adhere to the Ordinals protocol, then it means nothing. And there is nothing preventing me from creating my own enumeration protocol that associates an inscription of my choice with a satoshi that I own.My own opinion is that Ordinals is very clever and I applaud the creator, Casey Rodarmor. However, whether or not it becomes useful remains to be seen. I predict that future node software will allow pruning of inscription data as an option in order to reduce the size of the blockchain if inscriptions remain popular.",

Perhaps a soft-fork will be needed to tighten the protocol rules so that such activities will be rendered impossible.",

Ordinal NFTs are one of use cases and like it or not, it is your personal choice but other people have their freedom to like it. Like people are freely to use Bitcoin for many use cases and as people who support freedom, we don't like censorship.Hence censor or restrict Bitcoin transactions for Ordinal NFTs or future new use cases, will break the initial purpose of Bitcoin.I believe the best solution is to increase the block limit. The Bitcoin community did it in 2017 and can do it in future.Ordinal NFTs can bring more new people to Bitcoin network like some of them can come from Ethereum network and I see it is a good thing.",

I predict that future node software will allow pruning of inscription data as an option in order to reduce the size of the blockchain if inscriptions remain popular.This is 100% the most reasonable option to go after.Then we'll only have the problem with how to deal with Ordinals congestion in the mempool. Increasing the block size has been ruled out long ago, so maybe another kind of Merkle tree hashing could be invented where N blocks have a hash that is one of N separate pieces of a larger \"group hash\" which can be decomposed into such pieces using some bitwise operations and cryptography.This would allow multiple 1MB blocks to be mined simultaneously and included in the blockchain, in batches (most likely a factor of 2016, so 2x, 4x ... up to 32x), instead of solo.",

Despite of recent rise, fee on Bitcoin blockchain is still cheaper than on ERC-20 chain.https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-eth.html#3mWe, as Bitcoiners on this blockchain, care about it but they don't care about that and still enjoy discount transaction fee on Bitcoin blockchain.",
