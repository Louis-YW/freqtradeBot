  "content": "After about 3 months, I am here again. After reading your replays and your support, I got a lot of motivation! But this is not the whole story.You can find Teaching Bitcoin To My Friends (Part 1) here. (The whole story started here)When I started my weekly meeting, after a while, I noticed that some of my friends can't come to my house. I live in a rainy city; sometimes, the rains continue for months, and my friends cannot come to my house on rainy days.So I decided to start online classes. Every Friday, we have a friendly meeting for 2 hours, and we talk about Bitcoin and all the important events that affect the market.If you also want to join this group, I can create a discord server where we can talk and have a friendly meeting every week. I'll read your replays, and if you want to join this group, I'll create a discord server and update this post in the next few days. Cheers",

Everyday two hours of discussion about bitcoin and surrounding incidents will give clear picture about the market. Through the participants it will widespread. Good initiative which could turn OP a good trainer on cryptocurrency.Everyone won't be spend two hours regularly in teaching others. As an user mentioned, in between checking the progress of the participants could help you understand how well you've taught and what changes need to be done to make it more effective.",

If you teach 10, they will know 10, and so on.You have decided that it will be a matter of time, so now you do not talk about the borders of your rainy city, you can record the discussions for us to evaluate them.",

Nothing will ever hinder the learning of bitcoin or the circulation of bitcoin knowledge in the  world sine there will always be an alternative way to teach or give the awareness to people.I hope you are been open to them about the volatile nature of bitcoin and how they can keep their bitcoin holdings safe in a noncustodial wallet because I see that they might want to invest, if it is OK with them. Bitcoin will rule over fiat soon due to the adoption of people even without the government adopting bitcoin as a legal tender. The forum is the best place anyone can get the best knowledge of bitcoin from especially its technical aspect so I will suggest that you can invite more people from your working place or your neighborhood to join the discord channel so that they can also learn from your weekly class",

You might as well invite your friends here in this forum so that they will have more references in learning cryptocurrency. Kudos OP!",

That’s just to have more sense of how your Standard Operating Procedure is going to be. Many times handling big crowd could be challenging. So start small, keep gathering community, keep talking about it over and over again. This should be two process where after some days or weeks your listeners must start asking Back challenging questions about everything you taught. That would be kick start in to know you are on right path. It’s always great to see someone taking efforts to educate others about bitcoin. Keep growing mate",

OP you are doing a good job by taking this step in making sure your friends are not left behind in Bitcoin awareness. This you have done can not be forgotten by your friends. Believe me you, your friends would thank you in time to come for the kindness you did to them by showing and teaching them about Bitcoin. I myself I personally took it upon myself to making sure my locality get to know about Bitcoin. Not just locality, I decided to teach skilled and unskilled labour, small business owners, freelancers etc in my locality. I did this by putting up a scheme for them so they could easily understand the system. You can see it here   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422241.msg61318488#msg61318488  With it, I was able to guide them through with them understanding and having knowledge about Bitcoin and blockchain entirely. With these steps put in place by you, I think you'll achieve your goals in onboarding more people into the system. This would help in scaling up the percentage in Bitcoin Adoption and Promotion in the world.",

That's the part I like because it's easier for both the teacher and student(s). If they complain of data, send them data. However, let me quickly add here for OP. Don't be discouraged if after teaching them you discover that not all of them will continue with it. There will be those among them who will have the wrong notion of how Bitcoin should take them out of poverty level immediately they come in contact with it. Once you let them into the truth that it's not a get rich quick scheme, some will develop that lukewarm attitude and will eventually lose interest. Just know this and know peace.",

Checking progress would make it faster ofcourse and with proper guidance as well. Actually, sharing is fun not only in this industry but also to other things as long as it would give additional knowledge to other people. I hope you'd tackle misconceptions of this technology or industry in general such as easy way to be rich. This also includes risks involved from engaging in cryptocurrencies in line with its nature of market volatility. These things I think, are the best prior knowledge if you are trying to impart yours, before engaging with advantages of this blockchain.",
