As far as I'm concerned, merit sources, gives merits to quality posting and most of the senior members on this forum show more of such post than lower ranked member. QuoteJust like the one you made now If you had time to read some post made by junior members then You would see how good they are and why they should be awarded merits. I suggest you start learning and stop complaining about the merit system mate.",

      "body": "I don't see what the problem is with the OP using an alt account to say this. Alts are explicitly allowed on this forum and originally the idea was that you could use them to say controversial things that you don't want to say with your main account, so I think it's fine for the OP to create an alt.I don't agree with what he says though. The merit system is not perfect but it is very good and it improved the forum a lot compared to the ranking system when I registered in summer 2017. With it, if you are a good poster you will get merits, and if you don't get merits then your contribution to the forum is not good enough.Quote from: Meritsourceareshit on July 25, 2023, 12:54:30 AMMerit distribution isn't really that fair and I'm assuming that they are building their own sockpuppets to solo out and milk out signature campaigns that requires accounts that have lots of merit counts.Your assumption is incorrect, and I don't deny that there may be some isolated cases, but as things stand, it is better for them to concentrate on a single account that will end up paying them a lot, in some cases with custom deals, than to have several, because the time they have is limited and the quality inevitably suffers if you have several accounts. Look at the requirements to enter the Green Zone of the campaigns managed by Royse777 for example.Quote from: Royse777 on January 11, 2023, 07:22:22 AMWHAT IS GREEN ZONE?QuoteAs a campaign manager, my job is to provide the BEST VALUE of the money a project spend on Bitcointalk marketing. Besides, it became obvious that even though the forum rank of two or more members are the same but their overall performance regarding post quality, number of posts they made so far, merit vs post ratio, merit vs activity ratio, acceptability of their opinions in discussions, DT status, accuracy in the feedback leaving habit, correct practice of trust setting, forum socializing skills, knowledge about bitcoin and any subject in topics they engage, influence over others or ability to organize groups and lead a gang (LOL), individual acceptance in their own gang members (LOLx) - all are different. There are many more parameters we consider to pay a campaigner that bring the BEST VALUE from him/her. So, it's not just about merits, it's much more than that.",

The merits are often given to those users who make well informative posts, and they posts somehow reflect their helpful nature, and if a user doesn't gets a merit then that means the user isn't trying to help others but is only after grabbing merits, and we call such users as \"merit fishers,\" because they try their best to get merits even though they do not deserve to get any of merit because of their poor positing habits.And, when it comes to new accounts getting merits then you must have to look their post history because a useful post from a newbie is more appreciated by our merit sources because they want such newbies to rank faster. They only give merits to those newbies because they know that such users can be helpful for the forum, and they can produce more constructive and reading worthy posts after they are appreciated with merits.Instead of blaming our merits sources you should better try to make good and helpful posts, and I'm quite sure that you'll see that merits will flow toward your good posts like to the ones that you have seen on this forum.",

Merit distribution isn't really that fair and I'm assuming that they are building their own sockpuppets to solo out and milk out signature campaigns that requires accounts that have lots of merit counts.Merit sources are chosen after an application where they have to meet some criteria.Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PM1. Be a somewhat established member.2. Collect TEN posts written in the last couple of months by other people that have not received nearly enough merit for how good they are, and post quotes for them all in a new Meta thread. The point of this is to demonstrate your ability to give out merit usefully.3. We will take a look at your history and maybe make you a source.The application is not a formality and I know plenty of good forum contributors which applied for this position without receiving it. So those which are merit sources have to do a really good job in order to be elected.Furthermore, merit spending is not moderated. Each user may send his merits to whoever he wants and in whatever amount he wants (being limited by the 50 merits / month to a unique user limit and by the limit of the amount of his sMerits). So far I only witnessed one case where a merit source was accused of abusing his powers and that user was demoted from merit source position. So actions are taken in case of abuses.OP, if you can point the finger to someone directly, do it so and bring proof for your statement.Other than that, since it was only one case of a merit source demoted for abusing his power, I am certain that merit sources are doing their job just fine. (There were other cases of demoted merit sources, but not for abuses. This happened when the user became inactive or did not use the sMerits received for being a merit source.)",

Oh gosh! That shows how fearful you are for not posting with your main account. Those who stand for the truth don't disguise speaking out. This issue of merits circulation among high-ranking members has been addressed before (can't find the thread now) with many convincing reasons that are very obvious but only if you pay attention and observe. The merit sources are carefully selected having met up some requirements specify to qualify one to be a merit source. If you observe, you will notice that these high-rank members offer reasonable and informative contributions to conversations, and with this, they are likely to receive more merits.Talking about the milking signature campaign is absolutely off point driven by jealousy. Some of these high rank members failed to reach the weekly post quota which is a prove that they're not chasing the money while some are not in the campaign but post beyond the weekly post quota required in a signature campaign. The majority of the signature campaign is more interested in gambling posts which majority of posts there are not merit-worthy but you will see these high ranks moving from one board to another offering the best idea that they can. Let's be fair enough and stop criticizing them. They deserve the merit they're earning.Do away with this mindset and start improving your post and see merits flooding your profile. Take a look at this profile https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3486361 and tell me what you see. Within one year and a month with over 2k merits, What does that tell you? You can be like that also if you can do better other than criticism. I challenge you to bring out a post from your main account that's merit worthy but not merited and I will contribute my quota to show you that there's no bias in merit sharing. We also have numerous thread reviewing posts that are merit worthy but you pretend not to see those threads because you don't have any. Cmon mate!",

However, I am not sure if that is the complete list of all merit sources.In any case, since OP created a new account only for opening this thread as his very first post on the forum (at least under the new account), perhaps he can also come up with some names or substantial evidence. Unless he created the thread only for some more drama.",

Given that you can keep track of all regularly merited accounts that may be with your version of alternative accounts, their posts should also be of appropriate quality. Have you thought about it?Giving an unfounded accusation without evidence from a new account is an indicator of cowardice and self-doubt.Shame on you, OP!",
