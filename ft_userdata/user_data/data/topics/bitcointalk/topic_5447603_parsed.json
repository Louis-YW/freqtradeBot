  "content": "We need to be very careful when it comes to cryptocurrencies because there are a lot of scammers out there looking for ways to defraud us, and the majority of them always target newcomers because they think they are very simple to persuade and because they are unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency space, they don't really have much experience about security which makes it easy for scammers to easily brainwash them. That is why I put together the list because I think it will be helpful for the majority of newcomers just joining the forum.1, Phishing scams; we all have to be careful because this is a common cryptocurrency scam but newbies are the ones that mostly fall for this kind of scam. Scammers always look for ways to get personal information, they do end up sending emails to people or sending personal messages to people which contain a harmful links. So make sure you don’t trust anyone on social media, don’t click on any link you receive through email or any social media account, be careful with the websites you are visiting and always try your possible best not to connect your wallet address to anyhow website.2, Giveaway Scams; most newbies believe cryptocurrency space is where they can easily make free money, but I will tell you there is no free money in crypto, any money you are making you have to work for it. You might receive a random message telling you they are running a giveaway, any amount you send to them, they multiply for you in a few minutes or hours. Don’t be surprised if you receive this kind of message from an influential person on social media, the user’s account might have been compromised. No one will offer to double your money for you in the crypto space, so we all have to be very careful. 3, Fake Crypto Exchanges; we are having multiple crypto exchanges currently but some of them are fake when making use of crypto exchange, make sure you are using a reputable exchange, most of this those crypto exchanges are always offering  Bonuses just to attract customers, immediately you make a deposit to the exchange, the coin you send might not reflect or whenever you want to make a withdrawal, you might not be able to withdraw. So when using crypto exchange, make sure you go for reputable crypto exchange and avoid unrecognized exchanges even if they are offering attractive bonuses.4, Fake Apps; lots of people have lost their crypto assets just because they downloaded fake crypto apps, we have seen lots of fake crypto apps that have been reported on the forum. If you are downloading any crypto app, make sure you get the link to the app from the official website don’t trust most of the applications you see on the Google play store. So make sure you confirm if you are downloading the right application whenever you want to download any application.5, Fake crypto website; lots of people fall for this scam, most people don’t really take note of the website they are visiting, we have to be careful when visiting any website, scammers are always creating fake crypto websites similar to the original website, which if you don’t know you will think it’s the real website that you want to visit, the similarity is always much but there is always little difference in the domain name, they always make sure the website is very real.",

      "body": "All your tips explain phishing in one way or another, simply because it is an attempt to use a service that claims to be a reliable service, or at least there is an unreliable service that wants to attract followers by offering offers that are too good to be true.But the fraud is much greater than that. You may find a real service that works for several years, and yet it deceives you.So preparing static lists will not solve the problem, but: - Be skeptical. - Do not trust any service. - Always ask and do not be shy to ask the question, no matter how stupid. - Finally, do not think that you know everything, because it is the scammers' way of finding victims.",

      "body": "All those that you mentioned are scams based on fake versions: fake links and emails and sites, fake giveaways, fake exchanges, fake apps. Indeed, they are relatively easy to avoid. One may be easier to avoid than the others, though, as in a fake Binance site is easier to determine than a fake Binance email which may even carry the words official or staff or team or whatever. But the scams that are harder to avoid are those that aren't fake. FTX wasn't fake. BlockFi wasn't fake. The same is true with Celsius and Three Arrows Capital and others. They were all duly registered and licensed. They were all legal business entities. They all had highly paid teams and sleek headquarters and whatnot. But they're all scams!",

Cryptocurrency industry, only Bitcoin was created for the purpose of being a P2P payment method, Satoshi never intended to make it an investment or a commodity. The rest are all created to sell tokens and make a profit, so at some point, they will collapse for no reason.Investing in altcoins means taking a gamble, so we should stop before it's too late. A scam cannot appear on its own but is created by human greed, if we are not greedy, no one can deceive us.",

Since all new crypto investors need to begin their journey front the start, they will make so many mistakes along the way, it is inevitable.",

People learn better from their mistakes.Sincerely scammers are getting strong in their schemes but the obvious thing to do when a link is sent is for to go through the site and see maybe there a little changes on the domain name, https could be used as http by the scammers, also a phishing site will ask ridiculous questions like your personal information and once such pops up then one needs to be careful of going further. As for application even google play added goggle play protect and scammers still find their way to get fake apps into the goggle store but one could use some common tips to minimize downloading them. Firstly is to check the logo/avatar of the app once they are duplicated or many then one is the only genuine one. The next step is to go through the number of downloads and reviews although this also can be manipulated. One also can check the app developer to check which of these apps is actually the right one. Things like checking through the app grammatical errors could also help in dictating a fake app",

They are fooled by the value of the token they want to exchange, so they ignore the security of their wallet. And without them realizing it when they exchanged the token they had directly given access to their wallet to the hacker. Therefore, for newbies, you should not exchange the tokens that you get carelessly, make sure that the source of the tokens is trusted and always be vigilant.",

I know a guy who is in crypto profesionally for 7+ years, yet he managed to lose $100k by connecting Metamask to some scammy website just because he wanted to do something quick before going out. Even better example is the well known Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr who recently got hacked and lost 200+ BTC and guy knows more about security than 99.99% of us here.",

Exactly Google play overs convenience than searching for a particular app. Although it is easier for members of this forum to get link to the website but for outsiders searching randomly from google will still lead them to fake developers. Before it was social media verification that actually helped to access This links easily but the current trend of gathering fake followers or easily paying for verification has made it easy for scammers to create a large community for project on social media too. The other way could be requesting from a trusted person that is knowledgeable on the field or better going through the google play store but like you said calmly.",
