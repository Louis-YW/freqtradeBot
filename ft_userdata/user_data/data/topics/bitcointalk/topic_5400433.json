Nothing wrong in anyone on those assumptions, except if the user does not actually try to read and understand how the forum works and how it's different from regular social platforms.If in a couple of months OP applies for change of display name to the admin, they have my support.Or they could just never log in again, like many newbies who have popped up.",

You cannot imagine some weird things children can do. I said so because some people aren't always frank about their preferences, especially when such preferences are not upheld as morally right by the society. I know that the preference of some users here is to scam. But I haven't seen someone with the username as \"I am a scammer\".Again, I align with Upgrade00 as he said that many users are not aware of the permanency of usernames here. I know that if OP understands the real importance of this space, he/she will surely come back with a variant account.",

I didn't understand it at the first glance because ain't Italian but how did OP choose this nickname which is even anywhere on the platforms, this shouldn't be accepted. We didn't know what is the real purpose of choosing this nickname by the OP, either he didn't know or just seeking attention to the forum.  Though whatever it is, there is no rule for choosing a nickname, not at least for the purpose of scamming, spamming, or any violation that's against the forum's rule.  I suggest reading more first before posting it here and be careful on choosing a nickname",

To learn here, my advice to you is that you have to watch others and stay quiet alot of time while reading posts from other members. Also, you have to respect elders and forum rules. Do not be toxic. Did your friend not also tell you about bounties? Sure he did. Here is a good place for cryptocurrency experience and learning.
