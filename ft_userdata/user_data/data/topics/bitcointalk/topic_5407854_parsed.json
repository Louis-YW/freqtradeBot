      "body": "Link doesn’t work but I am assuming you want to use 3 PSU for a single rig.Can you do it? Sure. I’ve done it before without using any special devices.Just make sure all PSU are grounded together somewhere and DO NOT mix any of the +12V. Which means if a GPU takes 2 connections then you must connect to the same PSU or else you will destroy equipment.",

It works with multiple PSU.I would not look for such circuits on YouTube, but would buy a proven adapter. But it’s better to either reduce the number of video cards or increase the power of power supplies so as not to create unnecessary problems for yourself. I buy a new power supply for each mining farm and do not save money on this.",
