It's the question whether their customers fund are \"SAFU\".",

WTF, Nobody should trust in a hacked CEX, not even a CEX that was victing of two idiots like The Crocodile of Wall Street and her husband“Crocodile of Wall Street” and her husband plead guilty to giant-sized cryptocrimesI haven't use the exchange before but judging from the few comments under this thread so far, it seems they have no more reputation to keep or protect. However, even a minor phishing attack can have major repercussions. Phishing attack may be term minor in terms of the damage it causes but it's still a serious threat to any company who care about it reputation even if the phishing attack only affects a small number of people because it can have a major impact on the company's reputation and trust. If an exchange is known for having a history of phishing attacks, people may be less likely to do business with them. But is there need to notify the affected users? Hope they'll compensated?",

Obviously, many people - most especially on this forum - do not believe that Bitfinex is a good exchange worth dealing with. I do not have an account in Bitfinex and I don't have any plan to open one. Having experienced an unfortunate hacking, this is telling us that it is one of the many showing weakness which was exploited by professional hackers all just waiting for the right time to illicitly come in. Let's hope that eventually no users can lost any fund and that Bitfinex is going to learn many big lessons of this incident.",

I don't use Bitfinex, but have they been hacked before and caused damage to users? One thing I see is that Bitfinex is also a favorite exchange platform for sharks. Some news I have read and learned is that whales in the market often use Bitfinex or coinbase to sell assets rather than Binance or OKX. So I think maybe they are another big exchange besides Binance or OKB. As for them printing USDT, we don't have any evidence for that so it's hard to say. If they were actually laundering money or doing something illegal, would law enforcement cover them up?",

Been reading some articles about this exchange, and news and it happened several times. I wonder how they are still getting new users of the platform, wouldn't this news should be enough to wake up their clients?Let's see how they are going to manage this phishing attacks, and how would they compensate the affected users. I hope they would do a full-compensation plus some promo for disruption and inconvenience.",

Even Binance was hacked some time ago.Their reputation can be built by hacks and how they compensate their users after hacks. I knew about Poloniex in the past got hack but they compensated their users fairly and became a biggest cryptocurrency. They lost that position to Bittrex because of poor infrastructure expansion to satisfy massive user explosion in 2017 but it could be their dirty games to kill their users in margin through lag times too. Bittrex later lost their position to Binance and I believe you knew all about that.Thank you for mentioning Kucoin exchange. When they were hacked, they were not a big exchange like now.",

The size of the hack kinda proves that. 300 million of lost customer funds, which was called the second largest hack in the history of crypto, which was second only to MtGox and beat number 3 on the list 6 times. But mtgox went bankrupt, taking with it the rest of the customers' funds (the hack itself could be a scam), kucoin coped and continues to operate.",

They did not know whether it was a single hacker or a group of hackers that attacked this exchange. They called it a minor attack and at the beginning, they said that the hacker did not get access to the database center or users' passwords or accounts but after that, they said that most of the accounts were hacked and the hacked accounts were mostly inactive or empty.I don't know how the hackers attacked a big exchange that worked from 2012 just on inactive or empty accounts or if the exchange hid the truth. For your security, I recommend shifting your funds from that exchange to some other exchange for some time when things are fixed then using it again.",
