Either way, money has been devalued more and more in recent years and it will certainly continue to do so, but I think in 2030 you can still buy more for $250,000 than with $25,000 today. Surely you will be able to buy less in 2030 than today with $250,000, but I don't think that the devaluation of money is progressing so quickly. But if this does happen, the world will certainly have more problems than it has now and things are looking pretty bad anyway.",

Furthermore, any speculation that sets a range as wide as $250k to as much as $1.5 million is nothing more than mere speculation, regardless of whether it comes from someone who people think knows what will happen in the future.I basically agree with you, and I think many others share that opinion, although in 7 years most people think that the price of 1 BTC will be in the six-figure zone, so we will not be disappointed if Cathie is right",
