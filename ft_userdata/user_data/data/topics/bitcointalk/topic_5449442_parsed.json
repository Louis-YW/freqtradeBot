There is no such fee for UTXOs below this amount.As with any other bitcoin transaction, you also need to pay mining fees. For coinjoin, you must pay a mining fee for each round.Read the guide to know what are necessary, for example using Tor: https://trezor.io/learn/a/coinjoin-in-trezor-suite",

      "body": "When CoinJoining on Trezor, you can't choose a coordinator to manage your transactions because it only work with \"official\" zkSNACKs coordinator. QuoteWill Trezor sign just any transaction when it is in the automated signing mode?No. Trezor will only sign transactions that have been prepared by zkSNACKs official coinjoin coordinator. You are not allowed to decide which of your coins should participate in a CoinJoin transaction, you need to rely on their algorithm of automatic selection.QuoteCan I manually select which coins to register for coinjoin?No. All coins in your coinjoin account are eligible for mixing. The coins are selected automatically based on multiple factors.In one of the sections of their FAQ they claim that Bitcoin is fungible and that, at the same time, there may be some \"high-risk UTXOs\" in your wallet unworthy to be mixed by their software.QuoteHow does the coinjoin coordinator choose inputs?When you press Start, the coinjoin coordinator maintained by zkSNACKs receives a list of UTXOs to include in a coinjoin. Since your UTXOs will be sent in a transaction with other usersâ€™ funds, the coordinator checks that no individual UTXO has caused a recent coinjoin to fail and is not on a list of known high-risk UTXOs. This keeps your coins private without affecting fungibility. Owning a high-risk UTXO will not prevent other UTXOs in your wallet from being coinjoined.https://trezor.io/learn/a/coinjoin-in-trezor-suite#FAQs",

I don't think the problem is creating a new coordinator, and I am sure Trezor could have done it by putting in some more work. The problem is getting enough liquidity and users willing to switch from zkSNACKs to your new coordinator. The best option would have been to do nothing at the moment. The way things stand now, you have to choose between two evils. Using the pro-censorship zkSNACKs coordinator or running a new one no else is/will be using.Â  Quote from: witcher_sense on April 20, 2023, 05:29:15 AMQuoteHow does the coinjoin coordinator choose inputs?Since your UTXOs will be sent in a transaction with other usersâ€™ funds, the coordinator checks that no individual UTXO has caused a recent coinjoin to fail and is not on a list of known high-risk UTXOs.

BIG SECURITY RISKyep allowing some remote user to sign your funds away. is a big risk. its not auto as in the software does it itself. its auto meaning the user is not required to consent by signing themselves.. the coordinator does the transaction template creation and signing. big risk of allowing outsiders to move your funds, which defeats trezors original purpose",
