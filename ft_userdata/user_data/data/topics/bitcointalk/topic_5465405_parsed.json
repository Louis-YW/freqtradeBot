(I know i am not going to live to see that but in any case i want to dream a little with that).So, picture this: It's near the year 2134 or 2138, and we've experienced the last-ever bitcoin halving. At this point, miners are going to get only 1 Satoshi per mined block, plus transaction fees. It's a far cry from the current scenario and for the next period of 4 years only 210000 new satoshis will be created. That made me think that we need to start trying to save every satoshi available.For miners, it's safe to assume that transaction fees will go through the roof. As the mining reward shrinks, miners will need to get creative to keep their operations profitable. They might start looking into greener, more sustainable energy sources to cut costs and invest in better mining hardware to maximize their returns.On the other hand, for folks like us, the incentive to spend our bitcoins may decrease. With rewards diminishing and fees on the rise, there's a stronger argument for holding onto our digital treasure unless it's absolutely necessary. Think of it as a futuristic savings account where every satoshi saved feels like a victory.In the end, none of us may live to see the year 2138, but it's exciting to imagine how the world of bitcoin will evolve after the last halving. The balance between mining rewards and fees, along with the motivations of miners and users, will surely transform. Who knows what kind of innovative solutions and changes are in store? Until then, let's keep dreaming and HODLing those precious satoshis!What are your thoughts about the future of bitcoin in times of the last halving ?",

This only happens in the short term and will soon recover. And as you said, transaction fees were quite high during the BRC20 Ordinal hype a few months ago. I had felt the increase when I wanted to send bitcoin and was charged about $30 in one transaction and the time it took to be confirmed was also quite long. But that's still nothing compared to the transaction fees that occurred in 2018 which reached $55 and the highest in 2021 was around $62.",

Even around 2100, block rewards won't play any major role anymore because rewards will be very tiny. We are still earlyI believe transaction fees will carry Bitcoin way sooner than we might expect. And while more people will use Bitcoin, it won't be a problem to reward miners mostly from transaction fees.

If in 2134 or 2138 year miners were only getting 1 sat. for every block they mined, then today's small buyers with a couple of tens or hundreds of satoshi would be millionaires.Quote from: albert0bsd on September 02, 2023, 02:04:48 PMSo, picture this: It's near the year 2134 or 2138, and we've experienced the last-ever bitcoin halving.

That made me think that we need to start trying to save every satoshi available.Actually, that's right. This was the case in previous years. A couple of bitcoins seemed like a mere trifle, and now these are already impressive amounts. The same will happen with satoshi. Now it costs almost nothing, but in the future, it will become difficult for many. If I were a bitcoin-hater, I would still spend a couple of tens of bucks for a few satoshi and put it in my wallet and keep it for a very long time, forgetting for years. If my expectations are not justified, then the losses are small, but if they are justified, then even a couple of satoshi can pleasantly surprise in the future.Quote from: albert0bsd on September 02, 2023, 02:04:48 PMOn the other hand, for folks like us, the incentive to spend our bitcoins may decrease.

It is never known what the BTC-community will invent and in what direction it will move, but in any case, saving some bitcoin/satoshi will benefit the holders.If the forum survives until 2134-2138, then our dreams and discussions about bitcoin and the last halving will become historical artifacts.",

If there is too much increase in transaction fee, a lot of people will be forced to leave the exchange concerned, and if the transaction fee is too high generally, more people will be forced to leave depending on the gain one encounters at the end of it all.",

I consider myself the king of imagination world but its an obvious thing that my imaginative thoughts might be of no importance or to be liked by other and same goes for me. But still, in my imagination, till 2040 BTC will have alternative, or such unique developments that will make the whole scenario look as a normal scenario. Mean till then the inflation will be to the Mars and prices of everything will be 100x from now. But still people will be living and to them all of that money is nothing. For example millennials can relate this. To them 100$ were a lot of money back in there time but that same $100 will be of $1 worth at 2040. But seriously, we should enjoy the moments we have and get benefit from the features of BTC while we have the time. To be honest I still think we are so early in adopting the BTC as if we compare ourselves with the future people's of 2040 then we will realize that we really are early adopters.",

I doubt people will still use Bitcoin if the fee will grow more zero in fiat value since this is not economical. Maybe there will be some adjustment in the future the amount of transaction fee in sats in proportion with the fiat value.",

This seems so easy to imagine the future but still no one can really predict what will happen at that time. What if Satoshi put some work or mechanism there that at the end of halving he came and said here are more BTC to mine. I know technically that's not possible but hey we are imagining here.

But still the deflationary nature of BTC still made profit to all bit coiners. It indicates that, at the last halving miners will still make profit and who knows till then what type of green energy sources will be discovered or invented.",

Take a look at the average transaction fee in stable periods, for instance 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 and you'll see the fee has doubled. Bull markets produce extreme fees, so it's easier to look at bear market years and at this period of bitcoin's cycle the fee is higher every time.It's also important to add that we aren't talking about the next 10 years but OP is talking about a 100 years time. If we can see the fees going 3x in the low volatility periods over the course of 10 years, it will probably keep happening as we move forward.",
