  "content": "Hi guys.I wonder if you can help me. I have turned my old laptop and found out that i have got 5 Bitcoins back in 2010. I have scribbled a privkey and address. Now i have tried to download Bitcoin core wallet to get my coins to action, but for some reason i do not see my coins there. But i can clearly see them in the block explorer. Is it something to do with the fact that i got them before core wallets came in? I can't clearly remember what i did to get these coins back then as it was 13 year ago. Could you help me to figure this out?The block explorer say:This address has transacted 7 times on the Bitcoin blockchain. It has received a total of x.xxx BTC $xxx and has sent a total of 0.00000000 BTC $0.00 The current value of this address is x.xxxIt also show that it has a total of 7 transactions in and none of them out. First transaction made in 2010 and others in 2019-2022. When i sync bitcoin full node wallet, i can only see those 6 transactions that happened in 2019-2022, but not the one that has been in 2010Sorry for i don't disclose the balance and wallet address as it is pure for security reasons.",

So i have to export the public key out of my privkey?Like Loyce mentioned, if you're unsure about importing the private key you should do it offline and in a verified and authentic version of Bitcoin Core. First I would suggest that you check if the installer that you got was from the official Bitcoin Core website[1] which is also linked in the News section of the forum. Afterwards, even if you got it from the previous website, you should verify it by following the procedures applicable to your OS that can be found here[2].Afterwards I believe you can use the command \"importprivkey\"[3] in the Console window within Bitcoin Core in order to import your private key. To do so you'll have to:With the Bitcoin Core program open go to Window;Select \"Console\";Run the following command importprivkey <bitcoinprivkey> ;Click \"Enter\";If by any chance you get the following message - Rescan is disabled when blocks are pruned (code -4) - you can use the following code to avoid scanning the blockchain for transactions related to the key that you've just imported (and thus avoiding the previous error):Code:importprivkey \"<key>\" \"\" false[1]https://bitcoincore.org/[2]https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/[3]https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/importprivkey.html",

This doesn't matter for security of your address, but you should know all block data is public.I only dealt with \"sent to pubkey\" coins once. This is how you can safely sign a transaction offline (quote shortened to match your case):Quote from: LoyceV on April 29, 2022, 03:28:42 PMInstall a fresh spare laptop (with VPN of course)Download the full clientImport the pubkey, let it synchronizeTake it offlineImport the private keyCreate a raw transaction to a new addressCopy the transaction to a USB stickBroadcast the transaction from another deviceWipe the laptop (don't let it go online again after you entered the private key!)Importing addresses into Bitcoin Core is more complicated if you use a descriptor wallet. It's easiest to create a non-descriptor wallet for this.Quote from: Zipp_1199 on April 05, 2023, 08:52:12 PMI have imported the address and re- synced the wallet. I did not want to import the pvirkey after i saw that the balance does not match, tho the wallet address is correct. I did not import my privkey as i have heard some stories that people lost their bitcoins just because of stupid mistakes they did. So i have to export the public key out of my privkey?Did you manage to import the pubkey yet? If not:Code:importpubkey \"pubkey\" ( \"label\" rescan )You can use bitaddress.org to get the pubkey from your private key, but do this offline running from a Linux Live DVD so you're sure the private key will never be online. Wipe the memory by turning it off.QuoteI did not import my privkey as i have heard some stories that people lost their bitcoins just because of stupid mistakes they did.That's a good precaution. Also: it's good to think about what you're going to do with your 5 Bitcoin once you've recovered it. It's probably safest to setup a hardware wallet, learn how to use it safely, create a backup (or 2), and send all your funds there. If you're going to send only a small part, chances are your coins end up on a change-address in Bitcoin Core, which means you should backup your wallet.dat before doing that.After you've securely moved all your Bitcoins, it's good to know you also own some Fork coins worth close to $1000. Know that people have lost their Bitcoins trying to claim them with compromised wallets, so don't do anything with them before securing your Bitcoins.Quote from: RickDeckard on April 05, 2023, 09:31:21 PMAfterwards I believe you can use the command \"importprivkey\"[3] in the Console window within Bitcoin Core in order to import your private key.That's the one thing OP shouldn't do on an online computer.QuoteIf by any chance you get the following message - Rescan is disabled when blocks are pruned (code -4) - you can use the following code to avoid scanning the blockchain for transactions related to the key that you've just importedThat's not going to work: OP needs a rescan to import the pubkey. If he has a pruned chain, he'll just have to download the blockchain again.",
