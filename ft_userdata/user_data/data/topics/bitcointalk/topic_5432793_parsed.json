      "body": "You already got few suggestions.Truth is you can buy bitcoin online from anyone. But you have to make sure that you are not getting scammed. There are scammers around. Whenever you are buying bitcoin, always use escrow. Escrow as escrow agency or individuals. I don't have much idea about the exiting agencies but there are many users on the forum who will be happy to offer you their service for cheap cost.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2439910.0The above you will find a list of them. The best way to buy bitcoin is to find people who live in your local. In your county if bitcoin does not have a legal issue then meet people on Facebook and invite them to meet you in person to buy sell bitcoin with you. Don't go for large sum at the beginning and do these things in public place for your safety.",

You can either do this on your own, by finding someone that has the money you want and wants the money you have, or you can use a service that assists you with making that exchange (such as Coinbase, or Swan Bitcoin)You can commit a crime and take that money from someone else without their permission.You can beg and hope that some charitable person will just give you some of that money.

(This is not allowed on this forum)Crime is not also allowed in the forum, so I will say the two last options mentioned on the list are both not acceptable in the forum. Begging and crime I highly prohibited that is why you should not trust anyone bitcoin is trustless.",

You really can't.  Satoshi created bitcoin.  Now it exists.  You can create an altcoin if you want, but you can't really create Bitcoin.What you can do is:Quote from: DannyHamilton on January 03, 2023, 02:05:51 PMYou can provide a product or service and accept that money in exchange from anyone that wants that product or service.That's what solo \"bitcoin mining\" actually is.  You are providing a service for the bitcoin network, forming consensus through a method using proof-of-work, and in exchange, the users of that network allow you to receive some bitcoins as payment for that service.Some of those bitcoins are provided as transaction fees from the users that are currently sending transactions, the rest are provided as a form of inflation reducing the value of everyone else's bitcoins.If you're talking about mining with a mining pool, then you are just providing a hashing service to the pool operator (essentially leasing your hashpower to them), and they are paying you for that service with some of the bitcoins that THEY earn from the Bitcoin users by providing the service of forming consensus through a method using proof-of-work.",

In my opinion, though, those bitcoins already exist in concept. They were \"created\" by Satoshi when he created the code that allows them to exist in the blockchain.

Both mining for a pool and solo-mining are services; one for the pool and the other for the network. I just believe this kind of service deserves to fit an upper category, because it is more abstract. Just as you make a distinction between \"selling services\" and \"finding a job for an employer\", or \"selling services\" and \"exchanging currencies\". Both working for an employer and selling currencies are services; you just found it more proper to distinguish them.

They were \"created\" by Satoshi when he created the code that allows them to exist in the blockchain.Allowing something to exist and existing isn't the same, though. If all miners suddenly shut their ASICs down, there won't be these bitcoins you consider existent.",

What you need to do is to register an account on any of this platforms so that you can buy with your local currency through peer to peer method which I think would be more safer for you. There some reputable persons here that can swap there Bitcoin with you for your local currency but you will need to be careful and use a reputable seller or preferably using an escrow so that you fund would be safe.",
