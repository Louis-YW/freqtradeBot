At beast, Elon will be glad for it to be used in Mars as a secondary currency or make it the official crypto of the mission, because it does not matter who pro Doge Elon is, he is still likely come up with a centralized coin for his future settlement on the red planet. He is a billionaire and a centralized Martian FIAT would be very tempting for him not to implement",

Musk doesn't even like pow coins and frankly i am pretty sure that his days of being richest guy in the world are over soon. His behavior has been erratic enough to scare his investors away. I mean if i had a too much invested in anything Elon controls i would be really scared for my investment. And yet he keeps making insane statements on tv and twitter. And to top of that he really think he is funny. His hiring policy is pretty much opposite of google's who actually want to keep their talents working there.",

After all, his personal Roadster is floating in space right now.Who made Elon Musk the sole owner or administrator of Mars? I have not heard of any deal that have him the right to issue currency on Mars. For now, humans will not be able to live normal lives on that planet without scientific assistance and how many people do you think will be able to afford a trip to Mars? It will take more than fifty years and more scientific breakthroughs for man to live normal lives on Mars. Op might be a promoter of Dogecoin who is desperate to promote it, but by all means, because of the loss of relevance. And he wants me to start daydreaming about buying and selling on Mars with Muskcoim. But he chose the wrong advertisement concept and forum. I think. Elon is more concerned about fixing the SpaceX rocket that exploded and not a shitcoin.",

It could take up to 21 minutes for signals to travel from Earth to Mars. This means that a cryptocurrency cannot work for both planets since Dogecoin has about a 1 minute block time. One should use a completely new cryptocurrency for Mars.",

Exactly the name and motive for the coin is just joke and I am sure that dogecoin will indeed be limited to being used only on their platform for like and comments rewards as you mentioned also what will become the payment method for content creators who at the same time generate income through that social media will there be rewarded in dogecoin or in other stablecoins. What will this possible integration leads to, what have we to expect, will this development lead to more centralization and more control of the coin or a way to reward users of the platform in a more decentralized way?",
