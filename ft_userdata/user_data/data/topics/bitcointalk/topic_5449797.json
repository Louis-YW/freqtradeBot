This products also people invest in it but not everybody probably the rich, I believe many people won't have had the money to buy bitcoin or even put interest even if you have the money.Physical products like lands, cars, gold are multi-billion dollar establishments with investments from the rich and middle class and sometimes the poor even. Every investment cannot be virtual as each serves their different purposes, I for example would definitely not buy a virtual car or a virtual land in the metaverse, but as a transaction method and a store of value, being digital and private has its advantages.Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 22, 2023, 03:59:10 PMWould you have involved if bitcoin is a physical product?Bitcoin as it is designed cannot be a physical product. This would limit its ease of transfer or it's ease of storage meaning it loses somebody it's features. I can be interested in Bitcoin collectibles.",

The reason BTC was created is just to become and peer-to-peer cash electronic payment system, nothing else was stated in the Whitepaper, it also does not state there that have a promise to anyone to make a profit. I cannot just imagine how to cross the borders in every country if that is a physical product. Remember that BTC's unique properties, such as its decentralization, immutability, and digital nature, are what make it valuable and attractive to users. These properties would not exist if Bitcoin were a physical product, and it would lose its potential as a decentralized digital currency.",

      "body": "If bitcoin took on a tangible guise, like real estate, autos, gold, or precious stones, it would indisputably be among the most coveted goods out there. However, as you astutely emphasize, the true allure of bitcoin springs from its privacy and the liberty it grants to individual investors. As a crypto-enthusiast for ages, I can vouch for bitcoin's awe-inspiring potential and perks as a confidential investment. The capacity to deal anonymously and securely, minus intermediaries or middlemen, revolutionizes the financial landscape.But such liberty entails immense responsibility. As individual investors, it's crucial we stay alert and become prudent wealth custodians, shielding our private keys and defending our investments against ill-intentioned actors and external hazards. Although bitcoin isn't a physical product per se, its ethereal character and the influence it embodies hold the power to reshape finance and empower people like never before.",

At the beginning while hearing about it everyone will have a question how does it can hold value without have its physical presence. Slowly we'll understand and the best things will happen further. Very important thing then only we'll find what additional expenses every government is going through with the printing of currencies. Anyhow the need of physical currency lasts forever as everyone can't go digital as the people aren't prepared for it. Maybe after generations things might change.",

Such thing was only possible in software form, if something like Bitcoin was physical by nature then the inventor of that product might not be able to hide himself from centralized bodies. The nature of Bitcoin is decentralization, and purposefully Satoshi set the Hard limit at 21 million bitcoins. And, that genius guy gave this world a gift, especially to us in this tech world.Physical products are  different from virtual products in many aspects. Let's still guess that if something like Bitcoin was physical then it must have to be made out of physical elements. How would volatility like this could ever be achieved with a physical product, and how would others transfer that product anonymously? The answer to those questions is simply not possible at all. No body can trade a physical product without any interference from centralized bodies. That's the reason Bitcoin was made as a virtual product and it will remain in same state, it will never be released as a physical item.",

If bitcoin was like any other physical product then today we don't see any power from it and many people would think of bitcoin just like any other physical product.Where did this idea come to your mind? have you read the White Paper?

I'm sure almost all the members in this forum really admire the quality that bitcoin has, including me too. Bitcoin is indeed superior in terms of maintaining privacy, good potential in the future, and its market price is always stable.But that doesn't mean that other businesses that exist today are not good or unsafe. any business always has advantages in their respective fields, we must think realistically. Don't think there is no good business besides investing in bitcoin, if you think like that, it means you have never experienced business in other fields. because right now, I'm investing in bitcoin, while running a business even though it's still not big. And from my personal experience, I can conclude, that if you want to do business in any field, there will definitely be advantages and disadvantages.For privacy matters, not only in business,Even outside of business, when it comes to privacy, everyone also wants their privacy to be very well maintained, so when it comes to privacy, I don't think it lies in a job or business, but it has become a natural human trait.And if bitcoin exists in physical form, and still remains decentralized, I will still invest in bitcoin.",

That is to say, if the physical Bitcoin we are talking about is still able to fully offer the same utility it has today as a virtual asset when on its physical form. If not, then it would hardly be able to gather a couple of eyes to even take a look at it. Remember that the main reason why we all are drawn into this industry is because of what Bitcoin and most of the good utility coins in this industry has to offer to us investors. And a physical form of Bitcoin just can't offer such utility. Hence, Bitcoin as a physical product is a big no for me.",
