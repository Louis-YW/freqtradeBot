(to rebalance the reserves in opposite direction as binance was top-heavy in binance chain token but low-light on actual bitcoin sending people out of binance via their binance chain would rebalance their reserves and take the 'bank run' of real btc liability off of them if they push people to only get real btc via other exchanges...with all that said. people then decide (like they did in the 2014 events of MTGox) to sell their BTC for fiat and hope to escape with fiat rather than be suspended in an exchange that might suspend btc withdrawals.which the other exchanges(not affected) sheepishly follow the price down with more arbitraging  between exchanges by using more reserves of sidechain/stablecoin crap like binance chain",

(dont be a blind sheep follower due to one persons presumptions/confidence in their post)people can be confident about their own presumptions, but never ever be confident about other peoples presumptions.. in short. dont base your opinion solely on another persons presumptions due to what you conceive as their confidence or their context of how they made a presumption. take everything as an opinion and a presumption. but atleast see if what they say has any detail that atleast has some aspect of context to their presumption. and not some random number plucked out of their hat.i purposefully didnt say any future value presumption or specific date( hour day month) of any presumption. so there is no assurance.with that said. there are many factors that build many peoples presumptions. such as the 4 year cycle/seasons correlate due to other things of 4 years. like the halving event. (as others here and in other topics have mentioned a few times)(EG the pattern of the 4 year season is JUST ONE FACTOR.. dont base your own opinion on just one factor mentioned in one topic... find more, other clues. build up alot of info from alot of sources, by this i dont mean find multiple topics about one factor to then stand by one factor, simply because its mentioned by many people. i actually mean find many factors about different details that help you build a bigger picture )do your own research and take peoples opinions and presumptions and things that they use to base their presumptions. not as something to be spoon fed to you as a complete finished answer to stand by. but as a tip-bit of opinion to gather, along with other pieces from other sources. and then doing your own research to build up even more detail together and then with more info from many sources.. then form your own presumption..the reason i say this is because of one simple fact..when too many people know of a pattern. people then try to 'beat' the pattern by playing against the pattern. which then changes the pattern.sometimes people do sheep follow an historic pattern and just set their trade-bot to just blindly follow the trend, causing the trend to repeat itself. where the pattern may not have happened again without the blind following the blind.you cant predict which scenario will come next, blindly repeat, or break away.. so gather more info of more sources and try to make your own independent presumptionsno one can predict the future. but you can narrow down possibilities until your are more confident yourself",

Bitcoin is based on math. It has finite supply, known, stable rate at which new coins are mined and has been following a number of curves and staying within certain averages since it was created. You can find people explaining the math behind bitcoin in various articles and videos. There are only 2 possible outcomes for bitcoin which are growth or death because halvings make sure the value will grow and with it there will be greater interest and adoption. If bitcoin continues to exist it will have another halving and it will have more of its supply lost forever, making it more and more scarce. If it's still there in 2 years, you can be sure it will trade for more than today and with 5% inflation on most fiat currencies, bitcoin will have to be worth at least $35k in 2 years. There's no other way around it. People focus too much on highs, but it's really the lows that tell a story. Highs are very volatile and jump all over the charts, but lows are showing a slow and steady growth. I don't know how low we will crash from here but I'm ready to bet that we will never again see 2020 lows.",

Highs are very volatile and jump all over the charts, but lows are showing a slow and steady growth. I don't know how low we will crash from here but I'm ready to bet that we will never again see 2020 lows. i personally have a hoard from the old days(2012-14 era). so my hoard is in profit so i dont care about their value as the price even today is way way way above their acquisition costs. so i am not in panic mode nor care to sell.. so i dont care and am ignoring the value of that hoard. my personal presumptions were that the value window of 2021-22 of ~$25k-$70k meant the price last month of ~$29k was very good value. however seeing the 2021-2022 discounts for the era. its good value to buy a bit more. i dont need it. but i happily spent $6k of fiat(unused/unneeded disposable fiat income i wont need/miss for a while) to buy more at the $29k/btc value. and will be doing it again this week at the even better value to buy. (it helps average down my 2021-22 era stash)i dont recommend anyone stake their life savings or house at any 'bet' or presumption others state. but if you do have disposable income you wont miss. you might aswell give it a try.by disposable income i mean things you would normally waste income on.. like drive-thru's and fast food that just become a toilet flush the next day. things you spend that you will never see value returned on again. like buying some in-game credit for a feature that has a time expiry where you dont benefit from that spend after the time expires. EG if you are thinking of buying a brand new car. realise the very day after buying it. it is a second hand car and loses a few $xk of value instantly.. meaning if you bought a second hand car of same year/model. the value would be the same on day 2 as a new car on day 2. so save yourself a bit of disposable income, buy it second hand and invest the savings instead of losing it completely overnight (like a fast food becoming just a toilet flush after 1 days digestion)think smart. dont just take a blind punt/bet using more then you can risk living without. also if the price goes down more. you can just use next weeks/next months spare/available disposable income to get even more. rather then draining yourself in one shot meaning you cant take future opportunities.never be in a situation when seeing a price go down as a complete loss of life savings.think of it as just a delay in ROI of disposable income thats not life changing risk. and think of the low as a opportunity to gain more cheaply before the next rise",

I won't say this isn't concerning because I would hate to see bitcoin destroyed by shitcoiners who buy it to pump their shitcoins and then dump it as they exit their scam like Luna founder did. Every time Bitcoin falls there has to be some drama behind it. In 2014 we had MtGox collapse and in 2018 there was all that drama with bitcoin fees and bitcoin cash \"the new king\"  Meanwhile we had China mining bans, Tesla pump and dump, suddenly Bitcoin started to be bad for the environment, stablecoins became unstable, and so on. Now fudders are working to make everyone scared of Michael Saylor dumping just like years ago they were trying to scare everyone with fake satoshis who had access to Genesis Block and were about to dump it all. To all of the new guys reading this: All of my friends who I've talked about bitcoin in the last 9 years regretted not buying bitcoin or selling it and exiting the market. There was not a single person who felt good about selling or about not buying it when they had the chance. Don't believe that the market is going to disappear all of a sudden. People who had thousands of Bitcoins and sold did not do it to leave and forget about it. They did it to make you sell and buy back more because the ultimate goal for most of them is to have the largest piece of the pie. Without scaring you they can't make you sell it cheap.",

It has finite supplyWorld economy is based on trust.What Bitcoin \"created\" so far is a lot of victims who lost money to thousands of scams and even \"genuine\" products like LUNA brought more victims into this world.The average Joe needs to trust the system, not to be afraid of it.When you get more and more and more victims, and it's only rolling like a giant snowball - then no math in the world can save it. And this is where we're heading now.",
