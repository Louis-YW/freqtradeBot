  "content": "Kyberswap has been hacked and $46 million dollars has reportedly been drained from the exchange across multiple chains. The team is still trying to ascertain the root cause of the hack but they have advised users through a message on the exchange and X platform to withdraw their funds. The hacker stole about $20 million Wrapped Ether (wETH), $7 million wrapped Lido-staked Ether (wstETH) and $4 million Arbitrum (ARB) and other currencies.The hacker also left a message that says “Negotiations will start in a few hours when I am fully rested.”Let's hope he'll be reasonable and return back the loot.",
