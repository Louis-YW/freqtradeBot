What was your lowest point in life ? Especially when it comes to finanical difficulties ? How did you survive ? My lowest point was back to study overseas in XXX country decades ago. At the time, my moeny was robbed and the school kicked me of dormitory due to the overdue fees. I was reluctant to ask money from my parents and I was collecting garbage food for nearly two months to survive. Luckily one of my friends at church helped me find a part-time job and I lived on that little money for a long time. That was really an aweful experience but I am glad I made it through. What is your story ?",

Especially when it comes to finanical difficulties ? How did you survive ? Everyone may have experienced a difficult experience in their life differently, including me personally. But I try to get through it by working in a place that makes money even though the results are small, but as long as I can still use that income to eat every day, I will still survive and work there. And in general, I've never experienced anything more painful than what you experienced outside that country, so I'm just sad when I read your story that you wrote here.QuoteMy lowest point was back to study overseas in XXX country decades ago.

What is your story ? I have not experienced a more painful story like the one you are telling. Because I always try to find ways to continue to earn money when I'm dying in life, because I feel that no one wants to help me when I'm having a hard time so I just try to work hard to support myself until now. I hope that experience will make you stronger and I hope to never experience something like that in the future.",

What is your story ? I remember back in 2018, I had like $200 worth of BTCs which I earned from campaign signatures and a good friend of mine introduced me to USI-Tech. He explained to me that my BTCs can earn as much as 60% of its value after six (6) months of investing on it, not knowing that it was a ponzi-scheme. I even attended a seminar in our country wherein the owners of USI-TECH discussed its plans and futures.Fast-forward and after three (3) months, my whole BTC was scammed and I was left with nothing. Unfortunately, $200 in a third-world country is relatively huge and I had to do part-time jobs in order to recover such money.",

I think this is what I hear a lot from people I know. Yes they are addicted to gambling and have no limit to where they should stop gambling, I mean they forget that emotions that they cannot control make them unknowingly spend a lot of money on gambling. I think the root of the problem lies in self-control, because I also gamble, but I can still set limits and not exceed them so I can still manage my finances pretty well.Maybe the difference is that I gamble just for fun, while those who have collapsed financially because of gambling because they expect too much of a big win from what they play.",

Especially when it comes to finanical difficulties ? How did you survive ? It is more challenging when you were ones financially stable and later face a downtime. Those that have been poor might not feel the pain of facing lack because they are used to poverty. My own case was the death of my well to do father. I was a teenager when I lost my dad and it put the family into total financial distress because medical bills drained my father's wealth. My mum was not financially stable so we had to stay for days sometimes without good food. We would survive on a cheap local snacks that only made us survive. I and my siblings would have to hawk vegetables and fruits in the streets of my area to assist my mother's petty trade. I had to sleep in classrooms when I was admitted in a college because I couldn't afford to pay for house or hostel rent. What kept me going was the consciousnesses that the suffering wouldn't last forever. I had to get a dry-cleaning job where I manually washed and ironed cloths. I also was fortunate to befriend a girl that was wiling to help me. With my little income and her assistance, I graduated and got a job. Today, I look back at those days and I am grateful to God that I didn't give up.",
