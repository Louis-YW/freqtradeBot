  "content": "HiI put together an s9 with an old board and spare cards with old 2017 FW on it and it ran fine for 3 hours, i the upgraded to BrainsOS and it ran again, tuned fine.I have just returned home 4 hours later and miner is not running, i have tried restarting miner and sometimes one card runs to full Th, sometimes hust Gh and ramps down.I have tried other psu's, disconnecting cards, running one card (tried disabling card/s in FW settings but this does nothimg imo??).I did not screenshot or write down the message it gave a TUNER FAILED and the error on each card was somwehere alomg the lines of chips not recognided/renemeratopn or somthing?).I tried downgrading to older FW but it wull not??So i found an old card with FW -Linux 3.14.0-xilinx-gb190cb0-dirty #57 SMP PREEMPT Fri Dec 9 14:49:22 CST 2016 and it is npw running runs fine?I was on the verge of binning/selling these cards as faulty but they are all working/good temps/all asics showning, HW errors fine......What is going here and i presumed if you upgraded to BrainsOS it removed SSH lock thus allowing you to install older FW.I have just saved an S9 just by using different the older FW! <akes me wonder what other cards i have binned that would of worked fine on older FW!Any ideas?Cheers",

I have altready done this and all 3 cards only ran on that FW for a few hours.I simply tried/wanted to downgrade it to a previous non BrainsOS FW with no autotune etc, the ones that were around for years (i linked the exact one that worked above).It would not allow me to flash/doe=wngrade hence me just replacing the control board that had older FW on it.Or are you implying that there are card images for older FWs that can be installed via SD/NAND/JUMPER.In hindsight i should of purchased a few sd cards and used the run from SD card Brains FW, this wold of easily solved it just by removing it.But why is the newer brainsOS failing yet the older FW works fine?Cheers",

      "body": "Quote from: philipma1957 on November 04, 2022, 03:27:37 PMSo do not auto tune I am not very familiar with BO+ tuning but I believe it's similar to vnish, on BO+ you set a power limit on your miner which the firmware will try to achieve either by underclocking or overclocking certain boards/chips individually, similar to Vnish if you set a target so high which one of the boards can't stand the firmware would start to ignore your \"target\" and slowly adjust the setting to the downside until all chips become stable.So setting a high profile from the get-go is not a good idea, the miner could take forever to actually get to a stable state, the best approach would be setting a profile/power limit similar to the stock, so something like 14TH on Vnish, or 1250w on BO+, then check the chip's status, if they are happy with the setting for 2-3 hours, you can try another push, maybe 1350w or 15th, if the miner takes too long to finish tunning it's probably telling you that your miner's capabilities are way far below what you are asking.So in the above example if the tuning takes too long, fall back to 1300W or 14.5th, if the miner is happy with 1350w or 15th and your PSU is capable and you want to push it, go 1450w/16th, despite having to monitor the miner for a few hours, this is a lot safer and faster than going to 16th/1450w straight, because if your mine can only do 13th/1200w it will take so many hours for the runner to step down from 16th/1450w and you will think that the firmware isn't working when in fact you are pushing your miner way too hard.Also, I don't recall if there is a default setting for ASICBOOST on BO+ but on Vnish it comes disabled, so make sure you enable it before tuning.",

I guess we must inspire you a lot to copy paste our features   I am sorry I know that upsets you but you are more fun than Kano.But yes he is correct we created the feature back in the day that has limits of how high the temperature will get before the firmware will start to back itself down. Some others have copied it but it's okay I highly recommend you use it if you plan to play with firmware to protect your investment!ps. Please stop spreading lies about beagle bone boards being under powered for tuning and not having enough ram.. I heard that one today in a chat that was forwarded to me and I laughed so hard.

You need to lay off the pipe. What's next I am frodo too ahahahahIt's not garbage they landed on the moon with less processing power than the BeagleBone. It's called efficient code kiddo. \"true autotuning\" You just make up words now. Also what cpu on these boards have so many cores it's arm architecture so you develop for the hardware at hand and walla no issues at all. You can't make cpu/ram hungry programs for a devboard that was made over 10 years ago. Also that statement is great because I have people leaving because your tuning takes days and breaks hardware and our tuning takes a fraction of the time but then again that's what happens when you try to copy paste someone else IP and then implement it wrong yet again.C52 and C55 work fine what are you talking about. We support every control board. When do I ever tell people to install factory firmware on their miner we boot from the SD card and don't write to it to preserve warranty so that right there is how I know your lying. Just because you can't figure it out doesn't make it my problem. Also I think you forget we target different markets you target home miners while our average client is an industrial miner. Hence the reason we do a lot of the things we do. Also \"I don't send people\" all my coworkers are in Ukraine the majority don't speak English also I got banned from your group by one of your old mods because I muted them in my group for bothering customers.I like how you skipped all the text I wrote you can't respond to   now sit boy",

Stop spreading lies. Only thing you can do is turn a 17 series xlinx into a 19 series. That is not bricking it that is locking the boot loader dumb dumb. You would know this if you actually played with these things except echo chambered your feelings.Also you can't brick a control board by flashing the wrong bitmain firmware. You just need to flash the correct one. Your just making stuff up because it won't boot it if it's the wrong firmware. Go ahead try to flash bb firmware on a xilinx board watch as nothing happens.Can you please dig up this post because it's kind of funny to see you talking about things without context.Also why do you label it c52 etc. Xilinx, BB, Amlogic are the only 3 boards. There are variants of each but they are pretty much the exact same thing and work identical except for lower level driver controls on i/o.You just said modding cgminer but not understanding the hardware. Explain to me how you make a driver.... you understand the hardware to do so.Yes everyone does copy us. We have been around the longest and changelogs do not lie Have nice day mr copy cay echo chamber meanie pants!No your work is useless tuning in 3 days for a beagle bone and getting 30w/t at 110t lol. Sometimes copying people isn't the best route you should first understand the hardware and understand the science behind what we develop before copying it.ps. you do realize your firmware violates a few things correct?
