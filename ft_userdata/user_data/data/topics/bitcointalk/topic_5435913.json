  "content": "Hey guys, Despite all of this negative ish with Yogg etc, i still think the collection has collectible value from the artwork, and for that reason I am interested in trading for the bitcoin halving cards, etc. The cards can be redeemed idc. Whatever you have and are willing to trade for i'm sure we can work out some sort of deal. Lmk!I am deeply sorry for all of you who have lost considerable amounts of money on this, I am terribly sorry. Maybe I can help to soften the blow by a fun trade? We shall see. Looking forward to hearing from you, please feel free to send me a PM with links to images. Cheers, TREAD",
