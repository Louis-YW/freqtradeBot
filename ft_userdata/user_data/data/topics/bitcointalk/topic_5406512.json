  "content": "With Bitcoin's price currently in the middle of a trading range around $20K, as well as lack of clear direction as to whether price will rebound towards $30K or fall lower towards $10K, what do people think will happen if Bitcoin returns to the $25K - $30K trading range? With realized price as well as the 200WMA currently at $22K-$23K, it's likely breaking $25K would be confirmation of a local low (even if not necessarily the absolute bottom), but at the same time $30K acted as support for 18 months, suggesting it could now act as strong resistance. Therefore there could be a lot of indecision as well as volatility within this range it seems.Current poll options are as follows, ideally explain your reasoning below:More buyers will step in: Price will go beyond $30K towards $40K or even $50KMore sellers will appear: Price will get rejected and fall back down to $20K or lowerNeither, it'll be balanced: Price will consolidate in this range before moving higherStrange question I know, but currently it's clear most think the bottom isn't in and price will fall lower to $12K or $14K.So now I'm curious to hear what people think will happen if the majority are wrong",

I don't think most will vote for this though, the sentiment remains very pessimistic at the moment it seems, so I imagine that'd still be the case if Bitcoin get's to $25K. On a side note this scenario would remind me of 2019 when Bitcoin pumped from $4K to $5K within a week; most people were still heavily pessimistic and therefore waiting for a pull-back to $4K levels that didn't immediately occur.Not that I think the market conditions are the same as back then, as it was after months of consolidation at the lows as well as other factors, but just as a reference of how when Bitcoin breaks bear market trends or structures most people still don't trust the price movements.

Buy now at least 1 Bitcoin.2. Wait for the next Bitcoin price.I think such a method can be done at this time, if it goes down buy again, hold it, but if it goes up to $30k, it's up to sell or not sell, maybe you want to target up to $50k, who knows, everyone has their own understanding.Basically my choice.Quote(No idea, see results)",

I did however think this back in 2019 from $4K to $5K (+25%) within a week (or a single day if not mistaken), but after a few weeks it became pretty clear this wasn't going to happen as price consolidated. But this was after 3 months of consolidation, not just one month, without a bearish macro economic environment, so still inclined to agree to some degree. I think more likely would be a quick pump from $23K to $28K/$29K however, which would also be around +20 to +25%, simply because there is a big volume gap if price does soon leave the trading range to the upside.Either way, kind of expecting a big move to play out once price leaves the trading range, whether that be to the upside or the downside, sustained or not, similar to what happened last month.",

When previously Bitcoin was worth more than $1T it was around $50K and generally considered either overbought or too risky. Maybe the fact that Bitcoin has already reached $1T and can no doubt do it again there will be buyers stepping in before then though, only time will tell.Overall, an institutional buy level, well as main accumulation/distribution level (based on volume) does appear to be around $30K. For now I see this level very similarly to $6K to $8K back in 2018, as it's where the majority of volume lies in the past 18 months, as well as where institutions such as Tesla and Microstrategy (as well as others no doubt) invested for the long-term, and haven't yet sold most notably. Institutions also won't mind if it drops to $25K thereafter, if they are investing for the long-term that is.

Once these ambiguities are resolved financial institutions can enter the space. Currently the biggest holders are waiting for ETP approvals like ARK and Grayscale. Microstrategy to my knowledge is only holding it as an asset which binds their stock value to Bitcoin...Since Europe and Canada already have approved ETPs it's only a matter of time for the US to build legislation and regulation to allow it...I don't think the current marketcap has any real effect except for showing that Bitcoin is legit.",

Are we going to have another exchange going bankrupt soon?Indeed I'm not denying that other macro factors can or will be more influential to price movements than price itself. I guess the poll is based on the current economic situation, which is of course ever changing. I think your questions would make a good poll in itself, as to what might most affect price in the near future, or why price might fall much lower, or whether these events will occur.That said, since the \"bearish news\" of CPI numbers, Bitcoin has rallied 10%. So clearly these macro-economic factors don't always immediately influence price in the way many suspect it will. As I've said before, the bearish economic climate will negatively affect price until it no longer does. There will eventually be a decoupling to traditional markets as there always has been imo.Quote from: Poker Player on July 17, 2022, 05:45:26 AMQuote from: Lucius on July 16, 2022, 01:51:25 PMIt seems to me that we will stay between $19k and $22k for months because it seems that a balance has been created between sellers and buyers - serious buyers will still wait for some lower values, and sellers sell only what they have to.

Whether that means price drops to $10K and consolidates between $10K and $20K for months to come, or whether the trading range is expanded to $20K to $30K is another story. Either way, the longer price remains within this relatively tight range (tight for Bitcoin at least), the more volatile the break-out will be to a new trading range imo.",

In the past, good news has raised the price overnight by 20% or more without any problems, but bad news also resulted in even a 50% crash. It's true that the range I'm talking about is very narrow, but remember how long we were between $28k and $32k before crashing below $20k.I appreciate people who still have more knowledge in the area of TA and their analysis, but it seems to me that we are still too deep in the bear market to be able to expect positive changes in the price in terms of returning to the values of a few months ago.",
