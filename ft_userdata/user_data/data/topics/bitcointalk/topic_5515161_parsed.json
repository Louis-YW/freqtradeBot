The idea of the statue disappearing is good since no one knows about Satoshi Nakamoto's real identity. I wonder what other people will think about this statue created on Switzerland. Hope this brings more people into Bitcoin.",

Lugano, Switzerland is one of the pioneer cities for Bitcoin. The creator is Valentina Picozzi, if you want to see her other works check out her instagram account. There is also interesting content on the Satoshi Gallery account which this piece is a part of from what I understand.",

I am very glad that artists are using their skills to spread more awareness about Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin, and just Crypto in general. Any artwork is welcomed but even without the concept of Satoshi Nakamoto, this is an intelligent and well executed design. QuoteAnd this could be the second statue dedicated to him, Three years ago, Hungary became the first nation to build a Statue of Satoshi.This community is full of talented and creative individuals. Glad to see how creativity can be applied in a fintech kind of industry.",

If I read this correctly looks like the city, Tether, and Plan B Initiative are the ones who commissioned this statue. Tether's CEO comments are quite ironic since I don't think Tether is a good representative for decentralized finance. Anyway looks like this status will stay at Lugano and probably become an attraction for the annual event in the future.[1] https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshi-nakamoto-statue-revealed-at-luganos-annual-blockchain-event/",

But it's not about the looks but it's about the symbolism that the creator of that statue wants to relay to everyone who will see it. Let's appreciate that there are people and government that are appreciating satoshi in this means. If the maker of it has been a \"son of bit since 2008\" based on her website and she's really into it. This is her way of contributing to what has been done by satoshi or whoever she wants to reflect with that statue, it's a great piece of art.",

Thanks for sharing!In recent years, monuments to Satoshi Nakamoto have been appearing more and more often. There seems to be some kind of trend around this topic. Do people really want to see some kind of symbolism of freedom in this? Perhaps this is true. For how many centuries has the planet's population been enslaved by various despots, and now there is a small hope that this situation can be changed. I like it when freedom is expressed in this way.",

      "body": "I like the creativity of the designer Valentina Picozzi. His ability to create a bronze statue that fades based on the angle you view it from is commendable. The first statue unveiled in Hungary, Budapest is also made of bronze but does not have the unique features of this one located in Lugano, Switzerland. Satoshi deserves to have his statue in more countries because his invention revolutionised the world. The Mayor of Lugano Michele Foletti is taking advantage of the significance of the statue to promote his city as a crypto hub, that's creativity.    Quote from: nakamura12 on October 25, 2024, 11:28:44 PMIn my opinion, this could become a tourist attractions especially those people who are into Bitcoin and loves to travel. it's not everyday you can see an art being that is dedicated to Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin.

Hope this brings more people into Bitcoin.I guess most Bitcoiners around the location will want to see the artwork, hence it will gradually grow to become a tourist attraction. It will also be good for Bitcoin awareness because some people who have never heard about Bitcoin might become aware if they see the statue.",

Involving money but protecting the owner (supposedly).I think satoshi is currently observing what he is creating, now bitcoin is becoming common and used by users in the world even though not all, bitcoin is very useful.How easy it is to transact to different countries if people already know bitcoin, an amazing pioneer. The rest I really support various celebrations because of the enthusiasm of users who appreciate events about bitcoin and its creators.",

Since no one’s ever actually seen Satoshi, we’ll probably see all kinds of designs pop up in the future. Who knows, maybe one day there’ll even be a contest, and Satoshi might award the winner with some Bitcoin! We can’t say for sure, but these people creating Satoshi statues might just have something cool coming their way someday.",

And probably people are banking that if there is a country that will really have Satoshi's statue, it could be the first country that has accepted Satoshi's creation to be their legal tender. Not a county in Europe or any other else.So we much as well appreciate the creation of  Valentina Picozzi and I do agree that it could be a tourist spot in the country.",
