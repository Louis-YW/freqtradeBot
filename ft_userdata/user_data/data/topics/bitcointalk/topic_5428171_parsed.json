Imagine if you're stranded on a deserted island. How valuable would a gun or violence be in that scenario? Water, food and shelter would likely be your highest priorities. If you're alone or in a sparsely populated area, there will not be much competition for water, food, shelter, etc.But if you are in a densely populated area, there could be very high competition for those things. In which case a gun and violence might have greater value. I think living in a self sufficient community, with good people who organize and network could be the best security. The \"army of one\" approach and isolationism could be bad ideas. Having a lot of tough and reliable friends who produce their own food and energy, in a sparsely populated well defended area, who are well equipped and armed could be the formula for survival. Conflicts which arise will not be resolved by an army of one but rather I think barbarian hordes.",

And the development of the military-industrial complex is a good impetus for the development of the economy itself.Unfortunately, in 2022, we are seeing how fragile the world is if inadequate countries / governments have a lot of weapons, and the potential victim of their aggression is engaged in the development of civilian areas.There is one more nuance - the international system of treaties, agreements, laws - turned out to be not working. International institutions do not fulfill their duties, some do not understand at all who play into the hands and sabotage the legal processes. Criminals have veto power, criminals can block investigations against them...In a word, it is necessary to speak not about investments in air defense, but about the global restructuring of international relations, the rights of unions, the guaranteed implementation of laws and obligations. Well, yes - invest in defensive and high-tech weapons",

Thus, Russia's military aggression has given another round to the arms race, and this influence will last for several decades to come.There is another nuance here. Russia inherited the army and ideology of the USSR. It was like this - \"with a big iron fist, out of 100,500 tanks, we break through the enemy's defenses and sweep everything in our path! At the same time, we do not have unacceptable losses of both equipment and manpower.\"The concept of warfare in the West, I'm talking about NATO, is different - to save people as much as possible, to deliver strikes with the utmost precision, with minimal losses and expense. That is, the classic transition from quantity to quality. What we are actually seeing now at the front. Moreover, Russia deceived itself - puffing out its cheeks and telling tales about its weapons as \"unparalleled\" ... Hoping that everyone will believe this and be afraid to resist in the event of a confrontation. But there is another nuance here - the goals of hostilities and mativation. Russia is waging an aggressive terrorist war, akin to medieval seizures of adjacent territories. We are defending our country, our freedom, our right to live and live as we see fit. Therefore, the Russian army (regular) is demotivated and does not have a strong will, our small army and people are extremely motivated to win. This is also very important....",

Terrorist, bandits and kidnappers are everywhere and when that time comes,people might be left with no option but join these group for free access to weapons and dominance.Inflation is not the most terrible consequence of Russiaâs war on the territory of Ukraine. Violence and chaos in the world begin when the civilized world does not react in time to wars of conquest and allows the aggressor to commit violence in order, in the opinion of the world community, to avoid an even greater spread of violence. This tactic is nothing more than complacency and deception. The aggressor sees that he is allowed to commit violence and he moves on. In this case, violence spreads with even greater probability and force.If civilized states had taken decisive steps to put Putin's Russia in its place after Russia seized the Ukrainian roll-island of Crimea and territories in eastern Ukraine in 2014, there would have been no large-scale invasion of Ukraine. The West, due to its inactivity, has now reached the point where outbreaks of violence and local wars are occurring in many regions. The United States and European countries in the initial phase of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine were afraid to transfer effective weapons to Ukraine for protection, and now, because of this, they are forced to sharply increase military production in their countries and are directly preparing to defend their territory.",

Putinâs Russia wants to destroy this state and, since it has not been able to achieve military superiority on the battlefield for two years, it is relying on terror and intimidation of the civilian population. Therefore, a significant portion of missile, bomb and drone strikes are deliberately aimed at civilian targets.Russia is a terrorist country. It has always extremely cruelly suppressed and is now suppressing any resistance of the nationalities conquered over the past centuries that are part of it. Having practically no oil and gas of its own, it ruthlessly exploits the previously conquered territory and pumps out natural resources from it, and also mainly mobilizes their male population for the war with Ukraine, trying to Russify it. This does not work with Ukraine, so the cruelty in the occupied territories of Ukraine is simply off the charts.Nazi Germany was defeated in the war against the USSR largely due to their excessive cruelty to the population of the occupied territories. The same will happen with Putinâs Russia in Ukraine.",

Before this, European countries did not see any serious threat of war and were very reluctant to allocate money for defense. Now, especially recently, the situation has changed dramatically.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) notes that global defense spending in 2023 increased by 6.8% compared to the previous year to more than $2.4 trillion.In 2023, Ukraine was eighth in the world in terms of military spending, which rose 51% to $64.8 billion and accounted for 58% of total government spending. Russia's military spending increased by 24%, reaching an estimated $109 billion in 2023. This is 57% more than in 2014, when Russia illegally occupied Crimea. In 2023, Russian military spending amounted to 16% of total government spending.Ukraine's military spending in 2023 amounted to 59% of Russia's. However, during the year, Ukraine also received at least $35 billion in military aid, including $25.4 billion from the United States. Taken together, SIPRI estimates that this aid and Ukraine's own military spending are equivalent to about 91% of Russian spending. Given the recently allocated $61 billion in military aid to Ukraine, Ukraine's opposition to Russia's aggressive plans will be very serious.Moreover, military tension due to Russiaâs actions has arisen all over the world. For the first time since 2009, military spending increased in all five geographic regions defined by SIPRI. Particularly significant growth was recorded in Europe, Asia, Oceania and the Middle East.But the world is moving in the wrong direction again. Instead of improving technologies to solve the numerous problems of mankind, space exploration, thanks to countries like Russia, we are again sliding into the abyss of endless wars and the next death of human civilization...",
