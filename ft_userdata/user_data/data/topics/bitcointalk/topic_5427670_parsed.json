Even though rates have started to come down and home affordability has become the worst it’s been in my lifetime, I expect they will raise rates again. The language will probably be positive as they’ll signal increases may be done, but I believe they want to cause a recession. You have to remember the government’s overall goal is to inflict enough financial pain to get citizens on board with universal income. A soft landing doesn’t move towards that goal.",

Just a few days remaining!Really up to what the report maybe,- if it sound good, then obviously all market will have like a good short term run.- if the news is negative, probably we will see the price < $17k.Last month's CPI report though seems to be positive if I'm not mistaken and so we have some short term bump in the price.",

All that was discussed during the last FOMC minutes is they are slowing the pace of the hikes and not pivoting.So far inflation is still high. PPI came in high last Friday. The hikes are working but it will take time. So far it helped a little. It doesn’t help that the job market is just way too strong. So we don’t have any reasons to pivot just yet.",

Let's hope that nothing bad can happen after the report is published in the near future.It is impossible to expect the Fed to stop raising interest rates , inflation in the US is falling, but it is still very high, so it is inevitable that interest rate hikes will occur. But the question is whether they will go up sharply as usual or will they start lowering rates gradually, that's what we're talking about. But in my opinion, the rate hike no longer has too much impact on the market, the November rate hike did not cause bitcoin to drop as sharply as before. While the rate hike has not negatively impacted the market, with the world economy negatively affected, it is hard to expect bitcoin to recover.",

Why you care about his opinion in this field?https://www.investing.com/central-banks/fed-rate-monitorMarket expects +75 at 21.8% and +50 at 78.2% 0% for pivot this month. I guess its 0% chance for next 2-3 months.Why you care about pivot at all?",

      "body": "Elon's tweet seems to ignore that Fed has said it will raise rates, just that they will dampen the rate, though the months ahead will still see hikes. So it's not so much a question of if rates will rise, but for how long and how hard -- Fed seems to suggest it will relent, if inflation does.Bitcoin's just below 17k, which surprised me, thought the suits would be against shorting when inflation should be slowing down.Quote from: OgNasty on December 10, 2022, 07:54:42 AM~~ I believe they want to cause a recession. You have to remember the government’s overall goal is to inflict enough financial pain to get citizens on board with universal income. A soft landing doesn’t move towards that goal. I had a suspicion of this as well, that they want to see a recession. The middle class especially, and not just in US, looking at my own spending. They're not exactly hurting enough by inflation. I'm cutting back on a lot of things, even watching the energy meter more than normal, but still able to maintain most of the family lifestyle. I think they need more people -- the middle class especially -- to really hurt. Sadly, it's always the majority who will bear the brunt of that but a move towards universal income could be worth it (to me).",

A soft landing doesn’t move towards that goal. Some times I'm also forced to think this way when the government policy is always harsh on the people and they won't make things easy for the masses to benefit from but only to get increased income. The government concern more is how to increase there revenue and they make excuses for using it to finance government projects but we know that the amount that is embezzled is far greater than how much going into project. The outcome of the FED is to increase interest rate and that will cause more poverty.",

      "body": "Even if the FED raises rates, its the pace at which they have raised which matters overall.   A raise of say quarter percent would be perceived as positive overall.   Stock markets but not all markets are future facing which means they anticipate mostly the beginning of the end to the rises rather absolutely requiring no further rise in rates.   Add in that inflation itself is some adjustment to the cost of money, Ive no doubt that Dollar will continually lose value for this decade and the next.   A future cost to currency which is lower then the value now invested gives bias to stocks and performing assets.   However all of this is speculation, every shock turn in the road will upset the market but a foreseeable negative is not quite as bad.  I see some relief occurring in these next 12 months, it could start now; the emphasis being on assets which do perform.",

They probably already decided to up a notch, not a whole lot but a bit, and I am guessing that its going to just keeping going up for a while longer as well, like the next one too, just smaller and smaller measure. Until everything is back to normal with inflation, there is literally no reason for them to keep it lower, they should be increasing it more and more so that the more money goes back to banks the better. Eventually inflation will go down, and they will lower it, and people will use that to invest again. That is how it has been for a looong time, doubt that it would change anytime soon.",

FED is happy to see SBF in prison and not able to testify to congress. yay! and for holders to be happy as well, they better low interest rate too. double yay!",

This time, of course, the reaction was positive, and the surprising thing is that bitcoin reacted much earlier than the data was announced. But I think there is a lot of other bad news in the crypto market that affects the price. Today, for example, the claims against Binance started.",

Despite the FUD around binance, the market has recovered slightly with a lower-than-expected CPI, and tonight we get news of the last rate hike of the year.
