Even some rumours make situation in the crypto become so bad. I think that stock market has a very strong correlation with crypto for now. Anything that happened with stock market and then crypto will always be facing the same thing like that too. Remember that since so many big investors are coming to the crypto and that makes crypto always follow stock market.",

My question is will this have any impact on cryptocurrency projectsYes this will have a direct impact. If you watched the markets since the Covid bottom, you would have noticed that they trade side by side pretty much. Both of these markets peaked at pretty much the same time. So if the fed is still going to be raising interest rates, bitcoin and stocks will be sold off since they are risk on assets.People will be putting their money into safer alternatives. Hence the reason why the markets have been selling off for pretty much entire year. When the inflation is lower, and fed is stopping the hiking, then it means the bottom has happened or its near. And then everything will start to rally again.",

Every time there's a result or news about the FED, the market reacts so much. And it's not only with the crypto market but also with the other markets.Those traditional markets are also making their reactions and these are being played by the big players or whales. They know so much to the market that every single piece of news related to the FEDs, there's always this equal reaction to it and the same goes for the crypto market.",

There's a lot of economic issues actually, and we really have to do something about it or else we are going to deal for a longer bear market. Though global market is slowly recovering after many countries already open their boarder since the pandemic, most probably early next year we are on a better position, but for now we have to be more patient.",

The US economy for example are very vital in cryptomarket, we’ve seen a lot of negative impact as they face some economic problem. This bearish trend is an opportunity to accumulate, and it’s better if you do focus on good coins. The market will recover and this is just a temporary trend, the economy of many countries started to see some positive trend, this could be the beginning of a new bull trend.",

Investing in the crypto is pretty much the same like investing in the stock.If you have been checking the overall markets, both crypto and the stock market are in a bearish state.Quote from: JeffBrad12 on August 29, 2022, 11:53:55 PMInvesting in the crypto is pretty much the same like investing in the stock. I see no differences between both.Both are completely different, in stock market you are investing in businesses that generate profit and you get dividends while crypto you dont generate profit while hodling if its not a pos coin.This is why people are memeing people who are into crypto calling them \"crypto bro's\".",

My question is will this have any impact on cryptocurrency projectsAdmit it or not, crypto and stocks are somewhat correlated, so when stocks tumbled, crypto follow as what we have seen after this raise interest hike because it really doesn't sound good for investors. But for us, the more money is being printed then, probably some of it will go into crypto market. Not saying it's good to see it that way, money printing by the government, but they have to do something that sometimes it will benefit us.And 2-3 days after the announcement, the price seems to level around $20k'ish. At least at the end of the month we didn't see below or new lowest low as what we heard others predicting. And altcoin market too might recovered next month.",

That's why i was using acronym \"imho\". But if we would go slowly even lower then before, it would drain rest of the hope from the markets and like you said, crypto winter would last longer then ever. And naturally some people want to cash out now because inflation is eating their income and they want to cut their losses. They will probably sell the bottom, or in best case scenario they can buy cheaper. But i wouldn't buy the dip if it would go lower then before, because it wouldn't be worth my time unless i managed to leverage trade it right with high leverage. But that would be more like gambling.",

It is normal that crypto can dump more because they are more fragile or volatile than a stock which is most of the time known to be a stable asset just like a gold but dumps are a good thing for accumulation before the rise or the bull happens again.The overall market cap of crypto might be low for now compared to the stock market but time will come that it will grow and the price will be more stable which is still a good thing I believe? That way people now use their coin more in buying/paying.",
