That is why I was asking about the organizer's name. Maybe we can verify on their social media. Some well-known organizers can organize events like this so it should not be hard to check their authenticity. I saw some of the speakers wearing t-shirts with their logo on them on their social media. But the place is in a remote location and hard for someone like me to attend.",

Are you vouching for them, so you can confirm that they actually are legit. I would like to have some direction to checking the authenticity of this conference and what is the project all about, is it just a yearly conference or Bitcoin Atlantis is an educational project.Also like I said many of the speakers aren't the very knowledgeable crypto-currency speakers I would make travel to see. If I want how to grow a business advice then maybe yes but crypto related topics I won't make them my top options.",

If anyone is attending, this is the best place to bring kids ages 14 - 16 (especially those people who push Bitcoin education to kids) since kids age 16 and below are free to enter the events and the stated range of age have already a grasp of the economic activities.Â  I wonder if these kids are also included on the L3 ticket featured lists.I also think it is a good way to spend a traveling vacation while attending the Bitcoin conference, they can also visit the tourist spot of that island.Â  Hitting two birds with one stone.",

This is exclusive to local residents though. You'll have to pay at least 240 euros if you want to participate if you're the average joe. Not sure if that's worth the money since the next level costs four times as much. I guess the VIP label is really expensive for a conference like this. I can't check anything on their Twitter since I don't have an account, but it seems like the organizer is called Free Madeira. Their sponsors are also unknown to me. I'd say better wait and see before buying anything.",

You're right, that's the name of a local organization apparently empowered by the Portuguese government dedicated to the development of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Several speakers at the event are members of the organization's management.But I haven't seen confirmation from other well-known figures like Dorsey and Saylor that they will be speakers. Let's just say your goal is to have a vacation on the island instead of attending an event, that area is indeed a tourist spot.",

But if it's about the spread of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, the events they will do there are good. That's good for those who are close to that country.Also, I'm not familiar with the speakers at the venue, as long as there's only one thing I want them to do, and that's their teaching on the adoption of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. So I think that Madeira can attract more businesses and investment to that island, and at the same time, this place will also be bitcoin-friendly. And here's the link I found from Madeira anyway.https://www.freemadeira.com/",
