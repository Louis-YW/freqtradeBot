      "body": "tomorrow we will have two games:Bolivia - ArgentinaBolivia, who plays at home, comes to this game after a humiliating defeat that they suffered in their first game against Brazil, so they will strive to win or leave with at least a draw in this game against Argentina, we will see which player the coach from Bolivia will choose for the starting 11, for example abrego was the guy who scored Bolivia's only goal in the game against Brazil, the coach had chosen to put Marcelo Moreno in the starting 11 against Brazil, but Marcelo Moreno did not scored no goals, so perhaps in this game the Bolivian coach will put the abrego to play right at the beginning of the game. on the other hand, it is expected that the Argentine coach will not include Messi at the beginning of the game, because Messi suffered a blow in the game against Ecuador, it is also expected that Lizandro Martinez will not play in this gameIn my opinion this will not be an easy game for Bolivia, because even if Messi doesn't play in this game, Argentina has many other good players like Di Maria, Lautaro Martinez and others. That's why I predict Argentina's victory in this gameEcuador - Uruguay Ecuador comes to this game after a defeat they suffered against Argentina, so playing at home Ecuador will look for a victory or at least a draw in this game, while their opponent comes more confident for this game because they are coming off a convincing victory against Chile, looking at the current squad of these two teams I would say that Uruguay has a better squad and I see Uruguay coming out victorious in this gamebrazil - perubrazil comes to this game very motivated, as they won in their last game against bolivia, in a game in which brazil scored 5 goals and conceded only 1 goal. on the other hand, we have peru that arrives in this game with a draw in its last game against paraguay, in a game in which peru was playing with 10 players from the 1st half. looking at the squad of the two teams, I would notice that Brazil has the best squad and therefore I see Brazil winning this game",

Yes, it is controversialIn the past, teams suffered more, but nowadays with new discoveries, technology, faster transportation, etc., teams are able to make a good strategy so as not to suffer so much from the effects of altitudeDi María said this after the game  :Quote“The altitude is psychological,” Di María told journalists after his team's victory.SourceBrazil managed to win, but it was a very difficult gameThe new coach is very good, and I think with a few more games he'll be able to find an ideal team I could already see Brazil playing differently, playing the ball more, with more teamwork",

Don't think too much that this will be the end, because we'll still see 16 more matchdays in the CONMEBOL zone, so the current slump of teams like Uruguay can't be a full reference.",

Yes, there has Been much speculation about this, and it seems that the Bolivians have always had very good control over this, because things for them in that stadium have been very good, however I saw a very comfortable Argentina, they ran faster I Know that Bolivians scored three goals that put them second in the standings, it really is something that surprised many, because it is difficult for Bolivians themselves, and it is difficult to play in La Paz due to the lack of oxygen when you run, it's something that affects anyone, in everything the less oxygen there is in the body the less it Yields,  then in this order of ideas we can Think that Bolivia has a Slight Advantage over the Others , I don't really know how it would be Argentina's preparation to go for Peace but what they did was Something that left everyone there surprised, because no one expected them to win, in fact they expected to see the Argentinians standing still, waiting to make a good counterattack, and it was all On the contrary, I saw Bolivia in its total defense, it seemed like a match where the home team would have been Agenitna because it had arrincaondaso in the defense,  for me Argentina is at a very high level of Football to beat Argentina or Brazil, it means that It requires a lot of work, a lot of Effort and running a lot, resisting a lot, because these people run like horses and it seems like they never get tired, or like the Brazilians, they were playing in Peru and had not been able to do anything in the 90 minutes, in fact Peru They had Gotten into their Defense zone attacking and attacking, for one reason I thought they were going to win against the Brazilians,  in fact they were things that I saw Even a Neymar who did not know what to do, until his assistance Arrived and they were Able to do the Goal , But a Goal that is Worth Gold , so this type of aceotneiceimtnos are what Make a team Shine , in fact they are First in the table.Now there is Another date in October, and Brazil's next rival will be Venezuela, which by the way yesterday beat Paraguay, against all odds they did it, so with Brazil's game I do see it difficult for them to beat them, in fact if they beat them A Draw against Brazil is as if it were a real Victory.",

It is really essential to know how a team will behave playing at the altitude of the Bolivian capital, La Paz.But his answer undoubtedly shows that he is involved in the issue, the teams have learned to play against Bolivia in LA PAZ, but he is still the 12th player for the Bolivian team, what happens is that Bolivia cannot put together a Team Work, they are very weak team technically, but if they achieve cohesion they will have problems beating them at home.In summary: I am sure that Bolivia is going to the bottom of the table, However, they will win a couple of games playing in La Paz, and then they will get some draws, the other teams will not have it as easy as with these first two macht, Arg-Bra, perhaps those classified 1-2 in Conmebol in this long path of qualifications.Finally, the non-favorite teams to qualify, which are the remaining 7 with the exception of Brazil and Argentina, know that in their points accounts there are at least 4 \"safe\" points that they must get against Bolivia to be in the fight to 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification.",

For me, those that will permanently enter will be: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia. For me, they are the ones that can enter at once. , as far as I'm concerned he may be one of the main candidates to enter, so things can be seen that way, for me things with the teams can be very changeable, it may be that one of those does not qualify, the ones that do I am 100% sure that if they qualify it will be Brazil and Argentina, otherwise everything is fightable, and many things can happen, so right now Venezuela's most difficult commitment is Brazil, then Chile, because Chile is one of the strongest teams what's up.",

Back to Venezuela, Venezuela is now a different Venezuela and they can even get points from Paraguay. Have you gotten the point I mean here?Hehe, a good example you posted, but I'm still going to keep my bet on Venezuela in last place.But as I said, I hope that doesn't happen, I'd even love to see Venezuela take part in the World Cup, or at least play in the play-offs to try and get a place in the World Cup.Venezuela is going through a very big crisis in the country and that reflects on the local league, which reflects on the national team.Quote from: MAAManda on September 16, 2023, 05:30:12 PMThere's no specific reason, after looking at the composition of players from Uruguay and Colombia, I concluded that Colombia was better from any side than Uruguay.I'm also sticking with my bet on Uruguay ahead of Colombia. From what I've seen, the Uruguayan team is good, with younger players taking the place of Suarez, Cavani and Lugano.Darwin Nuñez, Piquerez and Valverde are good examples of great playersQuote from: famososMuertos on September 16, 2023, 04:28:19 PMOP, I think that the analysis expressed by the user is correct, what was said against Bolivia based on the altitude and how we had to face a bet. I also agree that Bolivia will be able to win some games and some points due to the high altitude of La Paz. Maybe the team can focus on getting those points against the \"weaker\" teams and when they play away from home, try to hold out for a draw, playing defensively. Given that 6 teams will qualify and 1 more will make the play-offs, it's a real chance for Bolivia",

Brazil currently has quite a great striker but unfortunately the players currently called up lack a midfielder who can set the tempo of the game and build forward attacks. Casemiro can be relied on but I don't really know the other midfielders. Currently Brazil is in first place in the Qualifications. But instead of discussing the match against Uruguay, it's better if we watch their match against Venezuela first.",
