Let me explain it to you graphically: see that I bolded only two words of the quote?When you put capitall letters on the internet it means you are shouting, and if you put a whole part of it in bold you are not emphasising anything other than how angry you are. Overall, lots of capital letters, all bold first part text and repetition does not help the reader's comprehension of the case other than to make it clear that the OP is very angry.",

'' clearly on one of the screenshots, how they EXPLAIN THAT ?That the $3426 is WITHDRAWABLE FUNDS and i did not got the chance to actually WITHDRAW it ?So sorry and no offense/nothing personal buddy but you are talking complete BS here in defense of BC game.So YES i have thinked about it at time of depositing and that was PRECISELY why i kept betting (because the funds were WITHDRAWABLE as per the rollover page!)And to the other '' little guy '' who posted here on above stating my way of writing elucidates that i'm ANGRY YES at last he made good use of the 2 neurons he only have on his brains: I'm ANGRY and i have THE RIGHT to be so, specially when people like BC GAME tries to STEAL MONEY from me.",

I would expect nothing less from you. @Op, lol I like the way you talk about hustling them, while you forget \"house always win\", what if in the future you lose more than $3000+ to them or any other casino? Would that be hustling?  I wonder why nobody from that casino post here to clear things up?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU9TouRnO84Always husssssssssssssssssssssslin      , always !For this end no worry my boy, remember the old saying: '' A DAY OF THE HUNTER, AND A DAY OF THE PREY ''I just try to make sure that ON MY DAY (the day of the prey) i take from them MUCH MORE than they took from me, hahahahaha     \" I SAY: GIVE N TAKE \"I learned this from father santa, man",

However if Op had scammed some people in the past, I would have stopped  the casino to pay him anything and would have requested for confiscation of his balance to make the victim(s) whole.  Otherwise have some decency when you are judging people \"you don't know\".Do you also say this to fulfill your post count requirements? I don't think I need to add anything more to what Plaguedeath has said in this regard.
