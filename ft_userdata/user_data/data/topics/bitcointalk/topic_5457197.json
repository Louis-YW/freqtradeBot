But more recently, they've slightly shifted focus to also include ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin's base layer. Basically, you can buy ordinals using the Lightning network (which automatically includes holders of USDT, WBTC or ETH on other chains).In the near future, I can see this as being a user-friendly way to build digital collectible markets on Bitcoin. Something like OpenSea, but much more elegant in its design and denominated in BTC.I thought it was an interesting concept, so I wrote an article about it.

At last Bitcoin blockchain is now a level up considering it is one of the oldest. The whole idea of NFT was to help graphic designers as of now it has become a shit concept.

I am not blaming anyone here I am pointing out the pain area which caused the whole issue. If you disagree with my argument then it is your choice. I only know what was the reason and how it was done. In the future, we might see another situation similar to what we experienced a few months back. At that time will you still say the same thing?",

I also believe that if Bitcoin makes a new all time high by 2024 or 2025, ordinals will bring massive profits for the investors.There is a lesson I have learnt in crypto space since 2018, the most hated new innovation in crypto space always make the newest millionaires in a new bull market, are we going to keep doing this? We said the same when meme coins was new, it's how we missed Shiba, I know that after the massive pump there is a chance that such innovation won't matter anymore, but let's ride the waves together in order to get more Bitcoin in the end. Ordinals is a new opportunity to get good numbers of Bitcoin in coming bull market, it could happen, all the hates on memecoin in 2020 failed to stop billions of dollars flowing into them, be wise, this crypto space is speculative area, follow where new money is heading",
