  "content": "Competition can be said to be a sequence of events in which companies, organizations or firms(small and big alike) that produce similar goods and or services try to outsmart, outwit each other to ultimately come out on top of the bunch. A healthy competition in a free market is essential to a growing functioning economy and without a healthy competition, there is bound to be a monopoly in the production of goods and rendering of services. These are some characteristics of competition;1. A healthy competition should always be neutral and un-biased. 2. Competition is constant and ceaseless as it goes on all the time. We all indulge in competition whether knowingly or unknowingly 3. Competition is universal, common and all embracing as it goes on all over the world. In my view, there are more advantages than disadvantages with competition in a free market. Here are some pros;1. It definitely fuels innovation, growth and progress2. It brings about creativity and also increases productivity 3. A healthy competition definitely favors the consumers as it helps lower prices and increases the quality of goods4. It fuels innovation which in turns brings about varieties and new ideas5. It brings about decent pricing in the production of goods As with pros, there are also cons. 1. As a small and growing business, you’re bound to lose business to bigger and stronger firms when there’s a strong competition 2. Competition pose a threat to a small business as they could pack up and close up shop3. A competition could very well turn into a conflict especially if it’s an unfair competition with undue advantage to one side. Generally, competition is very essential in a free market and without competition, there would be monopoly in the production of goods and rendering of services. And when there’s a monopoly, small business and start ups are destined to fail.",

Without lack of competition in markets is associated moreso with centralization.There is a long history of precedents for both movements. Which is usually not covered by youtubers and financial advisors. I can't claim to have read an overwhelming amount on the topic. From what I have seen, there are many things that become evident in terms of content. Its very uncommon for mistakes of the past to be acknowledged or remembered. The generation gap prevents knowledge from being transmitted from older generations to younger ones. People tend to assume its solely the responsibility of schools and educators to fill the gap. One thing that is certain is our greatest inventions and technological achievements were products of competition. Things like Einstein's Theory of Relativity may have been partially motivated by competition between nations involving wartime eras of World War I and World War II. While lack of competition can also be strongly associated with lack of achievement and progress.",

People compete and then get jealous the feeling of jealous is killing. I am always very inviting to the the people who want any help from me but I have noticed people are mostly jealous It might not be jealousy that's pushing them to do it but greediness can be one of the reasons why they do it. Monopoly still exist in other countries and sometimes we can't do anything about it if they play it well using different marketing strategy. Only the people can stop them if they really want that monopoly to continue or not.Even if you made a unique business there are people who still want to copy your business but if you have an idea how to not easily bypass/copy your business then use a secret recipe that only you know whether it's food businesses or the other.",

Small businesses will be eaten by the bigger competitors and that's why if you're a business and your niche is also a niche of a bigger enterprise. You better prepare yourself of competing with a better branding and for working harder with what you offer. Because if that is so, there's a chance that the bigger competitor will offer you some good deal.",

When mobile phones were introduce in my country, the first and only mobile communication provider sold their simcards for about 60 dollars. Now we have about seven providers competing for a fair share of the market and the price is less than a dollar now.But sometimes the benefits and beauty of open and competitive market is limited through the formation of trade unions and other pressure groups. With this they can determine the price of their goods and services, hence enjoying the benefits of monopoly. They sometimes lobby the government and influence them to make certain laws that harms the populace because of their selfish interest",

And when there’s a monopoly, small business and start ups are destined to fail. COVID restrictions really widened the gap between large corporations and small businesses unfortunately. Larger corporations had a lot more capital on hand to spend in order to comply with COVID restrictions, and the small businesses were the ones that had to close up shop. Free market economics doesn't necessarily account for large corporations and the power they have by virtue of their mass amounts of capital - the only silver lining is that corporations must compete with other corporations which makes it a fair fight. It isn't merely a corporation competing against small businesses.",

But there will be alternatives, and this is a big industry now. Instead of oil they use electricity now and I have seen a lot of electric vehicles in my neighborhood. I guess the oil price hike did affect them by a lot and so they changed their way of transportation. Speaking of transportation, there's also a big change in this business. People who had been using motorcycles are now using bicycles to save money, so I guess that business is growing in demand too. I think competition will also depend on the economic needs. Like right now because of inflation we have to be thrifty, so we use things that does not require daily spending. i.e. gas",

And when there’s a monopoly, small business and start ups are destined to fail. What you said is fairly true and also common sense as we've seen from decades of reasonably free market activity. However it does have a few caveats - it only works if there is a strong government in place which is able to defy lobbyist type activity, which in the most ruthless free markets will have corporations trying to create rules that purely benefit themselves. Corporations exist for decades and centuries, politicians are lucky if they can hold power for a few years, so there is a slight disadvantage in that respect - they have longer timescales to plan \"attacks\". Another is that it's possible, at least in some countries, that things like water or power generation could potentially be better managed by the government because there is such a monopolistic trait inherent to their operation.",

A healthy competition is extremely important for business and it affects prices alot as everyone wants to increase its sales in market and for that they keep prices in range. Competition helps to extend  market size and to get rid of monoply.And we know this is true because we have seen what happens when this is not the case, in communist countries there is a lack of competition and innovation as most businesses belong to the state, and as such there is not really any incentive to be creative there and very quickly they are left behind in terms of technology by capitalist economies, one of the most obvious examples of this was the automobile industry in which some of the worst cars ever produced all come from communist countries.",
