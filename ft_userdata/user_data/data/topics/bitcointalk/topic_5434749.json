People even sell in the bear market at a loss, there will always be someone who wants to sell his bitcoins and someone who wants to buy, that’s why it’s a market. If hypothetically no one is willing to sell and there are buyers in the market, the high demand will increase the price of bitcoin.

For that to happen, it would have to be poorly distributed among only a handful of holders, because they'd have to agree with each other to hold and not to sell until a certain price point is reached (or not sell at all).But if it ever gets to the point that there are only a small number of holders - that would mean that there was no demand and people, in general, decided to get rid of their bitcoins, meaning the price would rather be at very low levels. Plus, as mentioned above, if there's no active market - there's no value. And if people can't buy it, they'll shift their interest to something else.What we will see though, are situations where demand exceeds supply forcing the price up. So you'll most likely always be able to buy 'some' bitcoins but not necessarily at the desired price.",

This is unlikely happen, though there's a small chance that might be happened if there are no altcoins around. When the supply keeps reducing the price also keeps increasing, so might people will hard to accumulate in the future and those who hold now that has a targeted profit will also sell their Bitcoin, so it's called trading and that's how the market works now, besides from Bitcoin there are too many alternatives that people might choose. That's why Bitcoin was created for the main purpose of electronic payment system, not storing value.",

Good question, but human nature tell us that at some point, there will be individual that is more willing to sell for good profit. So there could be that person going to hold for a long time until such time that they will think of selling it.So it's the basic supply and demand, less supply, more demand means price is going to pump. But in the future, there are sellers and so obviously there will also be buyer willing to purchase regardless of what the price is.",

In fact, what people are trading is a number on exchanges. They don't really trade Bitcoin or altcoins which are in exchanges' hot or cold wallets. What they see in their account balances are also number, not real Bitcoin or altcoins. They only have actual Bitcoin or altcoins after they request a withdrawal and get approved by exchange to proceed it for them.It does not happen too often but at some points especially with pump and dump altcoins, you can see their 24hr trading volume suddenly is bigger than their total marketcap.You can think further from your question, why do institutional investors pay their attention on Bitcoin and spend their investment funds for Bitcoin firstly when they join the cryptocurrency market?It's because Bitcoin has biggest trading volume in cryptocurrency market that makes their entries and exits more easily than altcoins and with less impacts on price than on altcoins.",

How long can one hold Bitcoin.?The buying and selling cycle on the Exchange will continue to occur every day, you can buy Bitcoin whenever you want. The circulation of bitcoins can be reduced if one of the whales loses access or he dies, Bitcoin will continue to be stored in his wallet if other people cannot get the private key to enter there.Bitcoin can still be bought by anyone over the last decade, it is very unlikely that someone can't buy Bitcoin. The goal of buying Bitcoins is not how long you can hold them, you will release Bitcoins when the cloud turns bright, because the goal is to profit from it.",

For a market to exist, there has to be a willingness to buy and also to sell, without this there is no trade and no value. For there to be no Bitcoins available for sale, there has to be a high level of centralization among holders for such a consensus to be reached, that is like asking, \"if bitcoin can ever be $1 again if all the holders choose to sell at that price?\"Quote from: CryptoPanda on January 14, 2023, 10:40:06 PMSuch a scenario is very unlikely.

Everyday Bitcoin's circulation supply will increase because there's always a miner who mine Bitcoin, actually it's make more sense will the miners stop to contribute on the network when all of Bitcoin already been mined? this because the fees will be very high since the miners are make money from holders who create transactions, not from mining anymore.",

I don't think it's possible for someone to keep hodling Bitcoin forever at a point some issue will definitely force the hodlers to sell off his/her coin even if the price keeps increasing exponentially you will still see those that are going to sell their for one reason or another; some night sell due to the fact that they are scared that the price might drop so out of FOMO they'll sell off their coin. And again we still have some decent exchange that are still going to be operational if a time like this ever comes so you will be able to buy from an exchange directly though the exchange might decide to alter the price since no one is willing to sell theirs.",
