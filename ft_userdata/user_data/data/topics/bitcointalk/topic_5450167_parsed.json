Most of the time, this issue is caused by wallet updates. If your trust wallet app needs some updates, it might affect the synchronization of transactions. After you have successfully updated your app, those past transaction histories do appear. But I have come across some posts on this forum where users experience such issues, and wallet updates are never the cause of them. If you are always encountering such issues, I will advise you to use your phrase and import your wallet using Electrum, either mobile or desktop. It will help you trace both unconfirmed transactions and all incoming transactions.",

And of course I thought it could only happen to me. Since this is not the case and after having read all the threads about Trustwallet on this forum, I thought it was important to post it in the beginner section: first of all, we don't really understand the reason, it's not a synchronization problem otherwise it would concern all the transactions, but not all the transactions don't appear, it's still random, and finally, it seems that no one has the answer to this mystery But I understand that Electrum looks great (for the moment I have a lot of trouble understanding how it works).The beginners may panic if they don't see any incoming transactions.

I highly advice you both to:Post both of your issues on their Reddit sub[1] as mentioned before. Trust Wallet doesn't seem to have any kind of official presence here but there's a staff member in Reddit - rakib0020[2] - that seems to pop up every now and then to support users with problems.After solving all your issues - mostly the one reported by goldkingcoiner - you should consider another wallet, preferably an open source one. Not only is Trust Wallet a closed source wallet, it is also from Binance[3] which is the largest CEX out there.[1]https://safereddit.com/r/trustapp[2]https://safereddit.com/user/rakib0020[3]https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-trust-wallet",

About Trustwallet, as I've heard, they're buggy wallets when it comes to transactions and you can get a delay notification. And their explanation about that which somewhere I read but I didn't remember, said that the notification process for transactions on the blockchain network isn't controlled by Trust Wallet, but rather by the underlying blockchain network itself, meaning to say that no single entity has control over the network and transactions are verified and recorded by nodes on the network.",

It's strange and does happen to someone else too.From my experience, sometimes Trust Wallet background process got killed by my phone saving feature so if there is a new transaction there won't be any notification. You might want to check your device saving feature, but keep in mind that changing settings/adding the app to a whitelist doesn't really help for whatever reason. This is not always true though, since sometimes it doesn't give any notification too even if I open the app and close it for a few minutes. At the end of the day though Trust Wallet is just not reliable and good enough if you want to use it as your main wallet.",
