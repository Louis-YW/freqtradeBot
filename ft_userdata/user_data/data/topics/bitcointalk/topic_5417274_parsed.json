Many projects raised millions of dollars but that's it, they keep the money to themselves, I am not an expert in this field but projects that want to be successful needs to spend money on getting their names on billboard, popular website as ads, even search engines, every corners that news can get to people faster.2. Separating your project from the crypto hoards means you must have something new to offer, a new utility that solves big problems in crypto space, before a project is born an idea must be created, sit down and look at the problems affecting crypto right now and create something we haven't seen before.3. It's your choice as a developer, KYC is a no no situation for me and it doesn't mean many cares like I do, hundreds of projects still introduce KYC today and people still join their platform, It's hard to get rid of KYC in crypto space, not even now that regulation news is everywhere.4. That's one thing about crypto world and innovation, no matter how young you are the world doesn't care, we only care about the ideas that can change everything, give us something that works and we will follow you as a big community, age is just a number my friend.5. Utility, Team level of experience, fund management, tokenomics,Â  marketing ideas ðŸ’¡",

It sounds nice for sure, but I bet there are some devs out there who claimed that they already did the same thing but get no results.I think a promise or tagline of something similar is worthless. Showing them that your product already works, with open-source code and continuous development is more appealing, at least for me.",

      "body": "There are far too many scams in ICOs and crypto investments, investors are now much more careful and aware of the potential risk. This is a good thing, but it also means that this has made it harder for companies to raise funds, especially those that have legitimate business ideas. Therefore, it will be very important to give potential investors enough information. Investors want to see that you have made an effort to present a professional image of your project and to convince them with all the available materials. Because quite honestly, a large number of ICOs are launched by people that do not really need blockchain or distributed ledger technology. They simply want to take advantage of the hype and get some quick funding before their useless project fails. The best way to reach investors is to post your pitch on ICO sites and other crypto investment forums, this will give you a good chance to get some publicity for your project. See it as exposure, not promotion. The worst thing you can do is try to cash in quickly and not really have a plan or work towards the projects completion. If you are open and honest with your potential investors, you will be surprised at how many people can help you out. It's all about building the trust first. You are asking them for their hard-earned money, so show them that you are worth giving that money to.",

Developers must surprise crypto investors with the usefulness of their project and the need for a blockchain, something that did not exist before. There is no need for developers to hide their identities. In addition, talking about their experience and projects in which they have previously participated can increase the level of investor confidence. And also, if we talk about trust in age, you can remember the age of Vitalik Buterin, at which age he created Ethereum.",

If you've gotten the utilities aspect covered, marketing would depend on your budget and target audience. Popular social platforms for crypto discussions would be a go to place, such as bitcointalk, Reddit, Twitter etc. Announcing your project there would be a good approach.Getting an influencer user to promote your project is expensive, but effective. Investors are easily influenced and would easily follow the suggestion of a supposed influencer, without doing their research.2. Communicate. Once you've built a sort of Community, you need to communicate with them effectively and also listen to the community.Transparency is also an all important factor in building investor confidence.3. If you're not required by law to provide it, then do not If you are, have clear terms and how users can request their details be deleted and open policy on what 3rd party has access.4. Definitely.5. â€¢ Product (with real world utility),â€¢ Team,â€¢ Marketing,â€¢ Developing (reaching your roadmap milestones)â€¢ Looking to improve",

What's the best marketing strategies to be taken in order to launch your own Crypto Project, With real Utilities and broad developmentGet a functional platform and good manager for your project. A manager that can explain the aim and objective of the crypto project just the same way you will do. Do lots of giveaways, bounties and airdrops also engage people in weekly tasks to earn your coin or tokenQuote2. What's the best means of separating yourself from the Multitude of project developers out there. By showing off to investors that you're here for them and this is who you are. Totally different from the mode of operandi of countless dev out there. As you stay committedFirst be as decentralised as possible that way you are maintaining the integrity of the project as well as its security. Quote3. Having spent time reading about the disadvantages of KYC by one of the senior Bitcointalk moderator. What's the best options or step to take by projects developers and owners in relationships towards this aspect.This is what the blockchain came to solve. Why KYC is encouraged in the centralised system because of lack of trust the blockchain solves this by implementing a public ledger system to keep all transaction public thereby eliminating third party which is a key factor of KYCs.Quote4. Will a project be considered by investors as potential. if it's launched by a person under the age of 30s. Does age matter? What really counts is how much trust the project has around the crypto space and it will take a whole lot to achieve this trust.Quote5. What are the factors to be considered before launching a projectYour white paper should be as explanatory as possible. Ensure implementing consensus mechanism that will ensure decentralisation.",

Depends on the investors. Actually anything on crypto can be accepted and its not about the age of developer but the skills he can deliver during the work progress. Some even teenagers can do massive things on blockchain. As long as they can do the job done then they can be trusted. Some investors only care about skills and not the reference on CV.Â  Thats the difference with the crypto space.",

What's the best marketing strategies to be taken in order to launch your own Crypto Project, With real Utilities and broad developmentIf you want to create a \"product\" then you would create a completely useless token and sell it to gamblers and make profit. In this case you need marketing which is pretty much any type of advertisement you can think of from signature campaigns on bitcointalk to ads on social media.Obviously this is referred to as a shitcoin and dies soon.But cryptocurrencies are not products to need marketing. If they have a utility they will be adopted automatically. Think of how bitcoin works. Nobody advertised bitcoin but the adoption is increasing simply because it provides a real utility that people need in real world.Quote2.

Having spent time reading about the disadvantages of KYC by one of the senior Bitcointalk moderator. What's the best options or step to take by projects developers and owners in relationships towards this aspect.KYC is defined for centralized projects/services not anything that is decentralized like bitcoin.Quote4. Will a project be considered by investors as potential. if it's launched by a person under the age of 30s. Nobody knows how old Satoshi is and yet people adopted it.Quote5. What are the factors to be considered before launching a projectYou have to ask yourself \"what new thing am I bringing to the table\". If you are rehashing the same ideas by copying another project then you are creating another shitcoin.P.S. all your questions are very disappointing because you are asking things that are irrelevant to creating a new project with potential.Some real questions would be:What innovations do you have in mind?What problems does your project solve and how?What cryptography algorithms are you going to use and why?Is there any similar cryptocurrencies to your project and what difference are you going to make?",
