Your secrets like your seed phrase are encrypted. But how did he manage to know the balance? I thought that the seeds and private keys are encrypted using AES-256-CBC, and therefore if you only have the file and without a password, you will not be able to know your balance.@OP since you did not use any program to generate a strong password, it is probably one of the passwords that you use most often, or at least part of it.If you can know the length of the password or exclude things that cannot be in that password, then your options will be greatly reduced.You can contact WalletRecoveryServices walletrecoveryservices@gmail.comhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=130960http://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/",

This means you can open the wallet file and view the addresses, balance, and transaction history, but cannot spend anything without the password.I would add that taking advice from accounts with zero trust asking you to message them privately is incredibly high risk. You can very easily set up and run btcrecover yourself, and you can get all the advice you need to do that in public on this thread.",

I then put a password I know into the password list and tried running BTCRecover to see if it could find my password, but it couldn't find it.
