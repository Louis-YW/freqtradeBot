  "content": "I want to write a javascript-based monero mining algorithm. The libraries I saw on Github were written with reference from a site, and the algorithms that work by paying a commission to that site.I want a library that does not get references from any site and the profits will be 100% mine.Do you know of a library like this?My other question: How can I write my own javascript based monero mining algorithm from scratch? Any lesson, training set, book, etc. about what I want. I couldn't find it. If there is a training set that explains in this way, can you write it?Thank you in advance.",

      "body": "So, you're trying to host a javascript-mining website that uses your visitors' resources to mine and send the profits to your address? Or are you trying to run your own cloud mining service? Both of them are terrible services and most of the time is known for scams. I'll try to be positive here and not jump to conclusion that you want to build a malware site that tricks visitors to mine with their computers.If you do find a free mining script, I won't be surprised if it runs other malicious scripts without notifying you. Your best bet is probably to commission some developer to build the script for you. If you want to mine and earn Monero without doing any of that, just mine with a rig and mining software.Quote from: Zaukrut on February 25, 2023, 09:35:56 PMMy other question: How can I write my own javascript based monero mining algorithm from scratch? Any lesson, training set, book, etc. about what I want. I couldn't find it. If there is a training set that explains in this way, can you write it?Well, you will need to know some Javascript at least. There is no dedicated book/article that explains it since mining script is a niche program compared to other Javascript applications. If you don't want to learn from the big picture, your best option would be to find an existing Javascript mining algorithm software and then learn from there. Find out what this or that function does, ask around if you don't understand the flow of the algorithm, etc.",

      "body": "I remember during the last bull market (2017) many websites, including PirateBay decided to get rid of ads and instead would mine some crypto using 1 core of the browsers CPU. They assumed that it would be better for the user experience because there would be no more ads, site would be cleaner and using only 1 core wouldn't result in too much strain on the system.Basically everybody ended up hating it and they stopped using peoples CPUs to mine and went back to ads. Another reason is that its HIGHLY inefficient to use a browser mining code compared to standalone software miner. So most likely the profits were horrible so they get rid of it.",

I just want to code the monero mining algorithm from the basics in a simple level. An article, tutorial, showing how to write a monero mining algorithm from scratch in another language even if not Javascript (I want to write a mining algorithm with no commission to any site, 100% mine profits). Do you know the training set?",
