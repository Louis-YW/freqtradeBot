Besides, I don't know what you mean by fake bull. I think we are going to stay in the $17k-$30$ zone for a few months at least. I wouldn't call it a fake bull if it goes up a little bit now and then goes down. More like normal oscillations within a kind of sideways after reaching the bottom.",

But be it bull trap or not, if you want to hold for long, you can buy bitcoin now, hold it for long like 3 years and you will make profit. Only swing traders can be affected if they buy. But no one knows if the price will increase more before the price will decrease again but better to be on the safer side if not investing for long.",

As for me, it's still a long way to go before we start talking about fake bull. I think what you're seeing right now is just a part of the market moving sideways until the next bullrun. It's not too late to buy at these prices.",

We intend to see these traps that just happen to liquidate the shorts and then the actual short is about to come once everyone has been squeezed already. And about being late to buy, you're the only one that can answer it because you're the one who's got the plan to hold for long or not. So if you're short then when it's up, you shouldn't buy it. But if you don't mind holding for long then you'll just do what you usually do and that's to buy until the real bull run comes.",

Probably a good temporary long position.It may be fake bulish, but I agree some weeks we have a price drop and some days we go sideways. So it is natural that if there is a price increase, the disposal has saturated its time to collect again. I think we should look tomorrow for confirmation of whether it will be able to break through the 22,500 price high after the bearish phase. Perhaps if it manages to appear cndle confirmation bulish the next price may be around $28k. But stay alert bearish waves can still occur, be careful with fake rebounds, maybe you are safe if you use the Stop loss feature.",

A candle close above ~$22.5k preferably with decent volume would be a signal for me that we are ready to move to the next resistance - perhaps the $28k level. But the type of confirmation you wait for (horizontal break, ema intersection, stochastic cross, etc.) should be subjective to your own trading strategy.",

So do not expect much while bitcoin is even hard to sustain its $21k-$22k price range. But one thing is certain, those who have bought bitcoin below $20k have been making small profits already, that is if they are now selling. But it would create a bigger profits in the next couple of months if they prefer to hold more their bitcoin.",

This is true and we know that there are different types of traders whether its a long term holder or short time or active traders which these movements are indeed relevant for them to make some action.For those who do able to get in even on just 19k price few days ago on where making profits on the current price is definitely still a solid one since we are already 23k+ as of this writing whichisnt bad for a profit right? For those who had accumulate for long term then these movements wont really be that much of an issue thats why i have said that there are different types which would end up on different dealings and decisions to be made whenever the market do make out some positive movement.",

Well, there's no wrong in selling early as long as you never sell for a loss, and the hope that you'll buy back again once bitcoin turns cheaper again. However, i am not certain with the current price surge because anytime it could drop again and end up as a bull trap. So to avoid regrets, might as well let's continue to hold our bitcoin and only sell them if the market bull run has totally appear.",
