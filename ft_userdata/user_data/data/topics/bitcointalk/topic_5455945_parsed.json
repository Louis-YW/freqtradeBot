  "content": "Did the title sound a bit awkward? Oops ðŸ˜¬, the content may be better. hello folks, A lot is happening already, with the SEC and their issues with Bitcoin; we already heard that Binance was charged on June 5 and Coinbase as well; then bla bla bla. It will really be a regrettable situation if your coins get jacked through any centralized platform that you used to carry out your Bitcoin transactions, probably because you were too lazy to look up the important stuff like T&C update and other updates. That aside. How often do you check if there are any changes or updates on the platform you are using? Well, on one of the platforms I use for some Bitcoin transactions, I saw something like this on the image below, and I was surprised, because since I stated using Bitcoin, no platform has publicly drop down a notification like that on their home page, stating that there is an update on the terms and conditions. For these reasons, I have decided to remind us to be very vigilant and try to check if the platform you are using has any slit changes in T&C to avoid a situation where your assets will be at risk.It was just a quick reminder, and I hope it's beneficial to at least a many users here. Thanks for taking the time to read or take a snippet ðŸ˜œ.Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",

With this mind, they think their coins will be safe and they don't mind to check their accounts after long time. With those people, reading ToS, following its changes are something impossible.Following it regularly is good but not enough, because they can announce changes and shut down their platforms. Therefore following thisReminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

I think in general it only contains a few points such as: Responsible management, deposit and withdrawal, additional security, verification, etc.",

This means we need to periodically read these terms of service because there might be some changes that might affect users negatively. But I am pleased to see such a platform making such an open announcement which means they are open to their customer.Quote from: Despairo on June 10, 2023, 03:24:35 PMAny centralized exchanges will always tightening their rules at least once time per year and you will not know which rules they added because they didn't state the difference of the old and new terms.

Customers need to know when there are changes so they will have to check if they are comfortable with the exchange or not. But decentralized exchanges also have terms of service so even if they don't require KYC we still have to read these rules and these no KYC exchanges can also change some rules.",

Even for gambling platforms also more users just create an account and make a deposit then play. on the exchange platform, it might be even stricter with the KYC required but not many will pay attention to all the ToSs that are warned from the start of the account creation.but to keep up with updates from existing notifications, it might still be difficult to see the difference in points added or replaced. it requires understanding to re-read the whole thing, and we still likely won't know the difference.",

However, as you say, it's clear that people rarely read them. Whether it's for CEX, or for online casinos, many don't care and come to complain when these conditions are applied to them.Just look at the dozens of messages from people complaining about KYC and other AML document requests when attempting to withdraw large amounts in the Gambling section of the forum; everything is written in the TnCs but they don't read them and then come crying to have to provide justifications.Sometimes I think some people would sign dangerous documents without reading them, when you see how they behave online.",

This is a very serious question to ask. The first question should have been: how many of us usually read through an entire T&C before we use any platform service? If I am to be honest, I will rate myself at 1/4. All I do on every platform I enter is check their withdrawal limit and deposit limit; those are the things I usually check, and when I am done with that, I barely look at the rest.So talking about checking the T&C more often for me to see if it's been updated or not, I don't actually do that, which I know is very risky even for a non-crypto platform, but it's also considered very important. But if things are to be done the right way, platforms are meant to either send a notification either by mail or whatever means they will use to reach out to their customers regarding their updated T&C, even if the user might actually not find it interesting to read, or an auto pop-up when an already existing user revisits the platform. This will go a long way and might attract us to check through it again.",

The funny thing with some of these exchanges,is that they will do a little change in their ToS and might not even write to you or put it where every user can read it but only on their ToS. If you are such user that is lazy to read or feel reluctant to always check their ToS,you might go against the new updates. Avoid any regrets from exchanges,and always visit their ToS regularly,if you are the type that can't do without these centralized exchanges",
