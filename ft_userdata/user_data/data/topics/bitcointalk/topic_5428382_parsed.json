  "content": "On their Twitter, Bitmain announced a new gift, a 13% enhancement in efficiency for the S19 pro, of course, Christmas is not here yet and you have to wait till the 20th of Dec to get it.It would be fun to watch how the new update will perform, is it going to be 25.5w/th at the same default hashrate of 100-110th? or something like the custom firmware out there, maybe 60-70th to get to that 25w/th mark? if it's really 2500w/100th that would be a huge improvement, and of course, fuel for mining difficulty.",

The currently listed firmware for hydro models on their firmware page is from Dec 15th, 2022. https://imgur.com/a/0vVM401I don't have any hydros, but those who do might be able to provide more details on efficiency improvements.",

Voltage and frequency!!I wouldn't say they beat the aftermarket firmware, the report I saw shows the best efficiency at 25w/th with about 20% loss in the total hashrate, Artemis3 mentioned 20w/th, I am sure Vnish folks would probably report similar numbers, of course, you still need to consider the dev fees you pay for those two versions, but auto-tunning will always beat static figures in term of efficiency.IMO, S19 pro is pretty much effienct by default, the efficiency gains will affect the total earnings for most people with low power rates, a 20% loss in hashrate or even 10% is no joke, it will be good for those who pay higher rates, some serious maths need to do before choosing whether to go for the upgrade or not, the same math that needs to be done when choosing to go custom or not, different things work differently for different people.Quote from: PopoJeff on December 20, 2022, 08:21:32 PMSaw the Twitter last night.  Just signed into Bitmain and only firmware I'm seeing is from 12/15 for the Hydro.There is no need to sign in, just go to https://shop.bitmain.com/support/download select S19 pro or S19j pro, the latest firmware has (Support S19 Pro low power mode) in it with publish date 19-12-2022.",
