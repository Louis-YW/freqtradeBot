  "content": "I was going through the events of the KING ðŸ‘‘ OF ENGLAND CORONATION AND THE ENGLISH RITUALS THAT COMES WITH IT, then I noticed a group of people protesting against the age long practice of the English monarchy system. Ordinarily is something that I would have just taken note of and move on without giving it a second thought, but something kept ringing in my head about the fact that, this protest is really uncalled-for.Our today's society, give much credence to civilization, wokeness and liberalism, which have made a lot of people to look down on aged long traditional Â and cultural values we've inherited from our forebears.I remember the story of the Ethiopian monarch his imperial majesty Haile SelassieðŸ‘‘ Â the King of kings (as referred to by some), the head of state, the head of the government with all the legislative and executive powers all in his hand, Haile Selassie was literally worshipped.But today if you go to Ethiopia, that system is no longer in practice, because that system has been abolished and laws have been made to suit the current social formation.Though British government today, runs a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system of government, which allows citizens to vote for whoever that will represent them at the parliament.So far. The citizens have enjoyed the benefits of a first class world country, so to say, Â and they are among the best country in the world a lot of people wish to visit or migrate to, all this was made possible as result of this age long monarchical system that has rich ancestral heritage working side by side with the parliamentary system.https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/05/06/uk/king-charles-anti-monarchy-protest-arrests-ckc-gbr-intl/index.html",

I have lived a comfortable life in my country but disrespect for fundamental human rights has been my major reason for desiring to migrate. I was pleased that these protesters were not manhandled or beaten by the police and I am sure that they have been released from detention by now. You cannot find such respect in my fatherland. These protesters want the monarchy to be scrapped for the following reason:1. The royal family or system is expensive to maintain: In 2022 it is believed that they cost taxpayers Â£86m. The cost of Queen Elizabeth's funeral has not been published but It was also reported that the Queen Mothers's burial in 2002 cost the UK about $5 million. The protesters feel that this money can be channeled to other important sectors. 2. Exemption from tax: The Royal family is one of the richest in the world yet they enjoy exemption. They can just decide to pay voluntary tax if they wish. 3. Outdated: Some of these protesters believe that the monarchical system has no place in modern society. 4. Corruption: The royal family was seen as a standard for morality and good behavior. But recently we have seen corrupt and immoral behavior exhibited by top members of the royal family.",

      "body": "In our time, the old monarchy has become a sham with very limited functions and powers. The credit for this goes back to civilisation, which raised awareness of individual human rights. Among those monarchies, for example, is the British Kingdom, which has ruled the throne of England (with its colonies) for centuries, and also the oldest royal family in history, whose origins extend back to before the fourth century AD and is still ruling today in both Morocco and Jordan. All of these monarchies have had their powers limited and honorary functions have been compiled through which they cannot reoccur in power.There are modern monarchies that still practice rule by the system of ancient times, and we find them, especially in the Gulf countries, all of them possessing all powers in exchange for indifference to any of the human rights charters in the era of globalization.Quote from: Die_empty on May 07, 2023, 02:41:37 PMI have always desired to live in a country where there is freedom of speech and expression and Britain is such a kind of society.

I am very sorry to hear this, and I feel it very much, because I live in the same situation in my country, which does not respect the basic freedoms of individuals, although its republican system is based on institutions, not individuals.This is difficult to change in a short time. I encourage you to migrate at the first opportunity you get.",

Rather much millions of dollars that could be channeled to other issues for common good of the majority of the citizens are spent on maintaining the royal familyÂ  at the expense of tax payers money and this is what the protests is all about. Cutting down expenses wouldn't be a bad idea for the general good.",

Those protesters should understand that, the royal family has been in existence long before now, asking them to start paying tax in system that was made possible through their effort and historical wealth of ownership, is something not tangible.The world is changing and any society that refuses to embrace it will face serious problems. The monarchs were the rulers of the United Kingdom. Before the Queen or King was both the head of state and head of government. Today they are just the ceremonial head and the Prime Minister and the Parliament control the government. The royal family didn't create any legal wealth in the UK. As an African, I find discussion about the source of wealth of Britain painful. It reminds us of slave trade and exploitative colonialism. We are still expecting the royal family to apologize and compensate Afriacns for the atrocities that committed. Quote2. It is been said that, if you know your history, then you will know where your coming from,Â  how do you establish a modern society without a historical background, you can only build on the existing social history and make some modifications, which the family has been doing, they are not directly involved in politics of the parliament.No doubt the royal family is a symbol of the United Kingdom. And it is the most popular royalty in the world. They generate millions of pounds yearly for the UK government through tourism. Not to worry, the number of these protesters is few. Many UK citizens still appreciate the presence of the royal dynasty.",

So to just wake up and see a group of people protesting about a change in the system of government is something uncalled for, because for me, what would have been the most concern is having a system of government that is actually working for the interest of the people (whether Federalism or Monarchy), as that doesn't matter, in as much they are able to provide the needed basic amenities, (roads, electricity and shelter) for it's citizens and also create job opportunities. That's all that matters.",
