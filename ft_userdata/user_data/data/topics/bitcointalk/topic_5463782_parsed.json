Bitcoin is fully decentralized and that doesn't make it an anonymous coin.",

If you're really concerned about your privacy then using a bitcoin mixer might help you a lot, it mixes (as the service suggests) your coins with other coins so that the link to your target address is broken.",

There are fully anonymous chains (the most famous one is monero) too but they are not as widely adopted as bitcoin. It is because we still have to pay taxes and the government wants to know who their business partners are ( the taxpayers) KYC is becoming huge lately and anonymous chains like monero are dying off slowly. (pretty sad imo) In the end bitcoin's semi-anonymity will help it to survive through this mess. Would it be better if the government banned crypto completely? At least we still can trade and do business with bitcoin.",

Moreover now where ever you go, which service you use, you are asked for KYC, so yes without KYC you can’t withdraw Bitcoins into cash also. So practically if we see, then Bitcoins don’t exactly provide full anonymity. But it’s atleast better than these centralised banks.",

Yeah, that’s possible, other scenarios is like we have on the forum but, that just ties an address to a user rather than actual physical identity.Where it really lies is, on an exchange and that’s why, not having a third party in a transaction is what should be but, the issue of trust in the space and who gets to exchange first often creates a log of problem.Something users deal with case by case.",

But about a system that is decentralized or not centralized. Bitcoin can be said to respect privacy more but is still transparent in the transaction process. And of course that is one of the many advantages that can be obtained simultaneously from using bitcoin. We can maintain the privacy of our identities, but we can still transact transparently and another advantage is that we are in full control of the assets we have in bitcoin. If we transact with random IP connectivity or through a VPN and also use Mixer then maybe users who want to remain anonymous can take advantage of it.",

It's true that the transaction is traceable but if the person chose not never to reveal or sign their address then no one could connect the address to anyone. I think the whole idea of placing bitcoin as a pseudonymity and not fully anonymous is basically because of its usage, if you look at even the explanation people make that it is stored publicly on the blockchain you will still ask yourself ok if all the addresses becomes linked to each other can it be traced back to its owner, the Answer to that now is certainly based on the way the owner of the address uses it. If the owner transact or uses centralized exchanges with KYC protocol then it can simply be traced to such person but imagine someone using a decentralized exchange and doesn’t have any KYC linked with any platform then it will be hard to certainly get such person which in turn is full anonymity to me. So it is certainly a matter of choice.

Only centralized platforms can lock the funds but if it was send to a decentralized platform or even Wallet then I doubt that such funds can ever be recovered. You can only see the transactions on blockchain because it is public but tracing it to the owner is something else",
