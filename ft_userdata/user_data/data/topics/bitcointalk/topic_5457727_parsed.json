No, it's different, you will only ban evading if your other account/s are banned in this forum from different reasons. \"Proxy bans\" are the results of those banned accounts, once a user was banned, the IP address used by those users received evil points/score. The higher the evil points the higher the payment it will be generated once a user registered using those IP address.",

It does not cause a ban evasion.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM25. Ban evasion (using or creating accounts while one of your accounts is banned) is not allowed.[e]25. If you get banned (temporarily or permanently) and create a new account to continue posting / sending PMs, it's considered ban evasion. The only exception is creating a thread in Meta about your ban.",

It isn't you who committed evil but the ones who also belong to same city or country where you reside. It's common thing now that almost every ISP allocates dynamic IP addresses to the users of their service, and those dynamic IP addresses are mostly similar, but only difference in last numbers of the IP addresses.It isn't ban evasion if you are creating your account for first time and you didn't got any ban from this forum. But, if someone has broken the rules of the forum in past and has got a ban from the administrators, but now created another fake account to use this forum because his/her main account was banned due to malicious activity then that kind of account creation falls into the domain of ban evasion. You haven't done ban evasion, but still using of VPN for creating an account isn't a good activity because such kind of act could be the cause of more spamming. Ban evasion is basically the act of creating accounts on a forum where someone's main account is banned, that thing is another type of fraud and that's why it's disliked by all reputed forums and websites.However, if you intention behind using the VPN was to create your account for fair usage of the forum, and you didn't had an account banned of this forum in past then there isn't anything wrong in doing that. But be careful and read the rules of the forum so you can be safe from further issues. This forum is strictly against Plagiarism and if someone founds to be plagiarizing the content of others then the user will get banned as soon as he/she gets reported by the reputed members of the forum.You should go through this post to understand the rules better:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0#post_rules",

Nope, that's not considered ban evasion. If you happen to come across a proxy ban and don't feel like paying evil fees, you can try changing your public IP address or switching to a different VPN provider (if you're using one) and make a fresh account. Just remember, you won't be able to reuse the same username.",

Please I need clarification, I just don't want something that is going to haunt me during my stay here or affect me later on.Is there any other person near you, who is on this platform too, because what i have read in my Networking class that, when we get internet from the same service provider it provides the same IP, For example, You bought the internet from a middleman who got the internet from regional internet provider, and that middleman uses some old technology (modems) which mixes the IP address (mean did not change the IP address and allocate the same IP to every users connected to that modem. (well this could be eliminated if you could ask the middleman to change it).Why i asked is there any person near you on this platform, because his/her IP and you IP would be same and that person might have violated the rules of this platform, so this platform blacklisted that IP, and you having the same IP, tried to sign in or sign up and asked to pay fee.Now coming to evasion to ban, this is tricky for me, because if you could prove that you are new to this platform and never had any account in past which had violated the rules and got you banned then i think it is ok for you to be here and there left no reason for you to fear the ban. Well, let's left it on the moderators.",

Well, you are not totally a newcomer as you claimed but don't be afraid of ban evasion if you are not ban evading.The message that displayed in the evil fee portal didn't state that you are ban evading, just that you have the pre knowledge that ban evasion breeds evil fee.Don't panic and use the free forum in a healthy and honest manner.",

When those accounts all get knocked out, I might end up giving that location a bad reputation, which could possibly make the location blacklisted. But I don't think getting an IP address blacklisted is done just by 1-4 accounts getting banned for rules violation, I guess is far more above that, their should be a huge number enough to drag the attention of the admin.",

You are free to create as many accounts as you like and that won’t get you banned, as long as you follow the forum rules  and do not use your alt accounts to cheat campaigns. The proxy ban affects users from certain regions, it’s nothing serious and as you have discovered using vpn can help you bypass it.",
