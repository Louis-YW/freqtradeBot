Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double spending.\"We see two problems with the state of Bitcoin today:First and foremost, there are almost no solutions that adhere to these core principles because they are trying to capitalize on the hype by providing a centralized solution and maximize profits. Second, These centralized solutions are creating more confusion in the market causing the general public to see Bitcoin as an investment rather than a money. For Satoshi's vision to be realized Bitcoin needs to be seen as a currency and not an investment.Our contention is that we need more solutions that adhere to the principles outlined in the Bitcoin white paper.  We need companies that understand the principles and market products that adhere to these principles while at the same time making those companies enough money to continue marketing Bitcoin products.We have an idea of what that might look like and are working on it.

How do I get one?... And if we ask what is Bitcoin, they will respond with - It is used by criminals mostly to do illegal things.  If we were to ask, how do you spend a bitcoin if you own one, well that is beyond most peoples ability to understand.In my opinion this is where the future of bitcoin rests.The masses are being educated on Bitcoin by the companies that stand to gain the most by either centralizing it or squashing it to prevent their power from being diminished.Bitcoin has no centralized marketing team to educate so it will require businesses that can profit off of Bitcoin while holding it's core values in tact.All business can benefit from accepting bitcoin as a currency because they immediately save 2.5% in bank processing fees.  This savings will transfer to cheaper prices on goods and services.When more people understand the core concepts - Decentralized, Peer-to-Peer, Self Custody - I think then we will start to see Bitcoin become less volatile.",

Sounds like some kind of futures market for electricity.I agree with franky1 and would like to add that the value of money is an agreed upon value.  Many more things play into it other than the price it takes to create it.  Things like scarcity and supply and demand.I believe the real value of bitcoin comes from the people who believe in it.  This grass roots movement is taking place because people see the value in a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency.  I think if we stop believing that, we may as well pack it in and accept our current system or come up with something else.When I started learning about Bitcoin 8 years ago I thought there is no way this will ever succeed because there are two many headwinds.  The crazy thing is that this group just keeps growing.  The real growth comes from the people who understand the need for it. It is a grass roots movement of people who see the need for change.I also believe that everyone, given the right knowledge will agree it is the right thing!",

      "body": "mendace,I hear your concern but don't understand your logic.  A currency is a medium exchange for value.  What we want is to keep that currency from being centralized and controlled by a single group like a government or other.  I don't think you believe that a business should not be fairly compensated for a service that it provides. The important point is that Bitcoin is not coopted by any centralized organization.Our service is much the same as BTCPay Server.  We are not monitoring transactions and all our fees are based on the service we provide which is to make accepting Bitcoin easier.  Really the only difference between us and a business who has its own node is that they are paying us to host it for them and answer any questions they have.Now to the extent that our service does provide a single node that others use to transact on the Bitcoin blockchain I agree with you.This is the reason we are introducing a new product that will not include a shared node.  Each person or business will have their own full Bitcoin Core node.  This is the only way to keep Bitcoin truly decentralized.  The amazing thing is that Satoshi knew this when he wrote the white paper. This is why it is important to keep the block size as it is so this is possible.Finally, I agree that speculation is the reason for Bitcoin's instability and the solution is for it to become a currency.  If bitcoin is not a currency I don't know what value it has.",

In my opinion it contradicts the concept of being a currency which often and should have a stable market value. Thus, it is no longer surprising why people prefer to use it as an asset than to use it on daily transactions; profit purposes.Quote from: karabiber on December 21, 2022, 10:36:23 PMIn order for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be used as a currency, it is necessary to ensure reliability and stability, to carry out regulatory and legalization studies, to prevent the price from fluctuating, to prevent theft, to take other security measures and to expand their use.

Possible way is thru regulation from governments. If there will be something to mediate transactions, things might stabilize BUT this would also oppose the idea of this technology to be decentralized, so I guess it is just a complicated scenario for this industry. At the moment, more countries are adopting usage of this technology little by little. And once majority of countries do the same thing, it is still hard to guess what could happen on its market price as well as its function whether it would be a profitable investment or more of a typical digital currency.",

Thanks for setting up this business, wherein you try your best to encourage merchants follow these principles (and take a buck along the way), but unfortunately you're a drop in the ocean. If merchants, collectively, don't realize it themselves that bitcoin is in favor of them, nobody can. People can't stop seeing it as investment when they're neutral against their fiat currency. Everything is measured in fiat-- and very few people have a problem with that. Bitcoin will emerge as needed currency by the entire world, only if the former collapses-- and even in that scenario, I still have my doubts it will, because \"bad money drives out good\".",
