Instead of high withdrawal fees, platforms can manage their work by taking hidden fees such as transaction fees, lower exchange rates, trading fees, and other hidden deductions.Therefore, do not make fees the only reason to invest, but rather one of them in addition to the response of the support team, volumes of liquidity, and legal issues.",

On Binance and OKX, such level comes with low fee if compared to Huobi global, I wished I continue to use Huobi global, but the high fee let me leave the exchange. It was 0.2% fee for spot trading when I left like two months ago.",

The good thing is there are so many exchanges to check out. Some even still have relaxed KYC policies like OKX, FTX, Kucoin etc",

I doubt if the representative will be like hhampus, darkstar or any known reputable manager would suffice the scam notion. But you are right, its always much better to provide own member from Huobi coming here creating account and make necessary announcement.",
