  "content": "Hey there!The main question is in the thread subject. I have found a new DeFi app quidi.finance that claims to bring up to 321% API by staking your funds in their concentrated liquidity protocol. The website looks ok, you can even deposit funds and claim staking rewards. However, the overall lack of info regarding the project creates some doubts.Anyone got any thoughts on this matter?",

But use a separate Ethereum wallet since you're going to be connecting your wallet to the protocol and you'll be confirming (potentially malicious) transactions that could potentially empty up your entire wallet.",

Absurd APY? Check. Recently registered domain? Check.Source Code/smart contract information not visible? Check.A lot of red flags. Even if it is legit, the APY is simply not feasible. Note also, the audit information, if they have truly done the audit, the transparency reports should be publicly available. Merely claiming they have done an audit is meaningless.",

Obviously, the upcoming scam is the only reason to deliberately lie about the audit. I hope someone googles the project and finds this thread before investing in it. This is important and turns out it seems Peckshield might take this case seriously.An outright lie by the platform should be the first thing that people need to know. First of all, an audit does not guarantee the security and legitimacy of a project/platform. With that in mind, noting they even lying about it should certainly conclude this project is very likely made to scam/deceive people.",
