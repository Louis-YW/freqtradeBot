  "content": "Nobody says living off the grid of public life is the best way to live a great life when you hold bitcoin, there are ways we each enjoy life but there should be limitations on how this life should be lived especially when you hold Bitcoin. Buying a bitcoin is one of the first baby steps in the life cycle of a bitcoin, securing it in a good wallet(hardware wallet) is another great step to protect it from anyone and making sure the seed phrase is well backed up is another goal to check so that you can have access to it anytime in the future. This is the basic one everyone believes but security bitcoin doesn't end with running away from anyone having access to your seed phrase and private keys. There are more sophisticated kinds of public lifestyles that can endanger your Bitcoin.When you hold a Bitcoin as an individual, you must learn to live some private life but it seems living a private life is like living in a prison; some people don't know that when you hold a Bitcoin, you need some degree of private life to some length. A private life is not about hiding from the public completely but limiting some ways you interact with the public, you may think it is a flex but it puts not only your bitcoin in danger, when you hold bitcoin it puts your life at high risk because having a means to money invites bad energy around you and you know what thieves are capable of doing when they know you are in a possession of money.I want to share with you how a guy lost everything to armed robbers for always bringing his lifestyle to social media and always showing off how much he made in Bitcoin and some altcoins. There is this guy I followed on X, he is very active with updates regarding Bitcoin, he trades most of the time and also shares his opinion on bitcoin moves. Just some days ago, he was robbed right in his home and his bank account was empty, the bitcoin and other crypto were emptied. From his screenshot, he stored his coins in the exchange which is the first red flag and showing off again on the internet is another red flag.  Here are some images.Source: https://x.com/alh_myke1/status/1718374911352164567According to him, he was robbed and all his coins were been transferred out of his wallet when they threatened him and he had no choice but to send everything to them and was even forced to borrow more money from his friends to give them. Binance support was tagged for help and they are supporting him to trace the culprits but they didn't reveal whether it was a Binance to Binance transfer or Binance to external wallet. Regarding bank transfer, he has involved the legal process to trace the transaction.What are the lessons to learn from this:1. Don't share with people that you own a coin: There is joy when you tell friends about Bitcoin in other to encourage them or tell them about your journey but never tell them the amount you hold, the place you buy or how you store them. Some people have bad intentions even when you think they are your friends. Even if you save your Bitcoin in a hardware wallet that no one will access, you don't have to share everything with the public, it should remain private.2. You don't have to share with people how much you gain: Excitement makes us share gains and profits but it is not something you do on public platforms where people can easily identify you, telling people that you made X profits will only invite hate and jealous from people like the ones that are idle and have nothing doing, they can gang up to attack you when you don't expect them.3. Living a private life brings peace when you don't overshare: One thing about Bitcoin is if you don't tell anyone that you bought a Bitcoin, no one will ever know and the level of peace it brings, no other thing comes to it except you decide to share with people that you have bitcoin in your possession. Having money under you and nobody knows is peace on its own.4. Learning to live a private life gives you good privacy: Some people don't value their privacy, they see it as nothing but in fact when you have high privacy, it will be impossible for people to know much about you, it will be impossible for people to know your next move and how you plan to move, nothing goods like much privacy.When you live a private life, it attracts less attention because people don't know much about you, you may do whatever you like in public but it is not a good idea when you hold an asset like Bitcoin and tell the world that you own some, it will attract bad people around you that will be willing to kill you just to have that bitcoin from you. In addition, learn to hold your coins in a hardware wallet because not your keys, not your coin.",

I am really impressed after seeing his efforts because he shared his post of being robbed on 29 October and he already shared his new earnings via crypto trading around 5+ hours ago. He is real motivation, he must be interviewed by motivational shows and I doubt what would this tweet mean:Quote from: https://twitter.com/dimpledhanna/status/1718375158405022187That place is not safe, I clearly begged you to change location.I don't know this person never followed him so I at first doubted him but after reading the replies on his tweet and after hearing from you OP I got convinced and I don't know where he lived but maybe the dude knows where he lived which means in some of his streams or videos he must have disclosed that and that must have got him robbed or it maybe be an inside information. I would say there is nothing bad in streaming and showing your earnings but the bad is in sharing your address and where you live. Even if you wanted to share your earnings then try to share some of it so that the next thief would not know that how much money you have.PS: We are here to start a topic discussing whether we should not share our earnings and the victim is doing it again lol",

I don't know why if some people buy bitcoin, they must tell someone and show him your wallet for him to see the amount so that he can believe you. It is an unsafe practice and nobody needs to know that, it is better to be a secrete billionaire and safe your head, your family and your wealth from robbers and player haters, than to be show off to people how much you have made and loss either your wealth or your life or both.Bitcoin is something that draws people attention to the hodler because they will believe that you are very rich to buy bitcoin, unknown to them that you struggled to buy some sats anytime when the opportunity comes due to the value of bitcoin. Stay safe and enjoy your investment in the long term by keeping everything about your bitcoin investment a secrete.

The pictures you posted are not enough evidence bro. If this is true please provide evidence, I can as well post things like this and claim to be robbed....crickets...But funny how he got in donation already more than enough!  Robbers enter your house rob him of his TV and phones and stand by his side of while he gets money from his friends, he sends this money to the thief's account and he manages to get a phone in less than 50 minutes to log in in his binance accounts and takes a screenshot of ... his wallet balance not of the outgoing tx... because fck logic!Quote from: cryptosize on November 07, 2023, 06:49:33 PMWho exactly robbed him?The tooth fairy!",

He is an influencer and influencers do that its in nature even if it was not before becoming an influencer but after getting into this role, you have to share what you do especially if you are going to get some help out of it. And he did get help, as after reading some of his replies I can say for sure that his fan following must have helped him to set his setup back so he could start trading again.I am very motivated by him and even if he makes the same mistake again at the same place, he might be showing a token of assurance to fans who have helped him that I have used your (fans') money to back myself up instead of wasting it on a bear with snake friends.  But of course, he can do that in private DM also as there was no need for him to be on public again until he changed his address but I have one thing to say, even if a person doing any other work having relative skills he cannot getup again on his feet that fast. crypto is really helping people with skills.",

Although I still agree with most of the points made in OP:— He used exchange as primary wallet which is typical of most influencers.— for someone who was a target the first time, he still remained in same location (didn't learn obviously) and kept sharing too much on social media.Note to self: Even if lifestyle gets inflated, no nedd to flaunt since it's nothing and be very careful while at the top.",

I wouldn't be motivated about such people.You are right, and there is no doubt in your points, but I don't care if the story is real or fake. What I saw was that an influencer got robbed (maybe fake), and he showed posts of his room instead of giving the transaction details to prove the authenticity of his case. He waited for like a week, and when he got enough funds, he started to upload pictures of his trades again.But I did not care about the authenticity at that moment because I was motivated by the enthusiasm he put in even after being robbed, as he would have been sober on this incident or rest for days about what happened to him, but instead he used this opportunity in his own favour and shared the story with fans, they got emotional, he got funds in donations, and he started his journey again. If he is an influencer and his fans are willing to give him donations, then he must have given them some useful signals too, otherwise, no one will give their money to anybody sharing their stories on social media. Those who give money must have known him for some time, as the OP stated.But if the story is fake, then I can't say anything, but I will still be motivated by the person's characters, as we are motivated by fictional movies (movies are also not real).",
