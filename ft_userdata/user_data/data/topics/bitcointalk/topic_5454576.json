How can you capture this potential market?Market is truly that unpredictable, there's no way we could be able to know or predict on what would be its next movements. Yes, it isnt something that could really be connected intoeconomic events externally but we cant really tell that its 100% assured that it isnt really that connected specially if big economical events is happening then its really that impossible thatwe wont really be making up some correlation or in connection. This crypto market is really that highly reactive when it comes to news and evens on which if you do make out some Fundamental analysis then it would really be something applicable and relevant plus having those TA which it would really be giving out that picture out on what things are needed up to be dodone but of course it wont really be having no assurance about being that precise on making profits out of those decisions.",

How can you capture this potential market?It is not a paradox, is bitcoin part of the financial system? Can you buy things with it, exchange it for other fiat currencies and hire the services of companies and other people with it? Since the answer to all of that is yes, then why do you think that bitcoin should not respond to the fluctuating market conditions that we experiment? This is the most natural thing for bitcoin to do, and even if it is undesirable to you for some reason you have no other option but to adapt to it.",

Technical analysis is not enough to decide to buy or sell you need to combine both of these techniques to get a perfect analysis for the next price movement.Yes, that is true, since Bitcoin coexist with other assets of global relevance, it becomes very important to acknowledge the place of information sharing and news in the overall well-being of the market so which gives birth to funds and FOMO in the Bitcoin market since some people act along what they're heard from the news, and this is no new, but then as well-thought investors, we should be able to differentiate between real news and funds, and even if we can't totally avoid the funds, we can at least limit their influences on our daily decisions regarding our positions.",

Even if it seems completely unrelated to whatever asset you are handling, they will still try to connect the dots to it and make you believe that it will affect the asset that you're handling. That has been the way for years way even before bitcoin existed, so I am no longer really surprised that the world news affects bitcoin in some way.",

How can you capture this potential market?You have to learn how experienced investors out there handle the market. You have to learn how Warren invest his money in other instruments but didn't panic when the market crashed. You have to learn how Elon handle his emotion when Tesla stock fell. The real investor has good management to face all situation market so that if a crash happens they don't panic and take it easy to handle it. And, We are as small investors have to learn how to hodl because there is a starting point if want to continue to the market. We must have long-term planning, and step if the bad news appears according to the market. So it's no big deal (bad news) if suddenly make the crash because we've already to face it. So, Like what happened in last week (bitcoin price down to 26k), if you panic and don't have management to face it, you should sell it. But if you relax, easy going, and keep hodl your bitcoin, you will be fine until today.",

Although we cannot treat Bitcoin as if it is completely indifferent to the global traditional economy, the correlation isn't a complete one. You just have to look back at the news in the recent weeks, particularly when giant banks are falling one after another. It is symptomatic of a worse problem in the market and yet Bitcoin moved in a direction towards a negative correlation.",

Some people see it as a thing they can just make money from, others see it as a safe haven. The adoption still isn’t incredible and some countries still lay in between acceptance and refusal of BTC. The price is known to be extremely volatile and all of these added up give you a pretty good answer to your question.Bitcoin moves like that because many holders are afraid that Bitcoin will crash during a war, that Bitcoin will die because China or whoever else is under yet another crackdown and so on. And Bitcoin is still new, it hasn’t been through all possible kinds of events. We know how even new stocks react to events because stocks have been for so long. Same for commodities. But we don’t know yet if Bitcoin is a commodity, a stock or simply its own category of assets.",

Up to this day, major media outlets hold significant influence over investments. It is important to remember that most people only have access to news media to supplement their understanding of fundamental analysis.Moreover, upon further examination, price movements actually occur due to the dynamic nature of supply and demand. News, on the other hand, has the power to influence demand, whether it be high or low, depending on the media delivering it and the type of news being conveyed.

In 2017, I remember that Bitcoin's price moves by at least double digit percentage most of the time, if the news is positive, and vice-versa. Nowadays, news doesn't have that much effect on the price of Bitcoin anymore, but still there's a bit of it, but not as much as what it was in 2017.Overall, an an investor, it would be better if we will base on charts rather on the news.",

Likewise with the stock market and others.A recession looms, inflation soars, interest rates soar and the cost of living bites. And maybe what happened has shaken their overall confidence in the crypto market and other markets. As a result, it is possible that many people decide to sell, but there are also those who take advantage of this opportunity to buy.and in my opinion there is nothing to worry about, because with what comes it is a great opportunity and also a discount to buy, because of the low price. Then you just sit still and watch it, that's how it works and look ahead \"the pump will always happen\".",

Bitcoin, as a financial asset, is affected by news about the economy in general, but it has particularities that make it go up or down regardless of what happens in the rest of the markets.To the OP I would recommend a long term view. Regardless of the influence of the world markets, if the financial asset is good, as is the case with Bitcoin, the long-term trend is upwards, regardless of short-term volatility.",
