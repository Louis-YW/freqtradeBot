  "content": "I have finally created or opened an account in Electrum wallet and I was trying to change the Default-Wallet name to my name but I couldn't so I will want the forum Electrum experts to show me how to Re-name it. Though the creation process was some how difficult for me but I finally got it. I am sorry for disturbing you guys, these are some the things made me to join the forum. What I learn here is also impacting to the fellows in the area, so everything I learn here both small and big is very much important to me. Thanks for your help. Once again, Sorry for the Disturbance.Came to Learn",

If done, make sure the seed phrase is correct and let it synchronized with the blockchain, making sure your coin balance is correct. If done appropriately, delete the old wallet.",

For example, \"cold wallet\", \"hot wallet\", \"temporary wallet\", signature wallet, etc. I make a mistake in the past where I just name them wallet1, wallet2, etc, and then forgot which one is important and which one isn't. It is not a big deal but a little bit annoying.Obviously, this might affect your privacy a little bit if bad things happen, so just keep it in mind. Might not be the best practice so if anyone has a better way to manage them you should check them out too. CMIIW.",

As an extra advice, you may have heard it before from someone else, but I need to restate it for the purpose of those will read through all the responses in this thread. When you ask question regarding your wallet, be careful and do not respond to people even forum members who will want to offer you help through your private messages and are asking for your seed phrase.

The forum is a place to learn and get help when necessary, all forum members cannot be trusted.In crypto, if you receive DMs that ask for personal and sensitive information, ignore them.Legit people don't DM you to ask for sensitive information because in crypto, we have \"Not your keys, not your coins\".If you tell somebody your keys, you are sharing access to your coins to other people too.Because they DM first with bad intention, when you are trapped and share your keys, they will quickly import that key and move your coins to their wallets.",

Buy a hard wallet wallet soon to make sure your funds are safe.",
