Especially since these scammers usually spam you numerous times, from many different accounts, and there's no real way to block them all.What really needs to be changed there is, the reporting system for scammers. What I mean by that is, where it's actually possible to report a scammer and receive a response. Telegram and Discord are the worst at this, with no options whatsoever on report. This needs to be changed.",

Problem is that it usually takes more reports from different people for scamer to get his account tagged so in majority of cases its just the waste of time.",

It is an old one.Let me reveal that years ago, many scammers did it already. They contacted me and told me that they got issues with accounts and want to get help to make a transaction like 0.1 BTC, then I will get reward from it (maybe 0.05 BTC or 0.1 BTC). I don't remember exact deals I were offered but it is something like that.Offer details can be different but this scam scheme is the same and not new.Very basic rule, if a stranger contacts you first, gives you any deal relates with money, it's scam.",

Instead of creating a site with a balance and asking the user to deposit to withdraw the balance (the old trick), they are asking that you link your wallet to that site.Newbies may fall into such scams because they think their coins are safe in their wallets, and some may write seeds on the site if asked to do so, so it will be easy to be scammed in this way.MetaMask made things easier for beginners and scammers.",

To be honest, they have upgraded nothing, this method is very popular, well, it would be new for newcomers who prolly have no knowledge or experience, but then even as a newbie one should still be able to sense what looks like a scam, or what looks just too good to be true, and we all can agree that once a stranger sends you a message talking about something like what is in the op, it is undoubtedly a scam.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 02, 2022, 06:09:25 PMDon't think that you are the lucky one out of many to be offered a huge percentage, they try this method with many person's in one day hoping to take advantage of the greedy onesThat is it, the promise of the percentage is what allures people to some of these scams, and that is only cause they believe there is free money waiting to be harnessed in crypto, and that is why scammers will always have victims.",

Hope newbies will take a lesson and save their assets. This is not a new anymore, you can easily block those users but of course expect to receive more since scammers are everywhere and they can easily bypass the system of Telegram. Unfortunately, newbies are more prone to this since they don't analyze that much this is why its necessary to invest on knowledge first before putting any money on this market. Scammer will always find a new way to scam the investors always be careful.",

I freshly remember the same scenario in your case but the difference is when it comes to withdrawal.  In the same procedure, someone asked me to create an account because he can't access the exchange site due to the country's restrictions, and then, without hesitation, he transfer all his funds to my account, and now when he said just withdraw it and transfer to his Bitcoin wallet, the exchange platform asked me to deposit half of the amount that I wanted to withdraw which is very suspicious. That was on Telegram, we should better avoid dealing with strangers on Telegram. BTW, thank you for the awareness and we hope this could be a lesson for those people who are greedy, they thought they will get easy money but it's the opposite, it will drain their entire wallets once they will be scammed.",

When you register in a given exchange, it somehow gives you the relief and security thinking that it might go smoothly.
