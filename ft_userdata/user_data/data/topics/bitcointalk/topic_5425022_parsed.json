  "content": "First i deposited 50000 and 8684 dollars to binance. Then scammer made 0 dollars withdrawal from my address without having my private keys. Address where this empty withdrawal happened to is similar to binance's deposit address. Last 5 symbols are same and 2 first also are same. Then i copied address of last withdrawal, confirmed that last 4 symbols are same and deposited 100000 dollars. I did not notice that other symbols of address are different.I started to research about it in internet and figured out that scammer do not have my private keys and did withdrawal from my address using vulnerability in binance smart chain blockchain. I.e. scammers can make empty withdrawals without private keys to addresses with at least 5 same last symbols and 2-4 first symbols as exchanges' deposit addresses. Some people do not compare every symbol of address and watch for example only last 4 symbols and can send funds to scammer's address.Here is scam transaction: https://bscscan.com/tx/0xc797622c27e35f89898bf43121a36b1f6e29d64769c7aca0917c85f1b764c7f3",

Not trying to blame you there, just trying to understand how this could work and how would the alleged scammer know that you're going to do this?",

That should be a much better and secure practice, given that exchanges sometimes change deposit  addresses due to various reasons. Sorry for the loss, but be careful next time",

And I still don't understand how the alleged thief would have known that someone would do this. Is this a common practice?The thief's address matched three bytes of the victim's address (one at the beginning of the address and two at the end). I would have thought that if this was done on purpose they'd try to generate an address that matches more bytes at the beginning because that's what the explorer shows. But I checked a few other 0 token transfers from the same TX and there were similar 3-4 byte matches to other addresses that previously received large amounts, so it can't be a coincidence.Seems like a very low effort low probability \"attack\" if you can even call it that. And someone hit a jackpot.",

Unless hackers have full control of your computer or phone, it's enough to copy paste address from the exchange, if you're sending to exchange. If it's your address, also copy paste, or use address book in your wallet. This kind of attack is effective only against people who don't take security seriously at all.",

I reporded about this scam first time to binance 29:th or 30:th november.Here is answer:QuoteAfter reviewing the case, we have concluded that this was not due to a vulnerability in BSC.The 0 transfer from your address 0xb410e3d622D1072eE3E1cc6cdc90120E657977F7 to scammer’s address 0x27feaafd9b46b74bee510a0a538615d2ff639871 was not a withdrawal but a call to the token contract’s https://bscscan.com/token/0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56#writeContract transferFrom function. The transferFrom function does not require the private key of the sender address if the amount is 0. Anyone can call transferFrom with any address + 0 amount in token contract.Note that this function is not specific to BEP20 but to ERC20 tokens as well. If you check this contract from Etherscan (and other token contracts) https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#writeContract, you will be able to find and call the same transferFrom function.2. What the scammer has managed to achieve was to use the function to his advantage and target users who would copy the scam address from the previous transactions, trick them into thinking that it was a legit address and make a deposit to it.Here is article about this scam:https://mirror.xyz/x-explore.eth/cL3d_CyNujXq8XY7ueP4omNXx_IY1EG5Dz0FD0vJ90MAnd here updated info:https://dune.com/opang/first-and-last-address-constructionScam continues and new victims loss money.

Smart contracts can initiate an outgoing transaction from your wallet ONLY if they have been previously approved by the owner. The TransferFrom() function cannot fire a transfer event if it is not approved unless the token amount transacted is equal to 0. If you fail to understand this, it may lead you to believe that anyone can initiate a token transaction from any wallet - which is not true.Quote from: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-blockchain-programming/9781839218262/703abbf3-7b3b-4739-8396-a494eb4a17c4.xhtmlThe transferFrom() function transfers the tokens from an owner's account to the receiver account, but only if the transaction initiator has sufficient allowance that has been previously approved by the owner to the transaction initiator. To transfer the tokens using the transferFrom() function, approver must have called the approve() function prior. As per the standard, the transferFrom() function must fire the Transfer event upon the successful execution and transfer of tokens. The transfer of 0 (zero) value must also be treated as a valid transfer and should fire the Transfer event.",
