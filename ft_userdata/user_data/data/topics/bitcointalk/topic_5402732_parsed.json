I'm now noticing he is increasingly becoming concerned about his lawn. CheesySo, it's all true. Ok, then I join the congratulations and wish that his lawn is always green and fresh.  Apparently, theymos is not so old, which means that he will be able to work for the benefit of the crypto community for many more years. At least that's what I wish him. Why was this day not announced in advance - it was possible to hold a gift contest for theymos.",
