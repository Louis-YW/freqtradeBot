  "content": "After a car accident in 2015 that left me in a coma for several months, I chose to dedicate my life to pursuing my passion for art. I am trying hard to do my best but today I am left with nothing. I am locked in years of litigation with my insurance companies over their refusal to pay damages. Even at one point, funds to my bank account was frozen, which prevented me from paying court fees or sending money to my elderly mother. It was supposed to be the end, this month but I received letter from my insurance company and my lawyer. The final decision day is rescheduled to October, F***ing October, do you believe it?! The insurance tactic is to get me out of money, you know  I can take couple of thousands what they are offering but I must hand sign the paper that I will never ask anything more but what happens if I won't be able to move half of my body later? How I will survive that? I had to relearn everything after my crash, I couldn’t speak. I didn’t even remember who my sister was. Other than my love of drawing, I was basically like a blank slate at the time. I even don't have anymore where to live, I am at the moment staying by my sister and using her address but this is just the beginning of crash. The hospital bills and other life day bills will come after me. I decided to try to look for someone who was able to give me some work for Bitcoin.This forum was always big part of my life. I don't have another place to go. This is me and my journey.Mx12 Bitcoin art thread on bitcointalk:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5362071.0Donations is no must but are appreciated",
