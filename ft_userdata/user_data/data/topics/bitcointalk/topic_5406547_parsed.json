  "content": "Proof of Work = According to coinbase, this is the original crypto consensus mechanism. It is called Proof of Work because of the processing power that is required in order for the network to be maintained and updated. Security and verification of blockchains produced by proof-of-work are then the purpose of virtual miners that races to solve a mathematical problem. The first to do so gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions, and is rewarded by the network with a predetermined amount of crypto. source= https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stakeProof of Stake = Is another crypto consensus mechanism. In my understanding it goes this way: the validators would stake an amount to a pool to qualify as a validator. The network then chose a validator based on the amount and the length of time the stake is in the pool, once chosen they get to validate the latest verified transactions. The benefit of this compared to the Proof of Work system is it doesn't require a lot of processing power that consumes energy/electricity.source= https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stakeDefault = is the term used when a borrower fails to make a payment to the lender.Information Costs = these are expenditures of time and money that are required to obtain information. In my understanding most common here would be automation tools that gather and analyze data on cryptocurrencies. Investment opportunities and risks involved.(source=simplicable.com)CRR - (mostly applicable to stable coins like USDT, etc.,)This is the proportion of total deposits and reserves of a cryptocurrency that is to be kept in proportion to the number of coins in circulation. For example if there is 1,000,000 USDT in circulation, there must be an equivalent $1,000,000 deposited as they claim in there website. Tether ( USDT) is a cryptocurrency stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed \"100% by Tether's reserves,\" according to its website. (source = investopedia.com)edit:DCA - is a strategy to purchase a tradable asset in a periodic manner to minimize the impact in the volatility of the product/goods/crypto. Mostly done by huge investors who's business plan is to acquire/sell a certain stock/cryptocurrency without having to spook the market with a one time buy or sell.edit(thanks @Text) custodial wallets - wallets na hindi mo controlado. Wala kang private keys, kaya kung tutuusin wala ka ding coins. Nakikigamit ka lang, tulad ng coins.ph  non-custodial wallets - ikaw ang may ari, controlado mo ito. Nasa iyo ang private key. Example : Wasabi Wallet  Technical Analysis - Mga ginagawa ng mga wall observers. Dito ay nababantayan nila ang mga senyales na may congestion sa network. Mga fees, etc.   NFT - Non Fungible Token. Mostly ay virtual art pieces, games na nasa blockchain ang patunay na pagmamayari ito ng owner.

HODLHold On for Dear Life. A crypto trader who buys a coin and does not see himself selling in the foreseeable future is called a hodler of the coin.2. FOMOShort form for ‘Fear Of Missing Out’. The feeling when you see a huge green dildo on a chart and you don’t own that coin, so you sell other shit to buy into it freaking out. As crypto trading is still very much driven by emotions rather than valuation, FOMO is a huge factor to consider when swing trading in crypto.3. FUDShort form for ‘Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt’. Usually used in the form of “xxx spreading FUD again.”Example: JPMorgan’s Dimon spread FUD by saying Bitcoin is a fraud that will eventually blow up.4. ATHShort form for “All-Time High”. Therefore it means the highest historical price of a specific coin.5. WhaleA huge player who has a substantial amount of capital. Whales are often the market movers for small alt-coins too due to their huge capital.6. Pump and DumpThe recurring cycle of an Altcoin getting a spike in price followed by a huge crash. Such movements are often attributed to low volume, hence the ‘pump’. Traders who pump, buying huge volumes, may wish to invoke FOMO from the uninformed investors and then dump, or sell, their coins at a higher price.7. ShillThe act of unsolicited endorsing of the coin in public. Traders who bought a coin has an interest in shilling the coin, in hopes of igniting the public’s interest in that particular coin.8. Bag HolderA term to refer to a trader who bought in at a high and missed his opportunity to sell, leaving him with worthless coins.9. Margin TradingA term for ‘trading with leverage’. In this instance of trading, you borrow one side of the trading pair at an agreed loan rate and sell it for the other side of the trading pair. Depending on the direction you believe the market to move, you may place a long or a short bet on the trading pair of concern.10. LongA position that a trader takes. To take a long position on something is to believe its value will rise in the future.11. ShortA position that a trader takes. To take a short position on a coin is to believe its value will fall in the future.12. Limit OrderAn order placed at a future price that will execute when the price target is hit.13. Borrowing RateWhen you open a leveraged position, you will be borrowing coins at a pre-determined rate. This rate will be added to reflect your position’s overall profit and loss.14. Lending RateSome exchanges have lending accounts. You may deposit your coins into these lending accounts to lend your coins for others to execute their leveraged trades. The lending rate fluctuates throughout the day based on the demand for shorting the coin.15. Fill or KillA limit order that will not execute unless an opposite order exceeds this limit order’s amount.16. BUY | SELL WallA wall as seen in the depth chart of exchanges is an amalgamation of limit orders of the same price target.17. Altcoin“Alternate coin” so it is everything other than Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin is the main index for cryptocurrency market. If BTC goes up, other coins go up. If BTC goes down, other coins go down.18. Circulating SupplyThe price of a coin has no meaning on its own. However, the price of a coin, when multiplied by the circulating supply, gives the coin’s market cap.19. Market Cap.A stock’s market cap refers to the market value of the company’s outstanding shares.In the cryptocurrency market, the market cap is used to illustrate a coin’s dominance in the entire cryptocurrency market.20. DDOSShort form for ‘Distributed Denial of Service’.A well-timed DDoS attack at exchanges during volatile movements may be devastating as traders will not be able to execute any order manually and will be at the mercy of their pre-set, or the lack of, limit orders.21. ICOShort form for “Initial Coin Offering”, which takes a page from the usual IPOs investors know.Coins bought during ICOs are usually sold for a profit when the coin first hits exchanges. This is due to the initial hype which increases demand for the coin.On the supply side, ICOs create entry barriers as the buyer has to set up his private wallet to receive the coins from the ICO purchase.22. ArbitrageThe act of buying and selling on different exchanges to earn the difference in the spread. Arbitrage opportunities occur due to differences in exchange reputation, community coin preferences and ease of bank funding.Take note that fees, limits and prices could change anytime when you are transferring your coins between exchanges, especially during volatile times.23. BTFD“Buy The Fucking Dip” – When people are running around and selling because of fear, this is the time to buy.24. MoonExtreme bullish movement of a coin.25. Weak HandsThose who cannot be patient and sell at loss when the market is down.26. Token AirdropSimply put, an Airdrop means a coin/token is distributed to the community for free or for small tasks. This is done to ensure early distribution and to have as many people with “skin in the game” as possible.An Airdrop aims to build a huge community easily as people will pay attention to the coin they hold. Furthermore, they tend to promote this coin for profits, and this may cost the Development Team little to achieve the goal of advertisement.27. Vote for Token ListingVote for the coins you'd most like to be listed for trading.28. ETAShort for Estimated Time of Arrival,is an estimate time for something to be done.29. BountyRefers to a reward for users who promote the usage of cryptocurrencies(usually ICO campaign) through various social and business networks.30. Buying the DipsTo buy into the market when the market makes a downward move by a 'large' percentage (in crypto this can be anything from a 10% to %50+ move).Read more here31.
