That was a huge price drop, but I like the saying that a drop in price of a coin is an opportunity to buy, this is true for bitcoin because bitcoin will attain ATH, but not all altcoins were about to attain ATH. With what I am seeing about filecoin, I am thinking it can get to that price again which would be a huge opportunity, but I do not know much about the coin. Anyone that knows more about this coin can post here to let me know if the coin is worth going for or not. Thanks in advance.",

Thanks in advance.Ive been caught up by this coin before, I think. I bought some of this coin during its $37 and then thats it. The price continous to go down until now so Ive accept the loss of it but I dont have some funds for doing dca maybe the downtrend could be the lack of activity om their part but their technology is also good though.",

Thanks in advance.As far as i know the filecoin ICO broke all records back in 2017 because they have managed to collect 257 Million $ there. I think back then the price per token was 5$, so at the moment even the people that have participated in the ICO are in the loss zone. Of course when we enter a bull market then Filecoin will also start to rise again, but i am not sure if it will ever hit it's ATH again. First of all there are still millions and millions of tokens owned by investors of the ICO which means as soon as Filecoin will rise again and cross the 5$ mark they are in the profit zone again and they will slowly but surely begin to sell off.",

Because almost every altcoin does that? And compared to other altcoins it's stayed quite high in the marketcap. So i don't see it failing. However i see Storj as a decent competition on fundamental level. Not because it's better because it's not, but because it's more newb friendly decentralized storage system then filecoin.",

Although they are obsolet, there is still people using them to protect more private and exclusive files, fearing they can be leaked if stored online. A desktop or laptop without internet access are also alternatives.",

However, I forget how it went down, perhaps investors just grew tired of it or just shift around with other similar projects.So personally, not a financial advise here, but the hype on Filecoin is gone and I don't see investors suddenly going back as like it was 2017 all over again, just saying.Perhaps you can check their github: https://github.com/filecoin-project",

It gained good number of investors and the people who were able to invest during its ICO got to be lucky. There is continued fluctuation, but it is considered as one of the strong project that could bring long term profit.For now it is time to invest considering its ath. However it is quite hard to experience the previous ATH reached by filecoin. As suggested the investment will surely bring more than 5X return when the market turns bullish.",
