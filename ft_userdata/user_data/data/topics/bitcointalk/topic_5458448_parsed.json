  "content": "After the super pump of pepe who started the project on 2023 April 16th, many people started to make their own project. And we suddenly enter memes season, But, i found most of them is scams project, we can say 99% all of new project is scam (pump n dump, marketing wallet fraud, rugpull, etc). I just thinking after being scammed by hundred of new project, there will not project become the next pepe !!! Should i make my own project  Open Source Launch1 day before launch, everything will be announce, project name, logo, website, whitepaper, tokenomics, etc. Why i share here, because i want everyone have opportunity to enter at the begining, 100% supply for liquidity on dex, no team token, no pressle, no whitelist, LP will be locked forever, contract will be renounced at the right time, this is not like other project which the project team have a previlege to buy first (large amount of supply) then announce the contract, so they can dump the price anytime. If i launch with that way, how can i scam the people???When Launch ? End of july 2023",

Should i make my own project  You can only make a x1000 profit if you are the owner of the project or part of the the project that has an insider news and early access to the token before it will be listed to the market. it’s very hard for a normal trader to get that kind of profit if you are just buying on the market since you will have no idea if the project is scam or legit. the majority of altcoins that pump like pepe coins has a lot of budget to fund marketing and liquidity to boost the price in early stage to create a hype.You will need huge money if you want to launch your own token and reach a x1000 profit using your own token. It’s harder to create your own token rather than having a connection for an inside trade.",

Otherwise, your project will be no different from hundreds of other pump-and-dump scams out there. Good luck!",

I just thinking after being scammed by hundred of new project, there will not project become the next pepe !!! Should i make my own project  Go ahead but why would that pump? You do realize that Pepe token and others have teams with experience behind them, even though they are pseudonymous it's pretty clear how connected pepe for example is. You don't attract that much whales and get listed to binance immediately if you are not connected.Even those rug pulling scammers have experianced teams. You don't pump something by yourself unless you have ton of extra money to do that. And no one is buying a generic token with anon single dev",

So what do you intend to create that doesn't exist yet? that's the point. do you plan to create yet another meme altcoin? this already exists, and the question will be: do you have any billionaires to back your meme currency? because if you don't have any billionaires who would back your meme currency if it's your intention to create that then you won't succeed. I think it's best that you take care before creating any tokens, to avoid creating yet another meaningless token that is doomed to failure",
