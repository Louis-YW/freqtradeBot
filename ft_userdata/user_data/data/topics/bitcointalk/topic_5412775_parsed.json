If you do not have a credit history, you need to provide collateral that is equal or higher than the amount you are borrowing. Read the sticky topic.Quote from: DiamondCardz on April 20, 2014, 02:40:54 PMThe rule of \"No Collateral, No Loan\" means that in order to get a loan you must give collateral that is equal, or preferably higher to the amount you are being loaned.If you completely ignore this sticky and make a loan request with no collateral, without having massive trust on the forum, the chances of you getting negative trusted feedback and therefore having a Trade with Extreme Caution tag is almost 100%.",
