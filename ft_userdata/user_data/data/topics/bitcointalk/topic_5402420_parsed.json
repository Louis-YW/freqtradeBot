  "content": "This is terrible announcement by Binance, the top 1 centralized exchanges currently suspending Bitcoin withdrawal using Bitcoin network, but you're allowed to withdraw using other chains e.g. BEP20 and ERC20. This is a joke man, Bitcoin who using other chains isn't a real Bitcoin anymore since it's just a centralized coin created by Binance pegged with real Bitcoin price.The more and more centralized exchanges want their users to using their fake coins and centralized chains, does our personal information isn't enough for them? Because of this now I find more reason to use decentralized exchanges e.g. Bisq rather than centralized exchanges no matter their popularity.QuoteWithdrawals on Bitcoin (BTC) Network Temporarily Suspended2022-06-13 20:15Fellow Binancians,Withdrawals on the Bitcoin (BTC) network were temporarily suspended on 2022-06-13 at 11:43:43 (UTC). BTC withdrawals on other networks (BEP20 and ERC20) remain open and are working as normal.This is due to an earlier batch of transactions getting stuck from low transaction fees submitted and hence, resulting in a backlog of Bitcoin (BTC) network withdrawals. The Binance team is working on a solution to resume Bitcoin (BTC) network withdrawals soon.Binance will reopen withdrawals on the Bitcoin (BTC) network once our withdrawal system becomes stable, and we will notify users in a further announcement.Please note:    Some pending Bitcoin (BTC) network withdrawals may be rejected once withdrawals on the Bitcoin (BTC) network are resumed. In this case, the users will need to resubmit their withdrawal requests.    BTC withdrawals on other networks remain open and are working as normal.Source: https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/8437dfd1c7bf49c2a4bf124bd03b0624?ref=AZTKZ9XS&utm_source=BinanceTwitter&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial",

This is causing mainstream news media become very skeptical and have began publishing articles implying that Binance is ponzi scheme.Also, CZ filed a lawsuit against Bloomberg and I am quite certain many people in the forum would agree that CZ might be running a ponzi scheme. However, would we as investors in the cryptospace really want CZ to lose this lawsuit?Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao is suing Bloomberg Businessweek for three allegedly defamatory statements published earlier this month through the publication’s Chinese edition—which is distributed in Hong Kong—and its affiliated Twitter and Facebook accounts.Source https://decrypt.co/105948/binance-ceo-cz-sues-bloomberg-businessweek-for-defamation-in-hong-kong",

In some cases, a database glitch or another error relating to the exchange may cause some withdrawal problems. This might then have the knock-on effect of withdrawals being suspended as these are fixed.Indeed, lately exchanges often carry out periodic maintenance, until it takes a matter of hours and some up to days, I think what Binance said in the quote above makes sense, they have to adjust some features and withdrawal and deposit fees.It is unavoidable, complaints and disappointments for customers can not be dammed again by suspending.",

For all we know, that word Ponzi has probably been used to refer to almost anything in crypto including Bitcoin. CZ can't seem to take a shallow and false (?) accusation.Filing a suit for portraying Binance as \"sketchy\" or that it's breaking laws? Is \"sketchy\" not a word that describes Binance? Is Binance not kicked out from countries for breaking laws? Is it not facing legal battles until today for violations against domestic laws?",

He must have read and followed Bruce Lee's 'be like water' advice. The business will operate everywhere without complying with anything. The moment the countries' regulators take notice of their illegal operations, they will try to do something to be compliant. They would take steps to the pleasure of the regulators. If their actions fail, they would get out. If submission to the authorities is the key, they would submit. If they could get away with it, they wouldn't mind not securing a license.",
