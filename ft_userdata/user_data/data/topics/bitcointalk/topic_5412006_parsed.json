I think this one is good though I haven’t checked recently after FTX has taken them.Beside, you can check coinmarketcap and use their portfolio tracker too.There was another one which I can't remember at the moment. Will add shortly if I can remember.",

You can track mostly of the tokens that are in the market cause only few arent on the list but blockfolio supported. Its always good to trust those popular platform. Ive been monitoring the value of my tokens on coingecko, and you can input even the quantity of it matching with the live price on the market.",

You can see the portfolio on ledger live but it doesn’t tell you your average buy etc. Its nice that you have a hardwallet now. Good thing for your security. If major coins then used an estimated tracker from cmc or coingecko. It doesnt really that far from actual live tracker. Cause its based on general exchange averages so it would means a safe and accurate figures for monitoring the fund and asset value.",
