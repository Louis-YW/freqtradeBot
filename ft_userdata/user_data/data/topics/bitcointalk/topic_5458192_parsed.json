ONE GRAM?!?! - Haha, that's just awesome, crazy and cute at the same time.If affordable, please count me in for a bunch (bars and coins).Will they get a running serial - any idea on what the mintage is gonna be?Mine will be either buyerfunded pieces or just diy pieces with 2 holos included with each piece. The 1gram bars will be the FUNDED microbits versions so they will be a bit more. I‚Äôm thinking around 12 bucks or so a piece on mine as a diy coin. These were actually tough to make. Not many are willing to cut the dies and stamp/mint such small pieces as it‚Äôs a lot more labor intensive for such a small coin. Also they have a mintage of 250. The holos are laser etched with numbering. Release should be coming soon. I‚Äôll give more info once I‚Äôm home from offshore in a few days!",
