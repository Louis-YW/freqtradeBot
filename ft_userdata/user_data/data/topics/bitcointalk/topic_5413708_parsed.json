The required scores are:RankRequired activityRequired meritBrand new00Newbie10Jr Member301Member6010Full Member120100Sr. Member240250Hero Member480500LegendaryRandom in the range 775-10301000You get merit points when someone sends you some for one of your posts. Additionally, when someone sends you merit points, half of those points can be sent by you to other people.By the way welcome to the forum and I hope you enjoy your stay here and I will advice you to check out this thread  Beginners & Help + Encyclopedia [UPD: +Electrum Board it's a great to start from it has been of great help to me.",

I understand that most newbies find it difficult to open links to read. So I will give you a direct answer in addition to what have been given you already. My answers are in the context of the forum.What is merit? Merit system is a system introduced by the admin of the forum to curtail the rate of spamming in the forum, it also encourages quality posting and conversation in the forum and then enables the growth of the members in the forum in terms of ranks.Why do you need merits Merit is not compulsory that you must have it, but if you want to grow from one level to another you need it to be able to rank up.How do you get merits You get merits by making quality posts, though quality post is totally subjective because what is quality to me might not be quality to the second man below my reply.  But try your best to make posts that solve problems, answer questions and generally contribute to an ongoing discussions. With that you can be able to recieve merits. You have a good stat, 2 posts, 2 activities, 2 merits. I wish you would keep it up and not betray the kind gesture of Ognasty.",

What is Merit and how do we get and what is a benefit Merit is basically a special key to up everyone profile rank. Which you will get only based on your post quality and informative . Now let's talk about its benefits. This will up your rank.  Although activity is also required to rank up but your activity will automatically increase after a certain period of time after you post something.  So it's not a big problem. If you get many merits in a short period of time, it makes everyone think that you are a wise person . If your rank is Sr or above.  And if you have a consistent of regular getting merit history, you've more likely to be accepted into Good and Longterm Signatures campaign And these have many more benefits like these. hope you understand why need merit and what is the benefit",
