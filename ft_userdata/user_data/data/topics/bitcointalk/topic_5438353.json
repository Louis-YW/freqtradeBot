It's short enough for many people to get involved, and also covering very general useful topics, instead of focusing just on one aspect and diving deeply into it.I've looked into the website, and it seems that Saylor Academy is a product of Michael Saylor, so if the op means him as Chad, that's probably true.But this guy is a billionaire, so he probably doesn't need a hand in making his course popular, and he is also weird and not consistently pro-Bitcoin. While he is pro-Bitcoin now, it seems he was very wrong about Bitcoin in 2013 (as well as about online gambling, btw).",

This means prior to history, not Bitcoin's actual or direct history.So it's not like saying the motor car was a project with a 6000 year history, because the first wheel was invested then. But it would be true that the pre-history to the motor car includes when the first wheel was invented. Because without the wheel being invented creating a car would more or less be impossible (at least at present). So yes, Bitcoin's pre-history can include anything relevant to what made Bitcoin possible.Anything from maths, tcp ip, sha256, cryptography, distributed networks, digital currency. Basically anything related to it. Unless you think Bitcoin was created without any consideration of any developments prior to it? For example, Satoshi created Bitcoin without any consideration of the development of mathematics or cryptography? Obviously this is complete nonsense, Bitcoin's creation depended on various other factors.",
