There have been top investors in the traditional finance space that have talked down on bitcoin and showed to have little knowledge of it and there are people in the most remote areas who have good knowledge of how it works.Sensitizing people about an investment is not a popular strategy, sort of like going to market real estate investment or some other form of investment.- Jay -",

In this case will sensitising people in this areas be a vain adventure following their ¬†mindset.The comparison of Bitcoin with ponzi schemes has nothing to do with rural areas in those countries you mentioned it's actually lack of interest from the people you had contact with. There is hardly a place you go to in a country like Nigeria and see young people atleast not having a Mobile phone or asses to the internet.But depending on people's knowledge or interest some just writes Bitcoin off as a Ponzi scheme. I have a brother who is in the UK that feels same way and he isn't interested in getting to know more.",

I don‚Äôt blame them since the nature of their work is very far different than Bitcoin technology.Urban Area awareness should be the priority since this the place which Bitcoin investment is more suitable rather than the people that working on different field because the success rate of adaptation his high with people that has a good background on technology especially crypto.",

I don't know if any one has had similar encounter In time past.The adoption rate in rural areas will definitely be low because of certain factors like the exposure to internet. Most of these rural communities are faced by the challenges of having poor or no internet access up to the fact that even commercial banks are not close to them. So trying to spread adoption of bitcoin to this various places is certainly going to be difficult. Most of these people also rely on solely on government policies and with the government strongly against bitcoin it would still be hard to get them into it. Because most of the stereotypes spread around bitcoin is that it doesn‚Äôt have an office and these are people that actually believe only on things they see. So the only people that would have aid the adoption of bitcoin easily in these areas would have been the government",

Again urban citizens will have more advantage with better Internet.In rural areas, when locals exposed to cryptocurrency, they can adapt to it quickly but they are more vulnerable to scams because they are less educated and more naively to believe in promising projects and might let their greediness blurs their minds.

Locals in rural areas will be exposed to this market and joined it like when people who went to people who sell vegetables, fishes at spontaneous small markets in rural areas started to join stock market.They are not educated enough or no educated about this market and they only join with FOMO, greed, zero knowledge, you can guess what ending will wait them after a few months.I believe rural areas will be important but locals must prepare more before joining the market.

The only way is to tell them the whole truth about Bitcoin and let them decide what to do with the information.¬† Most of these scam schemes show them videos or pictures of people that have made money from the project.
