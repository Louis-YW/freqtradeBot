Then, you would tear apart a test jig to understand how to send commands to theÂ  hashboard and receive the nonce.Once you have the nonce you have to know how to send that to your pool for credit. Somewhere around the second or third step you're going to figure out how to fiddle with little things like frequency and voltage too get your desired effects.That's just a high level, back of the envelope, look at the top of the iceberg.",

But you allow that pirated software in your pool, go figure.Five things:1) You are replying to something I wrote more than 2 months ago 2) When have I been passive about the license violation?I'm the only one who is active about it.As I have stated before a number of times in the past, the catch is the GPL doesn't apply in China ...3) Yes Bitmain violate the license, as I keep saying about all the miners.'Technically' even you do since you used the opensource code to help write your miner in a different language then close sourced it 4) It took me about an hour to work out the version rolling plus everything else in the work protocol of the s19(but someone else also took time to dump the data for me)5) You allow all cgminer license violations on your pool.I block all the ones I know about who also make false claims about not violating the license and have never released any code.",

They're not obliged to tell you anything & can use whatever software/hardware they want, & then you can do what you want with it.That aside, there's a lot of info/documentation on their asic chips lately. Tons of folks are soldering them to their own PCB's. We're already seeing many projects with one or two asics on small pcb's controlled by some small mcu or via serial by a pc, next they're going to put 5 on a board, next 10, then you're going to have full fledged open source s19 type machines. It won't change anything though - The vast majority of the cost of a sha256d miner is in the asic development/wafer printing - even if you hand crafted a shad256d miner asic by asic, resistor by resistor, etc, custom controller board, etc with your own soldering iron - the cost would be similar to MSRP for a s19, for example. Bitmain is selling those machines for very, very close to their production cost. Just in case you're thinking it's cheaper to build your own miners.To answer your question though, how much to hack a fan control? That's more of a reverse engineering job than development, reversing costs are generally much cheaper than programming. I'd say not as much as you'd think, plenty of forums with lots of talented reversers who'd probably work with you for a few thousand US. If you want a custom pcb controller board with tested, quality software, you'd need to start adding 0's to the price.",

Now Artemis3 being Braiins's representative shouldn't be going around telling other pools what should and what should not, I can do it since I am not affiliated with any pools or firwamre. On a side but related note, what firmware do you actually block? I have tested one which you are most likely blocking and it mined just fine on your pool, not saying your claim is invalid, maybe your code is broken? , and please, don't start with all the personal attacks I am asking a simple question with no hidden agenda.",
