This is what I saw and I took the screenshot of 1 input and 1 output transaction. The result is $18.91 dollar at 267.233 sat/byte as fee rate.When the mempool is not taking up to $3 right now for 1 input and 2 outputs. The fee rate for high priority is 31 sat/vbyte. But on your link website that you posted, it is 267.233 sat/byte. Not even in sat/vbyte but in transaction size.",

I guess this was earlier in the day because the fees were higher then, but later on as the day went on the fees became normal.

When using the mempool to observe transaction fees, you do not need to be in a rush to make a transaction, when the fees are high, you simply need to be patient because they always come back down.There was a time I observed the mempool for close to five days before I could make a transaction  , Observation can take longer.",

Still the prices will remain same, that's if it's not just a speculation that isn't worth it.Transaction fee depends on transaction size (assume it is same for a same transaction) and fee rate. Fee rate can be chosen by a sender and that bot gives you different suggested fee rate, which I see is enough.QuoteFor now the price seems okay and I don't know why you may be trying to keep track to make decisions that concern trading when you know fully well that it may remain steady until some weeks nearing the end of this month.When you make an on chain transaction, you have need to move your bitcoin, and what you pay for transaction fee is bitcoin or satoshi, not $.I really fail to see how a transaction fee for one transaction relates to market price or its volatility.",

Bitcoin users buy and sell at intervals and will be very interested in how price changes. In this forum for example we have campaign managers who send out weekly payment and fees affect how much they will pay to do that, some participants who receive payments send them out to exchange wallet and ate dependent on tx fees as well.Traders are actually those least bothered about fees. Most of their transactions are within an exchange and don't cost any fees until they wish you withdraw to their wallets.- Jay -",
