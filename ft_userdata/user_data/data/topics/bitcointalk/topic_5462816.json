  "content": "Bitcointalk is a well-known forum in the crypto industry where being a reputable member is like a dream for many. There are some security measures that can be taken to protect your bitcoin talk account from being stolen or hacked. A user can add secret questions, and stake their BTC address in the forum to protect their account. Despite this sometimes accounts got hacked and are taken by hackers. So why don't we add a Google authentication option as a security feature to the forum? This could prevent from account being stolen if the user never showed up after a long period of inactivity or his password has been compromised.",

A legendary account that has records of trading or something similar is a good target to attack if they want to scam someone. A good example is also given above. Adding more security features is always a welcome addition as long as it doesn't compromise anything else imo.",

I have read almost every comment on that thread and I have seen that theymos also gave merits to that post of PowerGlove and that shows that he's interested in implementing that feature on the forum. The only reason he might be delaying that thing can be the issue of slow down or maybe he's still busy these days with some other projects. I don't think that Google Authentication would be a good choice for 2FA on the forum. We can search for open source solutions instead that would allow us to complete the 2FA. We can also go with the open source app named \"AuthPass\" as that one can be more reliable for us. There are many such open source 2FA solutions that we can choose and some of them are cross platform supported as well.",
