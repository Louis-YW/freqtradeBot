I need some help Electrum will allow you to see the seed phrase only if it was generated by Electrum itself.  If you imported a Bip39 seed phrase that was generated by Blockchain.info, a hardware wallet, or some other desktop wallet, Electrum will not store the seed phrase (only the master private key) and therefor you will not be able to display the seed phrase.At this point I suggest you create a new wallet, write down the seed phrase, store it someplace safe, then send all the funds from your old wallet to the new one.Electrum has an indicator at the bottom right of the window which will let you know if you have an Electrum seed phrase or not:",
