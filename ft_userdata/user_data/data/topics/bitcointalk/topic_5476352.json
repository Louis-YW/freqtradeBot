  "content": "You've all probably heard the stories on Bitcoin's value. Stories that portray Bitcoin not only as valuable, but precious. Stories by which buying bitcoins is one of the smartest things you can do. Well, all of that is just cheap propaganda. A bait to lure you to buy something worthless.Bitcoins cannot be eaten or drunk. They cannot be seen like artwork or heard like music. They cannot be used to operate computers and execute specific tasks like computer software. They cannot be driven like a car or worn like jewelry. In short, bitcoins have no intrinsic value. When you buy them, you only get a short record, e.g. '5.1234 BTC'.If someone issued a record and offered it to the public, they must redeem it. The record has to have redemption value. Casino chips, fiat currencies, shares, or gift cards are examples of such records. When you hold them, all you can see is a short string of characters written on a digital, plastic or paper media. There is nothing intrinsically valuable to consume or utilize. That's why their issuers must redeem them for something.Casinos redeem their chips for cash. Banks redeem their currencies for debt servicing and liens release. Namely, the units of fiat currencies are issued as debt owed to banks - individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds. That's why the banks redeem deposits and banknotes for reducing or closing that debt and releasing liens on the property that secures it. Corporations, if they decide to end their business operations, redeem their shares for funds from liquidated assets. Finally, retailers redeem their gift cards for goods or services.On the other hand, Satoshi Nakamoto, as the issuer of bitcoins, does not redeem them. He issues them through the protocol he wrote, but never redeems from anyone. If you invested electricity to make his system work and got bitcoins for it, Nakamoto won't redeem them even for a dime. Everyone who holds bitcoins knows this. They know that bitcoins have neither redemption nor intrinsic value. They know that bitcoins are worthless. That is why they are forced to get rid of them. Sell them to someone else. And to do this successfully, they need to publicly promote Bitcoin as valuable. They need to compare it to gold, diamonds or artwork. They must say it is the superior version of fiat currencies or money in general. That it can save us from greedy banks. That it is revolutionary like the Internet. That it is scarce. That it solves corruption or financial and economic problems. That it can lift poor countries out of poverty. They need to sugarcoat Bitcoin.All these stories are of course ridiculous. They would be such even if bitcoins were units of equity, like shares or units of debt, like fiat currencies. But bitcoins are units of the number 21 million. Nakamoto came up with it in his imagination and wrote a protocol for assigning its units to online addresses and storing them in a decentralized database.Numbers, whether they are stored centrally or decentrally, don't have magical powers. They cannot solve corruption, play the role of artwork or precious metals, lift countries out of poverty, save us from banks, or be scarce. They cannot be money if they are non-redeemable because there's nothing to compare with the value of goods and services. Those who make up or spread such stories know very well they are ridiculous. But they do it out of necessity. They invested huge amounts of redeemable or intrinsically valuable items into the scheme and it is necessary for them to get such items back. On the one hand, they don't want to be the bag holders. On the other hand, they want to profit from the scheme as much as possible. And that is literally all the wisdom behind the stories on Bitcoin's value.",

Here are short snippet from his other thread,Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5474861.0Quote from: JamesNZ on November 21, 2023, 08:05:11 AMFinally, crypto units cannot be drunk, eaten, built into products, worn as jewelry, viewed as a picture or movie, or listened to as music. In short, they do not have an intrinsic value that creates a certain amount of benefit through the fulfillment of human needs, for this benefit to serve as a reference for the value of these units.Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472154.0Quote from: JamesNZ on October 30, 2023, 05:59:29 AMLet's therefore assume that those 100 units are 100 apples. Apples can fulfill the purpose of nutrion. By knowing that purpose, you can evaluate whether it is worth giving your bike for those 100 units. The same is true for other products that have historically been money - livestock, grain, wine, fur, metals, etc. All these products were able to fulfill purposes beyond serving as a medium of exchange. That was then used for estimating how many other products to give for them.Source: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467415.0Quote from: JamesNZ on September 20, 2023, 05:13:05 AMFor example. By wheat having a nutritional purpose, speculators approximately know how valuable it is to consumers and whether prices are cheap or expensive. Similarly, by fiat currencies having the purpose of paying debt to the banks and by debtors facing foreclosures in case of default, speculators know these currencies are worth to debtors somewhere in the range of pledged collaterals. Meaning, they will not trade houses for a specific number of currency units if they see that banks take cars as collateral when issuing that number of units.But since OP bother rewrite his points, moderator couldn't just delete/lock the duplicated threads.",

Before Bitcoin there were many other coins in the crypto currency market but all the other coins could not get the attention of the investors and investors did not see anything special in any of the other coins that would make an investor prefer another coin. The value of Bitcoin and the popularity of Bitcoin were not like that in the beginning, if we dig through history we find some information that proves that Bitcoin was not a valuable coin to people at that time. A man paid a huge amount of bitcoins to buy just two pizzas. Imagine the position of the person who paid a large amount of BTC in exchange for two pizzas and the person who received a large amount of BTC in exchange for the pizza.

Intrinsic value is the perceived value of a particular thing and for sure demand is enough to support such things. With artwork perhaps, it is just a drawing and anyone could do it but why are some artworks has a huge value? It is because of demand; that there are people who would buy it for an amazing price simply because there are people who appreciates it. Same thing goes with Bitcoin wherein this community perceives high value of it which supports the increase on its price. It may not be having a physical value but there is a community which still generates the demand of it regardless of whether they will just ride the tide or they will use it in actual transaction. As long as there is an appreciation then there's a demand, therefore creating a value.",

A bait to lure you to buy something worthless.People who have something to impose or promote always make use of propaganda, it is not a new term for us, even governments are making propagandas in order to keep their citizens in check.  Whether Bitcoin is worthless depends on the person, since I believe that a person's junk can be another person's treasure.QuoteBitcoins cannot be eaten or drunk. They cannot be seen like artwork or heard like music. They cannot be used for text or image editing like computer software. They cannot be driven like a car or worn like jewelry. In short, bitcoins have no intrinsic value.But Bitcoin can be traded to buy such things.  Bitcoin can be used to exchange for cash to buy food, hire people to create artwork, and compose music.  Buy a text or image editing computer software and even buy a car and property.  In which point does Bitcoin not have an intrinsic value?  You may not see Bitcoin to have intrinsic value but more people than you see Bitcoin have it even a certain country declares that Bitcoin is a legal tender.  As we all know intrinsic value is subjective so you cannot push your argument to others whether Bitcoin has intrinsic value or not.",

      "body": "Stories, stories, stories. Everybody is just telling stories.Is there any person on Earth who doesn't want to sell their bitcoins at one time in the future? No, no such person exists. Everybody must sell their bitcoins simply because, as explained in the opening post, Nakamoto doesn't redeem them nor they are intrinsically valuable for someone to be able to satisfy their needs with them. So what is the point of all those stories about their value if everybody wants to get rid of them exactly because they know bitcoins have no value? Well, the point is simple: to lure as many suckers as possible and dump them worthless coins at as a high a price as possible.So, please stop with this nonsense stories. At least in this topic. Just admit why you're all here and move on.",
