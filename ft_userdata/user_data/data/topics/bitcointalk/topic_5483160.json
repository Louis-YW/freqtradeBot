  "content": "Today I read the news the govt of USA took a decision to sell approximately $130 million worth of BTC linked to Silk Road forfeitures.Source: fintelegram.comThey are focusing on ongoing legal repercussions which are associated with illegal activities. Those BTC linked to Ryan Farace aka Xanaxman and Sean Bridges both of them are part of a larger effort to combat money laundering and suspicious transactions. Farace and his father Joseph, who were convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and they tried to transfer a vast sum of BTC to an overseas account.US government’s investigation team found a hidden connection to Bridges, who is a former Secret Service agent involved in the Silk Road investigation, his name adds more complexity to the case. The court ordered them to forfeit their bitcoin, Although Bridges agreed to return the stolen bitcoins to US agents, Farace and his father claimed not to have access to the bitcoins used for darknet transactions, lol..What do you think, how will be the impact of the market, good or bad?looks like they have enough resources to make the bottoms they want.",

      "body": "Technically, it's a lot of money but comparing it to the institutions, it's definitely peanuts. If we see the impact of it, there could be a slight move but compared to what the institutions sell-offs and buy orders. There is no doubt that they've got that much. And if the seized one are going to be sold, it is for sure that many would come to take it as it's like cleaned already by the government as it's obviously because it came from them. WHat matters there is the amount of Bitcoin that will be put up on sale.",

Anyway, I am not convinced that this sell - actually it is a bidding so no selling the BTC in the open market - will have NO impact in the price of Bitcoin short-term or long-term. This is just a news of the government getting rid of something they acquired or confiscated.",

This is just a news of the government getting rid of something they acquired or confiscated. Whatever they sell on the open market or they use OTC that doesn't mater. is $130M a big number?the significant daily sale by Grayscale is amounting to 5x than the so-called $130M sale related to Silk Road forfeitures. Where such consistent large-scale sales from Grayscale struggle to influence potential short-term price movements, $130 million is the equivalent of dust compared to the Grayscale dump!By the way, don't you guys know what is the per-day transaction of Bitcoin?look coinmarketcap, more than ~16 Billion bitcoins are traded every day and we are speculating with their 130M dust LoL...",
