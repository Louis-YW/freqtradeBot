Like cash or bank transfer? In any case, it is not a very simple thing.",

Even if the OP has no history or reputation on the forum the deal could hypothetically be done through a trusted escrow. The only advantage I see of doing it here on the forum is that it would be P2P, which is not small if he cares about his privacy, but if not, there are entities that can give him the loan putting the Bitcoin as collateral.The other issue, OP, is that it is a very large amount, and the lenders on the forum will have seen or will soon see your post. If there is someone with that amount willing to do the deal they will contact you or post here, but I think any of the lenders here have a lot of track record and great reputation.",

There are MANY institutional lenders that take BTC as collateral but they have a lot of locations where they do not operate.At that amount of money and depending on where you are in the world here are a few options.https://www.coinbase.com/borrowhttps://unchained.com/loans/https://saltlending.com/Without knowing where in the world you are located it's tough to make a recommendation.Keep in mind a lot of these are 1 way collateral holds so if you give them 110% to get your loan and BTC goes down you will have to give them more or pay off that chunk of the loan to keep the 110%. If BTC goes up, they don't let you withdraw. -Dave",

      "body": "Assuming that you actually own at least 10 bitcoins and are serious about requesting a loan, you are most likely required to specify the method by which you want to receive that amount, bank transfer, cash, quick transfer, or any other method, and specify the interest rate on the loan, after mentioning the loan term. In the best case, the lender will ask you to sign a message from the address where you store the bitcoins and split the loan amount into several small amounts to make it easier for you to get the amount you want.The amount is huge, and frankly, I do not believe that you actually owns a similar amount in Bitcoin, and if you do, what would you need to take a loan from the forum? According to your posting history, a year ago you were selling tickets to Bitcoin conference in Miami.",

      "body": "gordonics.comI saw people do loans on here but I wasn't really insinuating one on here. Im not sure how it works and it seems risky for me but not the lender. I would supply btc as collateral and would deposit first so im really just trusting this unknown lender. I am located in the US. you asked where i was while earning all those bitcoins. I purchased my biggest portion in 2014 as just a buyer and have hodled ever since. of course have bought throughout the years algo but mainly from 2014 buying. Im actually now trying to borrow $500k. I am buying a house i have under contract for $475k plus closing costs in my city. I have got a loan from the liquity protocol with my ethereum before so i was kind of looking for something similiar with bitcoin but it seems alot of the defi lenders use Eth and not bitcoin. yeah i was trying for cash, wire transfer to basically buy this house i have under contract. Poker Player - i dont necessarily care too much about privacy but i kinda am trying to avo.,,.id ta,..xes . No one has contacted me through messages. it would be great to borrow from someone but i dont see that I can trust someone to do so from my end in all honesty. I suppose im a newbie on this platform with limited posts but have been in crypto since 2014 but only as a hodler. DaveFIm based in the US. checking unchained.com/loans and saltlending. thankscoinbase stopped borrowing as I was going to just bite the bullet and use them. really didn't want to for tax reasons but i really want this property. thanks for recommendations. appreciate itKavelj22i actually need $500k now lol. I do own decent amount of bitcoins and am serious lol. Im not asking for anyone in here to lend me the funds but recommendations as I figured there were bitcoin pros in here. I have a decent amount of btc that i have hodled and got in somewhat fairly early. I wasn't necessarily asking for anyone in here to lend me the money as that seems risky on my part , not the lender because I would be the one providing the collateral over 100%.  I was kind of asking for suggestions for any defi sites or reputable cefi platforms. I swore i would never use a cefi platform because we all saw what happened with a few cefi platforms.  I see you don't believe me , bro im not trying to sell myself to you or prove to you anything, do i just post a screenshot to shut a random internet guy up? um yeah i've gone twice to the btc conf in miami. not sure what that has to do with anythingagain bro i was asking for any suggestions for other sites you guys would recommend that you've used to borrow on btcDireWolfM14multiple alts? im really not sure what you are implying",

You can name it as you want. You call it negativity, we can call it suspicious, skeptical, mistrustful...The main thing is that you get what you want and as I mentioned above, your thread doesn't have to be open. Cheers.",
