They tend to keep a lower profile, so not even sure who is most responsible for their actions.Mark KarpelesBilly Markus & Jackson Palmer. Despite not doing a whole lot of anything, they started the dumb altcoin trend which lives on to this day.The ETH DAO exploiter for forever changing what is acceptable in this space. If you lose money just fork the blockchain!I wouldn't include some of those altcoin/DeFi developers.",

And as you can see the countless sh*tcoins that pops with his name on it like Dogelon coin.I'm not sure to what extent Elon Musk influenced it, but it's also undeniable that his interest in Dogecoin has made it incredibly volatile. However, based on the list provided by the OP, I believe the people listed above add positive value to the products they create rather than creating hype and pump and dump trends. Another view is that if Elon Musk performs better in this market, then I think in the future he will gain more trust and, in addition to that, create effects.",

This shit thinks that he can get away easily to the poor judgement that he did to resolve Luna UST attack.

They're the ones who made the earliest steps which Satoshi made use of. I guess it would also be good if we include Laszlo Hanyecz since he was the first man to spend Bitcoin on something. I wouldn't be giving too much credit to those who came into the scene with no other thing in mind than make profit. They're nothing but selfish individuals.",

Where is faketoshi aka CSW, this guy was creating so much noise in the crypto when this faketoshi claimed so many times to be the real satoshi nakamoto. How stupid people who are still following this faketoshi right now. This needs to be added in that list to make sure people know if the faketoshi was exist. The second one must be elon musk. I do believe if you know that so well how big the impact created by elon when meme trend was happening. With only on tweet from him and yeah bunch of meme tokens appeared in the market and mostly of these tokens were scam and spam tokens.",

You must learn and prepare knowledge for yourself. Investment decisions should be made from your knowledge, your research and your carefully consideration. Even so, you will get lot of losses from your investment. I think the odds between successful and failed investment is 20/80 or even smaller.If you only invest in Bitcoin and has ability hold it more than 4 years, you will succeed.https://hodl.camp/",

He did literally influenced a lot of people with his scamming tactic.He made everyone believed that all of his creations were good but eventually turned into a scam.

I don't follow some of the guy here since I'm not familiar with their project that much, and maybe this list can help me on analyzing new projects, hoping that those influential people in crypto space will use it to educate more people and not just to spread fud and hype.",

He did managed to bring twitter price down, he would probably drag the price down to take it from the board members for cheaper price that what he previously bid.So the reason why he made a lot of enemy though but still he is influencial in crypto. Didnt he made millions out of doge?",
