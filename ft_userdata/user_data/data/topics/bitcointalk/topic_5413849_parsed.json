There won't be any more halvings where there is a constant spike in bitcoin's price prior to the halving. 4. As long as bitcoin is still in existence, miners can continue to support themselves by earning transaction fees after a transaction is included in a block. 5.

Average fees earned per block is somewhere in the region of 0.1 - 0.2 BTC at the moment. By the 9th halving, the block subsidy will be 0.09765625 BTC, which will mean it will be less than the average fees. This will happen around 2044, so only 20 years away. Another few halvings after that and the block subsidy will be ~10% of the total fees. If fees aren't enough to maintain the security of the network alone (as will be the case in 2140), then it is very unlikely that fees +10% will be enough to maintain the security of the network, which is scenario which will be reached in the lifetime of many (or even most) current bitcoin users.I think the combination of the increasing value of bitcoin coupled with most smaller transactions moving to layer two, resulting in the base layer being used predominantly for larger transactions and channel opening/closing and therefore larger fees being acceptable, will be enough for fees alone to maintain the security of the network.There is some very interesting discussion about this in the following forum thread and on the dev mailing list:\"Surprisingly, Tail Emission Is Not Inflationary\" -- A post by Peter Toddhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-July/020665.html",

Another few halvings after that and the block subsidy will be ~10% of the total fees. This opens up a new perspective in the discussion, which I had not thought of before now.At the current block reward of 6.25BTC, miners averagely earn $122k - $125. Using the current average rate of one Bitcoin. If you include the tx fee, that's an extra ~$3k.For the reward of mining to remain commensurate with the current value (in USD), i.e, 0.15BTC giving miners about the same amount they are earning now, which is ~$125k, then the value of 1 Bitcoin needs to rise to above $800k. That's a huge leap from the current price levels.Would we likely be seeing $1 million to 1BTC within the next 25-30 years?Quote from: 348Judah on September 18, 2022, 06:59:27 PMOP, you just registered your account, don't you think tou need to engage some forum search in other to take survey on aspects like this related to your question maybe it had been talked about?

That's a huge leap from the current price levels.This is based on the assumption that total fees per block will remain static, which as I mentioned above, I don't think they necessarily will.We already know that block space is too limited as it stands to scale bitcoin to global usage, which is why second layer solutions are being developed. Currently, almost all of my transactions pay a fee of <5 sats/vbyte. If I'm paying for a coffee, fast food, or some other small transaction, then a fee much higher than that starts to become a significant amount of the transaction and therefore unacceptable to me. Let's say, however, that I move all my coffee buying on to Lightning. Now I can pay a fee of 50 sats/vbyte to open a channel, and then buy 100 coffees through that channel before I need to close it. In this scenario I have saved money on fees by paying 0.5 sats/vbyte per each of my 100 transactions, but at the same time I have paid 10x what I would usually pay for the block space.So provided there is enough demand for block space to support things like opening/closing Lightning channels at a higher fee rate (which is still economical for the end user), as well as very large transactions which will pay a higher fee for the added security of being on the base layer, then the fees paid could increase by an order of magnitude or more, while individual users still pay less by moving most of their transactions on to Lightning.In this scenario then fees per block could total 1-2 BTC, rather than 0.1-0.2 BTC (example numbers), meaning a price of $80k rather than $800k in your example.",

Nothing will change except that there will no longer be any new bitcoins.The change will be that all mining revenue will come from transaction fees, as opposed to a percentage of revenue under the status quo. As oeleo discusses above, it is likely that the majority of mining revenue will come from transaction fees in the next several halvings, and nearly all revenue will come from fees well before the block subsidy goes to zero.I suspect that transaction fees on a per block basis will likely rise over time (up until a point at which the market will no longer support higher tx fees) as adoption of bitcoin increases. The specific timing when transaction fees will make up the majority of revenue can be debated, but I think most would agree that this will happen sometime in the next few decades.",

There would also still be a percentage coming from block rewards, at least for the next 30-90 years. And the significance of that could get much higher with increasing value. Maybe even to the last coinbase reward being claimed.I've always had the perspective that the rewards to mining requirements ratio, is a system that can regulate itself, especially as there are so many years between now and the finite supply and many gradual decrements between now and then.",

So, no one knows, and no one can tell you if bitcoin will even exist after miners stop getting paid via freshly-mined bitcoins. Staunch bitcoiners like myself expect that transaction fees will be enough to incentivize miners to continue providing security to the network, but for that, the price of bitcoin in fiat terms needs to go up considerably so that transactions fees would also be a sufficient amount to replace bitcoin block subsidy. However, the problem with high transaction fees (in fiat terms, not in bitcoin units terms) is that the base layer will become almost unusable for people wanting to transfer tiny sums, forcing them to switch to something more economically reliable, for example, sidechains, layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network or even alternative blockchains. So, in the future people will conduct most, if not all, of their transactions outside the base layer (the Bitcoin blockchain), which naturally will result in such undesirable outcomes as a decrease in security, privacy, censorship-resistance, and decentralization. The Bitcoin network will remain robust and decentralized and will be used for settlements of large transactions, but these transactions will no longer be a representation of individuals exchanging with other individuals.",

Maybe even to the last coinbase reward being claimed.Agree with the first sentence, but not as far as the last coinbase reward. For the last 10 halvings (or ~40 years), the block subsidy will be under 1000 sats. For 1000 sats to even be worth $100, then a single bitcoin would have to be worth $10 million. The coinbase reward will be irrelevant in the grander scheme of things long before the last coinbase reward.Quote from: witcher_sense on September 19, 2022, 06:37:52 AMSo, in the future people will conduct most, if not all, of their transactions outside the base layer (the Bitcoin blockchain), which naturally will result in such undesirable outcomes as a decrease in security, privacy, censorship-resistance, and decentralization.Not necessarily.

By the way this not the first this kind thread has been created and different answers have been given to the question. In my own way of answering the questions is that the 21m BTC can not be exhausted because it is circulating everyday that is, transaction is moving around 24hrs. If you are not selling, another person is selling and if you are not buying another person is buying so the circulation of bitcoin is 24 hours. And nobody can buy and keep bitcoin in his wallet for years. You must buy something so exchange is always there. And another thing again. As far as people are mining bitcoin, it will never exhausted. And people must mine. One thing people need to understand is that bitcoin is not a goods that you pay but it is an asset.",

People who move millions, yea, but nobody is going to pay even a $500 yearly subscription at these levels.It's the opposite way, it's not like fees will have! to compensate for the reward, it will be how much people will want to pay in fees and from this, we will find out how much of the block reward will be replaced by those fees.  For a brief period in 2021 the average fee went to 60 with the network clogged completely, this won't last for more than a month simply nobody is going to pay those forevers, there won't be any constant pressure to pay that much, they will simply abandon transacting alltoghehter.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 18, 2022, 08:27:48 PMNow I can pay a fee of 50 sats/vbyte to open a channel, and then buy 100 coffees through that channel before I need to close it.

Even if we say that bitcoin goes to $1 million, and you can open a Lightning channel in a transaction of a few hundred vbytes in size, then with a fee rate of 1 sat/vbyte you are looking at $2-3 to open a channel. Even if we go up an entire order of magnitude say it's going to cost you $30 to open a channel, if I then use that channel to make a few hundred transactions over a period of months, then it is overall it is still cheaper than had I made all the transactions individually.You can always rebalance channels, and there are new developments such as channel factories and Eltoo which allow multi-user channels. With enough global adoption of bitcoin, there will be enough volume on the base layer simply from opening and closing Lightning channels (or some other layer two mechanism) to maintain the security of the network.It may be that a further block size increase is needed in the future, but we are nowhere near that stage yet.",
