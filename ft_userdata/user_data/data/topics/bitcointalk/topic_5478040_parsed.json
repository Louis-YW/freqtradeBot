What you earn from discussions is knowledge, every-other thing you get from a forum is secondary.If there was any thread that gets one merit, it will be abused and eventually turn to spam.- Jay -",

If that be the case, earning merits should not be a big deal for you because you would be able to contribute meaningfully in discussions across the forum. Furthermore, there is no thread dedicated for earning merits because merit is awarded to comments deserving it irrespective of the board and thread. Many people earned most of their merits even in this beginner's board; you just have to study what those highly merited individuals are doing and you will be earning merits effortlessly. Finally, as a simple advice, if all you think about is how to earn merits from the forum, you will never enjoy the forum and it will not take long before you become frustrated and consider disappearing. The best is always to feel at home, be yourself and enjoy the forum and all the available resources. You can earn free money in the games and rounds section if you are eager to earn money. You can also join promotional games of some projects in the same gambling board. There is so much you can do in the forum... just feel free to explore the forum.",

Okay.. you wanna pretend you didn't know we've got threads that can possibly earn you a few merits on application? If no, then what's your subject topic saying?.. tchhh secondly, I don't even think you know what merit is, and with that, I don't even think you read your way through the forum properly..... Did anyone ever tell you that merit is been put in your local accounts and you withdraw them like money?? Then what's this story you're telling us? LISTEN TO ME; next time, if you wanna ask questions about how you could earn some few bucks in here, be plain.. else you're just gonna make everyone assume you as a shitty-head poster...and that's what you look like to me.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Therefore, we should not jump into earning merits because it will definitely be hard if you chase it without adequate knowledge and learning experience. But, enjoy being a newbie while you are still in the process of learning. Your merits will come later on when others would think your posts have already improved and are now high quality posts.",

Although the answer to the question you have asked is still simple, the threads that can earn you merit are the ones you don't expect.Do not put your mind to earning merit alone; otherwise, you might get bored of trying. Think of ways you can positively contribute, share new ideas, learn from others, and share your thoughts too. If your ideas are good enough on the thread you drop them, then you will be merited.",

      "body": "Here is the problem I have with your thread Jenwi. It begins with a question about how to earn merits. However, the opening post discusses how you told some friends about Bitcointalk, who then asked you how much you earned. Now, I seriously doubt they would be interested in knowing how many merits you earned. Why would that particular stat interest them? It has no value whatsoever outside of this forum, and those who aren't part of Bitcointalk wouldn't care about what happens with it. They probably asked you how much money, aka, bitcoin you earned, didn't they?To answer the question you asked in your title, there isn't one specific type of posts/threads that earn people merits. There is a whole list of things you can do. No matter how you look at it, you will have to be willing to invest time and/or knowledge to get it right. Unless people can see from your posts that you know what you are talking about and that you spent time articulating your thoughts properly, they will rarely merit you.My tip, begin reading and learning about bitcoin, which should be the reason you are here. After that, start browsing the forum and participate in the discussions with other people in a natural and honest way. When you have made yourself familiar with the forum and its different boards, you will notice that there are people who create threads with various stats. They get merits. Some other folks hunt for scammers, and they also receive merits. Other people create detailed tutorials or report on the most important news and developments relating to Bitcoin. They get merited by people who find those posts pleasant to read. You can even get merits for being funny.You have to find your own way. That's how you will succeed in what you want. We can't tell you what do to except open your eyes, look around, and find what you like.",

Merits arent gonna come if you push to get that and make unnecessary post that could lead to a spam or low quality post. Well the volume of topics to be created are actually full due to a lots of topics has been discussed already. Anyways more people cna focus on response instead creating new topics. Show them your idea and contribute a good answer. Apparently merits will be on your way the least you expect it.",

There is no shortcut her Incase you are looking for a way to get to an higher rank without any input in the forum.
