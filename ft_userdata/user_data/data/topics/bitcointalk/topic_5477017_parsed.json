I began by understanding the basics of Bitcoin, then naturally followed the current. That's when I realized Bitcoin was just one piece in the world of cryptocurrencies. It led me to altcoins, and as time went on, new things like NFTs and DeFi emerged. I just kept following the developments. I believe many folks, like me, kickstarted their crypto journey with Bitcoin. It was the buzzword back then, and from there, it's been a journey of continuous learning and adapting to the evolving crypto landscape.",

Firstly, a person new to cryptocurrency should understand the risks associated with it and that it is not a get rich quick scheme because that is what new investors think of cryptocurrency. Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies profit is not always certain and it has a 50/50 chance of either profit or loss. To be successful in crypto one needs to understand it to some extent and be able to apply those knowledge in order to be successful. People new to cryptocurrency should first and foremost seek for knowledge before investing any amount in crypto and also they should only invest an amount they they can afford to lose. How to protect their wallets and assets against frauds should also be taken into account, as this is one of the biggest risks that novices in the cryptocurrency space face in their early days. There are several threads on this forum discussing how to protect ourselves from scam attacks; if you browse around, you can find some useful information. Quote from: SPARE on December 08, 2023, 09:15:44 AM By investing in cryptocurrency without understanding, they are losing all their property, so if you who are experts would say that before investing in cryptocurrencyThis happens a lot but sometimes learning the hard way is the best way to learn. No one in their right senses will indulge in anything without having knowledge about it so investing without knowledge and losing their money will teach them a lot, it will teach them not to rush into things they are not knowledgeable about. I will cost them nothing to ask experts for guidance on the basic concepts of cryptocurrency and how to embark on their crypto journey.",

Projects without purpose and meaning, regardless of the fact that they promise everything you can imagine, should be avoided at all costs.Of course, there are always exceptions, but you should remember that these are only exceptions, and also that research has shown that 95% of people who trade with cryptocurrencies end up with only losses, so you should ask yourself if you have a chance to be among those 5%? In any case, all those who want to invest in cryptocurrencies should first of all invest their time in acquiring as much knowledge and gathering information as possible. Such decisions should not be made overnight or based on what a friend or acquaintance told you, especially if someone convinces you of something that at first glance looks too good to be true.When it comes to money and earnings, even those you consider reliable and good people can change a lot, because money changes people very often for the worse.",

Many people lose money because they don't know enough about it, and in crypto, you should know everything there is to know before you start investing or trading. Investing is better than trading because trading is very high risk, and if you don't have a mind, you can't do it. So it is better you make your bitcoin investment now that you will profit even if you lose because the price of bitcoin will climb at any point and now that it is progressively increasing. If you haven't started investing in bitcoin yet, it's a good idea to do so before the bullrun. Anyone who invests in bitcoin knows that there will be times when the market doesn't go well and you'll lose your money, this isn't  mean because you're new to crypto that why you lose it's just that understanding it thoroughly will help you minimize your losses. because any investment you are doing they get some actually time that the market will misbehave and lose fund.",

All newbies should first understand that this industry isn't a quick rich industry and cryptocurrency are just currency so we should put that in mind when we're investing into them. The next advice would be to focus more on Bitcoin as that's the coin that controls the whole market and it's trusted and verified to be scam proof (you won't be scammed by the developers when investing in Bitcoin).Anybody that invest into sometimes they don't understand is putting their money at least and deserve whatever they get in return because they aren't respecting money. First understand money and then understand cryptocurrency before you start investing, doing this will help you to make good decisions like accumulating Bitcoin instead of buying tokens that'll be worthless after the incoming bull market. How to secure your Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general is very vital lesson you should learn too as alot of money is been lost yearly to scammers and hackers. protecting your investments very well will determine how successful you'll get in the space.To conclude, I'll advice you should have patience when investing in Bitcoin because those who hodl make the largest profits. Altcoins can be traded but you're taking a risk not worth it hodling them.",

The problem with this platforms is that, there is 100% risk of losing your funds is anything happens later.Learn to differentiate between centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges, this will help you a lot and also avoid exchanges that are non-custodial in nature because you can't hold the private keys or seed phrase to your coins.Learn to understand hardware wallet, software wallet and airgap device to store and manage your coins, each has its own advantage but hardware wallet and airgap device offer more conveniency and top notch security.",
