What I struggle with is understanding how close a block is to completion ?Hasrate is a flow / or volume ....But am i really getting anywhere is what Id like to know lol ?? ie 25 % complete or near Or anything to suggest its just not a heater lol.I picture somone in  a back room throwing darts and this is all imaginary lolThanks all !!",

Maybe other mining pools have an indicator where you can monitor the progress while solving a block.Actually, if you are mining solo in ckpool you don't need to worry about solving the block because what you need to do to get rewarded is to find a block. Please read the solo ckpool page.",

Ie if power goes out when solo mining are all prior efforts lost ?Is there an accumulation of equation solved that would be lost during a power outtage for example ? Would the answer be different if in a pool ?Thx !",

Ie if power goes out when solo mining are all prior efforts lost ?Is there an accumulation of equation solved that would be lost during a power outtage for example ? No when you are mining solo, until you find a block you own nothing. You will have the stats available on your ckpool worker's webpage, but it's only for your own curiosity. It's just totally random when you talk of solo mining.Look at this sentence in mikeywith's answer : Quoteblockchain has no memory and your previous hashing means nothing so every share you submit is a whole progress on its ownOf course your Antminer needs to be powered on to be able to hashQuote from: Raco on August 29, 2023, 06:08:05 AMWould the answer be different if in a pool ?You should have a look on the different btc mining payout's methods, this link could help you : PPS vs. FPPS vs. PPLNS vs. PPS+ - Mining Pool Payouts",

Would the answer be different if in a pool ?Thx !There are no equations in mining, you are not solving any sort of equations, you simply are guessing some random numbers and waiting to get lucky,  it is like rolling a dice, imagine you want to get 6 on a dice, the more you try the more likely you get 6, same with mining the more you try the more chances, if you want to stop at any moment it is fine, your future attempts are NOT related to your past at all.",
