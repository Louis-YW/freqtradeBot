My people how do we balance this two important things in our life currently now, Looking at your current income now? Is it possible to pick one and drop the other? What do you think!!  Oboy This is not a chitchat forum,   you registered yesterday, and your first move is to open topic, what happened to reading and getting acclimated to the forum and seeing how everything works and what kind of topics you should create? As much as we welcome newbies with open arms, we also make every effort to chastise those who violate certain basic principles. You mentioned in your last post that you were introduced by someone here. It's strange how most of you bring someone without providing sufficient directions, and most of these guys end up using AI or plagiarizing in an attempt to gain rank faster and get banned the next day. That being said, OP, this is not the type of topic you ought to create on a forum, and I recommend you lock it. I'm not going to report it since the moderator might nuke you because you only have two activity counts. If you want to voice your displeasure with the current state of the country, there are so many threads for such discussion that you don't have to start your own. Well I welcome you. Here is one of the thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5455008.0",
