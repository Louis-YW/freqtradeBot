What are the wagering requirements for the 150% deposit bonus? Do we need to give KYC in order to withdraw? At last players from all across the globe are eligible to play on the site or not?

Yes the level up rewards seems to be the lowest one compared to the other casinos with similar rank up reward system. Since they have said that they are in process of changing the reward system, lets see and wait the changes they make in the reward system. They should be able to provide competitive rewards in order to be competitive and attractive so new players want to come and play here.",
