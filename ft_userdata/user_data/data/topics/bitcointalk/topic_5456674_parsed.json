      "body": "using more TFs might be a bit inconvenient for many traders, bearing in mind that monitoring one TF requires a different approach from one to another. I personally use 2 TF, the first is hourly and daily. I find more suitable using this 2 TF especially when the market is a little unstable, I use more TF per hour because it's much easier to monitor the market using this TF. I just need to analyze and draw a line and determine which point to go out or enter.but for those whose style does not suit short trading, it is best to avoid TF of an hour or so, bearing in mind that the smaller the TF, the smarter you must be in determining points to sell and buy quickly. because if you choose the wrong step, in a matter of minutes your money can disappear, so one must be smart to choose a TF that suits their trading style.",

Such overview will help you to have better plan for your trading and help you to have plan B when your trading position is failed. If you trade spot, when your Plan A fails, you can use Plan B and do something like moving from Trading to Investment. It helps you to avoid loss from  Trading.Narrow time frames will help you to find good entries for your trading positions and potential exit prices to take profit as well as cut loss prices. You can not find those prices if you only look at narrow time frames and skip wide time frames.",

Our major goal is to identify good market entries, which is why I'm acquiring the skills to implement analysis using both high and low timeframes. Markets are examined using timeframes that correspond to trend lines and trading patterns. Combining several timeframes provides you a more comprehensive perspective of the market. These timeframes are typically lengthy such as one week, a month, or even a year, for the reason to understand the project's chart pattern.",

A trader is always recommended to watch the daily timezone or even higher the lower timeframes are not for the day trader. This si the reason you need to be choosey in the timeframes because using non-required timeframes can greatly impact your trade efficiency.",

Making out some positions basing with those lower TFshould really be that bias into higher ones because no matter how well you do put up those indicators on lower time frame but it doesnt correlate or fit out on higher TF's then it would be invalid.You cant really be able to make analysis well if you do make out some comparison. This is why making analysis in between is recommended if you are really that trying to find for some good entry.You cant really just having a single focus because it wouldnt really be that able to give out good results. Try to zoom out and you would be finding which one would be the most sensible thing to be done.",

If you are a day trader, you must first examine the higher time time frame to identify the market structure and figure out if you are long or short, and if you are short, you must next examine the lower timeframe for a short setup. There are also occasions where a solid setup exists in lower tf but not in higher tf; I normally don't trade with such way. I know it works occasionally, but it fails the majority of the time. It is better to always look at the higher time frame while trading because it is stronger than lower time frames.",

Like for example if you check quicker timeframes, such as 1-3-5-10 minutes, that means you want to do intraday trading, if possible leverage, like x100 or something (advice to do lower) and maybe even as quick as buying and selling within 1 hour if possible. However, if you do 30 minutes, 1 hour, or few hours, that means you might be looking into longer term trades, like you can hold it for a few days at least, maybe as much as a week or more. The longer you keep, it becomes investment and not trading, because I believe someone who held something for over a month means they invested into it, that shouldn't be considered trading. So the timeframes on charts, should equal timeframe on when you want to buy and how quickly you want to sell.",

This is more reason why I like to use at least 5 timeframes for trading, which will surely increase my chance of capturing the true psychology of the market at that time. And you know what? All of them must agree on a particular direction before I pull the trigger.TBVH (to be very honest) i am so amazed to read that you use 5 timeframes before making entry into the market, i wonder, you must have so much money or do you care about your winning rate that much because As Far As i remember, i never watched 5 timeframes to make any trade. all i do is, check the daily timeframe and monthly timeframe maybe sometimes, weekly too, but before doing that i prefer to analyze the market sentiments overall. Like, for now, weekly charts might be indicating a good profit because manipulation was its highs and still market recovered quickly and approached to $27k in that journey, i know that before every halving of BTC, there comes big dumps that might be manipulated or artificial ones but their occurrence does impact the profit ratio.So, keeping that in my mind, plus the fundamental analysis too, i perform trading. still with DCA and stop loss. Even by following all of these indicators i never made big profits even mostly i have been in a loss. So, for now, i gave up on the market and doing holding. Plus, i totally, I agree with your strategy plan, if you always stick to one strategy despite the knowledge of the overall market situation you will definitely going to be liquidated. So, i recently read a topic ->  I found a trading strategy that blew my mind! and every single member guided him to not rely on this single strategy only. But i think, things will become more complex when you chose multiple timeframes, well at least it becomes difficult for me, maybe i am not that much smart maybe i do not want to give it that much try. Well, looking forward to getting more from your experience. please next time share an example too.",
