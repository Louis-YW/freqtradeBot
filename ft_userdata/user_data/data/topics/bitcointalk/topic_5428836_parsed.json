Well, greedy people could think they become rich if that will happen without thinking of the possible scam in the end. Unfortunately, this always happens,s and many people got fooled and lose their money despite several warnings spread to the forum in regards to scam tricks, they still ignore it until such time it arrives. Like to say X1000 ROI from early investors when staking. It is really tempting...I can really feel it because I've once been a victim of this trick before. And it was not stopped because many people remain ignorant.",

Many new projects say that their project is the best that will provide the greatest profit for investors. But with time, we will find that what they say is false and only want to deceive investors.As new traders, we are required to be able to learn to analyze every project that we want to use as an investment so that that project won't fool us. Even if you can gather a lot of information, it doesn't guarantee that the project will run successfully because a lot of it has turned out to be a scam. And I agreed to invest the money we can afford to lose so that we don't lose more money if the project proves fraudulent.",

I mean it is also relatively simple mathematics that it can not really work out if a project is paying interests of 1000% per year or even more to their stakers. That projects like this can not last long should be clear to everyone that is able to think logically no matter if they are completely new to the crypto world or not. Also i suspect a lot of those projects are created with the intention already to only last a few days or weeks. The team and the very early investors make a huge profit that way but everyone that is joining to late will lose almost everything.",

Well, there are still high paying projects both as an investment and campaign. But when it comes on high paying projects, only a few are legitimate. If you would be able to observe few projects nowadays succeed. In contrast with the situation years from the past. Ofcourse there are chances that a project is really that great but always check if the informations they are using; from promotion to public sale, are also real. There are many instances scam projects are manipulating promotional informations and you better be cautious of it.",

      "body": "A scam scheme is not significantly different from the old ways before cryptocurrencies evolve, a method that was already being used to scam is only merely incorporated with cryptocurrency. There is a few methods that use cryptocurrency technical stuff to practise scam, and it does works. Some scammers also get the benefit of the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies so they might get away easily. But still, there are characteristics that are already known used for scams, like giving a sense of urgency, etc. Which is a basic red flag when dealing with anything online.My point is that scam techniques keep evolving, in addition, it might due to technological progression. Almost likely, a known scam method for ages, being polished with a shade of new fancy things, like in this case cryptocurrency, which makes some people forget that such claim is absurd.",

How can you expect 300,000% annual percentage yield from a new project?It is strongly not recommended to invest in projects that promise outrageous investment returns. This is usually a sign of fraud or a Ponzi scheme, where the perpetrators use the funds of new investors to pay profits to old investors. It's best to avoid investing in projects that promise unrealistic annual percentage results like the ones you mentioned, as they are most likely scams. Before investing in a project, it's a good idea to do some in-depth research to make sure that the project is trusted and has good prospects. If you still have doubts, it's best to avoid investing in the project.",

This will help you understand more deeply about the project, including their goals, the team behind it, and their future prospects. In addition, you can also collect information about the reputation of the project, reviews and testimonials from other investors, as well as its potential risks.

This is because cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new and not always organized environment. This allows some people to take advantage of inexperienced or unscrupulous investors. To avoid getting caught up in this scam, always do your own research on cryptocurrency projects before making any investment decisions. Never invest money you can't afford to lose and never buy cryptocurrency from an untrustworthy or untrusted seller.",

This type of scam is not new really. This has been around since very long. There was era of ICO when users were lured into the projects very quickly as they had impression of high returns and also at that time the boom was at another level. It’s always better to play slow but play steady. Rule of thumb, you can earn higher profits that way with least risk.",

That would be a lie someone couldn't guarantee.Also too high discounts during presale make it similar to pyramid scam, where early investors would just supposedly make more.
