This man is clever, he only need to spend some money to buy the yellow costume rather than educate his children and his wife many times. Why he need to wasting his time to educate his wife and children if he have a way to avoid it?Now answer me, are you want to work from 7AM to 7PM and got paid for $5 or you're only work from 7AM to 12AM and got paid for $10? I believe no one will pick the first choice.",

If not, then my guess is just for fun.As for why he hid his winnings from his family, it could be that he had evil intentions with the money he got, meaning to enjoy it for himself, it is better to educate the family to be able to use money properly than to hide it just because of fear of his wife and children being lazy, hopefully not something bad happened to him because it could be that neither he nor his family ended up enjoying anything because of stupid reasons like that",

Money like that can make a person go crazy like they're above the law. We've seen rich people just laying around sunbathing on thier yacht and bribing officials. Maybe he doesn't want his kids and wife to be like them.  And also he protects his identity also, anyone can just visit his house if his identity is revealed.",

It is possible that he is just hiding his prize from his family to avoid them slacking off and being comfortable with life or he has other plans which is why he decided not to tell them.

I understand that you can hide 30,000 USD from your wife, children and friends, if you like, but 30 million? Not a chance. Maybe he could put it in his savings account or open another account to a different bank without letting his family know. Not to judge but I guess, he's not a high profile individual so we could assume his family as well. There are chances that his wife is not knowledgeable with banking procedures which gave him the idea to keep it a secret.What troubles me is that, what if something happened to that man? Not hoping but just being realistic. Given that he did not mention it to his family, will his family be notified? If yes, then that would be promising on his family's end, but conflict may arise if not.",

True. A lot of things can happen.This is not just about preventing his wife and kids to become lazy, he is protecting his family from crimes to come.  I think the guy is sane enough to learn how dangerous this world is that families turn each other like a bunch of animals because of money.With criminals looking for prey,  $30M is a huge motivation to find this guy.  The criminals may even kidnap the guy beside him just to find out the identity of the man in the yellow costume. He could have just worn something like a mask though.",

He does like that for a reason, and he is the one who knows about his own family. Hiding it from his own family for a good reason is not something wrong imho. Lets say you have a wife and children who like to spend money for useless thing, or in other words they cant manage money well. It can be a reason for you to not tell them as they may ask the money then spend it for nothing. Other reason can be related to security, if his family knows means that there is a chance for his family to spread the news to others and it may attract people (the bad one) to do something against them for the money. Hiding such huge amount of money is better choice telling it to others.",

It is very possible the man is not saying the true reason for not letting her know, or maybe I am wrong about it, but in my opinion, there is nothing bad telling her wife if not telling children. As for me, I will tell my wife about it and also look for better business to start that which will yield more income. I just know that no one that has better ambition would be able to hide the money forever, one way or the other, the family will later know that he is getting richer.",

What about their safety?About his reasoning, I think he missed that privacy should be the first thing that let him do the yellow costume thing and not because of a selfish act. Although, if he is honest about what he said then I admire him. He can still support them from the shadows without knowing he won the lottery.This will avoid making spoiled brat kids that would only reason out about their riches which is why they won't go to school or if they want things immediately.",

I doubt that he can keep it a secret, maybe when he goes home he can tell it to his wife. But I do agree that the winner should remain anonymous.Just like what we are here in crypto, I guess for the majority of us we really wanted to stay hidden although it's pseudo anonymous. Of course, base on the other thread, i someone knows you are a winner then they will go and look for you to ask for free money and that is what you wanted to avoid.",

We might not know the behavior of his wife and children, it might be they are extravagant and has the tendency to become lazy if he exposes the win. He lives with them and understands them better than anyone. It is also a common experience to see family members of rich individuals waste money on unnecessary things because the money is just available. I think he want to still ensure that his family members remain hardworking, regardless of his wins. But he shouldn't secretly spend the money alone, his family should feel the impact of his win Firstly,I am thrilled by this man's decision to hide his identity from the public. At least he has saved himself from a potential attack or intimidation of criminals and fraudsters. I would only reveal my win to reliable family members because this big win can be lead to envy from people. And envy is the root of many evils.",
