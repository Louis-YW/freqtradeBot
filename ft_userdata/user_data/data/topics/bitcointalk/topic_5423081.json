If you think about it, what is the possibility that someone will lend that much money to an unknown random person from the internet, you will understand how senseless what you are doing is.I assume that you think that stupid people come here who throw money away.Here is nothing for you, unless you have valid collateral to offer.",

I know.I just want a offer. If I have a offer I can discuss about what I have as collateral.I'm sorry, but I'm not flaunting what I have until someone can give me some sort of detail on what they can do for how much collateral and how much interest.That's all And to be clear, I'm not asking for anything for \"free\". I'm not saying anyone is stupid. I'm not going to ask for any btc in advance.",

You will be able to see what they offer, the kind of collateral they need and other terms and conditions. There you get to choose what you like.",
