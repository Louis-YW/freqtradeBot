      "body": "I don't plan on sharing mine here because mine is not something I'm currently proud of but with time and consistent development I'm sure I'll share mine showing both my loses and my profits. And another thing you should take note of, most of those people who call themselves professional traders only say that so that they can sell their course or perhaps to get more views and subscribers to their channel, when you come across a genuine pro trader that wants to pass knowledge to others you'll be able to recognize him/her at first site.Some YouTubers pro traders just talk about how they got this profit, how they did this, how they were able to use $2 to make $20,000 in 48 hours but never will they share their sad story or they go about with their losses. I won't advise a newbie to watch those kind of video because it tend to put some kind of an unnecessary pressure on them and before you know it they'll forget that trading is not something you rush but something you handle gradually. Btw, for now I'll say trading is a little profitable for me although not to the extent that I'll be able to purchase a car or a house with my profit, but it's still okay as I'm able to cover my basic needs with my profit and with time I believe it will be better than the current situation.",

Some of they teach is true since I learned some basics from it, but for you to have a deep understanding and wide knowledge about it which they ask you to join their team. Of course if they share their journal it would fud viewers since its impossible for them to reach that stage without loss. Seeing those loss would fear them to risk in crypto.QuoteMy question is are your profitable trader and can you share you journal or something ?, many of us will feel motivated. Having our own journal is like a private diary of yours, since there's a lot of mistakes before you regain your profits in PnL. It's a long journey and I'm not yet ready to share it here. Maybe more improvements and good calls but all I can share is that I've improved a lot than before.",

In my opinion, trading is like making bread with the same recipe, but the taste at the end (result) is definitely different, and it's impossible for you to be able to perfectly imitate the taste produced by that person. all traders use the same formula and motivation, but the results obtained will never be the same, so even if you do copy-trading, it will be difficult for you to match the achievement of the account you are copying due to various factors.so my conclusion is that you yourself have to struggle to be able to understand well what you are doing (trading) if influencers say trading is easy then they are not completely wrong and not completely right either.",

Many of them are involved in such activity for quick profits without any better understanding of the same. If anyone is going to follow just a random reel maker to understand how trading works then damn, that person is gone out of the world for sure. The PNL they are showing is just fake. It could be anything from a demo account to fake-created macros in excel. Do not believe anything from such social accounts. They can lead you to losses for sure.",

I personally don't trust any professional trader who doesn't lose.After all, they even avoided being asked about things they didn't understand, and from their explanations that was all they said.

But if you look carefully, those who analyze the market with their own knowledge and then take trades, most of the time are profitable. To be successful in trading, you must have a complete understanding of trading, maybe it will take you a long time to gain that understanding, but even if it takes time, you must know about it. Never depend on anyone for trading it may put your money at risk. Many times we see many people join different telegram groups for signals and always follow that telegram group and when about any coin from that telegram group. When the announcement is made, we immediately buy those coins and we wait for the profit, but later on, instead of the profit, we lose all our money there.
