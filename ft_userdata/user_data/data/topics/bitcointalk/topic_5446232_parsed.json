  "content": "I have been feeding this cat for years... this outside cat who visits... every day around dinner time...I am in a situation now where I must move.I feel bad now, because there is no guarantee that the people who will soon occupy my place will feed this cat if it comes around...The cat was doing fine before I move in, so maybe it will be OK again? I feel bad because I figure he has gotten used to my daily offerings.Has anyone else been through this, or can offer advice? Am I worrying too much?Thanx",

      "body": "Is the cat owned by somebody else & is it fed by them, if you are aware? If not then if you are able to, maybe you could take the cat with you to your new home. If you have been feeding the cat for years then you have obviously formed a bond with it. Maybe if it was possible you could take the cat with you to the new home. Iâ€™m a sucker that would probably really consider taking the cat with me.",

How about you just take the cat with you. if you don't take the cat with you, when you move to a new house. You will definitely feel anxious and worried. so I thought just bring the cat.Here's the thing, the cat has been in the area before I moved in. So it considers the area ( outdoors ) it's home...It's a townhome complex.So yes, it has gotten used to the food I give it... but if I just relocate it when I move, that seems like it would also be a bad thing to do, because it has lived in this area for years, and considers it home ( I have no idea if it gets food from other people and/or hunts ).I am going to send a photo of it to the strata and ask if they know if someone owns it.( I refer to it as 'it' not he/she because I don't know it's gender )",

Ya, I mean I don't know if yanking it out of it's environment ( when I move ) is the best idea...yes, the cat would get food... but it would have to adapt to a whole new area... and I don't think turning it into an indoor cat after years of being an outdoor cat is a good idea.Ya I like the idea of leaving a note for the new tenants, it would be nice if they were cat people, but there's no guarantee... I think most people would see it as an unnecessary expense.",

      "body": "So, it is important to note that cats are tough animals, and they are also skilled hunters.If the cat was fine before you started feeding it, it will likely be able to adapt to changing circumstances and find a way to survive on its own. It's a normal situation.So, even if we don't feed it, the cat can survive unless it's an emergency, for example, a sore leg. The point is we don't know whether after we feed it, the cat eats something again or not. Can't control where they go.",

      "body": "My personally, it's possible that the cat was doing fine before you moved in, so maybe it will be okay again without your daily offerings. But I can see why you're worried about the cat's well-being. Also might be a good idea to try and find someone who can take over feeding the cat once you move. Maybe a neighbor or someone in the area who you know is an animal lover.I suggest that you try to make arrangements for the cat's care before you move, so that you can feel reassured that the cat will have a food source. And if you can't find anyone to take over feeding the cat, it might be worth considering reaching out to a local animal shelter or rescue organization for advice on how to best help the cat.",

That will give it the opportunity to adjust gradually and able to cope when it nolonger sees its care giver.I once in a while take care of a stray mother cat and her child but I let them be for now because they are ferocious hunters and can be quite independent.",
