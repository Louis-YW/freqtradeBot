After the lesson learned, I later chose to use gambling to make fun because using it to make money will not actually make money for you but losses instead.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 25, 2023, 08:08:52 AMCasinos, either online or offline, isn't a place to win money for the 99% of people, but this same group of people want to confused or already confused themselves that they can make money gambling, this isn't the proper way.

There are many ways to have fun without involving money all the time. No matter the means by which people make money, be it easy way or hard way no one will be happy to deliberately lose money on casino just for fun.",

If not then good, at least bring money that you can afford to lose.

They are their to win some money no matter what. Of course, they will be entertained at some point. But if you continue to lose money just for the sake of being entertained, then think again.",

I know others might understand me because we are aware that most casinos are luck-based games, especially the provably fair games. I am no longer there to make money but only to have some fun.Yeah, we may think that gambling is the same way as movie time but they are only similar in providing entertainment. They both involve money but in different ways, in the cinema, you are not expecting a return after paying and watching it, even if the movie is bad for you, there is no refund. In gambling, you might expect something in return if you win by luck.",

I don't think it's necessary as long as it's fun.But sometimes people find it strange, even though this clearly makes more sense than using money that is not used, because any money will definitely be used. The meaning is that this thread is described in more detail, this is why don't chase losses that are actually unnecessary, playing gambling must make it happen. as entertainment, if you win, withdraw all the money, if you lose, just think of paying for all the entertainment, but you must still limit your budget so that it doesn't swell and exceed the limit and end up going bankrupt due to addiction, gambling wisely using a healthy mindset is the point.",

But then, i agree that this is something i suppose we can never stop discussing since we have a lot of gamblers today who are not gambling for the right reasons, which is to just have fun, but gambling for the wrong reasons, which is to make money.If casinos were indeed a place to make money, i suppose many of us would be so damn rich right now. Gambling is solely a means of entertainment, it's called re-creational entertainment, the ability to make money through gambling i believe is what makes it recreational. But unfortunately, as it is with human beings, we like to abuse anything we know we can make money from, and this is why we have so many gamblers today not gambling for the real purpose as to why gambling is established, but rather, majority are gambling to make money, some don't even have a job and neither are they working to secure one, but rather, have decided to turn gambling into a profession or careerSuch things as this is something we all should highly discourage within ourselves and our friends.",

You can have that denial stage that you have gambled because you're all for the fun and you can think that you've gambled and loss and that money is good as payment to them. You can actually think of as many reasons as you can when you lose. It is also like a defense mechanism when you're all for the profit and then your plans aren't successful because all you're getting are losses. There's no need for one to admit that he's gambling for the profit and can just admit that he's paying for the experience so that he'll become a better gambler in the future. IMO, there's no problem whether you tell that you're up for the profit or for the experience and with that money you lose is fine as long as it is yours. What's shameful is when you gamble not with your money and either a loan or from someone who owns that money and you never told that you've used it for gambling.",

Winners always have price whichever the price is whether financial benefits or other gains of advantage. So cinema is totally for fun as primary purpose and even while at the cinema you can yet gamble out side for whatever you want to prove in the movie you are watching either to show you have seen it before and can tell the story in the movie. My point therefore is that even while relaxing at the movies you can gamble on a phenomenal with some other person or even your girlfriend or wife maybe not for cash but for a particular gain or advantage which could even be at the home front if you understand what I mean   Gambling is just something more than entertainment because majority of those embarking on it does not do it for the entertainment only.",

Watching a football match is also the same, If you bet too much on a match you ain't going to enjoy the game, been social or not, your mind will be hoping for a win because you bet what you consider to be a lot of money, so you will panic anyway. It's not the differences that I am pointing to, let's learn from this idea of comfortably watching movies as the same as gambling, we will be fine doing so, that's why every dollar bet on a game is nothing because its a dollar you betting, this is where all the fun will get to you.",

I've always compared it to something like games or something similar which hasn't really been effective after some point, I guess comparing it to a cinema would be a lot better (and a lot more relatable) to the majority of people. The idea of money might not be in casinos, but hey, it's easy to look at once you see how the \"money part\" is replaced by the \"movie\" part of cinemas. It's not supposed to be a completely similar exchange, but rather just push the idea of what the \"money\" part of casinos signify, which is simply a tool for your entertainment, just like how movies are in cinemas.",

When decided to watch you a movie, you know right at the beginning that youll gain nothing from except the experience of watching the moivie on big screen. Unlike once you place your bet, you are starting to hope taht you will win. Movies definitely have that chill social vibe where you can just kick back and enjoy without any pressure. Gambling on the other hand tends to bring that competitive edge into play. Even if we try to focus on the fun, the potential for making money is always there and its kind of hard to ignore.But OP is right that we should enjoy playing on it and not make it as a means to make money. I totally agree with that.",

And worst maybe there are some that think gamble is a way to make money, like having a regular job or something. But it is not.Actually in the casino that I frequented, I see some old ladies day in day out, sometimes I will converse to them and they say that they just stay in the casino even if they are not playing because they don't have money. And there are people who knows them, so if this people won, they are giving some to this old ladies. So most likely, it's like a part of their life already.

You are simply paying for the experience and the entertainment, it's either you enjoy it or you may not, can you feel me? You don't know how bad a movie can be until you watched it, so....I appreciate your creativity @OP in linking cinema and gambling. When you watch the previews of some films it will be so attractive that you will be pleased to buy the tickets to view it. In some cases, you will discover that the movie is not what you expected. The quality, character, or even production might become below your standard. Seeing gambling as an entertainment that cannot be predicted just like the movie is a good one. Just as the movie might be interesting or not, that is how you can win or lose in gambling. Watching movies is a good example because it does not cost much to buy a ticket, which also points to the fact that we should gamble will a little portion of our income. People who see gambling as their major source of income either become addicts or suffer from financial problems.",

We enjoy gambling because we're seeking the thrill, and we don't need to deceive ourselves by saying we're only in it for entertainment. In reality, we're chasing that win.I believe what we should practice is convincing ourselves that what we lose is an amount we can afford to lose, so it won't be too hard for us to move on.",
