  "content": "It has been a very good experience, counting that in these months I have had a profit of 5000 with a 10k account.Now the one I am using and recommend is crypto fund trader, but I have also used maven, ftmo, the experience with these has been a little worse.In general the option to start trading with propfirm is an advantage to get started.Also, if you have any doubts about what is a propfirm here is an article https://what-is-prop-trading/I recommend that you try the experience, but you have to be a profitable trader, don't expect it to be that easy.",

They were reported to be a ponzi scheme thereby leaving many thinking that other propfirms are just like that.  That issue sends a very bad signal about propfirms. I learnt they have a pending legal case which I feel the outcome will determine the fate of the other propfirms. Nevertheless,  FTMO have been in the business for long and have earned a good reputation.",

      "body": "Sorry if I have not uploaded the post to the best place It's been shitty what happened with MFF, but I never buy a challenge if I don't trust the company.An example is Cryptofundtrader, I bought a 10k and a 25k But before that I did a search and found that they upload proof of their payments to merchants, they have KYC and on their website they have a Proof Reserve section that gives you confidence that they have a backup. Plus they do copytrading to their traders which other companies don't do. And then there is FTMO which right now is the largest in the sector, but I prefer CFT because it is focused on cryptos.I'll leave a link for you to take a look.https://cryptofundtrader.com?_by=halloweeneventOh and if you want a discount they give it on discord \"platinum5\"",
