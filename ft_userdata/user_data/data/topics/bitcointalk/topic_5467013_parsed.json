If they are really good and promising, you will have no problem finding interested promoters. Each industry has its own specific market and requires a different approach to promotion. Also, if it is a question of ethically questionable services (cloud mining, money doublers, MLM, etc.), you may find it more difficult here, considering that this forum tries to stick to white-label businesses.Of course, you can always start a marketing campaign, which is perhaps the most effective way to start, because you can't expect only influencers to represent your brand/business.",

If you are going to develop products in the long term it's better to create a platform of your own.",

Sounds really a good idea because you'll be having a huge team on this one but that doesn't stop there until you make one.If you wanna hire people, you can post this opening on the Services and post the criteria and qualifications that you need to have on your team.And take note that posts and offers on that section should be paid in BTC or USD. But if you're going to pay some altcoins, Marketplace (Altcoins) is the section for it.",

If you have an attractive-enough affiliate program, just market it a bit — then you should be getting a lot of interested advertisers as long as your offer seems realistic and that your platform isn't scammy.",

If you really have many projects on your sleeve can you drop one here? your project will define who you are and what you're bringing to the table, marketing a project will be easy if the project has potential they don't need to engage in shill marketing all they have to do is bring something unique and usable to the community, its easy to build a community in a project that has potential and long term demand of its usage.The market and the community are always on the lookout for project that has potential.",

      "body": "Finding affiliates is dependent on the commission you are providing per referral. Seeing such a dedicated or targeted platform for affiliates can be rare, but finding affiliate marketers isn’t. But, you’ll have to build some reputation for these marketers to trust you. So, set up a website and build reviews, then reach out to affiliate marketers. If you don’t have intentions of setting up such websites, internet marketing forums have boards for affiliate marketers, where you can get such marketers. But, I’m wondering if you’re an affiliate looking to pay other marketers to spread your referral link to different platforms. If it’s not your idea, then why don’t you think the affiliate marketers will prefer to work with the projects directly. So, in your search for affiliate marketers, you’ll have to break down your goals and motives to their understanding. It’ll help get things straight. Not just coming to say, you need affiliate marketers. There are lots of question answers expected from your side.",
