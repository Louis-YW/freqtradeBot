That said I don't have a specific altcoin that I care about at the moment, I just hold a general view for altcoins. I can't afford to buy a lot of BTC, my only option is to hold what I have now, and commit funds to other cheaper alts.

This is good news for the crypto market because people are waiting for Trump's commitment to fulfill his promise to create a crypto reserve for America. and this news could provide something positive for the crypto market in the future.But maybe this positive trend will continue until the crypto summit later, which is planned to be held this weekend. investors want to see how regulation and innovation in the cryptocurrency sector are, and from that, many investors may decide to enter the market or not. so let's just wait patiently to see the results of this summit.",

You kidding right? because we can't put any timeline, and just like that, Bitcoin goes down from $95k to $92k currently, so it's just temporary but obviously there are a lot of short term traders or speculators who might have taken advantage of the situation and squeeze some profits.And it just shows how volatile the market will and will be in the future. So we don't know, at least we should be in the bullish trend still for this year but there could be a lot of humps along the way that it's really hard to see what will be all time high for this cycle.",

And it could be the just the minimum as it's possible that it could move as high as $180k as that's where most of the predictions.Of course it can still go as high as we don't have the crystal ball and see the future.But at least, just be conservative and not expect very high price so that we won't be discourage or something. Just like in the last bull run wherein there is that 6 digits that we all wanted to see but it turns out that the all time high is $69k in 2021.",

The correction was in, the recovery was in and the stability of Bitcoin shows above $78k is there as well. We probably have seen the dip and bottom of this cycle but we don't know for how long it will hold. We're trying to break and hit back $100k and more, so it's only a matter of time and give it time maybe until this year ends and things might go easy and favorable to all of us.Quote from: AlphaBheta on March 03, 2025, 09:56:17 AMBecause we've been here a couple of time, and it would be cool if we can put a timeline on this, if it's just a temporary move, and even if it isn't, how long can we expect the bullish trend to last. Just expect that for several months for this year, we're still in the bullish form. But if all of a sudden, more negative news and hacking comes and the market plummets a lot, that might be a sign but we have to wait for confirmation. It's pretty likely that 2026 is the bear market.",

You probably asked yourself the same question when Bitcoin was dumping, and honestly, the answer is we don’t know. No one expected Trump to suddenly announce crypto as part of the U.S. reserve. There were speculations before, but no one saw it happening this soon.So, just like before, if we trusted the market when it was dumping, then we should trust it even more when it’s pumping.

There are many many variables which can/could contribute to what direction the Bitcoin markettakes at any time. We can only speculate as to what way its going to go in the medium term.Based solely on the last halving we should see an new ATH later this year, in the second half perhapsand after that we should enter a bear season based on past historical moves and follow Bitcoins4 year cycle.Some commentators have spoken about an end to historical market movements because things havechanged now but that will all remain to be seen.I recon thats the best timeline you will get - Bitcoin following its 4 year cycle between halvings.And please be prepared for big pullbacks like we just had from ~$100k to ~$78k and correction back to ~$94k in the future.",

It's positive news after all and yesterday Donald J. Trump announced his national strategic cryptocurrency reserve for the USA. Surprising enough that Bitcoin is not mentioned but Bitcoin managed to soar about 10% yesterday and nearly reclaim what it lost after Bybit hack last week.Quote from: WatChe on March 03, 2025, 12:14:54 PMWe saw Bitcoin making it to new ATH last year after Bitcoin ETF's were launched.
