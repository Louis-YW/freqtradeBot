I can understand why - your article is presented as an introduction to cryptocurrencies for beginners. But! Read the first paragraph (I did not insert your text here because the site does not allow copying): there are too many crypto-currency concepts that will immediately scare off a beginner. And he won't read any more. I advise you to present the material of the text easier. To understand what I'm talking about, you can ask ChatGPT \"How to tell children about cryptocurrencies and blockchain\". I've seen similar articles before, and they're funny. Also add more explanatory diagrams, not just pictures with Bitcoin coins.",
