  "content": "I believe sae most of us know or don hear about Patricia's exchange not allowing her users to withdraw their funds from their exchange since last year so. The matter don come up again as the CEO, Haru don bring up a offer and em want them to consider the offer so. Link for the gist na hereIn case if you are hearing it for the first time, Patricia exchange na a young Nigeria citizen bearing the name Fejiro Hanu Agbodje, em follow or should I sae em be the main sponsor of BBNaija last 2 season. Nigeria's were able to know about him through being the big sponsor of BBNaija season. And na through that Nigeria got engaged and the know about Patricia exchange, which later got rugpulled by the CEO because of his buga lifestyle of buying expensive cars, properties, and traveling from one country to the other. Why I am bringing up this matter for the forum(already discussed before), na to resurrect our thinking not to ever leave our funds for exchange no matter how promising, well known or security-wise it could be. You go na imagine people's wealth about 2 billion naira is being stocked on an exchange, meaning that they can't withdraw or have control over it after 6 months. It is so appalling that Nigeria fell victim to this mess sha, but no yawa, peso no die. Na still part of life journey that never you trust anybody to hand over your wealth to am. Abegy make we d help to the tell people wey we know not to fall to exchange wahala. They should always try to withdraw their assets for exchange even if their money big or small. I say make I drop this one here as a reminder purposes for those wey go like drop their assets for an exchange to have a rethink of doing so.",

You will be surprised if you ask most of the people that are owning coins and tokens today what is bitcoin or crypto wallet, they will mention exchanges or mentioned exchanges among the ones they will mention. Many of them do not know what is noncustodial wallet. Not your coin because it is not your key has always been a good advise.",

      "body": "With the point u just raise, reminded me of same situation that happen when I was much more young in cryptocurrency, then I do not know bitcointalk. I was using luno then, so I came across some exchanges designed by our brothers , eeehhh , Let me give a try, I bought some crypto on the exchange, thanks to God, there was a bullish market so I decide to withdraw, boom, charges swallowed my profit and part of my money, I almost cried. Now my question is that why do our people like doing things that will paint us bad, extortion in everything. After my experience, I never use that exchange again, and I don't think the exchange still exist. These are some reasons why some countries kick against cryptocurrency. Locking some one asset for 6 months for their own selfish gain is wrong. Them suppose arrest am for that act",

This one na the reason wey we dey talk say IF NOT YOUR KEYS, IT'S NOT YOUR COINS. I hope our people go learn from this. The funny part com be say e expect customers mind to cool as e tok say their funds go dey used as shares. So in other words, them go get shares for the company bah? The tok no clear; on one hand, e dey tok say e go use am as shares, then come later say them dey do token and those users wey their  funds hang go get access to the PUTX token then e come say when them begin business again, their money go dey paid in batches. Which kind confused yarn be that. You see, no mata say he sponsor BBN no mean say e get everything under control, infact e just look like wetin Sam Bank Friedman do with FTX and coupled with the kind of lifestyle wey Hanu dey keep, I feel say those funds don enter voicemail since. Another sad part about this one be say nah remote them dey operate, dem no get office which means those users funds dey at greater point of being lost than anything. This nah the reason crypto users no sopoz leave their funds for centralized exchanges because if anything happen to am, na so so grammar like this you go dey hear.",
