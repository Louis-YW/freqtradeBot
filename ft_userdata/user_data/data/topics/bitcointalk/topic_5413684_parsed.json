  "content": "Hi,Â  We are looking for an artist who can help us with 3D animation for a new game project. We are looking for both 3D world design as well as character design and animation. If you have experience with shaders that is a bonus. We are probably looking to start with a 2-4 week kind of contract period and if things are going well then we are open to a longer term arragnement. Please reply here or DM.",
