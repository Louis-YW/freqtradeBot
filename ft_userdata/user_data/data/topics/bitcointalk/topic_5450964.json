  "content": "Hello together,after reading a very positive thread about the experience of a start-up funder in the cryptocurrency eco-system (\" https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448571.0 \"), I thought I will also give it a shot and share my experiences and also my project.I started my project about three years ago after watching a YouTube-video where prominent people discussed about bitcoin, DeFi, altcoins etc. The idea began when they mentioned the \"Ruby app\". For the people who dont remember: The ruby app was an app which cost a lot of money and the only thing it did was to show a Ruby on your mobile. I thought \"Hey everything will migrate to the cryptocurrency eco-system some day, why not replicate this idea\". Im a programmer but had no experience in crypto-development what so ever. So I now started investing my time in learning Solidity, OpenZeppelin-standards, understand how transactions work, learning React and so on. This was all while Corona hit the earth, which made it easier. But with the time, I spent little and less time with my friends anymore because I was so invested with my idea. Time passed and the project started to form. The idea was to have one unique NFT auction with a deadline. The price of the NFT rises with each purchase and at the end the last one to keep it will be \"The Richest\". It was never my idea to keep the profit for me, so I started creating an algorithm which distributes the profit according to the time someone has bought the NFT. I told friends about how it works and they all said \"this cant work\" and when I explained they suddenly realised that it really does.I wanted to launch the website over a year ago, but then came in contact with an investor who asked if the project has a pre-sale. I explained him how everything works and he was interested. We met up and made a plan, where we thought \"Why waste the whole effort and only have one auction. We could make everybody have their own auctions too\". The website was really easy at first, but with this new ideas I had to create a back-end, provide the possibility to create profiles, have a database, an altcoin for the platform instead of the native coin etc.I spent the next year developing further and was then at a point where I say that Im happy with it. I was calling with the investor again and again but he suddenly stopped answering. Im still thankful because of the ideas he gave me, but it is of course also a big pain in the ass to be alone again after alls the promises made.I got more and more ideas on the possibilities how to connect the digital and the physical world of NFTs, to give them real value, to make people stop saying \"I can just take a screenshot\". All these ideas with RichCoinNFT being the back of all of that. To use the auctioning system as a secure and transparent way of auctioning assets. With the people being in the middle of the platform while still maintaining anonymity.I was now sitting around with nothing else to do anymore and made the decision to just go for it and launch the website which happened yesterday. I now spent my time trying to gain awareness of the project. I dont even want people to just invest, but want them to understand the message behind it. I know the slogan \"Get Richer or the Richest\" is cheeky, but it is also an instrument to get people to question it and try to understand it by reading the whitepaper. Mayge I earned your attention  But Im also already thankful for everyone who read until here and listened to the story. Maybe you really are more curious about the project, how it works, what the advantages are etc. If that is the case, you can find the whitepaper here: https://richcoinnft.com/assets/Whitepaper-RichCoinNFT.pdfIt means everything to me if you read it and just gave me an honest opinion on the project including critics on what bothers you and what you would change.What also would mean a lot is if you just create a profile on the website itself, which doesnt cost any cent and takes only 30 seconds. No e-mail needed, no contact data. You only need a MetaMask wallet, because profile creation is verified by a signature: https://richcoinnft.com/profile/myProfileThank you guys and have a good one",
