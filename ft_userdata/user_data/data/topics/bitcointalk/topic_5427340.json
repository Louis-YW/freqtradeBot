  "content": "Here is an idea. What would happen if:El Salvador forked pre taproot bitcoin and adopted it as its native digital currencyLimited mining of their forked alt to IP addresses in El Salvador, to guarantee 51% attacks could not be made from outside territoriesOffered incentives on mining equipment and electricity to allow citizens in the country to experience the early golden years of low difficulty bitcoin miningOffered incentives on crypto wallet supporting smartphones and the infrastructure necessary for businesses and consumers to use the forked crypto exclusivelyImplemented caps on outside speculators such as large hedge funds from accumulating a significant portion of the forked alt, while allowing foreign small parties to buy and sell freelyWould it be possible for a small nation to fork bitcoin, in an effort to recreate the early glory days of mining (low difficulty era) for its residents.Which could in turn produce prosperity and wealth, somewhat out of thin air, in a deflationary capacity.While capping markets and limiting mining to IP addresses in El Salvador* to prevent interference from large speculators with overwhelming liquidity from buying out the market cap.I never thought bitcoin cash and other forks of BTC would amount to much. The staying power of bitcoin cash however has proven otherwise. Perhaps it is possible for small nations like El Salvador to recreate and even build upon this success.",

As far as I am concerned, the only condition for copying such software is that you must include the MIT copyright notice. In other words, El Salvador absolutely can modify Bitcoin software and create its own version of Bitcoin (fork). As for recreating \"the glory days of low mining difficulty,\" I think it is only possible if the fork is highly unsuccessful because otherwise, existing bitcoin miners will use part of their equipment for mining this state-sponsored fork, thereby automatically increasing the difficulty of mining. But creating or issuing your own money doesn't magically make you prosperous or wealthy because first, you need to convince your own people that this money is good for them (which, of course, a dictator can achieve via violence, aggression, torture, and propaganda), and second, you need to convince your neighbors, your enemies and all other countries that El Salvador's bitcoin is good enough to replace the dollar and other currencies when conducting trades between countries.Quote from: Hydrogen on December 09, 2022, 02:17:28 AMPerhaps it is possible for small nations like El Salvador to recreate and even build upon this success.Bitcoin Cash is a scam coin created to siphon off money from naive investors; and since its creation, it has only been dropping in price against bitcoin without the hope of ever catching up.",

I forgot to write it in the bottom part (edits it in), it was only in the bullet part on top.What if mining of their forked bitcoin alt were limited exclusively to IP addresses in El Salvador. To prevent foreign nations from hijacking the chain via 51% attacks and consolidate mining inside their own borders. Could that be a good idea and positive design change. Or would it be negative and limiting in some way?",

Of course, they could make a fork, but from that point, they'd be simply altcoin adopters, a coin nobody cares about outside their country. They might as well just make their own token for such purposes, because the fact of it being a fork of Bitcoin won't help to keep the value and capitalization of BTC. So the safest and most secure way is just buying regular BTC as they do, and encouraging eco-friendly mining of regular BTC as I think they are planning to do.",

These trends emphasize high price volatility which can occur in response to market trends and shifting demand. If it were possible to purchase crypto tokens pegged to the value of firewood and wood stoves, it would be profitable.

That would only work in only one direction as the IP routing would direct responses to the correct IP addresses rather than the forged ones. For that to have a chance of working they would need to spoof IP addresses then compromise internet routing to do something like a man in the middle attack to fulfill all of their crypto mining needs.If you're referring to proxy or VPN approach, they would need a server inside el salvador to make that work. Given that el salvador is the government of the country, they should be able to prevent or restrict unwanted 3rd parties from having that access.Long story short, its not that easy to fake IP addresses in a way which would allow them to be used for TCP handshakes and sessions, especially over the long term as would be needed for mining purposes.Quote from: franky1 on December 09, 2022, 04:17:19 AMASICS do not communicate directly with the peer to peer network.. they only communicate to a pool manager.a pool manager broadcasts a block to the peers(fullnodes). just like peers that relay blocks when syncing and such/ when they see a new block they download. if they are not getting blocks they are not getting blocks. to stop blocks outside of el salv is to ban peers of full nodes outside of elsalvadorthis means it becomes a whole network closed system of full nodes only running inside elsalvadorthis means no own can own el-btc on a full node outside of el salv because they cannot communicate to the el-btc network..also bitcoins bottom line value is ~$15k due to the most efficient underlying cost mining of network hashratethe price is then a premium above the $15kif el salv only does say 5exa network mining. the underlying value is $300 meaning the el-btc will be on the market speculating from $300 to a ~ speculated5x so probably a ATH of $1.5k at current rates of this scenarioI was thinking they would naturally limit IP mining to el salvador, while allowing nodes to be run by anyone globally. (Separation of nodes and mining) Or deploy a minimalist core setup, which would be easier to run on smartphones than the current bitcoin (if that were technically possible). The blockchain being formatted in a compressed format would reduce its size by roughly 1/3rd and make it easier to download.
