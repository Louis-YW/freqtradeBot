  "content": "-SnipGood afternoon my dear fellow miners, I have a question about a problem that frequently occurs to me, and that is that the Real Time power of the Pool (Btc in my case) tends to go down and checking my equipment I do not have restarts of any and the internet It's stable. Could someone help me find out why this is happening? Thank you for your attention.",

      "body": "And how much up and down 1%? 10%? 50%?There is going to be a fair amount of variation because there is an amount of luck involved. So long as over a long period (couple of days) the average is about where it should be you are fine. If you are checking minute to minute there can be some big swings.Most (All?) pools give you that number.Also, what miner are you using? -Dave",

      "body": "I think what you talking about is the hash rate report on the pool compared to the miner's current hash rate.If I'm right I think it's due to high ping it can cause delay. Try to change the pool with low ping. Some pools have 3 options ASIA, EU, and US pool servers if you are living in Asia you should use Asia pool or if you are living in the US then use US pool.If using other pool doesn't fix your issue try to change your miners network from DHCP to Static and use Google/Cloudflare DNS. Update here if it works",

If it's a 1 or 5 or 15 minute average then it's not important the 24 hours number is what you are looking for.-Dave",

And well, this is why my 24H is also affected.As for the \"GUI\" I don't know exactly what I should see, I'm not very informed of everything that I should take into account when reviewing the equipment.If they run if Original Firmware.",

Better use a monitoring tool to find out what exactly happens to your miners, Bitmain has free monitoring tools that you can check here \"MAnagement tools\"Sometimes the pool is down If I were you try switching to another Sha256 pool so that you can check if it's due to the pool server. You can try ViaBTC pool or try any other pools from this link https://miningpoolstats.stream/",
