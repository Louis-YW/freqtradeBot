I doubt most people will learn anything from this FTX collapse.",

Is that I good thing? Well.. it's debatable.As said, people losing money is not a good thing, even if he signs were there (not your keys, not your coins) and they just failed to see them.Consumers' protection should have been first for many years, still, taking (unnecessarily high) risks in the name of profit is not new and I fear it won't stop this easy.People still open businesses under various jurisdictions they can play people's money with no big repercussions.Even SMF tells now that USA customers will be OK, while the rest of the world... pretty much bad luck. Why that? Maybe because USA is one of the few regions SBF is afraid of the law?",

They are risky investments at their best and, as such, they will continue to be vulnerable to wild fluctuations in price. But, the FTX exchange funds mismanagement is a clear sign that there are some very real problems in the space that needs to be addressed. Not only does this show a complete lack of ethics, but it also indicates an opportunistic approach that could have serious consequences for the industry as a whole. It's not about the volatility or risk, but how exchanges are handling the user's money and what they do with it. And, it's clear that FTX has failed miserably in this regard.",

I agree with you. But you can't say that this FTX issue might be for the greater good because it can't be. People will always be lazy and just like you said, in a few years FTX will be remembered just like we remember Mt. Gox today. And there will probably be another centralized exchanges where people will hold their crypto because it's easier and people are lazy to learn.Actually, this FTX fiasco is very similar to some bank becoming insolvent - people would run to that bank and try to withdraw their money (that's where the phrase \"bank run\" comes from). Those who are first will be able to withdraw, but many won't. The only difference is that this kind of business is legal for banks, but it's illegal for crypto exchanges.",

But I'm not talking about regulating crypto as the industry. I'm talking about regulating projects that use crypto to earn a shitload of money and actually bring nothing to the crypto industry. Take FTX, Binance and other CEXes. What do they bring to the industry? Nothing. Their owners are just using crypto to earn themself a lot of money. That should be regulated and people who play with other people's crypto should know that they can't do whatever they want.On the other hand, we can't have people who just write code put behind bars (here I'm referring to the Tornado Cash creator) because people like him did nothing wrong just like gun manufacturers aren't held accountable for someone killing a person with the gun that they manufactured.Quote from: The Pharmacist on November 16, 2022, 08:47:10 AMQuote from: dkbit98 on November 10, 2022, 02:48:45 PMI doubt most people will learn anything from this FTX collapse.Probably not, and I'm sure this won't be the last disaster to hit crypto no matter what governments do.Of course!
