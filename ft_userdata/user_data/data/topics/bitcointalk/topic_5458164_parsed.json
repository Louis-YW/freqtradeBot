Here is a decade of designing skills. I don't intend to have this as a long term service here. Will only do a couple of work to collect some cash. The work doesn't have to be related to crypto at all the reputable member may have or need to launch a side buss.",

However, I do believe that people here won't do such thing.. and if they do it I'll still accept it as I published the service based on this model. I don't price or complain.",
