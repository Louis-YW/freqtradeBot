  "content": "Decred is one of those coins that wanted to \"fix\" bitcoin. Their big features were governance and a hybrid pow/pos model.Their founder Jake Yocom Piatt has talked negatively about Bitcoin since the Greg Maxwell days, ever since Bitcoin Core declared btcd as persona non grata. He has repeatedly called Bitcoin too centralized under BCs control. He also strangely calls miners malicious for selling instead of participating in their proof of stake system.Now it turns out that Decred there is evidence that over 2M of the 21M coins are owned by the Decred founder. This would be double the Satoshi amount , and effectively means a single person has a de facto veto power over all governance decisions. Over time, these holdings will grow even higher.There is a crazy discussion on the Decred reddit. Their admins first asked for proofs, but then started censoring the posts when the evidence started rolling in. It got reposted in second reddit. They just voted over 90% to kill ASIC miners, and move to a 99% Proof of Stake model. There is now a question about how much of the voting came from their founding team whales, and how much comes from 'regular users'. IIRC, multiple people have 6 figure bags from staking their premine.They delivered on non-trivial software innovations, but it's sad to see human ego and a centralization of power take over again.",

If you assume the 4% (800k coins) is already in the founder's bag and the other 4% is distributed to the alt accounts of the founder, he'll get 2M coins after a simple pump-and-dump scheme and staking.The lesson is there will be no decentralized coin after BTC, because of pre-mine, stealth-mine, ICO, etc.",

So, just as the market today, this has probably added to the effect of what it is experiencing now but still not that much.",

According to the evidence, up to 85% of their \"staked\" are held by Dev affiliated groups.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5479728.0There is now names posted of the top 2 Decred whales who decided to keep the miners coins for themselves:Jake Yocom Piatt (holds up to 3 million DCR)Jonathan Zeppettini (holds more than 1 million DCR)The Decred governance voting is a rigged show. You can vote how you want, but this group can veto anything and they call the real shots.More proof that Alt coins are scams",

No one would do what Satoshi did that give every coins to the community or unless someone develope soemthing that no plans to earn from it but is there a guy like that anymore? Purely for community only? I doubt it.This decred coin is worst even up to now its being bombarded with issues on their social and groups.",

It's common in the business would, CEOs will want to hold majority shares so they can conveniently call the shots, even at the detriment of other minority shareholders. If the Decred project founder is able to own more than 2m DCR coins, and is able to pilot the affairs of the project profitably then I don't have a problem with that, afterall if the coin goes down he'll be the most affected. It's only when the founder manipulates decisions to favor only himself that there's a problem.",
