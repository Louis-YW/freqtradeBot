This na one of the reason wey make Oyibo create exchange, them make exchange so that we fit dey swap or exchange coin for fiat. So I no see reason wey go make person say make we trade outside the exchange wey be say, if I no confirm payment I no go fit release my coin give any buyer. Some persons sef dey do this kind of outside trade well well for this country, and some of their rates too dey good to be true, na why I no dey trust any vendor for this we country. I don hear of case sef wey person say the vendor show am sent transaction say make em credit am, and case like this the vendor go dey rush the seller or buyer to credit dem or release coin asap. But if you wise you go wait for confirmation before you release coin or send fundz, so if we dey do any kind of trade make we dey very patient until we receive result, not from the vendor but from our wallet or bank account.",

I know the exchange is not very pure and free from scam but it is better to trade p2p not to lose your money than to trade with a total stranger that is off the exchange.  Losing money all in the name of trading is very painful, I think people just neeed to do right thing and not to allow just increase of rate of trade to be used as a strategy to get into the hands of scammers. When it comes to trading people needs to be extremely careful because their are lots of scammers looking for who to scam.",

Another red flag way to know is they will then say you should send first before their payment. They may even say they are victim of p2p scam just to give you a false assurance that they are not scammers, but don't fall them. In fact do not be the first sender before receiving since you are sure that you will definitely pay once you receive the bitcoin or money and not otherwise because no body is to be trusted online.",

But the aspect of requesting to trade off the exchange is a red flag that no one should even accept. There is a reason the exchanges design their p2p platform the way it is and as you can see, the funds are in escrow meaning any funny move can be tackled. But outside the exchange, it becomes very difficult. So never accept trade outside the exchange.",

We get local vendors wey we fit trade with and they're as good as those centralized platforms wey we dey patronized.

Always learn to dey trade in batches and e no go bad to disguise yourself as also a merchant trading others coin so e no go belike all the money wey you dey trade na your own. Another thing na to dey avoid high rate, whether na for Binance exchange oh or for local vendors, high rate na trick wey scammers dey use to attract greedy people so you need dey lower your longer throat den to dey regret later say your money dun loss due to scam.

I think the primary motive of p2p na to merge client wey dey in need of coin or fiat to reduce risk of scammers. and when someone don dey give offer behind closed doors person sopos know say this thing no be legit. Whenever something don too real to be true just bear it in mind say na scam. Every offer wey person give outside CEX, is likely to be fraud because I see no reason wetting go make person no follow due process. We really need to careful this days because people fit do anything just to get what dey want.

Whenever people hear someone talking about investing money and getting double of what you invested their ears will go high without thinking about where the person that promises to double your money will get it from or even if it's his money doesn't they have anything to do with money rather giving it out because they want to double money that you've invested. Inasmuch as money is concerned, no body wants to lose money or give out money to people that didn't perform any work for them so it's obvious that when you encounter such people you should understand that they are fraudulent and scammers.Furthermore, sometimes I don't blame people because poverty has really eaten deep in some persons life such that they don't care about their privacy or about if what they're getting their self in is fraudulent they will just get involved with the hope of making profits. So poverty is a major criteria that has caused some people falling so easily to internet scams",
