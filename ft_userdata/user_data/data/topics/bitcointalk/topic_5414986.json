  "content": "QuoteIn case the U.S. economy wasn't hurting enough already, the Federal Reserve has a message for Americans: It's about to get much more painful.Fed Chair Jerome Powell made that amply clear this week when the central bank projected its benchmark rate hitting 4.4% by the end of the year — even if it causes a recession. \"There will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions,\" Powell said on Wednesday. \"We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done.\" In plain English, that means unemployment. The Fed forecasts the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% next year, from 3.7% today — a number that implies an additional 1.2 million people losing their jobs. \"I wish there were a painless way to do that,\" Powell said. \"There isn't.\" Hurt so good?Here's the idea behind why boosting the nation's unemployment could cool inflation. With an additional million or two people out of work, the newly unemployed and their families would sharply cut back on spending, while for most people who are still working, wage growth would flatline. When companies assume their labor costs are unlikely to rise, the theory goes, they will stop hiking prices. That, in turn, slows the growth in prices.  But some economists question whether crushing the job market is necessary to bring inflation to heel. \"The Fed clearly wants the labor market to weaken quite sharply. What's not clear to us is why,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a report. He predicted that inflation is set to \"plunge\" next year as supply chains normalize.The Fed fears a so-called wage-price spiral, in which workers demand higher pay to stay ahead of inflation and companies pass those higher wage costs on to consumers. But experts disagree that wages are the main driver of today's red-hot inflation. While worker pay has risen an average of 5.5% over the last year, it's been eclipsed by even higher price increases. At least half of today's inflation comes from supply-chain issues, noted former Fed economist Claudia Sahm in a tweet. Sahm noted that lower-wage workers today have both benefitted the most from pay increases and been hurt the most by inflation — inflation driven by higher spending by wealthy households rather than people lower down the ladder. Rising rates, falling jobsWhile the exact relationship between wages and inflation remains under debate, economists are much clearer on how raising interest rates puts people out of work.When rates rise, \"Any consumer item that people take on debt to buy — whether that's automobiles or washing machines — gets more expensive,\" said Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute. That means less work for the people making those cars and washing machines, and eventually, layoffs. Other parts of the economy sensitive to interest rates, such as construction, home sales and mortgage refinancing, also slow down, affecting employment in that sector.In addition, people travel less, leading hotels to reduce staffing to account for lower occupancy rates. Businesses looking to expand — say, a coffee shop chain opening a new branch —  are more hesitant to do so when borrowing costs are high. And as people spend less on travel, dining out and entertainment, those hoteliers and restaurateurs will have fewer customers to serve and eventually cut back on staff.\"In the service economy, labor is the biggest component of your cost structure, so if you're looking to cut costs, that's where you'll look first,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Financial Group.While in Boockvar's view hiking rates is needed, the Fed's tactics strike him as aggressive. \"I just have a problem with the [Fed's] rapidity and scale,\" he said. \"They're coming on so fast and strong, I'm just worried the economy and markets can't handle it.\"Layoffs aheadIn the meantime, the Fed's existing rate hikes have put about 800,000 job losses in the pipeline, according to predictions from Oxford Economics. \"When we look at 2023, we see almost no net hiring in the first quarter and job losses of over 800,000 or 900,000 in the second and third quarter combined,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, Oxford's lead U.S. economist. Others predict an even harder landing, with Bank of America expecting a peak unemployment rate of 5.6% next year. That would put an additional 3.2 million people out of work above today's levels.Some policy makers and economists have called out the Fed's aggressive rate hike plans, with Senator Elizabeth Warren saying they \"would throw millions of Americans out of work\" and Sahm calling them \"inexcusable, bordering on dangerous.\" Powell promised pain, and many are questioning just how much pain is necessary.\"Inflation will come down quite a bit faster if we actually hit a recession. But the cost of that is going to be much bigger,\" said Bivens said. The danger, he added, is that the Fed has set off a runaway train. Once unemployment starts rising sharply, it's hard to make it stop. Rather than neatly halting at the 4.4% rate projected by Fed officials, the jobless numbers could easily keep rising.\"This idea that there's an inflation dial that the Fed can just haul on really hard and leave everything else untouched, that's a fallacy,\" Bivens said. Instead of the soft landing for the economy the Fed says it's aiming for, Bivens added, \"we are now pointing the plane at the ground pretty hard and hitting the accelerator.\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fed-interest-rates-unemployment-inflation/....I think this article echoes the most common observations and concerns people have made concerning the US economy.While the united states has historically excelled at getting itself into trouble. It has recently had great difficulty with exit strategies. While american is good at entering a phase of inflation. if history is any indicator, exiting inflation will be far more difficult.I still maintain that productivity and wealth are strongly correlated. As long as nations can maintain relatively stable levels of productivity, their wealth and standard of living may also be maintained. Higher fossil fuel prices, food prices and inflation introduce inefficiencies into markets. Hampering production. But it is still possible to seek and find alternatives. Later on is where things could become more difficult, with more limited options.Early adoption has been key in the modern era. Early adopters of bitcoin, amazon, tesla and other high growth giants has made a high number of millionaires and billionaires over the past few decades. As economic conditions shift, becoming an early adopter of successful financial and economic strategies may also be key. While our current crisis situation is extremely unfortunate, it is possible that there are many opportunities that will become available and I hope people of the world are able to leverage and take advantage of said opportunities when they materialize.",

      "body": "It's confusing to say if unemployment rates go up, prices will have to come down because companies will realise people are poorer and lower their prices. If this was true, why don't they just do what left leaning governments do when they do well and statt to move the goal posts. Poverty was once considered destitution, now it's considered to be earning less than 60% of the average income (aroud 40% of $40,000). There's ways to fiddle with employment rates too, change it so students aren't classed as employed or people earning below a threshold or some pensioners). Most effects governments put on people to tackle rising inflation just exacerbate and intensify the problems faced by the people on lower incomes and those unemployed, the exact groups it already had the greatest effect on while there was inflation. At this point you probabky have to question who lowering inflation benefits and why (and I don't think it benefits anyone better than offering people discounts on goods after adjusting them for inflation).",

I think the bigger point is that the Fed can't just sit idly by and do nothing at a time when the economy is going through a heartbreaking transformation, let alone right now. Even if it wanted to, which I don't think so, the Fed doesn't have a magic wand with which to get things started. So while it can't solve our economic problems, it also can't sit idly by and do nothing. It just had to keep moving forward in the same direction—just like the traffic cops had to keep driving cars even if they couldn't get the city to fix the roads and clear the traffic.A much more effective solution is a progressive tax on investment profits. Just imagine how much money could be raised by limiting the tax breaks enjoyed by those with higher incomes. Instead of protecting the bank, maybe this extra money could be used for infrastructure improvements and other things.",

This is sure to cause hardship for many families and increase inequality, as lower-wage workers are the ones who will be most affected by the job losses.So, if you're looking to keep your job, it might be a good idea to start hoarding canned goods and non-perishables.

Let's say that among the community, apart from the increasing number of unemployed, the impact such as skills will be duller, vulnerable people will experience psychological burdens, this can also have an impact on political and social instability, including an increase in crime. The Fed tries to turn off one button instead triggers another button to work to complete.Isn't the role of the government to pay attention to its people so as not to be affected by inflation, while workers who are trying to survive in the midst of inflation are forced to deal with it without any guarantee of social costs? Wow America will be a zone that remains terrible as long as inflation lasts, if in the next 1 year I'm not sure 4.4% next year is the right number.",

      "body": "The problem started many years ago, at least with Eisenhower and the last straw was Nixon. When their currency became global but was not backed by anything and they kept printing it. The disaster was waiting to happen like a ticking time bomb! Then Reagen came and took a shit on the economy by infecting it with capitalism. Now a large part of the world is dumping US dollar and all that printed nonbacked fiat is going back to United States. The result is more and more inflation.Right now the US economy is like a drowning man who tries to cling to anything he can, you can't really blame them for thrashing around trying to buy more time above water.What's going to happen in the end, I can not predict. Historically US economy has fallen apart before and they've rebuilt it at the cost of millions suffrage. But those times they could still force others to continue using their weak currency to give it a fake strength (eg. introduction of petrodollar in the 40's), I don't think they can repeat anything like that.So they play with the rates right now trying to keep inflation under control at the cost of causing recession. But the combination of recession and inflation is a lot worse than inflation alone.P.S.

They try to hold on to keep the economy afloat in the short term, knowing full well that in the long term inflation will increase, and those that aren't in the top 5-10% feel the crunch. However, the news usually just covers the stories of companies losing money, rather than the individual households.It's why I partly hate pensions. It seems like a way of taxing you, because the retirement age continues to go up, and inflation literally makes your pension worth much less than it was when you were putting it in, especially if you've been doing it your whole life, and at 65 you decide to retire.

I'm probably going to regret this statement, but; I can't see how we don't directly benefit from this. People will lose all confidence in banks, and the government because this is now having a compounding effect, and in a short amount of time. So, it's not like the people have forgotten about the last recession, hell some might even still be feeling the effects of it. We've seen signs of a recession even right after surviving it, and some actually do argue that we never really leave a recession, the government just implements temporary solutions to keep their values as high as possible. However, that usually leads to more inflation down the line. That's the whole meaning behind the statement of the \"rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\" - Percy Bysshe Shelley.",
