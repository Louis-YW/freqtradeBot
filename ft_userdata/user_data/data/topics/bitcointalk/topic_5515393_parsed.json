Is there anything wrong with that? Of course not, although the ideal of owning bitcoin is when you withdraw it to a wallet and have full control with your own keys, whereas going through a third party means 50:50 you still have strong rights to claim ownership. There is no debate as long as the third party is bound by the rules and every time you withdraw bitcoin from Grayscale and it works then everything is considered legal.",

For an institution for many reasons it is better to buy Grayscale's, MicroStrategy shares, or ETFs than to buy bitcoin directly.All these ETFs, including buying and holding Bitcoin, boil down to one thing: trust in Bitcoin. This university investing in Grayscale’s mini trust clearly shows they understand Bitcoin and believe in its future. Whether their plan is short-term or long-term, it’s positive news being the first to invest in Bitcoin.Holding Bitcoin is a different story, though. But I think it really depends on how we understand it. We shouldn’t get caught up in technicalities; instead, let’s appreciate that they’re investing, which means adoption is already happening.",

For individual investors, they provide an easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without managing crypto wallets or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges, making Bitcoin investments more accessible for some. For institutions, ETFs offer a regulated and secure method to include Bitcoin in their portfolios, aiding in diversification and potentially enhancing returns. Institutions can trade these ETFs on traditional stock exchanges, simplifying the incorporation of Bitcoin into their existing investment strategies. This creates a pathway for institutional and retail capital to find its place in the cryptocurrency marketplace",

Just 2 my cents.I get what you mean but if we take that harsh stance and discourage loved ones from investing in bitcoin or advise people not to invest in bitcoin if they don't store bitcoin themselves. Do you think more people will invest in bitcoin and will bitcoin become as popular as it is today? I bet if there were no bitcoin ETFs, we wouldn't have as many people interested and invested in bitcoin as we do today. As you can see, the amount of money flowing into the market through ETFs is huge, and even the amount of bitcoins bought by ETFs exceeds the amount of BTC mined every day. That shows that the demand for bitcoin is huge but most people do not want to invest in it directly but want to invest through ETFs because it makes them feel safer in their mind.We can't expect everyone to be like us and confident enough to store their own bitcoins. By the way, I don't think buying bitcoin and storing bitcoin will be easier than gold or stocks, this is the bias of bitcoin investors. Put yourself in the shoes of people who have never invested in bitcoin and don't even have basic knowledge of technology, they even have difficulty using the internet, you will see their answer is completely opposite to yours. And unfortunately, such people still make up the majority of the world's population.",

And that's because if the government literally hates bitcoin why do they seem to hodl it secretly. Seeing this made me think of how the US government literally gave bitcoin a pull back during the period of the HBO drama by Making news of them attempting to move some coins.Firms like these and universities actually have the opportunity to invest in bitcoin mainly if the government wants them to. The idea is bitcoin is the biggest and top crypto currency in the whole ecosystem.
