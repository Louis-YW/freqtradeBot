  "content": "I think this is the first of it's kind, criminals are faking the voice of Elon Musk, hire someone that sounds like him and the interview, but then change the words itself. But you can't really say that it's fake because the criminals took one step further to synchronize everything, from the opening and closing of his mouth and the words that are coming. Sounds comical, but this is a bold step to scam crypto investors out of their hard earn money.https://vimeo.com/user52361365I also urge everyone to report this video as it is circulating on Youtube just like the one below so that it will be taken down ASAP.https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8PwAJyjFpRA",

People who listen to Musk with any ideas related to cryptocurrencies should know that they are wasting their time, because the man has publicly admitted that he is not very knowledgeable about these things.Not only is the problem that someone is doing things like this, but the even bigger problem is that millions of naive people believe in fairy tales like this.",

I guess they've got to go right back to the studio and edit it a little bit.Well, those that would fall for this would be those that still look and listens to Elon for crypto investment advices on what coin or projects to invest in. I mean, his a great guy but not so much anymore when it comes to cryptos after the episode he played sometime last year.Let's hope users on the forum don't get to fa for this cheaply and unexperienced edition of a blue screen interview,  so poor!",

I figure that a complete (gullable) outsider might fall for it, based on the 30% daily return the video claims to offer. The figure on the associates scam website ranged between 11% and 23% weekly, depending on the (dis)investment plan you chose. Why not match the criteria between the video and the site? Go figure …What still manages to lure people to these crypto scam is a combination of factors, amongst which lies the perception that people get rich in crypto all the time, thus creating a ground for gullibility to develop over common sense.",

Go figure …At first glance at both videos (the one in this thread and the one you linked), it is already glaring to me that it's an edited video, but I showed it to a couple other people and apparently, it's not so easy to spot for some; they maybe have not watched many of his interviews or understand fully how videos could be faked with the lip sync and voice similarities. On more careful research, if those people chose to research they could likely have made out the irregularities, but it's still scary the number of people such videos could fool at first viewing.What's more scary is how many people sheep into investments cause certain successful individuals said so, whether or not they have proven to be savvy in the said investment niche.",

But most of the time very slow or not even removing it until the scammers have victimizes a lot to the tune of hundreds if not millions of dollars.",

That would be a good way to make a hosts file with the vast majority of crypto sites (innocent websites that get caught in the net can be filtered out with a whitelist).The only problem is that would the hosts file be able to process thousands of entries without lag. I suppose somebody could make a DNS resolver which solves this issue, takes the proccessing away from the hosts files as well. But I doubt any big corp is interested in that at present.",
