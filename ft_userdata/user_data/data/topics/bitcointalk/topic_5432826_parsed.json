  "content": "QuoteIT is common knowledge that Nigerian roads are generally either in a state of disrepair, poorly maintained or altogether untarred. With Nigeria boasting of the largest road network in Africa, it is not surprising that only about 60,000km out of its estimated 195,000km or road network is paved. Majority of the nation’s road network was constructed between the 80s and 90s, with a larger portion of them currently deteriorated because of poor maintenance. Even when the existing roads are constructed or supposedly maintained, it soon falls into disrepair due to the use of low-quality materials. Despite huge budgetary allocations been committed annually to infrastructural development projects, much yet remains to be seen on how the condition of the roads justifies their fiscal allocation.The Nigerian road network is majorly classified into three. First is Trunk Road “A” which encompasses the framework of the national road grid and cuts across regional boundaries. The Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, is responsible for financing, constructing, and maintaining this class of roads. Second is the Trunk Road “B” which connects the major cities within states. They are financed, constructed, and maintained by the state governments. Third, Trunk Road “C” falls under the category of roads constructed and maintained by local government authorities in Nigeria, and they are usually untarred.Read more; https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/10/the-deplorable-condition-of-the-nigerian-road-a-bane-to-economic-sustainability/amp/Okay make we leave all this article, I just gaz put am as e make sense when I read am. Normally we know say road no good for Nigeria like na one of the things we dey lack for this country plus the road no come safe self join (so na double wahala). I wan know how ur own area be for the bad road matta, how we go solve this problem because when you reason am this bad roads follow for many of our problems as e dey spoil market as transport dey increase, car maintenance dey cost as the road the follow spoil cars then market come dey over cost due to all this factors. How we go fit take achieve an increase in the quality of our road to bring about a safe transportation, wetin you think government fit do or dem dey do wrong?.",

The percentage of good roads in my place no go reach 15% out 100%. Just imagine me traveling from my hometown to my school within my state again ooo and I dey spend 8 hrs for road. Chai even from Lagos to maiduguri wey be longest journey for Nigeria no far pass like that, lol . Normally that journey na 1½ hrs journey but na the nature of the road make am that long. Despite say na for raining season, e no suppose reach like that if the road dey manageable. Both government and contractors get fault but na wetin dem pay the contractors dem dey do for us jare. I support government to reintroduce toll gate if dem go use the money realise to maintain our roads tru tru e go make sense small. Government dey shout already say load Don too much for am and I no sure say government alone fit take the responsibility of maintaining and constructing new roads for our country. By reintroducing that toll gate again at least those heavy duty vehicles wey dey follow spoil the road go dey contribute to it maintenance.",

Upon the road taxes wey Agbero, FRSC and other government agencies dey collect, it is not enough to consider the repairs.  The worst na when rainy season begins, coupled with the rising cost of energy, PMS and vehicular maintenance cost; no wonder many dey sell their motor instead.For my side right now, the roads dey manageable because of the dry season, compared to when it rained. All vehicles and bikes can easily maneuver the holes. If them been patch up these bad roads on time at earlier signs of cracks, e for save a lot more stress trying to think out cost and allocation of contract palava per square meter, of the current road in question.",

In one of residence in Rivers State, the road is in good condition, not just because the government did the road, but also because the residence around there have very good maintenance culture, If dem see pot holes, dem dey fill am us with cement, dem dey tidy their drainage so water nor go dey gather for the road, na street road be that, and na so dem dey maintain am. If Government fit adopt good maintenance culture, dey run maintenance for roads wey dem dun do, e go make sense. To just the road and leave am anyhow nor go well, before person go know e dun spoil.",
