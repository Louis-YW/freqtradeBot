  "content": "Bitcoin is a digital asset that can be stored at a cryptocurrency exchange or in a digital wallet. Each individual coin represents the value of Bitcoin’s current price, but you can also own partial shares of each coin. The smallest denomination of each Bitcoin is called a Satoshi, sharing its name with Bitcoin’s creator. Each Satoshi is equivalent to a hundred millionth of one Bitcoin, so owning fractional shares of Bitcoin is quite common.Below are facts you would love to know about bitcoin 1. The coins are created by users who \"mine\" them by lending computing power to verify other users’ transactions which use blockchain technology.They receive Bitcoins in exchange.2.The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with US dollars and other fiat currencies(the physical money we use every day in our bank accounts).3. Bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialised software.It is believed that crypto currency is actually used in most countries today but it has not yet been known, although bitcoin is one of the fast rising crypto currency in the world today most people still don't understand how beneficial it is.Hope you enjoyed it.",

I agree that most people still don't understand how beneficial Bitcoin is because their negative thoughts still stuck on their heads maybe because of FUD.",

Bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialised software.It is improper to store in centralised exchanges because they are not reliable. These platforms can easily be affected by hacks and negative government policies. The owners of these exchanges could also pull an exit scam or mismanage the business.

They buy, hodl and sell when the price appreciates. Others mainly in developing nations use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.",

Bitcoin mining  is a very expensive process, and not many can afford it. A less expensive alternative for beginners who want to own bitcoins but do not have the money to buy would be to accept bitcoins as payment for services rendered. Quote from: Biggeno on January 09, 2024, 03:34:57 PM3.

Always store your coins in a non custodial wallet like Electrum, Blue wallet or Unstoppable wallet. It’s recommended to buy an hardware wallet like trezor if you are hodling large amounts of bitcoins. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421039.msg61293646#msg61293646",

Bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialised software.OP, this is not correct.Bitcoin is simply stored in the blockchain, so it is stored on the network, not on a hard drive using specialized software or on an exchange. Only the bitcoin network (thousands of computers called nodes, decentralized around the world) stores bitcoin, no specific computer or exchange or device or whatever stores it.The way you can ACCESS and transact with your bitcoin is through software called a wallet, specifically using your cryptographic keys. This wallet software could be various different things, including a company providing the service like an exchange, or a specialized hardware gadget, or software on your computer, but that is NOT how bitcoin is stored.And storing of the actual cryptographic keys which allow you to access your bitcoin through wallet software (whichever kind you're using) is a different thing entirely and that could be stored through a service like an exchange, on a hardware wallet, on your computer, on a usb stick, on paper, in your head, on metal, on anything cuz it's literally just a string of characters so anything that you can write in/on (including 'writing' into your memory) can store your keys.",

Beside that, these exchanges can steal your funds, i.e., Bitcoin, by collapsing. The past is full of such cases where, when investors put their funds in exchanges to store them, the exchange took advantage of the opportunity, among which Mt-Gox is at the top. .So, therefore, I believe that keeping funds or assets in exchange is inappropriate for users who have an investment in Bitcoin. So OP I didn't agree with you that storing Bitcoin in exchanges. Stored Bitcoin only in hardware wallets because only wallets give you the guarantee of your assets in terms of privacy. So guys, use your wit and don't keep your assets in exchanges instead of a hard wallet.",

Bitcoins have to be stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Coinbase, or offline on a hard drive using specialised software.In this part, I think there is a mistake in understanding it properly. I will give you a little understanding of how to store coins in a wallet.Storing in wallets on exchanges is not recommended because exchanges are not wallets for storing Bitcoin assets.Exchange as a place to buy and sell assets including Bitcoin.Each wallet generates a seed phrase and this seed phrase is the most important for wallet users in terms of accessing the contents of the wallet.If you use the exchange as a place to store Bitcoin, then that is where your mistake lies. Why, because the address obtained on the exchange does not produce a seed phrase.The truth is that exchanges are not wallets.",
