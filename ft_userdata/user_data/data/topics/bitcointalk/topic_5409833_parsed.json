These resources are what makes it possible for man to somewhat survive here on earth, but when these resources are depleted and abused, over time it will definitely come back to haunt man who is always in dire need of them. Thus the call for eco-consciousness and other sort of campaigns that advocate for more care for the enviroment is basically just man looking out for himself, now and in the long run.",

What would be the point? Why procreate if you basically just give birth to someone on a death sentence? The earth itself might not care for us, but its unique conditions (and yes, since we haven't seen many examples besides earth, they are somewhat unique, at least to our solar system) ''cared'' enough to give us a chance to form and evolve, so by caring for the planet would be caring for something that is not ours (we did not make it, therefore, we are not permitted to destroy it, we are not the Gods of 'it'), but gave birth to us, no matter if we as a species outlive it in whatever form or condition. I hope I made that clear enough.",

It doesn't matter if they are plants, animals and minerals. As humans, we've got taste and needs and these things in our environs is what we could used in satisfying them. We aren't going to leave things be to fly out of space and get the resource we need to fix ourselves up. We would always get it right here but, our actions to the correction of the problems we create is what matters.If we are to say, they shouldn't cut trees, do nothing and there won't be any heavy breathing and no CO2 increase in the environment, then wht about the athletes. At least, they aren't cutting trees but thy get to perform there sports, burn energy and in turn, release CO2 into the atmosphere.In all, we still have to try and follow processes that ensures its remediation.",

In 2019, the ozone hole was considerably smaller, but honestly, I don't see too much improvement in recent years.I'm starting to believe that our generation is pretty much doomed.",

During Covid-19 quarantine measures, pollution was radically decreased, the air was a lot cleaner and the effects of human isolation were very evident for the environment. However, that was only temporary, since after the measures were drawn, we quickly reverted to our previous state. Human activity is harmful for the environment, period.
