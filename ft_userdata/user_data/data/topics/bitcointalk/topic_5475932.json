  "content": "Fresh press hit from the British The Independent on Bitcoin mining, surprisingly in a positive tone. That's a nice change from what we usually read regarding the energy usage of the mining. Could this indicate a massive shift in public perception? Probably not.Bitcoin mining could supercharge transition to renewables, study claimshttps://www.independent.co.uk/tech/bitcoin-mining-solar-wind-renewable-energy-b2454666.htmlQuoteSolar and wind energy installations could earn hundreds of millions of dollars by mining bitcoin during periods of excess electricity generation, according to a new study.Scientists from Cornell University in the US, who conducted the research, said setting up mining operations could reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency, while also providing revenue that could be reinvested in future renewable energy projects.“Profitability of a mining system hinges on periods of steady energy availability since renewable energy sources can vary significantly,” said Fengqi You, a professor of energy systems at Cornell University.“Therefore, it is important to site the mining farm strategically to maximise productivity.”The state with the most potential for setting up profitable crypto mining operations is Texas, according to the study, with 32 planned renewable projects capable of generating combined profits of $47 million.(...)Bitcoin has drawn criticism from environmentalists for the vast amounts of electricity required to support its network and mint new units of the cryptocurrency, with recent analysis from the University of Cambridge estimating that it uses roughly the same amount of electricity as Poland.The plummeting costs of renewable energy mean bitcoin miners are increasingly turning to solar, wind and hydro sources to power their operations.",
