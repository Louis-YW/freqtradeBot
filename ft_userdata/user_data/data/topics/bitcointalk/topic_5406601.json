No matter how hard, we need to keep surviving using everything we have so we can pass the bad situation that happens in our country. I am sure all people will keep trying to do the best they can because we know that the recession will mot besides us forever. There will be a moment for us to the recession will end and no matter how long the recession will happen, we can make sure that we are ready for that.",

And the worst thing is that those who can't prepare because they can only afford to cover the basics already are always hit the hardest.We don't know how bad the recession will be and when exactly it will come. The situation can also very from country to country, from fiat currency to fiat currency. And cryptos aren't a safe haven, as they can go up, but might also go down along with the global economy.",

      "body": "Recession discussion is already in public but you can't do anything about it, if an individual is receiving less of income, they will be badly hit because recession comes as inflation increases. The remedy to go for is diversification of income but you can't also do that if you are not able to save up and gather finance. As recession gets closer with inflation, it eats up into the finance you have and savings becomes hard but we need to keep trying harder and try to reduce expenses by buying the necessary things and leave out those not necessary.",

I can't get surprise for the next recession as I could still remember what happened in 2008 very well. The war in Ukraine has create a lot of problems already for the market and the risk assets are mostly hit. I will say this meltdown is going to last as far as the war in Ukraine remains with us.",

Calling for a collapse is actually the common opinion now.At this point in time the question is how big the next recession or depression is going to be? We know that is coming and we also know that it is inevitable, but are the politicians currently on the top will be skilled enough to avoid a complete collapse of the economy? That is what we don't really know, personally this is something that I will not like to see because even if the collapse of the fiat system will be something good for the long term health of the economy the amount of suffering this will bring is so enormous that no matter how prepared we may think we are, we are also going to have problems under that scenario",

As if they plan to use gun ammunition as fuel or food. It is a strange world we live in, with strange people. I have prepared for a crash for many years, and I'm not well prepared. If the doom and gloom doesn't hit after a period of years. It becomes normalized to assume it will never happen. The confidence and smugness many have over the next recession must be fueled by a firm belief that it will never occur.Most buy a gun and focus primarily on home defense. Or grow their own food to focus on self sustainability. A big crash could extend to transportation, communication and energy as well as the basic fundamentals. I don't think there's anyone who is fully prepared for that.",

The increasing prices of oil and oil products is causing a huge ripple effect on the local economy of my country. It's the reason why the cost of public transportation is now rising. And since all kinds of goods are also transported, their prices are also rising. But where did you get this? Did you have some kind of a premonition? Did you see it in your crystal ball?",

Demand of oil will keep on increasing and those who own the oil rigs and distributors will keep on taking advantage of the high demands by implementing high value for it.It will not go down, imo. If there's a good investment now, that is the target. As long as that US-Russia conflict is not fixed there will be shortage of oil supply and I doubt Russia will back down to their challenge.Prepared? That's something that will depend on the economy.

But I find it highly unlikely considering how much an investment has poured in and will continue to come in from institutional, governmental and retail traders. The reality is crypto currencies are here to stay but we have to be patient with the price due to the shaky global economy.",

Economic development is at the top of the world, but price problems are escalating, jobs are shrinking, and investment channels are gradually becoming inefficient.
