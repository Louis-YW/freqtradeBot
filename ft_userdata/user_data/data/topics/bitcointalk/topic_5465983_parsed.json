I won't Encourage risking depositing your asset in a wallet you're aware someone else might still be in possession of the private key.OP is quite knowledgeable about the fact that people will always hold the private key even after they have sold it to him, that is entirely his own problem. My concern is that those wallets might hold value locked in it that you have no ide about until you stumble upon  a research that show you the need and use of that wallet. It will be too late if someone else has found the need for it and has bought it off you for an insignificant amount and made a fortune out of it.",
