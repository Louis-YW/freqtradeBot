With USDM, you can leverage with other assets like USDT. It means USD margin.",

I found a coin with USDm  but it seems that it is not active so I don't think you will find it listed on any trading exchange.other than that you can talking about feature market and m is for margin",

      "body": "Just to dumb down what @Bitcoin_Arena have said, the suffix \"m\" indicates the type of account you are going to use in order to execute a trade of a particular trading pair -- which in this case is associated with  \"Standard Account\"[1]. In other words, it's just regular trading account that has access to any type of asset with no commission fee as described ny their article.[1] https://www.exness.com/standard-accounts/",
