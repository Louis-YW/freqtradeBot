  "content": "Resistance are barriers and places where you encounter selling pressure which can lead to a reversal or a range before breakout. In the financial market resistance happens when the supply of currency, commodity, instrument, crypto etc. is higher than the demand. Supports are places where you find buying interest. The inverse of Resistance.Note: Support and Resistance are zones and not a point on a chart as some unprofessional thinks. Support is usually at the base whereas resistance at the top. For a newbie to get it correctly draw it along a trendline or spot turning point on the chart.As we proceed I will bring few lessons to note.LESSON 1: Resistance or Support Level may not hold due to the fact that the market is influence by other factors which revolves around economics, politics, natural disasters, wars, interest etc. So use resistance and support alongside other technical and fundamental tools. The Best Time Frame to Draw Support or Resistance.There are no best time to draw support and Resistance. Usually or most likely the market respond to Support or Resistance drawn with higher time frame.LESSON 2: The best time frame to draw Resistance or Support Level is the time frame that is suitable to your trading pattern or style. Read the simple guide below;Position traders usually use monthly and weekly chart to pin point, place or choose there zones.Swing traders uses weekly and daily chart to pin point, place there zones.Daily traders uses daily and hour times frames.Scalpers has no rule, you become the rule.Note: Trading is complicated and you need triggers.To know the Strongest Support and ResistanceI present to you two school of thought; The first believes that ones a Resistant or Support has held more than two times that particular zone should be considered as strong.The Second believes that ones a zone has been tried more than ones there is high possibility for it to give a way.LESSON 3:  Always consider the pressure at which the price bounces back. It will tell you much of that zone. Whether the first school of thought or the second as mentioned above you need to know that conditions changes.Feel free to add you input as there are many lessons to learn.",

For a daily trader, 15 minutes, 30minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours is most appropriate but a lesson has to be taken from a daily trading, all trades should be closed at the end of the day.Quote from: RioBlemz on September 19, 2023, 05:54:03 PMLESSON 3:  Always consider the pressure at which the price bounces back.

So with the chart on candlesticks, you can also use it to determine whether a tested support or resistance will give way or do a rebounce to continue reverse position.",

One of the indicator of being a good trader is not to depend to anyone but of course to have your own trading strategy and you can easily set your trading goal once you already have this one. Well, the first thing that you need to do is to identify what kind of trader are you, usually the resistance and support level analysis works for the position traders as their timeline is longer and have more data to analyze.",

Choosing a longer time frame brings a lot of assistance in analyzing the market because there you have time to read and analyze maximum aspects of the market drow hold your position. On the time frame where you are bound with 30 min or 15 min, support and resistance continuously change due to the market volatility and nonavailability of the psychological ranges.The rest of the points are sufficient enough to help out a newbie IMO, relatively  , usually its not style but I did liked it as a buddy above used it effictivly.",

I should advice that you don't just use Bolliger Band alone, use it along other tools for analysis.",

But to determine the strong SNR, you can only see them in the higher time frame. Meaning we must have the same plot of SNR when in terms of the higher time frame because it's really obvious. And also, we can confluence them to indicator to strengthen. If the majority of us have the same plotting of SNR, meaning we did it correctly.",

Indeed. This is why it is useful to use both larger and smaller timeframes. We can use 4h-1d timeframes to determine whether we are in a premium or discount zone and then switch to 15m-4h TF in order to find good entry and exit points.This can be applied for pretty much all types of trading beside scalping on super low TF with low SLs and high leverages.Quote from: UchihaSarada on September 20, 2023, 01:19:58 AMTo deal with resistances and supports, you must know it and in action you must not bind yourself with an idea like that resistance is strong and can not be broken out, that support is strong and price will not be dumped under it.

I suggest dummy trading to any newbie who might be reading this because that saves up your money and a lot of frustration but gives you good insight and a head start.A support level would be built where many buyers are present, it is usually lower than the trading price and the resistance level would be built where a lot of sellers are present. As the price drops more difficult to cross support levels are found because people are ready to buy at discounted prices.

Trading support and resistance has a lot of things we need to put into consideration and we don't need to keep trading without some certain conditions. Just imagine someone that is trading support and resistance using the loyal time frame. It will never hold because if you look at the higher time, we can find out that the point where we think is support or resistance may never be and it may look like a fake out.

Resistance and support alone cannot help and be relied upon, because if a resistance is broken, it becomes support for the next session till it gets broken back down and vice versa for support.
