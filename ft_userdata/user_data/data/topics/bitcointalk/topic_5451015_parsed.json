So we create a meme coin called Papillon to give utilies to all meme coins!We are here to discuss about our project and to invite all from our begging to the trip.Lets talk about PapillonPapillon Token made an epic presale on PinkSale filled the hard cap of 80 BNB in three seconds (3sec). The official launch is in a few hours (13.04.2023 16:00 UTM) and is expected to be also amazing.Papillon Token is a community-driven token that cannot be controlled by anyone. This means that its value is determined solely by the community and its demand. By being part of the community, you have a say in the direction of the token and can help drive its growth.One of the most attractive features of Papillon Token is its staking program, which offers a huge APY from buybacks. This means that as more people buy and hold the token, the value of the token increases, leading to bigger rewards for stakers. Additionally, the low tax rate of only 2% makes it a more affordable investment.Papillon Token also offers unique rewards to its holders. With 2% Doge rewards, 3% marketing, and 2% buyback, holders are incentivized to hold onto their tokens for the long term. This is further supported by the 1% liquidity that ensures there is always a pool of funds available for buying and selling.Unlike other tokens, Papillon Token has no team tokens, which means that the team does not have a vested interest in the token's value. This ensures that the token's growth is driven purely by community demand.Many extreme contests for all holders!site: https://papillontoken.com/Join Community: @papillontokenTwitter: https://twitter.com/TokenPapillon",
