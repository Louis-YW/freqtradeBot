  "content": "Hello,Why does Facebook allows ads for Elon musk to present opportunity for bitcoin auto trading using Quantum AI?I noticed in the video that Elon Musk is speaking about the AI platform that it can auto trade with $250 USD minimum deposit and help people become rich in a short amount of time. This fake news  video must have been done by scammers and I always report the ads but it comes back again. I also saw the comments in Facebook that the platform helped them earned money but I believe it is a fake comments made by scammers with fake or hacked Facebook profile. I just installed an app called text me with a virtual phone number and not my actual number to see how thee scam works and I get calls from different number from different countries so scammer encourage me to sign up and deposit the money but I hang up the phone. The scammers claimed the trading website is regulated in Canada and UK which is not true. This are the website www.bethebank.site which seems to be offline and www.afexeu.com but unregulated and they claimed company not regulated is not a necessarily a scam and they said I can try with $250 dollars and see how it works and if it did not perform well I can withdraw the money anytime but that seems a lie. Also one of the scammers who called me said they want  me to install any desk so they can have access to my pc to set up the account but I never gave them access nor deposited the $250 dollars. The strange thing that scamadviser give afexeu.com a very good score how can that happen? They write fake good reviews to give the rating high?",

All we can do is to warn people about possible scams, which you nicely did. I think there is a very strong basis that afexeu[dot]com is a scam. Their website only claimed that they're regulated, but there were no further info of who issue their license.And \"bethebank\" rang a bell on my mind, but I can't find any record of them on this forum for previous scam attempt. I can't shrug away the sense of eerie familiarity with their name, though. Anyone have a better luck on this matter, perhaps?",

You did the right thing this is how they scam people by getting access to your computer I have seen this method several times on Youtube not only as a trading platform but they also act as a call center from a popular marketplace like Amazon To see how scammers do their things check this video or better subscribe to how this guy exposes these scammersScambaiterQuoteThe strange thing that scamadviser give afexeu.com a very good score how can that happen?

These scammers that have been using like videos of Elon Musk that talks in a convention and then putting it up like it's theirs and put some text about their project is also popular in YouTube hacked accounts. And those comments that are supporting these scammers are also them, it is obvious that those are fake accounts too. Honestly, just like YouTube, Google, Facebook(Meta) isn't really strict in terms of these ads that are coming out to our feed. In fact, there's one that I've reported before about a fake ledger IPO and it's a sponsored ad.Quote from: Hamada1983 on August 28, 2023, 06:35:45 PMI just installed an app called text me with a virtual phone number and not my actual number to see how thee scam works and I get calls from different number from different countries so scammer encourage me to sign up and deposit the money but I hang up the phone.

Sorry I don’t have the video but if I see another one will post it here.HelloToday I just received a call from scammer from the uk fake number +5140887296 and asked me to install any desk screen sharing and I told them not to access my personal information and they said I have nothing to do with your personal information I am just helping you to set up the new account to start trading  and I hanged up. I was just messing up with scammer pretending to trade with them. However when I hanged up I receive five missed calls from different numbers. I did not give my real number just a virtual number from my app.I was given the website www.ethertrader.cc and the website looks professional and claimed to be featured on cnn and other news. However when I looked at the domain on Whois, it is hosted by Sarek Oy. I searched it on google and found that the hosting company is scam. Just go to third result in google and look for shutting down scam site.At the footer of the website ether trader I noticed they have the uk address which is fake and registration number but upon looking at the registration number, it is regulated in Marshall island and upon checking the regulatory body I found this from this site:ETHER LIMITEDiFinma LN8318167 – 2116-03-14Operating Trademarkhttps://ethertrader.ccRegistered office address20-22 Wenlock Road, London, EnglandCompany statusACTIVECompany typePrivate Limited CompanyIncorporated on2016-03-14AccountsN/AConfirmation statementN/AThis is contradictory because according to Whois the domain name for ethertrader.cc is registered on December 19th 2022.There is also spelling mistake on the website where on the menu tab it says for the costumers instead of customers. The regulatory body seems to have the fake uk address with domain name registered on Marshall island. I figured out how the scam works. Tell me what u think?",

They know people will research them and find out the truth so they set up those good ratings and pay reviewers.",

I'm not saying that you don't do something but all you do on Facebook is to report it's just a waste of time, I usually report 5 ads and then ignore all the others, Scammers are well funded so they keep showing ads, and Facebook marketing just lets those ads show up.",
