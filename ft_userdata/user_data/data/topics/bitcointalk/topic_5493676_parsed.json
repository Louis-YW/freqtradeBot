And now you switch your story around.First You must learn how to speak respectfuly and not being a dumb aggressive  idiot Second thing I supposed to think there Is a balance on it because i have seen posts and topics about wallet.dat size and they say normally its 100kp and mine was more way big so there is alot of addresses and that mean there is a chance for balance and transactions on it  For why make topic when not see balance = to update what happens  Yeah my bitcoin file cause I found it on (my)pc  does your iq very low to know when I have siblings uses the pc I also can still name it my pc cause it is And I didn't see why are you mad to this point and I have reply with answers so other people can see it but you u just shut up",
