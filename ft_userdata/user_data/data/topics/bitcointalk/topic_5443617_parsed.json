Also, if there is anyone who bet on Liverpool, gamblers who love the Football game, they are for sure rich if they bet a large amount on Liverpool.But the opponent was hardly formed if you look at the current situation during the time they were fighting, 7 out of 0 until the end of the time, it seems embarrassing and disappointing for their supporters.",

Although ManU is still active and in good shape but was humiliated as they underestimated the capacity of Liverpool. Still in the football spirit, it is a game of fun and there is or must be a winner in every game played. I believe ManU learnt a big lesson from what has happened to them on Saturday and for those who bet in favour of Liverpool I believe Liverpool made them xtimes richer now. Congratulations to you all for your big wins.",

The captain did seem to handle it really badly and was giving up when he should have continued fighting - a very bad impression to give to other players on the team, he was even trying to get substituted at one point it seemed. I actually had a multi bet open on this game but with goals under 4.5, everything else on the bet was successful except for the goals reaching 7. I wonder whether Man United will strike back against Southampton with a vengeance on the weekend or continue a fall from grace.",

What I was just saying is that Manchester United had good time too, it is not easy for a club to still have one awaiting match to play and yet maintain the third position. It was a big mistake for Manchester United, but they are not a fallen hero, that statement is not right, not right because the club are not on the relegation zone, the club did not relegate, and not that they are playing bad, but just that the club play bad just once for now.",
