  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm posting a volunteer topic about SpaceMesh :Before I start, I'd like to point out that this is an ultra-early call in view of the Innovation this crypto offers. It's far better and more advanced than Kaspa (which went x200 - x300).Please read this topic carefully and DYOR afterwards. This is the most decentralized cryptocurrency in the world (yes, seriously already more than 80'000 nodes, because anyone can mine it).--- --- --- --- --- --- ---‚ú® What is Spacemesh?Spacemesh is a cryptocurrency distinguished by its unique blockchain technology. Using a new consensus protocol, called Proof of Space-Time (PoST), Spacemesh aims to create a more equitable and accessible decentralized network. (With Smart Contracts, Defi, NFT already available).It's different from what currently exists, and I'll try to explain. Most L1s are copycats, but here we're witnessing something new and big.A phrase to describe it would be: The People's Room. The community around the project is already incredible, and I'm delighted to be part of it! Forget scalability issues and high energy costs, Spacemesh is here to change the game!Whitepaper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18I9GPebWqgpvusI1kMnAB9nayBbL-1qN/view=> big brain stuff, good luck!Where to buy? https://safe.trade/trading/smhusdtIt's available on safetrade, just like $QUBIC. It's a bit of a pain to buy, but it's also a great way to get your hands on it.--- --- --- --- --- --- ---üë®‚Äçüíª The Brains Behind SpacemeshWhat makes Spacemesh particularly interesting are the brilliant minds behind the project. Here are some of the key developers:Tal Moran: A Harvard graduate, Tal has significant experience in secure systems development. He worked on numerous blockchain projects before joining Spacemesh.Lane Rettig: Lane is an influential developer and thinker in the blockchain space, known for his significant contribution to '''Ethereum''' (core developer)''. His expertise in decentralized development and innovative approach are major assets for the Spacemesh team.Iddo Bentov: With a PhD from Cornell University, Iddo is a pioneer in the field of cryptography and distributed systems. His contribution to Spacemesh is invaluable.Rami Kogan: An expert in software development and blockchain, Rami brings his technical expertise to ensure that Spacemesh is not only secure, but also efficient.--- --- --- --- --- --- ---üìà Why invest in Spacemesh $SMH?Advanced Technology: With PoST, Spacemesh aims to solve scalability and energy efficiency problems.World-class development team: The team behind Spacemesh is made up of leaders in the fields of cryptography, blockchain, and IT security.Growth potential: Spacemesh is still in its early stages, which means huge growth potential for early investors.Commitment to Decentralization and Accessibility: Spacemesh is committed to making blockchain accessible to everyone, not just a technological elite.--- --- --- --- --- --- ---üîó Useful LinksOfficial website: https://spacemesh.ioTechnical documentation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18I9GPebWqgpvusI1kMnAB9nayBbL-1qN/viewCommunity: https://discord.com/invite/yVhQ7rC--- --- --- --- --- --- ---üåü ConclusionSpacemesh $SMH isn't just another cryptocurrency. It's a vision, a technological revolution, driven by a dream team. Now is the perfect time to embark on this adventure.Much more advanced than Kaspa and much more promising. Remember that anyone can mine it with a simple computer, so it's really very interesting.Let me reiterate that Lane Rettig is part of the team. He was one of Ethereum's core developers.Missing this call is like missing a much more advanced Kaspa.Slogan: Join the decentralized revolution: user-friendly, financially fair, environmentally sound, and totally permissionless.",
