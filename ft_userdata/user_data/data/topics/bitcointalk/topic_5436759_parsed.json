Well, this quote says \"regardless of the price of the security\", this is part of the sentence I do not agree withFor me, dollar cost average is buying, maybe same amount of bitcoin(for example) at a different price ranges while the market price is going down or in a bear mode. Quote What is your best strategy for Dollar Cost Averaging, do you do it weekly, monthly?What do you advice and why?Like I explained above, my best strategy for dollar cost averaging is to by same amount of the coin at a cheaper price from time to time, could be every daily, every three days, weekly or bi-weekly, it all depends on how strong the bear market is at the period in time..And my advice and why, dollar cost average is a good strategy to make more profit on your investment since it's helps to bring down or reduce your average buying price, by buying same amount of bitcoin at a cheaper price, you are reducing the over all buying price of all the bitcoins bought in the period.",

You can buy each week or each month and do not think about the price. If you see the price, you will not be ale to do DCA as you always think that you are buying too low or too high.I will prefer monthly DCA on 1st of every month. Make sure, you keep buying bitcoin periodically and keep on accumulating bitcoin at all prices.",

      "body": "It depends on their needs how many dollars will be put in bitcoin and varies in this case because they also have to manage their cash flow all the time as long as with this DCA strategy because this is for a long time let's say 3 to 5 years in the future.I do it weekly, it's not even how much dollars I put in, but at least $ 10 must be put in DCA or even more, it depends on the cash flow I get while I work and the income in the business that I run.I started maybe at the right time when the bitcoin price was low, I did it until now, sometimes there are obstacles as well as several other needs that can clog DCA, stop for 1 week or one month, I have experienced that.Yes, how much is the best for Dollar Cost Average they have their own way you can calculate it here : https://dcabtc.com/",

If you were to ask me how I do it then I say you simply divide your money up and invest/trade as you would normally except not all at once. I personally use the daily scale and invest in each dip. At any moment, a giant red candle could appear and ruin your day. Same goes for the giant green candle. Nobody knows when or why it will happen but we know that it will happen. So the best course of action is to minimize the risk with DCA.",

But if it's bitcoin and you're longing to do it in a long period of time then price doesn't matter to you.What matters to you is when you've got money, you'll just buy and accumulate those bits/satoshis that you can buy with the current value that you've got.",

It's important to follow this strategy, so you don't distract yourself purchasing another stuff in your daily routine that will compromise your DCA plan.Also, make sure to write the price you are buying BTC each new turn in a spreadsheet, so once you cashout your profits futurely, you can calculate accurately how much you have made and how much you have invested.",

I'd say make it depend on transaction fees: if you buy small amounts, too can save money by buying slightly larger amounts less often.Not quite, if your goal is to get a true average, than buying as often as possible would be the best way to do it. But it's not very practical and yes, fees can get in the way - unless they're purely determined as a percentage of transaction, in which case they're irrelevant.The most convenient way, for someone who gets their primary income from employment, would be to set a recurring buy on the day of your pay day, or shortly after.But as much as DCA is a simple concept, it's proven to be less effective on average than timing the market (i.e. buying a bit more on what looks like a bottom, and bit less on what looks like the top).",

Basically, it is good that you DCA when the price has dropped because you will have more chances of profit than when you buy on the high after price has broken for bull direction.",
