If you quote that particular post you will see everything in plain text and how they arranged it. This way you can copy that from a tab and use it in another tab, then preview it first to see if you have done it properly. And you will get use to it in no time.",

This and other experiences have taught me the importance of learning and collecting new knowledge on a regular basis, no matter how small, because it provides exposure and understanding of new topics. After that, I took my time crawling the beginners and help boards, as well as the Help navigation bars, from time to time to review what I had learned or to learn about new subjects.

Next, of course, you will need practice, which you can master very quickly with desire.Just click the quote, and you will understand everything.",

It's more of a hyperlink, just like this one which has already been givenCode:[url=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5477669.msg63315738#msg63315738]please I need Â help [/url]It allows you to link to a specific section or location within a webpage. Â When I click on an anchor, it takes me directly to the part of the webpage which I want to read. This is particularly useful for longer web pages with distinct sections, and it enables users to access the relevant content directly, improving the overall user experience.https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/hypertext_links#same_pageSo here's I'm using @ churchillvv post for example since it's longer on this webpage.1.Go to the Icon2.clicking of the Icon3.automatically saves the link (FAQ)4.pasting your linkÂ Â Quote from: Churchillvv on December 13, 2023, 05:30:50 AMSince you don't understand the above code I will explain further.

I also had such feelings whenever I had to ask a question which is so common that a newbie is even aware of it but I who have spent a long time don't know about it. So, what I have in mind to give a suggestion to you.Try to perform reverse engineering, don't be afraid of the word and its simple means, and try to go backward for example how the text has been made, even if the reverse engineering's definition tells us something else but it fits here well. For further understanding, you should use the quote option of any post which you don't know how they made it, for example, someone made an ANN, a bounty page, a signature page, a table with icons, a list, or hyperlinking, etc.You simply have to click on the quote button and you can see what tags and format the user has used to make it.",
