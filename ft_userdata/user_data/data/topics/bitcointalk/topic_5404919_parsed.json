I  am into them for about $19 I guess, I would be happy to send a few if anyone wants one.Thanks!It's a New Mexico location and they do have more if anyone else wants some.  I am sure they would ship more as the franchise makes out like a bandit.  Most locations sent back the coins, but Which Wich allowed each location to decide to keep the coins or send them back, so likely there are other locations that still have some.",
