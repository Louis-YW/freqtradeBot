  "content": "this week i just found out that BRC-20 is a token that uses the Bitcoin blockchain just like ERC-20 which uses the Ethereum blockchain.and now it seems booming because many meme tokens were created here like PEPE or Shiba.i even read on Cointelegraph that the volume of transactions peaked on May 1 with over 366k transactions and their market cap reached 106m$ in just 60 days after createdhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-brc-20-token-standard-becomes-a-new-destination-for-meme-tokenshttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/02/bitcoin-request-for-comment-tokens-surge-to-137m-in-market-value/https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/05/32161181/bitcoins-brc-20-token-explosion-market-cap-skyrockets-682-in-just-one-weekhttps://coingeek.com/brc-20-tokens-reach-100-million-marketcap-in-60-days/",

Sooner or later bitcoin will face the same problem like the eth and other smart-contracts enabled blockchain regarding the higher fees and longer transaction confirmation.",

Maybe other higher rank members may tell you were the post belongs as well.Nevertheless, this is my first time of hearing about this blockchain brc-20I believe it's about bitcoin because every time you want to trade/make the tokens you need a bitcoin wallet and they broadcast it into the bitcoin blockchain.maybe you can read this article Bitcoin BRC-20 token standard and from this article you will saw the affect of this.",

I am sure someone else who had to pay more to acquire some stupid NFT was complaining about my $5 transaction and thinks it's spam, it's hard to get everyone to agree on what is spam and what is not, as far as capitalism style free-market is concerned, those NFTs freaks are transacting value similar to what we do.Quote. Also have you all noticed the names and the pictures of those tokens that are circulating not in the Bitcoin network, none of them look like a serious project, just meme coins that do not solve any real life problemTrue, in fact, none of them even look pretty, I wouldn't pay 10$ for the whole NFT market combined, but I respect the fact that that stupid stuff mean a lot to someone else who is willing to pay for them.",

I mean, wouldn't adding a new facility to the bitcoin ecosystem like BRC-20 require at least overhauling the bitcoin mainnet protocol where previously it required a consensus process?What makes me wonder, why was it just added in 2023 while smart contract-based crypto has been mainstream since 8 years ago, or is this actually a facility that existed a long time ago but is only being used now?",

      "body": "Ordinals attack on Bitcoin network is not new. It happened months ago and caused overload of Bitcoin mempools but you saw one week ago, mempools were cleared after a few months.Unfortunately, after that, very shortly after that mempool clearance, we are witnessing its congestion again. Again it is caused by Ordinals but I have positive feeling with Bitcoin mempools. Basically my belief comes from unsustainable of meme coins which won't be able to keep their hot attraction for too long.Mempools will be cleared in future when those BRC-20 meme tokens are no longer hot in meme communities.See mempool history in last 6 months:https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),6m,weightIt was congested in early February, cleared in late February. Congested again in early March and only was cleared in late April (2 months later). Will I have problem to wait 1 or 2 month for cheaper transaction fee, I won't.",
