  "content": "In the society we find ourselves today, many people have decided to do the unthinkable just to survive the hardships of life. Our education system is also not helping matters. Some who are in school, are being frustrated by not just hunger and lack, but also by some lecturers who would make outrageous demands all so that the individual can scale through that course. Recently, I heard of an incidence of a student who took their life! I may not know what may have propelled such an action. Depression? Frustration? Or maybe heart break? Who knows?.. The question here is, how can we stop this from becoming a norm? Where it does not become the only choice available because the truth is, it's not only brain drain that deprives a country from harnessing the potentials of its citizens, suicide does too!  What do you think can be the better option? Your thoughts.",

Around the world, so many people are struggling with unemployment issues and financial problems. As a result, people do not have the ability to provide for their families. What can one do if they cannot even provide a meal for their children? It is really hard to understand how this situation has come about. It seems like there is no hope for them, but there is always hope if you try hard enough.The world has become a very fast-paced place. People are always on the go, traveling here and there. As a result, they do not have the time to sit down and think about what is really important in life. They are too busy trying to make money and provide for their families. But people should take a step back and look at their lives. They need to realize that it is not all about money, but also about their families and friends. They should not give up. Life is full of ups and downs. It seems that it is always easier to look at the down moments than to look at your positive side. It may seem hard when you are going through some tough times, but every day can be a great day! You just have to get up and see the light. Your life can be better with some determination and a positive attitude. You never know what tomorrow may bring you. The best thing you can do is enjoy each day as if it could be your last.",

This is the same reason insecurity is making a lot of waves as well. If this must stop it will take a working society and economy to fix all this. A massive regulation on religious activities and a good funding on the educational sectors",

Your thoughts.First off, let them know that suicide is never the best option. In an economy where there is a high rate of unemployment, inflation, and a high cost of living ,when people now see life as worthless and meaningless, helping them with a reassuring hope and encouraging them to have believe that whatever they are passing through is just for a moment can be a big solution to anyone trying to commit suicide and providing employment and making the economy a better place can be a better way of stopping suicide in any society.When the economy of a country is working well and citizens have access to all the good things they need, people will not think about committing suicide because they have a better life.",

Unfortunately, suicides are rising at an alarming rate, especially after the pandemic, while the economic recession is the icing on the cake. Quite a few people have committed suicide due to financial issues, and while Greece has relatively low suicidal rates, they have almost doubled after the economic recession in 2010.Chart taken from TradingEconomicsI'm not going to say that it always gets better, life is full of ups and downs, you adapt and improve your coping mechanisms. It's saddening that society's pressure is starting from an early age and has detrimental effects to mental health. The American Psychology Association (APA), in a survey conducted in 2018, has reported higher levels of stress in teenagers than adults.",

Imagine someone that commits suicide because he/she couldn't provide for the family, we he now provide for the family from the grave? No. Rather the suicide will bring more pains and agony to the family.Commiting suicide because you didn't achieve your goal is also wrong because your goal is not in the grave. One way to overcome this incidence of suicide is to find your way around your loved ones, avoid staying alone, and most importantly try to talk to someone about your predicament.",

How is suicide surviving?Of course there are hardship situations in our societies but how is suicide a way out of it. By committing suicide, you didn't survive the hardship that was ment to kill you, you just succumbed to the process, you facilitated it.Suicide is never a way to survive hardship, its just another means to succumb to hardship.",

Yes suicide is as old as man but the suicide as of then is not like these days happening. Suicide is not a norm but it is a man made. I always quote theorists who had propounded human nature. Such theorists are: Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Rousseau etc. These people had given the different way human being behave. But best theorist of mine is Rousseau. Who said, Human being is good but the society he found himself corrupt him. Now concerning the OP, from the beginning of the childhood as human the person is good but as he grew up to mingle with others and in the process they hurt him so he become angry, and that process the child which was having the pure mind became wicked. And do the unthinkable. Now I may say in the contemporary society. Government is the major cause of suicides. Why because when someone has spent 4 to 6 years in university and at the end the person is hope in the society because there is no job for him to take care of his daily needs. so the best option for him is to die and leave the suffering world of dilemma.  Therefore my suggestion to cube this social dilemma is for the government to provide guarantee jobs for the best graduating students in all level of education.",

Why is it that communities and countries in Africa, impoverished severely, low quality of life, plagued by famine and disease, have lower rates of suicide than places like South Korea or some European countries?Culture plays a large role. I speculate that the internet/social media also plays a role, which attenuates the drug problem amongst the youth today as well. I don't know what the solution would be, though I want to bring up a related but separate issue of euthanasia/physician assisted suicide. Suicide is not the best option under any circumstances, and I fear with suicide rates increasing there will be a move closer to euthanasia under the guise of compassion.Suicide rates by country source: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/suicide-rate-by-countryAfrica and Latin America have higher rates of poverty, yet lower suicide rates.",
