  "content": "Recently, I came across information about how much casinos earn and wanted to ask if this data can be extrapolated to the crypto sphere?I know that crypto gaming portals are very profitable, but I have never come across information about how much crypto bookmakers can earn. I am especially interested in how the verified of corporate social networks affects the profits of the casino. I am also interested in how much crypto bookmakers earn on partnerships with football clubs. Any information or link to an article would be appreciated!QuoteAs showcased above, an $100 bet will on average result in $5 in profit for the book, but that $5 will get split in between the bookie and the book owner. Let’s assume this simple 3 person structure, gambler → bookie → book ownerBookies are usually paid a commission at the end of every week on their total books losses. From interviewing a variety of bookies, these commissions often vary from 10-20% (let’s assume 20% because those are the ones that I have seen more often). Meaning that if a bookie has 25 gamblers on his book that each bet an average of $200 in a week, on average the book will go down $10 per gambler ($250 total). This results in $50 of profit for the bookie ($250*.2) and $200 for the book in just one week. Obviously, there might be some marginal costs, like customer acquisition, or a pay-per head service for the book-owner, but raking in $200 a week amounts to over $10,000 a year.",

It is of course very profitable if you look at how certain crypto sportsbooks and casinos can afford partnerships with expensive players, teams, and leagues. But you can also notice that there are many crypto casinos and sportsbooks that are barely known. So it is just a matter of how popular a casino or sportsbook is or how big their userbase is. The more popular they are, the bigger revenue they must have.",

Usually, the profits only trickle until one big whale splurges on the whole bankroll of the casino. It will take months for you to get a return on your initial investment but only one good day for a whale to lose it all. It's kinda like gambling too since you're betting that your money will be fine for a few months until you can safely pull out. As for sportsbooks, I've no idea how profitable those can be. But IMO they are quite safer to place your investments on since on each events, the bookies already have a fix cut on the proceeds of the whole lot.",

At the minimum of 5% that is, which I imagine is rather true since crypto casinos and fiat casinos would generally be the same imo. Even if there were changes as you said with the taxes, I don't think it'd be that big since it'd call to reason that it'd then be regulated if it actually was.Quote from: twiki on August 16, 2022, 11:00:32 PMI am also interested in how much crypto bookmakers earn on partnerships with football clubs.

      "body": "I am not really an expert on the profitability of crypt casinos or sportbooks, but it's obvious that they are a really profitable and good investment for their owners. The boom in the online gambling industry over the last several years saw a rise in new casinos who are competing for market shares. Even with strong competition among the casinos and offering promotions like 200% deposit bonuses it' still a lucrative business to operate your own or be part of a casino. All of the games a casino runs has a house edge, this positive expected value means that the more people play their games the higher their profits. We know the winning percentages of the casino from the Roulette or BlackJack, here the casino usually has a 4-6% edge. In slots the number is even higher, the RTP is between 90-96% that means that on some slots the casino can make up to 10 cents for every $1 played. It's the same games a physical casino is running and they have to pay for rent, electricity, a lot of more employee, security, etc. When it's already profitable for a physical casino to operate with all these additional costs than it makes it so much more lucrative for a online casino to operate the same games. If you have the chance to invest in a crypto casino or sportbook you should look at it in great detail, it's important not to overpay for your share.",
