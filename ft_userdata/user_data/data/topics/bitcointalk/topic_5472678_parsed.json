No expect the price of goods to just come down for Naija because now this week wey Naira has gained greatly against the dollar, and marketers will still dey sell the old goods wey they bought for a high price when $1 is 1293 a few days ago. And secondly, fuel price dey increases almost every day and this marketers dey pay big money to carry their goods come where they go sell. I believe say if the Naira continues to gain well against the dollar and the marketers go to market to buy new goods they will sell their goods well for lower prices than before because they will also buy at low prices. We also need fuel price to be reduced so that marketers go spends less when transporting their goods to the final consumers.",

Let's discussSeriously, I was overjoyed when I hard that value of the dollar dropped. This demonstrates that the CBN governor is attempting to save our lives; otherwise, it will be difficult for us because the cause of living wishes to murder the living. The USDT was about 1,197 last month; image one of them going past the Nigerian naira. However, according to Binance, the USDT is currently around 985, which is encouraging. It will also benefit us if the dollar continues to fall in value, allowing our Nigerian naira to appreciate. Because I am aware of how our Nigerian currency devalues even basic food goods. If you want to buy now, business people will whine about the increasing dollar.Quote from: Samlucky O on November 03, 2023, 03:35:25 PMPeople wey dey earn dollar and Bitcoin dey feel bad as the Naira don dey gather morale against the dollar. This na true sha because for this we country, even though say dollar dey fall, you no go seem am make price of things come down. Wetin go up for Naija dey hardly come down, that na the problem. Actually we all knows that in this our country wetin don already gos up is hardly to come down but we can no predict that it will not come down is just all about time immediately when is time reach it will surely come down, because Normally what goes up most come down. QuoteWetting me I observe for this matter be say. If fuel come down every other thing dey also come down because people dey always complain say transportation cost naim dey make price no dey come down, and if you check well every business wey person dey do for this Naija dey involve transportation. If transport come down things dey also follow come down because nothing Dem fit use as excuse again.To be honest, everything now is involved with transportation; without them, items will not be able to be moved well, it is impossible to move goods efficiently without them. Moreover, once the fuel subsidy is eliminated, they lament that they are unable to transfer the goods again due to the high cost of transportation. In order for the price of all goods to decrease, It would be excellent if the government would consider the issue of gasoline and lower it so that all goods can be reduced.",

Let's discussThe situation of the Naira in the international market is pathetic, to say the least, no thanks to the Buhari government and co-accomplice Emefile, a big shame to these people. We can't adequately talk about the current situation without first talking about what led us to this mess. Fine, Naira has not been so great in the past, but Emefiele still met it at about $1=N150+ (a price that was slightly adjusting) but left it at about $800+, which is unforgivable. This guy first started devaluing our national currency years ago, this is a country that depends on importation for that matter not minding the latter consequence instead of letting the Naira adjust freely and take its prevailing rate. He devalued it many times until the Naira became a mess and negative speculation took over from there. On noticing this, he started pegging it and exhausting our foreign reserves, but it was too late.Then the $USD became too costly and also scarce since we earn little Forex from exportations and the aftermath was the inability of the Nigerian government to meet their foreign obligations and promises both outside and within the country, thereby owing a lot of backlogs mainly in the $USD. The situation reduces investors' confidence, and this alone was strongly speculative against the Naira and is one of the major reasons why NGN continues to fall sharply across the board even at slightly negative news.Thankfully, the Federal government and CBN have painfully come to the reasonable conclusion to clear some backlogs of the foreign-currency forward contracts that are affecting the $USD inflow into the country due to investors' fear that their money might be locked away in the country like others. They've settled through banks for $6.7 billion dollars which is relieving indeed, and a reason why the Naira gains against the $USD.Will this be sustained for long? I doubt it. Unless;1. Investors are trooping in so seriously. 2. The IMF and others eventually loaned the country billions of $USD.3. Exportation significantly improves.",

You've spoken well, our mentality in this country is really bad as soon as price of goods skyrocket in the market, if they like let naira reduce to the highest minimum they will still no reduce the price of things in the market. These practices of whatever thing that the price increases will not decrease again has also affected our currency because it will now look as if our currency doesn't have value again due to the high cost of goods and commodities in the market. Like for instance now that Naira gained advantage over the dollars has there been any change in the price of things? The straight answer is no. Even farmers that also produces things from their farms will practically increase his products with the mindset that if the prices of things in the market are been sold at a high price then how much more him as a farmer knowing too well that the products are being gotten from the farm.Like seriously, Naira appreciating may not really bring solution to us as we need to sanitize our conscience because that's where the real corruption and evil practices is, we should also encourage ourselves on patronizing locally made products as it helps in building the economy of a country, whether it is to the best standards or not we should give values to things we produce and find ways by which they can meet up international standards so that they can be exported to foreign countries thereby boosting our economic growth and development. these practices I've said are the things that will make our currency gain value and be appreciated.",

I'm not sure if there is anything like subsidy of dollar have been resumed but you know you can't swear for governments sometimes, they are unpredictable but from my sources, they have settle about 70% of Forward contract and some other debts of foreign investors that have not been previously settled in the past. Clearing this back log from the CBN means that commercial banks will have enough dollars to sell and foreign investors trust will increase because it will clear doubts about the current government that they need people to come invest in their country.The release funds will surely increase liquidity across the FX markets because some of the contracts are more than 7 years old, some people have waited for this moment to have their investment back and since dollar has appreciated rapidly since last few years, selling to Naira will be a massive profits for them and that raised concern for the speculators. In other to protect their investment, they silently exit the market to avoid these dollars been dump on the market and that's how the market crash and Naira appreciated in just 3 days and those earning in Naira were happy.My major problem now is that commercial banks, the major stakeholders have been paid but they are not letting this money out for the FX windows to access and now the speculators are back again doing what they do best for Naira to depreciate against dollar which is bad, I want to see a permanent solution for these dollar madness because it is Nigeria is becoming a joke where a common market person now use dollar as excuse to inflate price of goods, literally 10 naira is becoming valueless in the county as it can't buy anything, 5 naira is long gone as I hardly see it around circulation.",

This na true sha because for this we country, even though say dollar dey fall, you no go seem am make price of things come down. Wetin go up for Naija dey hardly come down, that na the problem. If to say as dollar dey crash so e go affect things for market, we for dey happy... I don go buy things this week, the price still dare meaning say our people no get joy kpata kpata. I no know who we offend for this country self.... when will the ordinary people breath? Na d way e be an him you dey talk am so my brother. D fall of naira compare to dollar dey always make the price of goods high for our country and if naira come dey rise against dollar, the price of goods go still dey stagnant and nothing go change even as Naira don dey get value. That is why if Naira dey appreciate against dollar, people wey dey earn for dollar or bitcoin no go dey happy like dat because say nothing dey change for market. Dem go prefer make d price remain like dat so dat e go dey compensate wetin dem dey buy with the money as the price dey high when dollar dey appreciation against Naira.",
