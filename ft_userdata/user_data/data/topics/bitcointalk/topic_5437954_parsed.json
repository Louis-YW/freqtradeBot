Yeah, but i don't think you should memorize this things/URLs, you can visit this thread to check things up.

If you want to think about more features to add or even debate what should you implement next, I think that this thread[1] from BlackHatCoiner is a really great start to begin with.

Thanks for linking it, i can probably add most of those features mentioned there just give me a time though . As i'm currently creating a wallet watcher (email notification when sending/receiving bitcoin) that can be used for free without limit or account registration needed unlike other wallet watchers.",
