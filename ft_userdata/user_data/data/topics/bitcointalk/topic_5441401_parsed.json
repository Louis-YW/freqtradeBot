  "content": "G20, to be hosted by India during September, India is set to talk about Crypto Regulatory Framework amongst the 20 largest economies around the globe. India's Finance minister Mrs. Nirmala Sitaraman stated her clear views about the Crypto regulations based on the fact that all the G20's should create a framework of rules after International Monetary Funds and Financial Stability Board release a synthesis paper on the new economic outlook for the globe. A synthesis paper is more or less their Policy Paper which states proper guidelines for the regulation of all finances. Usually concerning about Institutional Safeguards and involvement of Executive Board and Management. The paper should be out by July and before the India's Presidency of G20 so that they can discuss the Crypto rules based on the same. On the other hand, Canada's Bank Governor cautioned everyone, not to approve any kind of Crypto Framework without studying and well developed framework before implementation. Even further Mr. Shaktinath Das, Governor to Indian Central Bank also made everyone think twice considering the changed perception of Crypto after seeing various collapses of exchangers including the FTX downfall.I am not sure how hard this will hit after G20, but big players already talking negative about the Crypto and its regulatory framework. Its question of curiosity what IMF, FSB has to say about it and what decision will be made by G20. QuoteThe basis of coming global crypto rules will be formed on a new synthesis paper, jointly produced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), announced India as the holder of the Group of 20 (G20) Presidency in Bangalore on Saturday.The announcement came after three days of meetings in India among the 20 largest economies of the world, collectively known as the G20, in which creating a global regulatory framework for crypto was a priority.The discussions held between the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors were expected to chart the way forward for globally coordinated crypto rules.The synthesis paper will be submitted during India's G20 Presidency which culminates in September when India hosts G20 leaders from around the world, said Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during a press conference.Asked whether consensus around global crypto regulation that India had prioritised for its G20 presidency will arrive during India's term, Sitharaman said \"first of all we are going through the study process so that their can be informed discussions.\"\"Something should develop,\" Sitharaman added while referring to FSB's expected paper in July that will lead to the synthesis paper by September.Sitharaman also said that Canada's central bank governor cautioned other members that crypto assets should not be given \"regulatory seal of approval\" without a well-thought-out approach and a framework for implementation.\"The World Bank stated that views of all developing countries should also be included in any (crypto) policy framework,\" Sitharaman added.India's Central Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said that there was a marked shift in perception around crypto assets by G20 nations in the past year which saw the collapse of several major crypto companies, including FTX, and a global contagion. There is a wide acceptance about risks involved in crypto assets now, Das said.Global Crypto Rules to Be Based on Coming FSB and IMF Synthesis Paper, India Says After G20 Meetings",

The Central Bank of India really negative about it and they are probably going to present the case in a negative way which in turn create negatively among the world leaders. As long as crypto is not banned and the governments do not impose a blanket 30% tax on it, we should be ok. But not keeping any high and positive expectations.",

Plus \"the rules\" should NOT, and will NEVER apply to a decentralized, censorship-resistant network that's made possible ONLY through the utilization of POW. If any Bitcoiner debates that \"it should follow the rules\", then I would question what, do you believe, would be the use of mining with all that electricity to secure the network? It would therefore be a wasteful use of electricity.",

That's exactly what I expect these world leaders to do. They should take time and study about bitcoin before they make any policy. I hope their negative perception about bitcoin will not becloud their judgement. Let them just study the sector with an open heart.QuoteEven further Mr. Shaktinath Das, Governor to Indian Central Bank also made everyone think twice considering the changed perception of Crypto after seeing various collapses of exchangers including the FTX downfall.This is where they always get it wrong. You cannot blame bitcoin for the fall of exchanges. People are always advised to use decentralized. When they refuse to to heed to this wise counsel, the outcome sometimes is loss of funds. But these Bitcoin haters will always use these exchanges to campaign against bitcoin.Quote\"The World Bank stated that views of all developing countries should also be included in any (crypto) policy framework,\" Sitharaman added.I like this point so much. It is clear that developing nations will benefit more from bitcoin, that is why it is highly accepted in most of these third world economies. These developed nations, IMF and others should consider how bitcoin assists these nations. They can consider trading with these poor nations with bitcoin instead manipulating these economies through dollarized trade.",

Its a place where everyone just either brag or complain about stuff which they cant do nothing aboutQuote from: avikz on February 28, 2023, 11:08:30 AMAs long as crypto is not banned and the governments do not impose a blanket 30% tax on it, we should be ok. But not keeping any high and positive expectations. Which government are we talking about? At some point, I believe that majority of the country will impose atleast 5-10% tax to crypto in general especially in 10 years timeframe from now where most people will finally get to know about crypto and probably use crypto as some sort of payment",

The main point of Bitcoin is, as designed by Satoshi and later by the design-decisions made by the Core Developers, it simply CAN'T be regulated. If the Bitcoin users/economic majority/HODLers call/demand for regulations, then let's bring in a proposal to remove POW, give all trust to a central entity, and turn the network into another PayPal.",
