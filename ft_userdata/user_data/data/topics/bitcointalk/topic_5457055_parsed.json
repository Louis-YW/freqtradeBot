  "content": "In a funny competition that was held last Wednesday at a Parisian institutin, artificial intelligence (ChatGPT) took a philosophy exam for baccalaureate students against one of the most prominent philosophers, Mr Rafael Enthoven, a lecturer at the University of Paris. The question in the exam was about producing an article on whether joy is a rational issue. The philosopher took the entire exam time (4 hours) to get a score of 20/20, while the program formulated his thesis to get a score of 11/20 with an acceptable note within few seconds, after two distinguished researchers carried out the evaluation process. This test led to several conclusions, the most important of which is that artificial intelligence is unable to match human intelligence, since philosophy is one of the finest productions of human brain as its proficiency is not just a narration of long sentences as it requires critical thinking of a special kind. This experience was very reassuring to different audiences and evidence of the shortcomings of artificial intelligence in several areas.These reassurances should not eliminate all concerns about the uses of artificial intelligence, and what increases our fears is the confidentiality of research in this field, because although we can control the capabilities of private companies such as Microsoft or Google, we do not know what the US administration, for example, or China is working on.Fears of technological intelligence had emerged since the seventies of the last century with the development of computing machines, but no one really cared. Today, artificial intelligence poses two main problems, the first is the potential destruction of many jobs, and the second is the development of autonomous weapon systems with little human intervention that can violate the laws of war, called \"killer robots\".What do you think?",

AI already pose threats to people's jobs already, and threats in usage as weapons, we cannot tell was other things it will threaten as the technology becomes more advanced because all these current threats are threats just caused by these AI's that have just been introduced, makes you wonder what the Artificial intelligence that will be developed in the next two years will be capable of doing.",

The argument Elon Musk relied on was s interesting when he described the developers of artificial intelligence as delusional that they are at a degree of intelligence that they do not actually have. He said that these developers do not believe that a machine of their manufacture can outsmart them if it is programmed to learn on its own.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/elon-musk-at-sxsw-a-i-is-more-dangerous-than-nuclear-weapons.htmlElon Musk had described artificial intelligence in a previous statement as more dangerous than North Korea as well, and that its destructive capacity would exceed all expectations if limits were not set for its pace of development.",

Let it not be that what we watch on TV about robots fighting human will come to play someday. Since of developers or programmers might have bad intention and will wants to use those robots for their own evil purpose. AI has already started taken human jobs and if this continues,there will be high rate of unemployment,which will affect the human survival. It is dangerous to human race and I hope that things don't get out of human control. It is hard to go in war with robots,only if another robot will be created to destroy it or someone smarter.",

The artificial intelligence requested the service of a freelancer, claiming that he is a person who has visual problems and cannot distinguish colors to solve the captcha code. What is terrifying is that artificial intelligence lies to achieve a specific goal. Because he did not admit that he is a robot and not a human being. This is one of the most astounding results in my opinion that provides evidence that the future may not be what we all expected.",

This experience was very reassuring to different audiences and evidence of the shortcomings of artificial intelligence in several areas.Artificial intelligence cannot match humans in brainpower. No machine can be compared with the human intellect and ability to handle issues or tasks based on the situation. If you tell an artificial intelligence machine to always instruct everybody to stand up, it will not be reasonable to tell an old woman or physically challenged to sit down. But a human will always reason based on circumstance, I am sure a human receptionist will reason that these people need special attention and offer them a sit. These tools can perform task fast but it is limited to only the information available on the internet. QuoteThese reassurances should not eliminate all concerns about the uses of artificial intelligence, and what increases our fears is the confidentiality of research in this field, because although we can control the capabilities of private companies such as Microsoft or Google, we do not know what the US administration, for example, or China is working on.I don't know that their research is shredded in secrecy, that's scary. That's why the AI sector needs to be regulated. But so many sectors like the pharmaceutical sector also keep their research secret and it was clear during the COVID-19 pandemic. QuoteFears of technological intelligence had emerged since the seventies of the last century with the development of computing machines, but no one really cared. Today, artificial intelligence poses two main problems, the first is the potential destruction of many jobs, and the second is the development of autonomous weapon systems with little human intervention that can violate the laws of war, called \"killer robots\".What do you think?These killer robots are called lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS). They can identify, target, and kill their target. These AI warfare tools can be used as military personnel on the battlefield and can cause havoc without human feelings. These technologies also need to be regulated or even banned. The ban on chemical weapon discourages companies from venturing into the sector, it the UN ban the production of killer robots, many firms will not join the business.",

While the activity of companies can be monitored by government agencies or neutral monitoring institutions, it is not possible to monitor the activity of governments and countries in the same way.No one can prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons and developing hostile activities because Korea is isolated internationally and does not participate in any international agreement. The same thing can happen with any country in organizing artificial intelligence development activities.The matter is no less dangerous than any other sensitive sector, such as the production of weapons and medicines, but we note that even the protective measures are taken individually, each party acting alone, while there must be an action map that defines the activities of all parties.",

There is a terrible development of employing artificial intelligence in suspicious activities whose ends are criminal and illegal in the first place.During my research on the subject, I found a report published by Europol on 2020 detailing the criminal domains that artificial intelligence is employed to serve, which is considered a bridge to facilitate access to results that were not easy to implement in the past. For example, AI could be used to support.- Convincing social engineering attacks at scale.- Document-scraping malware to make attacks more efficient.- Evasion of image recognition and voice biometrics.- Ransomware attacks, through intelligent targeting and evasion.- Data pollution, by identifying blind spots in detection rules.Link to descriptive article: New report finds that criminals leverage AI for malicious use – and it’s not just deep fakesLink to PDF report: https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/malicious_uses_and_abuses_of_artificial_intelligence_europol.pdf",
