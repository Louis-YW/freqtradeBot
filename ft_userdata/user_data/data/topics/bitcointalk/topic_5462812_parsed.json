Many people that are building their Bitcoin portfolio are doing it to also save for the coming generation.

If you've lost the key or anyone doesn't have it he cant access the Bitcoins in the wallet. So you need to pass the key but there is a huge risk haha, as I had mentioned already if anyone has the key he can withdraw all the funds. More interestingly haha in reality people store Bitcoins for their hiers. I use to keep my keys mostly in a place and few of my family members know where. As you know haha Death is the reality and it can be on the head anytime.",

Knowing fully that bitcoin is not stored on the wallet we make use of, it is stored permanently on the blockchain, what is needed to have an access to this bitcoin is the unblocking keys needed to decoded the encoded coins on the blockchain through the wallet, that is why we need to have the private keys or the seed seed phrase to have access to the bitcoin on the blockchain, someone like me may hand over the keys to my children if i want an inheritance for them, there's a bitcoin timelock device as well which we can use, some may also finds a means of passing the last key or seed of their wallet to their children through a different sources or written down and archived.",

The vision is clear, but one must not fail to keep the private keys safe, because it's 'not your keys, not your coins.'Also, a good offline wallet should be used for those who already have the knowledge, expertise or resources of a merchant trader.I know the rates, or market trends 맖r halving may affect ones capital investment to HODL for the future, let's say 5-7 years or even longer. The surety of BTC wealth being a substantial amount upon withdrawal or passing it over to the next generation/heirs, is one that stands guaranteed.",

It didn't even occur to them to protect their bitcoins and leave them to heirs. You can enter where your Bitcoin backups are stored. You can write that your Bitcoin keys are stored in a family safety deposit box. Now, this information will not be helpful to strangers or hackers. They will have no idea what the keys are, or where your family safety deposit box is or how to get into it. But a trusted family member will tell this information. That way, you can have peace of mind knowing your bitcoins will be found by the right person.",

However, how this wealth will be transferred to the heirs and the next generation and how this wealth will be preserved without being lost or causing problems still remain unclear. Well, let's say you have 6 Bitcoins in your Wallet and you also have 3 kids, so perhaps you wish to give 2 bitcoins to each of your children. When you feel you are getting older, and by then your children might have also come of age, you can discuss with them how you want to will 2 bitcoins to each of them, but they can only access them (the Bitcoins) when you have passed on. Then, you can have your private key or wallet phrase divided into four different places and hidden in four different locations (the fourth location is where you will hide the hardware wallet and the last phrase or last key to access the wallet) . then inform each of your kids about the location where he or she can find a piece of the private key, so that when you have finally passed on, the three kids can come together with each piece of the private key so they can combine it together before they can be able to access the location where you have hidden the hardware wallet and the last key to unlock the wallet.Quote from: KiaKia on August 10, 2023, 05:07:32 PMIf your kinds are still very young, wait for them to get to a certain age, you have a wife?

I remember a movie where a rich man willed his property to his children, but after the man passed away, the wife connived with the law and made the lawyer have some properties willed to her, and the lawyer also took some shares in the property.

Strangely, there are couples who eat and sleep together, swear to live and die together before the gods, but only because of bitcoin, they doubt each other. i have a feeling those people are valuing bitcoin and money more than their spouses and children.",

In case this topic have been discussed, I will be glad to be pointed to the thread.You have posted a very nice thread, and it's true that most people are holding Bitcoin for their next generation and they really can't tell the secret of their holdings to anyone currently because most of them are planning to hold Bitcoin till 2050's before letting their next generation know about the investment their parents have made to secure their children's future. There can be many things done to protect those Bitcoin and transfer it to the next generation upon need.It would still be difficult to transfer the Bitcoin to your next generation in its current state and that's why you must have to have someone else on your side who might also know about your investment and would never ever tell anyone about it or misuse it in anyway. It would be hard to trust the lawyers with the private keys of your wallets because they can access and transfer those coins and may change easily change the will details. The proper way should be to tell your heirs about your Bitcoin investment and also tell them that you have hidden the private key somewhere in the home which they will have to find after your death. I know that such thing seems crazy, but if you can't share the private key the way it is then you will have to share it in this way. You should also leave hints and clues about the place where you have stored your private keys, and it would be better to tell your children about the passwords of the devices where you have stored your private keys, but you should hide the devices from them and would tell them to access it only if suddenly something happens to you. I think this is the only possible way to share details of your investment with your children, and I would also recommend you to avoid telling them about the amount of Bitcoins that you have been holding for their better future.",

But for Bitcoin, I don't know how this can be done as it may require revealing the secrete codes of the wallets or storage device. Is there any other way this can be done?My thought was captured in my comment in this thread but I felt to raise a topic for most discussion. In case this topic have been discussed, I will be glad to be pointed to the thread.New generation will probably waste the money buying cars and a lot of things instead of investing, if your going to put that in your last will if that is a large amount of bitcoin, there should be clause and a thing they need to accomplish before receiving it, you also have to find an attorney who is really trust worthy, in a safety deposit box perhaps they will only open it in a certain year like when they reach 38 or 40 years of age.I believe that the goal of this bitcoin inheritance thing is to avoid the third party involvement like a lawyer, bitcoin has a trustless mechanism so no other party is required in doing the inheritance. At the end of the day it is still the decision of successor on what he/she will do about the bitcoin he recieve. For sure he will be forced to learn atleaat the basic of crypto for him/her to access the inheritance.",
