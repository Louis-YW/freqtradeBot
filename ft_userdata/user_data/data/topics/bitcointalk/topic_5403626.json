Below Is The Main Subject Of This Discussion.$800 WORTH OF LITECOIN MISTAKENLY SENT TO A WRONG BITCOIN ADDRESS WHILE DRIVING.A few hours ago, a friend(one of my crypto buddies) reached out to me on the phone calling for help, read conversation below.[my phone ringing and i answered the call]FREIND: hey five, xup?ME: hey bro, whats up man?FREIND: something happened, and i think i really need your help.ME: what happened?FREIND: i bought 15 litecoin from Remitano exchange this morning, but something really urgent came up and i had to travel to PH, so while i was driving, i decided to transfer the 15 litecoin to my Binance account, i thought i recognized my Binance litecoin address among the several addresses i pinned on my clipboard on my swiftkey keyboard, so i didnt bother to log into my Binance account to copy the address afresh in order for me to save time and also to concentrate more on the road.  ME: oookeey, am listening.FREIND: so I withdraw my 15 litecoin from Remitano to an address I thought was my Binance litecoin address, the transaction status on Remitano showed they've sent it but for over 30 minutes after i managed to login, I didn't get the coin on my Binance account, I became worried and had to park to find out what's going on, then I discovered I actually withdraw the coins to a Bitcoin address, and....[i cut in] ME: Jesus!i exclaimed, and what?FREIND: and the worst of it all is that the Bitcoin address i sent the coins to does not belong to me, the address....

And it doesn't make sense to save multiple addresses when you can easily get them from the wallet you intend sending to,• Lastly, relying on memory to chose an address to send to is totally wrong and the risk of error is high.That's a quite costly lesson on not getting to complacent when handling finances, especially one you have full control and responsibility on.",

Unlike the traditional banks where you can recall a wrong transaction or get the name/contact details of the user you mistakenly sent fiat to, crypto doesn't provide such options. Apart from avoiding making hasty crypto transactions, you also need to try to be in a proper frame of mind when making transactions as well, avoid divided attention and be sure to always double check before confirming transaction. In addition to avoid mistakes, if you do transactions with someone you know often (p2p), always tell them to resend their address and not assume that it is the one you think it is or the one you saved, that assumption can be costly.",

Driving in the road while doing a very important transaction is always not advisable as it could mean you're gonna fail in one of them. And yeah, it's happening now. It's like losing all his money in an instant, and sending a fortune to a total stranger. Carelessness is something that could really ruin us, as it always hit us in the end and make us regret later on. Honestly, there's no way that he can get his money back, that's so lucky for him if the owner of that address will send back the money, but its never happening in most cases. Hopefully, this story will always remind us that being careful always pays off. And that there's no need to rush if that transaction is as important as your life.",

The good part is that if someone gets caught twice and loses his/her license (6 points + 6 points), he/she won't be able to mistakenly send coins to wrong addresses while driving anymore Always check at least twice that the address you are sending your coins is the correct one.

Your friend must have park in the safe place first before he did his transaction so he won't be making mistakes while doing his money transaction. But maybe he didn't realized that until he experienced it by himself. He could just have reviewed the address first before sending because that is the right thing to do to avoid sending in a wrong address. But maybe the damage is done, his money is lost, so he must have learned his big lesson for the first time, and learn to avoid doing it again.",
