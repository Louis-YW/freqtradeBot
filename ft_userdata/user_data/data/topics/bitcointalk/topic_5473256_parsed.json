There are people trying to live a normal life with what little amount they earn. And there are people using the same amount of money just to smell good.Such is life. It has always been like that wright from the oncept. There is a difference between the rich and the poor. The rich will always go for expensive things which the poor can not afford. I think that's the way they can show or express the use of their money. Every body have class and desire, it does not necessarily mean you must buy what is equivalent to your salary. You shoygo for what you can afford. Rather than putting yourself to emotional jopady.Quote from: tjtonmoy on November 07, 2023, 07:46:18 PMI bring up this to talk about financial freedom. What is financial freedom to you? Is it about having a certain amount of money that is required to have financial freedom or to have an amount of money which can potentially give you freedom in the future? To me financial freedom is when you have extablish yourself financially. By setting up various business that would be generating fund from time to time. Which could be durable for a long time, because short time investment does not guarantee financial freedom.",

Someone might say that it's financial freedom when they can eat everything they want and don't have to be problematic with their bills.The others could say that it is all about having all the material things that they never have. And the rest will just say it's all about having like lots of money that you can't imagine.What I've learned from the others about being financially free is that, they can do everything and they all have the time to do things that they want to do while earning passively.",

Many people complain about their salaries, but what is more important than the salary and job is enhancing your assets so that it generates more and more money and profits for you easily.",

You don't worry about money.But the real financial freedom is that the money follows you, not that you follow the money. I hope you get my point about what we are talking about here. Another reason is that we have financial freedom because we have different businesses that produce money, so we never run out of money.",

Sometimes people loss their temper just for a single thing or for that thing which is not too important. But the main thing we should consider always run according to the waves. For example if there is a loss in something we should take one step back and follow another way to cross the barriers.I have seen even many poor people that was on road and even they love to or like to study but they don't have money to study, they have are beautiful enough to work in any office but their money can't allow them to work as in this sense. Which hurts me too much sometimes. But they didn't have a mistake in it, as we all know life is so crucial and we have to deal with it sometimes.",

If you do able to experience some sudden improvement on the time you are earning that muchthen it would be normal that you would really be upgrading your living as well on which means that you arent that minding on tending to save up for some investment or business but rather you do cherish out the current situation that you are in. Not all would really be that mindful about future events or plans but rather they would really be that minding on the current situation they are in.When the time comes that the source had been cut or facing up some problems then this is where regrets do start to show or come up.Regrets do always come at the end and dont wait for those consequences to slap you in the face on which you should have able to avoid such scenario if you had just that madeyourself that sensible and mindful about your finances. We do know that there's nothing permanent into this world. This is why you should really be wiseon taking decisions.",

Don't get me wrong, if you have 25 million dollars in the bank, and 200+ million networth, spending 10k dollars on a perfume is not a \"stupid\" move, some people think that it is, but they are so rich that it doesn't matter to them at all. I think it would make sense for those people to spend like that, because if they buy a perfume that you can buy too, then why did that become so rich? But the real person I envy a lot is not that rich person, its the perfume manufacturer, I would love to own a brand like that, more than be able to buy it.",

It sounds so sad and how unequal life is between the super rich and us ordinary peopleOf course everyone wants to achieve financial freedom and works hard enough to achieve that goal but circumstances and luck in life are often different. For me, financial freedom is when I can provide for all my family's needs and can help other people. When it comes to money there will never be enough, humans have greed and always want more than we need. One way we can get financial freedom is by investing and I believe Bitcoin can take us there one day.",

It doesn’t bother you that when you come to a restaurant you can spend as much in one evening as probably 20-30% of the Earth’s population earns in a month (if not the majority)? Doesn't bother me. Your car can cost - as much as the annual income of an entire family in a third world country, or the poor part of even very developed countries! Although this is quite an average-priced, non-premium car...In the end, the manufacturer has the right to set any price at which the product will be purchased from him! Yes, the world is not very fair... For some you are a wild spender with inadequate expenses, for someone you are the same wild spender with inadequate expenses. This is how the world works. Either you need to choose your niche, or rise to a higher level, there is no other way.PS may be a little harsh and not humane, but this is the truth of life. By the way, is there a price indication there? It would be more interesting - we could discuss a specific figure",

Some products are only for some people, and the reason for this is the unnecessary consumption behavior that comes with the concept of wealth.If you want to buy something and others can't buy it easily, there is a social class difference and the rich want that difference to be obvious. Most of them don't, but I would say that's generally the case. I think that's one of the mistakes that society has to overcome.Financial freedom consists of a regular income that can enable a person to get what they want without creating any problems in their financial situation.",

As long as I can survive with that amount of money and not worry about the future, then it is financial freedom to me.]This is financial freedom. You don't have to sweat that much and you've made a system that generates you money passively. Mostly the CEOs are like this but they still choose to go to their office and work for some checkings and usual task. But I agree to you that this is it, we don't have to worry about future and we've got some setup already on how we're going to spend but unknown how much we're going to make this and next month. With that uncertainty, the assurance is no matter what you do, you'll still make money. And from that money we earn passively, we also can adjust our lifestyle but it's always the best thing to live within our means.",

I'm still confused. Should I laugh or should I feel sorry for that person? So here's how the whole video goes. The man said and I quote\" I saw my salary on a bottle of perfume today. So you are saying that someone out there smells like my salary.\" It's kind of funny but also sad at the same time. Where have we come today? There are people trying to live a normal life with what little amount they earn. And there are people using the same amount of money just to smell good.I bring up this to talk about financial freedom. What is financial freedom to you? Is it about having a certain amount of money that is required to have financial freedom or to have an amount of money which can potentially give you freedom in the future? To me, I will choose the second one. If I am happy with what I have and I am certain that it will continue to help me in the future too, then I have successfully achieved financial freedom. But most people these days are caught up with the thought of using luxurious thing and being able to continuously use it is financial freedom to them.Do you agree or disagree to this? Let me know your thoughts. [Just for context, I am not talking about holding money. I am talking about investments that good give me passive income that will continue to come in the future and give me financial freedom.

If the restaurant is 1000 pounds, so be it, it does not matter. If the parfume costs 3000... whatever, it is the one I like. Basically a bunch of people who have forgotten the real value of money.Look, the fee for attending the last forum of davos was 15.000 dollars.",
