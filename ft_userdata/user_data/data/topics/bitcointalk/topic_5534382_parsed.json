I just hope that this summit touches on all issues affecting the crypto industry, not just regulations, but also good innovations and policies to make cryptocurrencies of all kinds attractive to everyone, including private individuals, small and large businesses, traders, investors, governments, and corporate bodies.

They suddenly want to hold it next to gold? If that fails to stop you and cause you to consider, nothing will.Who's at the table and who's missing is interesting. Not one Federal Reserve or big bank representative here. Why? Vitalik Buterin is still unconfirmed; is Ethereum being underlined or is there an ideological divide? Where’s BlackRock, the biggest institutional Bitcoin holder?Also, there's the altcoin things. For a reserve, bitcoin makes logic. It is political neutral, distributed, and strong. But XRP, SOL, ADA? Is this about financial diversification, or are these projects closely ties to the administration?Everything changes if the U.S. government considers Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Because what follows? New laws? (This might either help or suffocate the industry.) International response? (Will other nations start their own reserves?) Financial stability concerns? (Imagine a government-owned Bitcoin market maker, a horrible idea.)",

I love the fact that Michael Saylor is in the list because he is like the mouthpiece for bitcoin, his presence in that conference is like a representation for bitcoin and I hope to hear his motivation for what he does with bitcoin and how he will be able to convince others to buy and hold just like he is doing. I am sure this is a positive development for cryptocurrency in general.",

Can't wait to see how things turns out.This is a good one.Well, it is still good to know that a government and a world power like US can organise a submit to discuss crypto. Whether this has an indirect impact on bitcoin's price is not my major concern, rather my interest is on the fact that crypto, including Bitcoin has gained some level of relevance and recognition by the government attracting such influential speakers. This is something we never imagined years back would ever happen in the crypto space considering all the attacks back then. However, just as I have said earlier, we just hope that this submit gives room for some favourable policies that will be of benefit to crypto enthusiasts in the US and all over the world. I will be on the lookout for more updates from the submit.",
