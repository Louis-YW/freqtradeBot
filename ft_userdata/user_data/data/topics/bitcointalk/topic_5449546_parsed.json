I play daily and I did noticed I was winning in the morning, but later lose the money at evening or night. Also the week can be good, but the weekend will go bad.If you have such issue, why not just win little and stop gambling for that day? It is better that way.Quote from: cafter on April 20, 2023, 07:36:27 AMand in provably fair once we lose more then 10% of balance then, then we start to revenge gambling to recover our loses, while recovering we are unable to think by waiting some times, we think like my profit is only one click away, then clicking and clicking then increasing bet size and blowing account.I know this case is not for everyone, but in gambling most of players comes on that phase! we can not control and wait and think to recover that loss tomorrow because we can profit in just a one mouse click.We have to be disciplined while gambling for us to not lose control. If you lose, you should stop gambling that day. If you lose too much, you should just stop gambling for that week or more, but best not to go beyond the budget which should be small amount of money and in a way you can lose it and not thinking about it because you can afford to lose such amount.Quote from: cafter on April 20, 2023, 07:36:27 AMand also live casino's dealer is front of me i can see we are cheated or not, but i don't know if they use rigged roulette or not.I do not know how rigging can be done with roulette because people are selecting different odd types. If rigging is possible, you should know through your winning or loss. If you play like 3 to 5 times, you should have won at least once, and as you continue to play, you should feel that the casino are manipulating or not. But I do not think a trustworthy casino can do that because even as they do everything fairly, punters still lose than win overall, only the experienced gamblers win than lose, and they are the type that do not gamble much.",

      "body": "There is one big lesson to learn while gambling, whenever you lose money do not try to get it back, doing so will leave you with 0 balance and you will walk away with nothing, when you win be bold enough to can it a quit, leave for the day and try your luck another day. Also, know when to stop if all you getting that day is losses, yea, as a gambler you need to have your daily gambling limit, and if you lost the limit, take your leave. Setting rules for yourself is discipline, and this will reduce the risk of even losing more money.",

I don't know what you are trying to achieve by making 2 contradictory threads but the answer to your question lies in your trust towards the game provider that you are using. It's like the Schrödinger cat experiment. Both possibilities exist until you experienced first hand whether the casino is rigged or not. More importantly is your having fun with your gambling experience rather than worrying if the casino games are rigged or not because we don't have enough choice since the casino uses the same provider for all of their games.",

I have been using as low as $0.1 on casinos to bet games like Roulettes and this makes it fun because you can use very low amount of money at every round you want to bet. Where I know the minimum amount can be $1 or more for minimum bet are sport betting.",

In those cases where I do feel like I'm being impulsive, I tend to throw (and yes I've replaced my mouse quite a few times now) my mouse the hell away from me, just to make me go over and pick it up. More than enough time to think through whether to continue or not. Ofc it depends from person to person, but it's up to you yourself really to set it up in the first place. Now to compare, I'd probably still go for provably fair. I'm just more used to it, and I don't think I've had that \"unfair\" experience, whatever it is that others actually do experience.",

The best thing is to control yourself and see how you can do so as not to lose, and the solution is to withdraw when you have a profit, even if it is little.",

And such impatient behavior makes us lose because that's why the dealers keep the duration low like 15 seconds only so not to give you enough time to \"think before betting\". And about provably fair games, I've played some original games like dice, crash, minesweeper, etc. and TBH, I've won more there compared to live casino games. However, we get attracted towards live casinos just because we get bored watching the same graphics again and again in the provably fair games and so, we go to live casino to see those beautiful women dealing cards (blackjack) and throwing balls near the rolling numbers (roulette) because come on, we do it for fun and that's a nice distraction we men are fond of.",
