No idea, but I'm sure they know what they are doing... The thing that is odd to me is they said \"25 Cas coins\" worth like 174 BTC, but this pic appears to show 6 x 25 BTC coins, plus 2 more singles and halves, plus whatever is in that roll...I think they are confused on the numbers or something there... but then again, i can't really see the pics that well...",
