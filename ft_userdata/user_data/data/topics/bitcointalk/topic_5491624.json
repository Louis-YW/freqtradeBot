Also, based on my research, blackrock holds about 256,681 BTC as of this month, while microstrategy owns about 214,246 bitcoins as of last month, less than what blackrock's holding.Upon the factors that influence the price of Bitcoin, we all know that whales are one factor that contributes to the price volatility of Bitcoin.

QuoteThe enterprise software maker, whose corporate strategy includes buying the digital currency, purchased 9,245 Bitcoin for $623 million between March 11 and March 18, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-19/microstrategy-owns-about-1-of-all-bitcoin-with-latest-purchase-mstrBut I will still check on fillippone thread to see the exact amount. And there is one company which is competing with microstrategy in possession of bitcoin.",

Institutional investors can hold Bitcoin for much longer periods of time, bitcoins which could have otherwise increased sell pressure on the market or could have been dumped by panic sellers during dips in the market. The major benefit this has on Bitcoin is that bear curves will not be as steep as it used to be and recoveries between bull periods will start to have less and less dips between.",

The only way these companies can impact the value is if they buy and sell without being careful and considerate of how this will affect the movement of the market.

If I got it right (because it turned out to be harder to find this info than I anticipated), they include Grayscale, BlackRock (iShares), Fidelity, VanEck, and some others. Then there's, of course, MicroStrategy, famous for its Bitcoin investments. So it seems that at least several major investment companies adopted Bitcoin, and I suppose the premature Bitcoin bull market can be attributed to that. We've already seen what the anticipation of approval at the end of last year and the actual approval this year got us in terms of the price: Bitcoin fully recovered and established a new ATH point. But I think we've already got all or most of the growth that comes from solid investments by big companies.",

Well, there are many of them to be honest, and personally, I won't be able to name them all, but first, we much recognize Microstrategy for that company's strong and unwavering believe in the the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.And after bitcoin Spot ETF was approved, major asset holders like Blackrock, Grayscale, Vanguard and so on and on all purchased various numbers of bitcoin, and even after the ETF was approved, I trust that this institutions plus alot of others have also purchased a lot of bitcoins as well.Tesla is also a very popular name in the world of bitcoin investment, Elon musk announced when tesla bought its bitcoins, but later on, also announced when tesla also sold some of the bitcoin, and till date, Elon musk have never made any annoument again on Tesla selling it's remaining part of bitcoin they bought, which suggests that the company is still holding the remaining part of their bitcoin stash they kept after selling some.Elon musk himself, I believe owns alot of bitcoins.And speaking on the effect this has, or will have on the price of bitcoin, what other effect will it have if not that this will make the price of bitcoin go up significantly in the future, all this names are really big names and are likely not to sell their bitcoins anytime soon, so, while all this bitcoin are held in wallets that may never move them for several years from now, there are less bitcoin in the market and the more demand for bitcoin increases, so will the price of bitcoin as well will increase.",

So ignore what they do, adapt to everything and focus on your investment. That's something you and we can do.At the end of the day it's all about profit, no institutional or large corporate investor avoids big profits.Tesla is even too quick to take advantage of the regulatory and taxation issues they will face, of course, it will reduce their profits and eventually have to sell about 75% of their ownership but then in 2024 buy back. And big companies like MicroStrategy, Blackrock etc. are just holding back longer to accumulate more Bitcoins.There are times when they will drop some of their Bitcoin to take profits, of course this is very normal,but it will cause the price of bitcoin to drop and retail traders start to panic. Panic will only be cheaper repurchases for large companies. Nothing can stop big companies from continuing to buy or sell, they have more money, and it is easier to manipulate and speculate.",
