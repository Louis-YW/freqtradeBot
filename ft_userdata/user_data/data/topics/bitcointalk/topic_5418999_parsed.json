However I would like to ask you guys if you consider a forced conscript pretty much the same as a slave.I am asking because the RF is now forcing people to become soldiers under threat of being sent to prison and they are being sent sometimes with just days of training and obsolete and malfunctioning equipment to fight in the war in Ukraine. For me, these soldiers are just slaves. They are not defending their country or trying to save the lives of their loved ones, they are just accepting being sent to kill and die for no good reason.",

That is their motivation for going to the war, because most of them drafted to the war live in places like thiswhere they see microwave ovens and washing machines only in TV-series. First you bring your people to these conditions, and then you send them to loot a neighbouring country. It won't work. People with such motivation and goals simply can't be victorious.",

Either serve, or go to prison. The proverbial slave doesn't have a choice.The way I understand forced military service works is that it's for those eligible and most places don't mandate their soldiers commit suicide in an unwinnable war either. The U.S. in Vietnam was a bit of an exception.It's not like it would be difficult to excuse yourself of military service if you were so inclined. Most countries will strike you for just cause and that bar is low. The Russians don't have a chance.",

My conclusions about it:- The soldiers would have been all right, they would have simply surrendered en-masse and probably marry some Ukrainian widows and live happily ever after free from Adolf Putin.- The fact that they abandon the city means that the scarcity of cannon fodder is much more acute.- They are trying to convince future recruits that they will be cared for.All this points to very little depth in the front lines. The classic structures of reserves at 5, 15 and 30 kilometres are not being implemented, breaking RF's own tactical manuals and that is an indication of extreme weakness and lack of resources. They are very close to their \"safe territory\" and the supply bases.I am really surprised if at this point anyone with an internet connection would join.",
