  "content": "I have been seeing Dogecoiners absolutely giddy about Elon Musk and over whether he will integrate Dogecoin into some Twitter-profit-scheme. This has led to a superficial pump in speculative nature. Why do people believe that Elon is not going to simply drop Dogecoin in the future? Lets take a look at a similiar memecoin and its history:Shiba Inu. SHIB is in the top 13 on CMC and must therefore be a good investment, right? Wrong. It's trading at less than 15% of its ATH and is barely surviving.Remember when it first came out? The idea was to do what most shitcoin devs were doing at that time and send most of the tokens to the wallet of a famous personality (Vitalik Buterin) in order to prove that the SHIB devs could never rugpull their investors and crash the price - they thought Vitalik would never touch SHIB as if there was supposed to be some unspoken, sacred bond between him and this ERC-20 token. Nobody expected Vitalik to donate the shitcoins/memecoins sent to him and crash the markets. Yet he did. Not all of them. Nonetheless the concept of a rugpull-proof memecoin failed. Vitalik did not care about the value of SHIB or the investors of SHIB. And so SHIB crashed and today has yet to recover even a fifth of its ATH price.Now we have history repeating itself. Except this time with Dogecoin and Elon Musk as its only pillar of support.I believe Musk is an egomaniac who only cares about the attention he gets from doing things like buying Twitter, making unsustainable cars or half-baked self landing rockets. He is just a bored multi-billionaire who wants more attention. Do people really believe DOGE can survive without Elon Musk backing it?I for one will not be wasting my time or money just because some useless memecoin did what all cryptocurrencies do every now and then by pumping a decent 50+%.",

      "body": "From our point of view, much of what is written here is correct. But when the bullrun starts, there must be coins that are strongly publicized by the media. People are primarily interested in what is written in the media, few of them go into detail and look at the technology, or the usability of the coin. For example, if the Los Angeles Rams win the Super Bowl, the team will sell more jerseys. This is a story that is written over and over again, whether in Memecoins or in sports. If you ask a newcomer if Doge has a limit, he probably won't be able to answer that, or maybe he won't understand it. But if he can show a wallet at the next BBQ-Party and has X.XXX.XXX Doge Coins, then he is the king. If you ask him about a limit of Bitcoin, then I hope that he can answered.Maybe these two questions without an explanation are useful at the next party. I will try it if asked.",

And until this person still backing up Dogecoin, we can expect that one day a surge of its price can be possible and even more bullish than before. I was going to believe that but I was neglecting to buy Dogecoin since I didn't find any news that could finger point to that particular event.

No doubt, even though the supply is unlimited but many are holding it even Elon Musk has been a Doge fan for a long time and because he is always being tweeted by Elon Doge it starts hype and reaches the most insane ATH in history. But if Doge's history is going to repeat itself or it can hit its highest price again it might require even stronger hype. But anything in the crypto market can happen overnight, it's likely to repeat itself or it's just going to be memecoin in general.",

Maybe yes but can't just easily erase it from the mindset of many people who will still think that Doge is a meme coin and this also Shiba Inu. I say they are unique and far different from their kind but once they are still a meme coin, it keeps generalized that they are not suitable for long-term investment. And they just survive the market competition due to manipulation and shilled by an influential person like Elon Musk. I don't stop people from investing in this project but it was just to remind the risk in them. Then, it was their decision to take it or just leave it.",

Yes. Thrive at its current level? No.Seems like the negative reaction over this issue from maxis just stems from them being their usual sour grape selves, jealous of the success of anything crypto-related that isn't Bitcoin, seemingly unable to experience happiness unless the price of BTC is pushing all-time highs. A cursed albeit self-imposed mindset.",

When the first tweet of Elon Musk about Dogecoin happened back like 2 years ago it came pretty much out of nowhere for everyone and it caused a massive price pump of Dogecoin, but not only that. Musk and his tweets basically kicked off that crazy shit-coin hype wave that happened back then with literally hundreds of new shit-coins being released each and every day. Of course almost all of them are completely dead already again, only Shiba Inu is kind of still relevant but of course the longterm trend for Shiba Inu is also downwards and i would never invest into it.
