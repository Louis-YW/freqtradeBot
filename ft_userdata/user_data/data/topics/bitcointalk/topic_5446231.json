Although it says \"crypto\", the video is very much about Bitcoin (and ETH NFTs).Video link: https://youtu.be/ORdWE_ffirg2.2M views.Supposedly \"Best video of 2023\", according to MKBHD.What hurts the most is that this is not even coming from some investor dinosaur like Charlie Munger, this is from a well-respected Youtuber.And yet:\"How is it possible that despite all its failings, Bitcoin survived and is very much present to this day?\" (11:24)Because we, as a community, are building it - maybe not all of us are developers, maybe we don't contribute to Bitcoin Core, maybe we don't write a BIP, maybe we don't work on Layer 2 scaling technologies, maybe some of us are not even running a validation node, but we are all doing one thing in common: We drive adoption in our own sphere of influences. The drive of which people have been doing since the early days of Bitcoin.People who think they don't need this innovation, that's fine, stay out of it. There are still people who are better off with Nokias than iPhones anyway. But the people who say this mostly come from places where such a technology as cryptocurrency is not deemed absolutely necessary to them. And I perfectly understand that, if your bank money is suitable for you - until the bank loses it, or you're pals with inflation and hyper-money-printing and the new kid on the block, recession.Bitcoin is the people's currency. Not the ruling class' currency.",

And Big Tech itself.We have been discussing scam advertisements both on Youtube and Google SERP. I fully agree that those adverts are fuelling the government's ideology but you cannot deny that some scammers like Sam Bankman-Fried have convinced a lot of people that everything related to crypto is a scam. Within the crypto community, a lot of people have suffered because of him &  therefore we cannot solely blame such Youtube influencers. That scams got removed from the mind of many people after a few banks filed for bankruptcy. Those who got convinced that crypto is bad now know Banks are not to be believed. In the end it doesn't matter what they say. Those want to believe them will always believe such influencers and thos who don't would skip such videos.",

The first time I've heard bitcoin my first impression is that its also a scam system due to my curiosity I researched about how bitcoin works and then the first I saw videos with clickbaits which it talks about \"don't waste your money in bitcoin\".

Focusing the video on Bitcoin is not relevant.And I agree the fact that I have been scammed in NFTs before using ETH because of my inexperienced about it. I minted a fake website of the famous project since it gained popularity with the good background of project and its team. So when they launched their website for minting I have clicked a fake link. That's the time I realized that there's hacker and scammer that could manipulate the accounts of project where they could easily scam people. That's fine I learned from it and good thing I only minted 1.",

Although we didn't contribute directly to the core of bitcoin, the mere existence of us supporting as a community being the \"demand\" is already enough for bitcoin to be alive. As long as there is someone believing bitcoin, it will always thrive through and through.They can complain but we can't? They have huge advantages when they start their own ways of having income since they all have the resources and exact environment needed to participate in global economy, but how about those who started from scratch and manage to live decently due to bitcoin's existence? We didn't have that much resources to begin with and at the wrong place too, but still manage to learn and participate in the economy through this. We cannot complain even if they're playing monopoly since the ancient times? But they have the right to complain as we struggle just to put food on our tables while working to have a little bit of investment?",
