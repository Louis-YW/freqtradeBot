  "content": "This may be a naive question but here goes.Im building a way for users to use fiat to buy Bitcoin - but not sell it (they can at a later stage withdraw it). Basically like a direct debit savings account.Users create an account, go through KYC, and add funds via a debit card. When a user creates an account they provide a seed phrase, and this can be used to generate a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet.I then will acquire Bitcoin for the user (not sure how this part will be done yet), generate a public key from the HD wallet, and send the Bitcoin to this. I wont save the private key or the seed phrase since I can later, if they would like to withdraw, generate the private keys for the users wallet from the seed phrase they provide (as far as I understand). Is this plan feasible and is it secure? To me, it looks secure since Im not storing private keys.",

If you think of user id + password as the same as a seed phrase, cant something similar be used here (eg 3d secure by sending an OTP  to the user's phone)?With 2, this isnt really a problem unique to a Bitcoin exchange though - people try this all the time purchasing stuff with stolen cards. Most acquirers have really good fraud detection. Or am I not considering something here?Your point about users losing their seed phrase and blaming me is legit though. I guess THIS is the main reason so many get hacked - they have to keep a copy of the seed phrase or private keys to cover this scenario...",

For example, they provide you with an SDK that you bundle with your iOS/Android app. This parses documents, does liveness check etc. You then save these docs and results on your server. Regarding the reversal risk, I work in online payments and, for the most part, we avoid reversals by forcing all paying with a debit/credit card through 3d secure. This shifts liability to the card holder. Actually what I want to do is a bit different - its pay by bank account. Its becoming more common now here in Europe due to increase in open banking.",

That's not how cryptocurrency (or at least Bitcoin) works.  If you change the seed phrase, you get a completely different wallet with completely different addresses. That will not give you access to the funds that are still stuck at the addresses from the old seed phrase.A userID and password is something that gives access to a website.  If you operate the website, you can generate a one-time password (I assume that's what you mean when you say OTP?) and send it to a user, then when they connect to your website, you can force them to create a new password. You can do this because you control the website, and you get to choose who gets to access the website and who doesn't. You get to choose the methods that are used to access that website.There is no \"Bitcoin Company\" that has control of access to the Bitcoins.  Therefore, there is nobody available to issue a OTP that will allow the user access to their Bitcoins.  If the user has permanently lost their seed phrase (or any of the associated private keys), and there is nobody else storing any of that for them then those Bitcoins are locked into those addresses forever.So, I suppose you could store a copy of the user's seed phrase for them. Then if they forget their seed phrase, you could give it back to them, but then you are taking on the risk of storing that phrase.  If you are hacked, and the hacker gets the seed phrase, then they have access to ALL of the private keys and therefore all of the addresses associated with that HD wallet.",

Isn't it less risky to not do so, and only ask for it upon withdrawal, and guarantee that its not stored or logged by the server?

If the user provides the seed phrase, then the user has is and can simply use it with another wallet. They also can get from that wallet of theirs the private keys too. So there's no \"nobody has the private key\".

The bank has the money in their custody until you go to an ATM.If the user have the seed phrase, the bitcoins are in their (self) custody. Way different.Plus, as said, if the use loses his phone number or whatever, he will get new login info from the bank; if they do the same with you, the bitcoins are lost forever. Plus the scam scenarios I already wrote.Quote from: zander1983 on December 27, 2022, 09:58:28 PMWith 2, this isnt really a problem unique to a Bitcoin exchange though - people try this all the time purchasing stuff with stolen cards. Most acquirers have really good fraud detection. Or am I not considering something here?While banks may be considering reimbursing this or that in the case of reputed stores selling physical goods, they may not be that nice with bitcoin related businesses. Just look at the history of PayPal vs Bitcoin and how many chargebacks did happen in P2P exchanging simply because bitcoin is digital and PayPal never cared to research deeper.",

You do need to store keys on your server in one way or another; whenever a user wants to withdraw, you use those keys to create a Bitcoin transaction that spends up to the user's balance and sends it to the address they specify.A user should never be asked to send you their seed phrase, because at that point you will own all of their private keys, even though you don't need them just to send them Bitcoin. You just need a single address.Quote from: zander1983 on December 28, 2022, 08:05:14 AMIm suggesting no storage of private keys.Then do it like https://getbittr.com/. Users provide an address and whenever they send the service fiat, they immediately get the same amount in BTC sent to that Bitcoin address.
