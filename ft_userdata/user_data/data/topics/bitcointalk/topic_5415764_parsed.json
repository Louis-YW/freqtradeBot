I noticed that you listed Ledger among those hardware wallets that support a Bitcoin-only firmware. Ledger doesn't have that. It's possible to only install the Bitcoin app on your Nano device and no other apps, but that can't be considered as a Bitcoin-only firmware. Is this a mistake or is there a reason why Ledger is on that list?",

Thanks !!Quote from: Pmalek on October 04, 2022, 04:04:22 PMI noticed that you listed Ledger among those hardware wallets that support a Bitcoin-only firmware. Ledger doesn't have that. It's possible to only install the Bitcoin app on your Nano device and no other apps, but that can't be considered as a Bitcoin-only firmware. Is this a mistake or is there a reason why Ledger is on that list? Thanks for your feedback. My goal was to create something valuable to compare wallets and help you decide which of them to use. I also learned a lot when writing the article. I know there are a lot of missing wallets, so I tried to start with the most popular ones. I plan to continue adding more wallets.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 04, 2022, 08:10:51 PMThis is another good source for hardware wallets but I didn't see any new information I didn't already know, and they could did a bit more research for exact secure elements and other things.If what they say is true than only Trezor and Coldcard mk4 hardware wallets can be used as password managers, and that can be a useful thing.I noticed some hardware wallets are missing, but you can find almost all missing hardware wallets in out local section topic that is maintained by out member FatFork:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5285324.0Quote from: Husires on October 03, 2022, 09:31:42 AMIf someone can make it in the form of an infographic, it will give detailed and quick information to everyone who wants to compareOr someone could convert this spreadsheet into bitcointalk forum post tables, maybe with less information if possible.Hi.
