  "content": "The Compac F comes with no fans, and you must provide some kind of cooling to prevent its melting.So I first just connected this USB powered fan:I pointed it into the heatsink of the miner. This seems to do the trick, the miner works fine over a long period of time, no melting, and the fan is not crazy loud. Normally that would be the end of the story, and most people are happy with that setup.But, when things get quiet, the fan is noticeably loud in an annoying way as it's right next to me, and I would like to change that.So I started to look around to see how I could cool them down with minimum noise.I first saw these small fans that can be attached directly to the miner:But the fan is rather loud, so that's a no go for me.I already have some big fans that move a lot of air very quietly, like the Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM:You can manually set the speed for these fans with a controller, like this one(Noctua NA-FC1):That way, I can lower their speed and they are basically silent, yet still move a lot of air. That's ideal for this, so I would want to use them.What would be the best configuration to mount these fans to cool down the Compac F in the best way?I usually see setups like this (I could mount the big fan on the USB hub and it would be moving air horizontally):But looking around I've found this alternative setup:It might work great with a single 120mm fan:Would it be better to put the big fan on top like the previous photo(moving air towards the ceiling), or horizontally on the USB hub moving air either away or towards the miner?. Also, is there any optimal distance between the fan and the miner?",

Then for extra heat dissipation I add the smaller sinks on the back using same adhesive glue-SNIP-That thermal glue you are using is really poor thermal conductivity. You'll basically loose most of the benefit of a larger heatsink due to the poor thermal conductivity of the glue.If you're going to glue heatsinks together you'll need a better thermal conductivity glue, 2W/mK just isnt going to cut it.Most basic silicon thermal paste is in the region of 6W/mK, there are some pastes that are in the 9-12W/mK but rarely any better than this.There's a 7.2W/mK glue available through Farnell https://uk.farnell.com/omega/ob-101-2/adhesive-epoxy-twinpack-2oz/dp/3870429 if you insist on gluing heatsinks together.Anyway, if you want to improve the thermal performance you'd probably do better by completely replacing the original heatsink with something larger more fins, bigger surface area and using a good thermal conductivity paste or thermal pad to the ASIC.Also, use a black annodised heatsink. It will offer a 5-10% improvement due to black body radiation.",
