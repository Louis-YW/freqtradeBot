I used Agoradesk a lot for buying and selling cryptos, it is very nice. Once you found some nice users, it is just perfect imo. You just need to be carreful and check the rates.Peachbitcoin is a good P2P non-KYC option too, based in Switzerland. Very smooth process, just a little bit boring if you are an Iphone user but still doable. (their app is still in Beta with iOS)If you want to find legit P2P services, kycnot.me could be a great place to find links.",

Those market websites have Trust and Reputation score for exchange and you can use those score as kind of reviews.Want to know they are legit or scam, you can search with Google.Paxful + scamBybit + scamYou will have results from Google and do your assessment on those results, to judge those exchanges.Five exchanges you list, four are centralized exchanges and only Paxful is a Peer-to-Peer exchange.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

A fair answer for all. Apart from Phemex, the rest are all reputable exchanges and OP can use one of them to start his crypto journey. The only downside is that they are all centralized exchanges and most people here don't like them so there will be accusations about them. But basically, they are safe to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. OP, my advice, you are newbies and there are many things you need to learn before investing. Therefore, I recommend that you have the most basic knowledge about the market before thinking about investing. Investing in haste also won't help you make a profit.",

If you don't use escrow you can be scammed also. This happened to me once when I was using a new p2p exchange where I wasn't familiar how it worked and mistakenly sent a payment before the other user's funds were in escrow. I got scammed but it wasn't a major loss. You should start out with smaller trades when you are just beginning.",

Like Paxful, you would be charged more, so I prefer you to go for direct exchanges like Bybit or OKX. But, I prefer Binance for you if you must be informed, more than all those exchanges you listed above. You didn't add it despite being the largest crypto exchange in the world. I've used it for many years without any issue even as I'd used others with a slight issue, so I can't be selfish to recommend it.Only note that all these services are centralised (CEX), you might also want to also learn about decentralised exchange (DEX) if that's okay by you.",

ByBit and OkX are both centralized exchanges, them offering peer to peer trade is like how Binance exchange is doing it's thing, but customers are asked to pass KYC, I believe the best P2P platforms don't need to ask for KYC or keep any form of data from their users. They are not as good as AlgoraDesk, HodlHodl and others, they don't ask for any sensitive data, just you and the person you want to buy from or sell to, their job is making sure the trade is a success.",

In the crypto environment, it is better to be flexible and also to be equipped with more knowledge and skills to handle those things, and if you are newbie then I think you should start coming to the Beginners & Help  to find the basics first.",

The exchange is not a scam. Also that others like OKX and Bybit have made KYC mandatory now also.I am still using Bybit and OKX, they are both good exchanges. But I do not like the OXK mobile app, it is always slow if you want to select another coin or token from trading page, but it is good on desktop. Although the mobile app is not that bad.Bybit is good, but I noticed too much trading fee deduction at times on the exchange which I may be wrong or right about. It is good for using altcoins to trade futures, unlike using only stablecoins as it is on most exchanges, you can also use stablecoins to trade futures on Bybit.  Stablecoins available are USDT and USDC for future trading.I have not used Bitget and Phemex before but they are said to be legit exchanges. You can make more research about them to know if they are shady or not.",

If you are doing a P2P trade on any centralized exchange ensure that you do with a merchant who has a reputation and has made a significant amount of trade.",
