If they go up by 6%, obviously, they will hurt less than when they have gone up by 10%, but a 6% increase in the future is in addition to what prices have gone up. The only thing that can save people from being hurt by inflation is that salaries rise above it or that they have investments that beat it. As for how long the recession will last, it depends. With the powerful arguments you provide to defend that the recession will last, I don't even know how to begin to refute you.",

This is why stimulus might become again, money printers will go brrr again for people to have funds despite being jobless. But I don't think the prices of food or gas will drop like what OP is thinking. Jerome Pal has not said there is a recession actually. They don't say it but they just want us to feel it. The recession will last for a long time until leaders will really have a concern about the priority. The transition from gas dependent to renewable energy will be very slow. This route is full of suffering.",

Even though we are going through a period of inflation, but the demand isn't going down. It's a weird recession(if it can be called one). Anyhow, if it stays(as you wish), even then it won't have that dampening effect on the price. Why? Because jobs are here to stay for a while due to baby boomer exodus. They are retiring, which in turn is creating job openings and producing a deflationary effect. People will continue to earn and spend. There's also the factor of money printing by feds which plays a more crucial part here. What we are seeing right now is an after effect of their money printing, things are going back to normal, and economy will finally show the damage all the money printing has done. But I am guessing when that happens, Feds will just start pumping again lolSo yea, we aren't really in a recession(since people still got jobs). Weird times.",

The good thing about this your message is that this current recession we're all experiencing is not the first the world has experienced and it wouldn't be the last, cause worst situations beyond this recession has taken place buy with time things were normalized with a good sense of moderation to the standard of living.Next time bring forensics to the table along with your statements and not just based on mere assumptions, as it could only be creating fear into people.

It's not that a lot but it helps to cope and at least slow down the inflation rate and the price of commodities.",

Your statement shows that you have zero idea of what a recession is! Price never drops down due to a recession. Rather it increases the price of commodities because the purchasing power of a currency reduces. If a commodity costs 100 USD today, it will cost 106 USD tomorrow if the inflation is 6%. Inflation is a pretty normal thing. It happens everywhere. But high inflation is a challenge and there are several measures available to control it.",

Boom and bust is an economic cycle that has been around ever since free market capitalism existed, probably a long time before. People get happy, borrow a lot, spend a lot and then realize they have to pay it back which requires tightening spending a lot. Many politicians and central bankers have tried, then failed, to break this cycle over time but it seems as reliable as the sunrise each morning or the movement of the tides.",
