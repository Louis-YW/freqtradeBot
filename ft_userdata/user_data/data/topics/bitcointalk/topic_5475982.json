      "body": "Not only the bitcoiners are scammers targets, but everybody they come across . It is people that should learn, make research and avoid scam. When I starting knowing about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, the first I did was that I researched on how to avoid scam. If you check my earliest topics, they are more about avoiding crypto scam and hack.This topic would have been good if you add the examples of scam and how to avoid, but you did not include any. Scam increase during bull run, but there have always been scam. If you want to know, just find a presale coin, join their telegram group and post something. You will see how scammers will message you so that you can connect to their fake site with your wallet so that they can stole all your coins.I can still remember the Elon Musk SNL that fake Elon Musk speech was shown after a break. The speech was about scammers using Elon Mush fake speech that people should send money to a doge address, that they will receive double immediately. The scammer address was funded with over $5 million not quite long before it was said to be a scam. There are scam like this on social media.Another example are the celebrities and well known people that their Twitter account were hacked and used to lure victims to send coins to a provided addresses. How about the premium cloud mining that end as scam. They are many online.  How about airdrops scam. To pay VIP. Also your information can be known, like email which can be used to send phishing email. How about fake ICO which is completely an exit scam. Also are some pump and dump coins. We warned people on this local board not to buy digitoad for example. See the price of digitaod now after launch. People are losing money. I am not saying you should not buy presale coins or tokens, but do your research and use the amount of money that you can be able to afford to lose.While talking about money loss like this, it is also good to talk about hackers. Not the same as scam but both can lead to money loss and both can be interconnected as scammers can be a hacker.Put thoughts into what you are discussing next time. Not a criticism but an advice.",

Alot of shitcoins and scam toekns promising huge returns to naive/ greedy investors who in the end be victimised while the development team get the gains and move on. There are still many ways scammers get the better of investors aside from the ones listed by both me and Charles-Tim but in the end its just for us to be cautious and anything that is too good to be true should be avoided.

But the fact still reamain say we go must always dey careful about this bitcoin or bullrun matter, because no be only bitcoin matter self both this festive period. Because the end of every season dey always come with hoddles, and if you no dey careful them don scam you or your hard earn money. If you watch out this days you go confirm say for social media you go discover as advert don plenty on how you go buy new phone of #150k for as low as #50k %75 discount promo! promo!! Promo!!! My brother no request any oder. Because Dem go tell you to pay half of the money before delivery. and if you do, Dem no go bring anything rather requesting for the remaining balance. So this one na general advice to all forum members I dey use this thread as a medium to informing us all. Make we really dey careful expecialy those websites wey dey use jumia name dey promote their fake business for social media. Disclaimer⚠️ bewear of any site promoting jumia product. Its a red tag. Jumia is not aware of such but for you to oder any goods you can go to there officials website to purchase there product not by just consulting some random jumiaseal. while I talk like this no be because of promoting them but due to the encounter I don get with this people before, so I no want anyone of us to go through that part again.",

For instance, when Vitalik Buterin X (formerly Twitter) account was compromised, victims suffered losses of $691,000 due to a malicious link promoting a fake free NFT.

One thing with dis scammers be say ba, as new ways dey comot to take combat dem from scamming people, even dem too dey get new ways wey dem go take scam their victims the more. All dis tins na because of d newest technologies wey dem come always. Most of dis scammers are more educated dan us but one things be say make you know the basis of security and not to expose your self to the digital (online) world too much. Remember say anything wey you no share online, nobody go fit get access to you talk less of scamming you. A word is enough for the wise and when the wise obeys it becomes a lesson and a more wiser person in the future.

This ones don cast and dem don upgrade pass like this. That being said, newbies go still fit need dis one if dem never know about all dis scams before since I dey sure say anybody wey no be newbie here or new to the online digital world, dem for don understand all dis scopes wey dis scammers dey use to fraud their victims. Technology don go far the way we dey think am now, make we just dey careful with anything we dey do online. Na d place to learn new things to make yourself better but d same time, the place dey very risky too so make you know how to trail for dis kind place wey go fit make you lose everything within minutes.",

The new investor's dey come in their number wey be say dem dey plenty die and lack proper knowledge of how the market be so this na why scammers dey chop dem scatter. Scammers know say newbies dem go plenty so dem dey target dem with mouth watering offers and many dey fall victims. You wey be investor, na you suppose secure your investment and you no supposed believe everything wey you see for online unless you go fall mugu to scammers.Different scams plenty during the bull market but e get one wey people no dey too reason because dem believe say everything wey dem invest inside you do well (most times e dey go that way but e no dey last). We need dey careful wetin we dey Invest inside because plenty altcoins go come out during this time. Many of dem no go fit survive after the bull market as the project founders only created the tokens for the bull market and after the market finish dem no get any plans for the bear market and the project go die so if you still dey invested inside them na you go lose am. During the bull market, ponzi scheme go plenty too and Bitcoin doublers go begin dey plenty but as a wise investor, we need dey avoid all this sites them and just dey hold the coins wey we dun buy for the bull market.For Nigeria here, we go begin here all sorts of defi platforms dem wey go dey promise all sorts of benefits, we need avoid them and not give out control over your coins to any platform wey go promised say dem go Invest for you or trade for you and dem go dey give you returns.
