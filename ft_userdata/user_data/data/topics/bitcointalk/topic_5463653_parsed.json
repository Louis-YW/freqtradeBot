I'm happy you are selling more stuff, I think it's underrated myself.I'll have a think on these this weekend and get back to you. still owe ya a pm as well, sorry but tired!  Thanks! I love these little guys. They're made for those small transactions and for collectors that say they can't afford a silver wallet. Physical bitcoin wallets don't have to just be for the rich. There are many more affordable ones coming and the best are yet to come. Yeah, most people suffer from group think and fear of others  .I've been making physical bitcoins since 2014 and don't intend on stopping anytime soon. I love it.   If I can prevent the government from silencing or stopping just 1 transaction, it will all be worth it. . Not that I think the government can stop bitcoin, but they can stop and control the redemption from exchanges, making it difficult for those who don't know how to avoid them. That is why it is important to build the tools now before the regulations catch up to the exchanges free choice. These aren't necessarily for the here and now, but for the future, when miners only get small amounts of Sats for rewards and when the governments restrict  transactions from those they appose. It is written, you will not be able to buy and sell without their mark. I will go 1000 miles out of my way, not to comply, if freedom of choice is not on the table. \"The Builder\"cT",
