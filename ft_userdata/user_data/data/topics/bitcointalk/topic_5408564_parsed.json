TRON is really a good option and with a lower minimum plus their fees are not that big compare to other coins.If you are just on that exchange to trade your tokens, this can be your best option but I suggest not to stay on a smaller site longer because for me its not safe and its always good to use the top exchanges but don't ever put big money on any exchanges.",

But now that am well informed I don't commit such error any more I believe, this will be one of the learnings that a crypto trader will acquire at the beginning.At some point, we will understand that each exchange has their own minimum amount of trades.Just like for example, binance, most trading pairs, you can execute at the min of 10USD equivalent.So if your coins are below in that amount, you can't trade and need to add more if you want to complete your order.",

Pretty much a wallet exploit, which can happen to literally any other blockchain.If we are just talking about some instant or cheap fees and fast transactions and forgot about what recently happened with Slope or Solana hack then Solana for me is a good choice or alternative.There are already lot of platform on Solana that you can exchange different tokens to one another in just few clicks with small transaction fees and fast confirmation.",

So it isn't about minimum fees to transfer your asset from the exchange but trying to find a 'bridge' that is even lower than the minimum amount in the direct pair.At first it was indeed confusing but if you take time to read it and understand it again and again, you will eventually get what he was saying there. If I remember I think I already did that same strategy but only on different coins because I mostly deal with smaller amounts. This is time, effort and money consuming because of the left and right fees but it was worth it overall.I only don't know if it's worth it to share this idea because I think this was too common already and many of us here already knows this trick. This can be done not only in instant exchanges or decentralized exchanges but also on centralized exchanges as well.",
