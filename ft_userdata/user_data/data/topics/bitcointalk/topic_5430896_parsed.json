Does completing bonus is still possible and profitable or it's just like chasing the wind? It is for you to decide. Duelbits' milestones are meant for high-rollers and if you think you won't be able to meet such requirements, then it's fine to just play the way you do, no need to switch up or anything. These as their name imply, are just bonuses. Incentives for playing and betting. You can play and bet without having to meet bonus requirements, although it really urges you to go beyond your means sometimes and bet more especially with how greaf Duelbits is with inspiring people to play on their site. Anyhow, it is up to you whether betting for the bonuses is worth the extra effort or not.",

      "body": "Speaking of bonuses, I'll say it's something you don't or shouldn't have to contest for. Not when you know you could be at the loosing end of it all like you've rightly stated. That at times one has to lose more to acquire just a small fragment in bonus. That would be some great lose if you look at it and a compensation that doesn't go no where.Hence, supposedly your doing your thing, just gambling like you would want to and your rewarded with some bonuses, it's great news. At least, it wasn't contested for and you've got a few rounds to go for free and you don't get to stake your real money. That's okay and it would be worth it at that time.",

Does completing bonus is still possible and profitable or it's just like chasing the wind?Completing bonus is very possible all you need to do is just meet the requirements but profitable? Which solely depends on your luck and if you calculate the amount you wager and possibility of reward from the bonus then most likely its won't be that much profitable but for a gambler its just an encouragement factor nothing else.I remember FJs free spin which they offered years back but I never won anything in it to be honest but the current bonus are more realistic and profitable for casinos as well as users if they are lucky enough to win.",

Does completing bonus is still possible and profitable or it's just like chasing the wind?There are lots of threads about this sort of thing that have been debated ad nauseam, but giving my two cents...  It seems like you've somewhat answered your own question.  You say you've been searching for giveaways and haven't found one you think you can win, so right now you are chasing the wind a bit, but being realistic.  It seems like you will know when a bonus is within your means to complete and if it with be worth it for you to try.  I'd say if you keep doing what you're doing you'll probably select the right bonus when it comes along, and will save yourself the heartache of chasing the wrong one.",

We have bonus that requires you to make a deposit and you get awarded the bonus which you can redeem without much tasks. We also have those that require you to make just one or few bets to redeem the bonus. Those you gave as example mightn't be worth participating in but we have others.Therefore generally, casino bonus are worth it because you can get some profits which means you risking less of your money to achieve that. But instead of focusing efforts on those bonus, I think you should just bet with your own money, get your profit and move on. Those bonus are marketing tools and the casinos will always find ways they don't go bankrupt doing those bonuses. Bonus.",

Some casinos require up to 100x wagered amount just to claim the bonuses that they offer which I think is too hard to reach.",

Although when claiming a deposit bonus make sure to check our the rollover needed because sometimes they tie up your deposit alongside bonus and it becomes impossible to complete the wager and your initial deposit is also locked up because of this. I will explain with an example,Suppose you get 100% signup bonus for depositing $100, now make sure the bonus $100 is separate from the actual deposited $100 so that in case you fail to rollover the bonus you can still play a little bit and withdraw your actual deposit. I have been a victim of such a bonus where the deposit was locked and I had to rollover 20x and it was just not possible and I had to basically gamble up everything.",

This is one way more advantage to the casinos so they can stay at edge from other casinos despite of the strong competition. However, for us, I’d say this is also worth it because they can be a big help for us to win without high risks, but for some it can also be somewhat annoying since it can also wager us more until we end up empty just to chase for them.",

Every steps they take they take it to generate review so that first they can pay their employees, then pay for the resources and other costs before the owners make a profit from it.
