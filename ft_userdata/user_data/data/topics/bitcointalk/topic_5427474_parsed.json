      "body": "So he essentially admits that there were not 1:1 assets and that user deposits in FTX trading could withdraw from the same user funds that the FTX exchange was operating on, which is to say there never existed a 1:1 ratio of underlying assets, hence the liquidity issue. He said there was a \"generalized withdrawal\" when everyone began to withdraw so the guys that were told they had their funds 1:1 with assets got screwed over.He's skirting most of the questions by feigning ignorance, as if he couldn't possibly be aware that his company never kept true to their own terms of service and had user funds dabbling into other corporate entities with much riskier enterprises. He's speculating as to what happened because if he says concretely what happened, then he would have been aware of his FTX's misconduct and therefore his own. He's trying to avoid criminal charges and keep his liability only to the civil level (fines, not jail).",

He is clearly an intelligent person to be able to construct such a big company that has since failed, but his downfall might actually be the fact that he is on this media campaign and falling into many unwitting traps that interviewers are asking him. It's clear he is going against the advice of the best lawyers he can afford, but this might be a level of arrogance he still retains. Ultimately it is the regulators who will pursue charges against him once the company has been properly audited and the auditors have been giving very bad signals about the organization of the company so far, he seems to be in for at least a few years jail time.",

It reminds me of one of the characters in Alexandre Dumas' novel \"Ten Years Later\". I mean Superintendent Fouquet. He also constantly confused his personal funds with public funds (the funds of his clients).",

Maybe because SBF thinks that the more he does interviews and is seen being talked about in the mainstream media or social media platforms, his image will still be fragrant and fine, he forgot that his image will be tarnished even more because his reputation is already ruined.",
