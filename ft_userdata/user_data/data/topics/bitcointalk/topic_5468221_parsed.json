  "content": "While watching TV with my kid, I've watched various advertisements of gambling nature (let's say for example, Rummy123, RummyCircle, A23 Rummy, etc.)These are all specifically Indian ads, but I'm sure you may have seen various gambling advertisements, some banners at boundaries when cricket is ongoing, even in any other sport. How would a kid ignore those things, they might just come and ask you about what is it. Till when can we lie to them? Don't you think that the frequency of such ads must be less in order to let the kids not get trapped into gambling and don't do it at such a small age?",

      "body": "Those gambling sites are usually sponsors of such sporting activities, that why they are aired on Tv alongside some sports. There's no point lieing to your kids about it mate. As long as you show them a good example and don't gamble if front if them. They won't mind. I think parents makes one mistake all the time and that is, when your child ask you something that you know they shouldn't be aware of, just give them an idea of what it is, so they can chill on that issues. If you let them go out on thier own to know what it is, they will probably learn it the wrong way and try at all means to know how it works. So I will suggest you stop lieing and tell them the truth about the adverts.",

I do not have kids, by the way, so I cannot talk from experience. But if I had and they saw those ads, I would make clear to them that they are seeing things which are supposed to be consumed by adults only.I personally prefer to say the truth if the children are old enough to understand it, rather than lying to them. Though, I would not criticize parents for using \"white lies\", to avoid their children to go a long a bad path.",

Maybe I think you can also control yours to keep those channels out of the reach of kids as well this is only applicable if you have your special dish at home.",

I don't know if this is patt of the dictates of democracy and capitalism but doing business at the detriment of our children is not a great idea. The government and regulators literally look the other way while the media do what they want. Just like you have stated, we are left with the choice of protecting our kids by ourselves. The frustrating thing about this is that kids learn faster than adults. As soon as the ads are allowed to run one or two times, they capture it and it stick to their brain. It is truly our duty to protect our children",

The latest announcement on the ban of advertising on gambling and gaming platform have been made a month back. However there is relaxation that advertisements can be broadcast with request to the authority, holding prior written permission. Now the frequency of gambling advertisements have decreased, but it is possible to see ads.Earlier we used to see ads popping whenever we go through YouTube and other social media platforms. Now this have decreased much. Things were really uncontrollable during the days of covid-19, because we can't move anywhere. Whatever application we use there we'll get to see something related to gambling. As in the opening thread more number of Rummy and related platforms emerged. Further when the ban imposed, these platforms started to move towards small games and Ludo is one amongst that had turned very popular.",

I am against gambling advertisements on television because they want to drag people who are not involved in gambling into a quagmire by offering attractive offers to people who are not involved in gambling. We can say that even some of the youngest young people start gambling in this way. Especially this of course is more present on billboards during football matches. Someone should take a hand because young children also watch such sports and this is a bad example for them.",

Though I can see a lot of gambling-related ads on social media sites, especially those that are promoted by influencers and other social figures. This, IMO, is a lot more dangerous as more and more youths are using social media as days pass. Some of them are being exposed to social media at a very early stage in their lives and that wouldn't help them develop at all. They can see all types of gambling adverts in there that are being inserted in contents very easily.",

Going back to television, the sponsor banners from most matches aren't regulated as well and from those games, they're visible. So if I am watching some basketball games or any sports as long as there are these sponsors, they're very visible in the eyes of the child. But if it's just the gambling ads, thank goodness that I haven't seen one because for sure a lot of parents will be triggered by that. Because with what's happening in social media, there are plenty of them and parents can't stop ignoring the proliferation of these.",

Advertisements featuring gambling sites aren’t no different as they simply aim to attract and retain new and willing customers. If your kid is curious about gambling cause of an advertisement in TV, we should come clean about gambling and not lie. Be open and honest about everything as kids would definitely find out for themselves  what they’re curious about.

But with social media platforms they’re all over the web and not to mention that kids are now also surfacing social media. What can we do as parents? Atleast be on their side if possible or teach them to always ask for your opinion when there’s something unfamiliar caught their attention. It’ll be starting with us and ‘coz governments won’t simply remove them from public’s access because those which are being advertised are paying them and are regulated in the first place. You may also avail adblocker or request to your cable provider to remove chanels with such content.",

There are always advertisements for gambling websites on TV and newspapers and announcements of lottery winners are always on TV and precisely at night. but when advertisements about gambling are shown, it says prohibited for minors and it is up to each mother and father to explain to children that they should not play what they are seeing on TV, this is no different from cases in which parents They are watching TV and there is advertising for a film that involves violence and sex and the parents immediately explain to the child that they cannot do thatAnother example is that there are parents who give cell phones to children aged 2 to 3 years old and above so they can watch Mikey and other animes on YouTube, these parents constantly control what the children watch, so in my opinion there is nothing wrong with having advertising gambling games on TV, parents must educate their children well so that they do not create an account at a casino while they are minors. Also, for someone to play at the casino they need money, so a child of 9 or 10 years of age cannot have money to go and play at an online casino, all it takes is for the father not to give him his debit card and not to give him cryptocurrencies that the child does not You will have money to play. There are many ways to prevent children from playing at online casinos because they are underage",

Avoiding the topic could still work, but there's nothing wrong with talking about it this early when some kids pick up the situation and become more curious the more you try to push them away.While I agree with what you said about the need for gambling ads to appear less frequently, there's not much we can do aside from looking for another solution because losing viewers and receiving complaints won't stop them from broadcasting gambling ads.",

I think television networks are much more regulated so gambling ads are filtered better compared to social media.If we're talking about sponsorship banners on some sporting events then I think that's something TV networks can't handle because it's out of their contract.

They can ignore risk of exposure on kids to add those advertisements on television channels. However if gambling is allowed in your nation, they do not do anything wrong and illegally but as parents, you must choose channels without those advertisements or as least as possible for your kids to watch.It is hard and requires your deep care for your kids who are very young and have yet educated and are matured enough to control their activities. I believe it is best to keep them away from gambling before they are no longer teenager and even a little bit older too.",

It's not good if kids were exposed in gambling in such a very young age for they still don't have the capacity to understand such things. So, it's better if kids still have supervision with their parents or adults and so by any chance they saw gambling advertisements and they asked about it, someone can explain and tell them that it is still not appropriate for their age. I think there should be laws and policy about that, gambling advertisements should only be posted in appropriate avenues and tv is not one of them.",
