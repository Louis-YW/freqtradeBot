Also, you should have a basic understanding of the current readiness status of an alt coin and possible changes. Also, you must take the time to familiarize yourself with each trade and learn if you want to learn and improve yourself. All alt coins in the market except Bitcoin are risky. You do short term trading more long term trading is totally risky which is fear of losing money. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin Meme coins or cryptocurrencies currently in the market can be useful for you in trading but carries the highest risk. The value of these coins tends to go up and down depending on the field. When interested and motivated to start trading, the most important thing is to observe yourself and trade with humor. Allows you to arrange yourself through which good profit and education can be obtained.",

The important of altcoin to give us easy profit when the bullish market has come. Mostly of meme coins were scam coin. It might be pumped but it will be dumped crazily later. None knew when the scammer who was issuing the meme coin will be dumping it to make millions of money from the traders. Altcoin was just giving alternative way to invest and avoid the congested blockchain when bitcoin got many traffics. I don't see an important point other than it.

Many people have been hotly discussing BRC20, I think there have been some topics that have emerged, but to me, the current hype is still related to some low quality content about memes, and they are not the basis. The investment base to me simply sees it as a fomo event. Actually, altcoins are always important, they bring directions to solve problems, but if you are too fomo to follow trends and are not aware of the things that are built like infrastructure, then altcoins are a potentially risky place.",

Suddenly I scrolled down to your comments and now you have deflated my interest in considering giving a short at  altcoins again.Guess I'm back to where I was , focusing only on bitcoin, with it's considerable risks, compared to how I hear altcoins, can just disappear and die, in the shortest time. Eventually I'll start my journey in altcoins, but it'll be a top altcoin, not any new hyped projects in the market.From my findings I know that altcoins can be profitable in a short time, like bitcoin trading, only that it's like gambling, where there's chances of losing your investment too. Difference is that altcoins can disappear but bitcoin doesn't.",

Although altcoins still add diversity to the crypto industry as not everyone would be sole stuck on one coins and I will relate this to the scenerio that is happening with Bitcoin now in terms of the high rate as many people do swap to other altcoins to either complete their transaction as they are much less fee for the sending of these altcoins compare to Bitcoin for now due to the increase fee hike.",
