Moreover, you only succeed to successfully guide some at when you are grounded to the point of motions whereas there are evidence in you admirably to be emulated.To my best of founding, only those who embraced the Bitcoin industry at the very periods of time it was introduced are said to be the pioneers in the crytop world as you may say. Basically not really about those who has more of Bitcoin in there wallets of today's.Moreover at OP, I wonder the boosting of a jnr member to parade as a pioneer. What sorts of amiable advice would you have to offer to the newbies or beginners as one who had been in the platform since 2019 til date of 2023.However, arguements to me in the platform is uncalled-for.Quote from: coinremitter on December 08, 2023, 10:02:02 AMShare your valuable advice for someone new to crypto payments and let's build a supportive network. When you say crytop payment, I don't know if you meant crypto exchange or the profitable earnings in the Bitcoin industry.But in a general terms, I would advise the Bitcoin earning beginners who are approximately newbies to the Bitcoin crytop space to adhere that this is not a centralized censorship platform of saving ones funds and the conventional assets the government or any sector of governance is in-charge for decision making and the general overrules of orders, so as not also one of the programs that you have an existing caucus you can lean on at your misplacement of private materials or private keys such as your passwords and your phrases that has the the keen to securing your Bitcoin through the Blockchains because basically, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency where you can store/save your funds with the potentials to have it growing.Bitcoin as an inventory assertive assets that had the potentials of the depreciations (decrease) and appreciations (increases) as a nature of its economical fluctuations of inflations and deinflations but specifically with the goal of standing against the World global unpleasant economy but to offer profitablities to its investors.As a beginner in the Bitcoin crypto world, it is advisable to kickstart your Bitcoin trading with a minimum tolerable amount of money considering your faith and ability to handle frustrations of unpleasant situations at when I he market goes against your will of making profits.Also as, must know that there are two categories of Bitcoin beneficials whom are the Bitcoin traders that normally hope to make quick incomes in no long period of time to solve their financial needs. This set of Bitcoiners are likely to face challenges of to risk because the increments moments of Bitcoin is not the Will of man and not even a personal skilful marketing system can utter one a unique favour to the Bitcoin industry.Also, that of the Bitcoin investors investments, these are investors who has accumulated a specific amount of Bitcoin or investors who are accumulating Bitcoin over and over in a longer period of times hoping to take advantage at every nature of profitablities the Bitcoin markets has in the marketing industries and these sets of Bitcoin investors are likely to less risk in the world of Bitcoin of making profitsThis is where patient is said to be virtue. So likely, an Bitcoin investor is alternate to diversify its Bitcoin asset's portfolio dependent on the investors thoughtfulness to decisions.",

This is question is a honest one, so I'm going to give you some that clue other people night not want to share with you buddy. First of all, in everything you do in crypto space, make sure you have access to your private keys and they are not manage in any custodial platforms. Here are the list of my advices:Make sure you you do your own personal researches and findings before you waste money on any thing, whether it's a coin or tokens, hardware or software wallets or the type of the exchange you want to use to buy and sell your coins.Don't buy shitcoins and meme coins, these coins trend and are very profitable for many people but you have to be careful about them because their downfall are very bad, they can make you hate crypto forever.Don't leave your coins on any centralized exchanges, use it if you want to but make sure that you don't leave your coins on the exchange to avoid stories and regret.Lastly, don't forget that nothing is guaranteed with crypto, anything can happen.These are my advices, in addition; you have to develop strong mind to hold any coin that you hold because the growth is not linear, it will go up one time and will comes down another time.",

Don't believe anything someone tells you in this space unless you've done extensive research and confirmed it's true.Don't leave your coins on centralised exchanges; instead, act as your own bank and keep your funds in a decentralised wallet. Keep your private keys safe and do not share them with others because they are the password to access your money.If you ever want to invest in a coin other than bitcoin, do your own research and calculate the risk you're willing to take. Don't let your altcoin investments turn you off to cryptocurrency in general. You are always welcome to stay and invest in bitcoin.Continue to learn and grow in this space; continuous learning will provide you with an understanding of new technology in the space and will assist you in becoming more knowledgeable and confident in the cryptocurrency space.",

Learn first what they want to know and create posts to get answers from users who are much more knowledgeable. Expecting 80% of the time to get input or lessons from other people is the act of the lazy and that's not what beginners should do.If you are one of the pioneers as you describe then give newcomers an idea of how they can avoid being scammed. The basis for avoiding fraud must be seen from the extent of their knowledge, not whether they want to learn or not, because opportunities will always be exploited by people who want to cheat.",

There's a lot of resources where one who is eagerly enough to learn about bitcoin should go with. And everything is laid free in the Internet, so learning is not a problem anymore, as long as there is sufficient time and good determination to make the learning more meaningful. But I believe studying the bitcointalk forum is the best legit source ever.My best advice for newbies is just trust no one but only yourself. The crypto world has a lot of scammers so learn to trust no one. And always be patient in every decision you make and in every action you chose to make.
