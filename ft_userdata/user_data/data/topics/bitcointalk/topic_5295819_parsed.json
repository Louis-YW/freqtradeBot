  "content": "Bitcoin was invented by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and released as open-source software in early 2009. It was gradually recognized by many until it reached a peak of $19,783 per bitcoin in late-2017. From the beginning of bitcoin history I know that many people become rich instantly when they hold their bitcoins and sold at the highest price last 2017.  After the price of bitcoin fluctuated and dropped where many investors got scared and started to panic to sell their bitcoin even if they went bankrupt. But we cannot hide that bitcoin has changed many lives.On the other hand, after bitcoin dump many are still investing, especially as the price of bitcoin gradually rises again. And due to the continuous development of bitcoin it has become more and more popular and attractive to investors especially to the rich and big companies. Now bitcoin is preparing to reach another ATH. Are you still there and holding your bitcoins? What happened to your life after 10 years in bitcoin? Is there any changes?",

I wish I would have invested into Bitcoin when it was new, but nevertheless it has improved my standard of living and now I don't need to pay huge fees for money exchangers if I have to make cross border payments. This is just my experience which might vary from those who invested at peak and did panic selling as they Amy either consider it as a lesson or curse.",

Nevertheless, I'm still holding and I don't know what will happen to me after 10 years. As much as possible, it's part of my plan to hold at least some up to that year. And with my experience from the time that I've started to invest in bitcoin, it has changed my life in so many ways. The common things just like others are sharing.",

I have been doing this for the last six months, now I have a good value of Bitcoin deposited in my volt. I want to accumulate something like this until the price of Bitcoin reaches $30,000. I think this is a good and profitable idea for everyone.",

What happened to your life after 10 years in bitcoin? Is there any changes?You're right, the way I see it, BTC is on another ATH roll. Like many others since the big rise in BTC back in 2017, I must say that I remained a faithful investor with BTC assets still at hand. How have the past 10 years changed for me?For starters, I learnt a lot more about the industry and gained a much better knowledge of how to levy my skills in trading to increase my capital. so for sure there have been a few bumps here and there, but overall BTC and the entire boom of the crypto industry has impacted me positively. And I'm sure it will continue to do so",

It can happen within weeks when more institutions come in and put 1% of their money into it.My life has changed for the better because thanks to Bitcoin I felt safe financially.

I already heard about the bitcoin from series \"Big Bang Theory\", a comedian show that used to get aired on Netflix back in time. Literally heard it only twice or thrice and never looked back it until the news started floating around my country. We had many black money holders and suddenly it came to notice bitcoin is being used as escape route. So the thing is, I have entered bitcoin at the time when it was already at it's peak and most of the people were rich by then. But surely, up until now the role of bitcoin in my life has been tremendously supportive considering the financial needs of me or family. I never greed for richness, but just small chunks now and then so as to give extra backbone to finances and I think it's going pretty well with bitcoin.",

There are losers and winners and the capital flow on the market are moved between losers and winners. They can survive after few years and they can get big wins or big losses sometimes but not all of them can end with a profit. Bitcoin market is risky and your greed and bad leverage orders can wash out all you achieved after years.Quoteespecially when from mid-2018 to the last few months bitcoin was in a sluggish state. so that many are no longer active because their income does not match their work.is currently experiencing an increase and the possibility of many returning to join again. because this is the time the opportunity can be done. but until when? no one can predict with certainty.The 2018 is a first bearish year of bitcoin after it hit all time high in late 2017. It is a boring year and I remembered the month when it fell down from strong support around $6,000 to below $4,000. It is a terrible month and worse than the crash in 2020 as a pandemic consequence.",
