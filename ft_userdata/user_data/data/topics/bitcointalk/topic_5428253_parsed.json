Is one of the main sources of hydrogen currently not from hydrocarbons which could have been used for fuel? I absolutely agree that this will not become a mass product tomorrow, and most likely it will take more than one year, or maybe 10 years, for industrial solutions. But this is a transition, a qualitative transition to a completely new level of energy. In a sense, almost free and accessible.It's hard to say how equipment manufacturers will behave. But I am sure that after everything that the world has experienced in 2022, after \"hydrocarbon economic terrorism\", they will try to remove hydrocarbons, or rather dependence on them, as soon as possible!",

      "body": "I think fusion energy could be the wrong path to pursue. It could be fundamentally flawed in terms of the containment and insulation necessary to sustain the process over the long term, not being suited to applications smaller than planetoid in scale. While the sun can sustain a fusion reaction for millions of years. The mass and gravity a sun requires to make that a long term achievement might never scale down to a miniaturized industrial grade application. Fusions extremely high efficiency is due to its near zero energy leakage. The suns high gravity keeps everything contained providing insulation and low heat (thermal energy and mass) loss. Developing alternatives which perform the same functional tasks in a smaller application is difficult to conceive of even from a purely theoretical perspective.",

      "body": "I will reply to everyone 1. Yes, before the industrial design - still years of work, and honing technology. But I am sure that modern technologies and science will make it possible to reduce the time for the implementation of this, I will not be afraid of this word - a fundamental transition to a new level of humanity.2. Conceptually, thermonuclear reactors can be implemented both in the form of gigantic stations, on a national scale, and \"personal\" for households, or, for example, apartment buildings. It's only a matter of time. Now you are sitting and reading this from a laptop weighing only 1.5 kg and a screen a couple of millimeters thick. 50 years ago, such power, which is now at your fingertips, occupied huge areas and looked more like a separate building 3. Now billions of dollars of investments will flow into this project and technology, from the same UAE, Qatar and others who now live off oil / gas, but understand that they need to invest in the future. And they have that opportunity. This will further accelerate the development and implementation of technology in our lives.4. The technology is much safer than any other existing one, because if the integrity of the \"container\" where thermonuclear fusion takes place is violated, the plasma is instantly destroyed, and the process stops, without the possibility of \"self-launch\". In addition, primary fuel is absolutely harmless... When switching to Helium 3 (it's true, it is still a difficult process, due to its almost complete absence on Earth, but huge deposits on the Moon), the process becomes absolutely safe and environmentally friendly.",

But I assume either Siemens, General Electric, or other one will be the only ones authorized to build and operate these facilities in the long run. The government of the United States, might donate one of two of these facilities to their allies in order to move the world closer to zero carbon emitions, but I don't see this wonderful technology going all around the world.",

What researchers are currently doing is only developing renewable energy which will reduce the use of fossil energy, not replace it, because it will not be possible to replace fossil energy in the future because there will be more problems that arise such as economic and political problems.https://rentar.com/impossible-replace-fossil-fuels-alternative-fuel-sources/And actually fossil energy is not too bad, indeed the effect of the carbon dioxide it produces causes global warming but in my opinion this problem in the next few years will be resolved with CO2 capture devices which have been developed by companies like CleanO2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JaN6kT_zRIIt's true that the development of this energy fusion is very good and I'm very amazed at it because in the future we will feel life like in Iron Man, but that doesn't need to be exaggerated because what is exaggerated is not good and also we shouldn't be distracted by problems safety of this fusion energy.

If you carefully read the full announcement - it is indicated that the total energy spent on holding a stable plasma to obtain an energy output was less received as a result of the process. Gain/cost ratio - 120%Yes, the energy spent on the initial start-up is not taken into account, but I am sure that with such an indicator of efficiency, the influence of \"start-up\" costs will tend to 0 in proportion to the operating time of the installation.2. Thorium, against the background of controlled thermonuclear fusion, has disadvantages:- It's hard to get. It is very diffusely distributed on Earth. Although it is estimated to be more in total than the same uranium.- It is much more difficult and expensive to extract from the rock, due to its scattered distribution.- Thorium is not safe, although less dangerous than plutonium/uranium. The presence of thorium aerosols is thought to increase the risk of lung, pancreatic, and blood cancers.- The technology has not been brought to industrial widespread use either. But there are working experimental ones, for example, in the 1960s, the thorium reactor LFTR Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment was built in the USA.",

Therefore, scientists who invented something new or were close to solving it disappeared or died for unknown reasons, or inventions were bought by someone and their developments disappeared. But now is a different time. There are only a few decades left of fossil fuels on Earth, everyone understands that it will end soon. Therefore, states are actively looking for and finding a replacement for them. Such a study itself and its positive results were not previously possible. But now there is a question of the survival of mankind due to global climate change. Here, corporate interests will no longer work.After reading this news, I remembered one of Vanga's prophecies. She said that soon we will have several artificial suns that will evenly illuminate the Earth throughout the day. It will be a ball with a shell about six meters in diameter, inside which the same reaction will take place as in the sun. True, Vanga then predicted a catastrophe when two such artificial suns collided in the sky. But anyway, this suggests that such an invention is quite possible and it will be soon.",
