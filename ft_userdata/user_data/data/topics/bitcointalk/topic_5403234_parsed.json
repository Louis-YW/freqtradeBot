The Oil sector is regulated under OPEC and that is a body in control of countries producing Oil. Food also has to do with agriculture. A country that doesn't invest in agriculture is bound to have food shortage that will give others edge or advantage to either hold it back and sell at higher price. If this will be seen as whale manipulation then it is the fault of the government.",

The weak hodlers of products like farm produce need other materials they don't have so they sell at cheaper price to attract faster buying. During the scarcity, the hodlers can increase there price and this goes on facets of life That has been a normal circumstances so why hating the buyers at the time products are cheap. It is about planning and strategy. Currently with the going on with bitcoin price, it is equally a time to accumulate more to sell in bull time.",
