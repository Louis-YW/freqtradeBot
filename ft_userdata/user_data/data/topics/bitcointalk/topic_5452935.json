  "content": "Work Progress: https://ibb.co/VvJZWBL   https://ibb.co/VTn5hj0     https://ibb.co/8mg8ZPrSatoshi Nakamoto, you are one of the pioneers in the welfare of modern human life. Bitcoiners are ever grateful to your discovery. None of us know whether you are dead or alive. Many people have tried to find you but no one specifically recognized you. But your identity is not important to me because you are not of any particular race, you belong to everyone in the world. I would like to emphasize your discovery rather than your identity. If I could I would dedicate America's Statue of Liberty to you which is hidden inside my mind. But today in this regard i tried to do through my artwork. The people of the world never thought they would have freedom in financial transactions or services. The freedom you give us. People were imprisoned by the conventional banking system and would have been held hostage to a third party. Today you are the guide of liberation from that situation.When people are desperate to save wealth always had to worry about the lack of security at that moment you have shown them an alternative way. Now wherever people move with their wealth virtually.Today about 15 percent of women in the world have also found their economic independence. While many of us may not appreciate you today, the guy who bought pizza with 10000 bitcoins will understand your invention better than anyone else. Many have now learned to guess to what extent your discoveries may rise in the future.A historic and venerable symbol of American independence is the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to America. But in reality, I have nothing to give you. I express my gratitude to you from the core of my heart.",

And it seems that more bitcoin \"users\" have never transacted freely because they do so in a centralized application environment, even reducing the level of interest in using bitcoin if you see the phenomenon of increasing network fees lately.People are really finding it difficult to migrate from some of the conventional systems.",

Your beautiful description and the positivity you found in this art work both of the two things inspired me much. This art work is looking a bit like the Statue of Liberty that I'm only think as a gift not consider as a Statue of Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi is anonymous so it is impossible to identify him specifically and i think we should not give utmost importance on Satoshi's identity we can gather proper knowledge about his creation that will be effective for us.",

But after discovering bitcoin his anonymity is definitely a good idea. Because what he created could not have been possible by any other governments . But if he was alive then he would have been a citizen of any country then the citizen or government of that country could have taken more advantage from him. From this aspect his anonymity is very important.",

Aside from being grateful, we all knew that he also received a lot of contempt from authorities since what he has made ignited the thought of the authorities that maybe he is creating something so that people will be more convinced to rebel from their authorities. It is not that we didn't understand this very thought, and we are aware what might happen if it was used to be like that, it's just giving the very idea of that is what makes the authority fearful about their positions being threatened.",

In my view the hand of the statue indicates economic liberation. I think BTC will free the whole world from poverty and inflation. In essence, the statue is showing the whole world the path to economic liberation with the magic of his hands. The crown on her head stands for economic growth and I think the crown of the statue is a reminder that the country is thinking of more free economy. Finally, it's time to rethink those who work in the global economy. From my point of view this painting portrait these things.",
