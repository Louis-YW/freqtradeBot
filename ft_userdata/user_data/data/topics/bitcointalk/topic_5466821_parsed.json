And i think it will fulfil your requirement as it has vault option and i have used the vault several time. Though they have few issues on sportsbook but they have no issues on the casono section. So, undoubtedly you can use it.",

But your mentioning vault also makes me more confused about what you really mean and hope that my above statement answers your questions.",

I do have a question; does the vault have an amount that you have to accumulate to before you can withdraw the money? Or they have a certain rank that you have to achieve beige you’ll be able to unlock the vault and withdraw if “yes” then it’s no different from what other casinos are doing when you’re given bonuses. Since you’ll have to accumulate a certain amount from the bonus that you have received before you can withdraw them to your non-custodial wallet.",

If you asking these feature from a user perspective, these feature being used for to stored some of your money in-case you are in winning situation. Example, you sent 80/90% of your winning to the vault and want to keep gambling you keep the 10% on your main balance. Once is gone, we are gonna to withdraw the money from the vault.Quote from: Stalker22 on September 14, 2023, 09:05:19 PMThe Vault feature is mainly for setting betting limits, imho.

He may just want to know where he can gamble while keeping his earnings to one side, so he can a better control over his gambling budget. It just takes a little bit of common sense and knowledge on how custodial wallets work, in order to realize the risks associated to them. So, if anyone just feels like using the vault feature to keep control over their expenses on a casino, then there is nothing wrong with using it.",

I have played in both the site, so I can recommend you the both. The main idea behind this banks or vault is to not bust the whole balance at once. You can keep a certain amount in vault and can gamble with the rest amount with high risk. This is a beneficial feature for the gamblers who used to bet all funds at once.",

In short, it is like a bank account. In the past many players create a 2nd account as their bank account and some sites started to create vault feature to fulfil what is needed by player. It was really useful when most gamblers play with bitcoin and when the transaction fee was so expensive. Instead of withdrawing their bitcoin and deposit it back to the casino which will cost them more money for the fee , they preferred to use their bank account (secondary account) by tipping feature and then they moved to the vault feature for the same reason. It can be said as \"soft-lock\" of your money so you will not lose all your balance because you store/save some of it in the vault.",
