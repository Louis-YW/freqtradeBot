But the choice of investing in Luna is very risky as the team seems to focus only on its wishes and ignores the actual voting of the community to burn the coins.",

Thanks again everyone for your input!A recovery is very unlikely, I know what you are thinking, if you were to invest in luna right now at a price of 0.00017 and it reached one dollar again that will be a growth close to 6000x, so even an investment as low as 100 dollars will give you massive profits, now if you are willing to take the risk and such an amount of money is nothing for you then you could take the risk, however I will strongly warn you about investing any significant amount of money in a project that is dying.",

Thanks again everyone for your input!No chance for the current token as it has trillions of supply but im not sure about the new token that will come soon. You must aware if the current token will be replaced with the new tokens that will be distributed at the end of this month. is not it better for you waiting for the new token to be launched rather than gambling on the current token that will be replaced by the new token soon? i have been reading the whole proposal about the fork of terra luna blockchain and it seems like too many manipulation on the vote. $1 was impossible rate even when you are waiting for the next decade",
