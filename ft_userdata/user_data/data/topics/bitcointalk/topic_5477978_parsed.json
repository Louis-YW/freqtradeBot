Although it's a pretty ranked website and it gets good traffic on monthly basis but it's better to be honest instead of using such words that aren't a part of reality. I've personally never used that exchange and it's the first time I'm hearing about it. Does anyone else used that exchange?",

      "body": "So you are basically trying to advertise your own exchange here on BTT by mentioning other exchanges, while you know Binance is no more reading crypto exchange because it has been restricted to work in more than 3 new countries which really raises concerns. And even if you are advertising your own exchange, I think you should hire a campaign manager for better advertising and do add proof of reserve on the coin market cap website. They will increase the authenticity and trust of your exchange among new users. By the way, I was not aware of this exchange before but they seem to have a good trading volume also. I just give a try to OKX exchange and it also works very fine but why it is hard to download, as we have to download the APK of this application from the official website.",

So far, I judge the ranking of an exchange based on its volume, and based on data from the coin marketcap website. Everyone knows about Coinmarketcap's credibility in determining rankings based on trading volume on an exchange.At least we know who the 4th exchange is occupied by? And once again, coinmarketcap lists this list based on trading volume on each exchange. And unfortunately the exchange that is said to be OP in 4th place is not included in the coinmarketcap list at all.",

About that two old crypto exchanges you mentioned. I don't know if they are still existing now, as I think I've heard a negative news about them last time. But If ever they are still alive, we also/still don't know if they will perform much better next year.About Binance, I think they are still here with us. It's a sign that they are doing their best to survive. Besides this wasn't the first attack they have received. That is how strong they are. I guess they will still take the lead next year. If ever they are closing down, they will still give an early warning, for their users to withdraw their funds. So, why worry?",
