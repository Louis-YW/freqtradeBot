Both parties have paid dearly for this war and they have suffered irreplaceable losses. But the main problem now would be the terms of peace. Would Ukraine be willing to cede its occupied territories to Russia or will the latter just withdraw peacefully? I think both parties should be willing to make sacrifices so that his negotiations would be fruitful. I don't think Ukraine would surrender because NATO has not shown any sign of support withdrawal.",

Sure, Biden has guaranteed to remain with Ukraine as long as it takes, but he might be out of the presidency in 2024. It seems that the US is already slowing down regarding its support for Ukraine.So, the question is, will Ukraine surrender to Russia the nest time it surrenders?",

Ukraine is moved from praying for Kyiv not to fall in early days of war to Ukraine recovering occupied territories now and hitting airbases deep in territory of Russia, far away from front line.BTW, I noticed that some spammers here started to spread agenda that Putin is showing his good will, ready to negotiate, but stubborn Zelensky is against it and he prefer to continue war.

All they want is to make it look like Russia is the aggressor.Does Russia want peace? Well, think about it. They gave freedom to a whole bunch of Satellite countries in 1991 so that there would be peace. While it's true that they fought skirmishes here and there since 1991, most of the time they were trying to act like the US. All they were doing were police actions here and there, just like the US has done in dozens of places around the world.Russia might have a few military bases in a few countries. But it is nothing like the number of military bases the US has around the world... just to maintain the peace, they say. Since the funding and armament of Ukraine is the real proof that Ukraine is a military base for the US, it is the US that doesn't want peace.Ukraine HAS already surrendered... to the United States. This is the reason why they are fighting in this Russian police action. It is US prompted and US promoted. Ukraine needs to clean out its corrupt government, bring back the millions of their people who have fled the war to other countries, and take a proper vote of all its people. If they did that, they would side with Russia long before they would side with the US.",
