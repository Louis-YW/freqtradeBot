  "content": "Hi, I read somewhere that every thing you do on electrum console is recorded and written to hard disk unencrypted. Is this TRUE?I want to generate legacy seed and only way to do that currently is using electrum console (make_seed function)So is it safe to generate say 24 words electrum seed using console and then use it? Am i at risk that my seed is written to the hard disk?",

You can simply open your wallet file using a text editor application and check what has been recorded. You will see your used commands under \"qt-console-history\" and you won't see the outputs.",

      "body": "It is worth mentioning that from Electrum version 4.0 the commands you enter in your console is no longer stored in a separate unencrypted file (called config). Instead they are stored as part of your wallet file and if your wallet file is already encrypted the command history would also be encrypted.Respective commit: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/commit/2b52ee26e64b56b364e9dc3ed2150fceef925e08",

      "body": "Still though, I would clear the console every time you generate a seed there just to protect you from, you know, ridiculously easy to carry out screenshot attacks initiated by malware. Airgapping your computer is not enough to make you fully safe from this -  I mean you can't just assume the system is constantly free of malware, unless the amount of Bitcoin you're storing in there does not warrant that amount of paranoia.",

You don't need internet connection for that. Quote from: BitMaxz on November 16, 2022, 11:47:39 PMOr needs internet because the command will send to servers/any nodes. Servers have no role in generating the seed phrase.  Quote from: BitMaxz on November 16, 2022, 11:47:39 PMJust want to confirm currently I have a broken PC can't confirm it but if it's allowed to generate seed offline through command then this is the safer one.Whether you want to generate the seed phrase through GUI or console, you can do that offline and it's not that generating the seed phrase using commands is safer.",
