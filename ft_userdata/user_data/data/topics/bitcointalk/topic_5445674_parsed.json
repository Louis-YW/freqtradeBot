CI coins tend to have these tarnishes after a while. Is it the capsules that come originally with them or something on the coin / minting process?I wouldn't even consider it an impairment, since it's so common with CIs.And, on a side note: Amazing collectible photography again.@Eclipse: Could you mabe create a video / slideshow with some of your photos? - Could be a cool way to show off crypto collectibles and maybe increase awareness / interest.",

It's also important to note that those types of tarnishes/toning don't necessarily downgrade a coin's grading either - Have seen many slightly toned CI's with fairly high grades from ICG myself.",
