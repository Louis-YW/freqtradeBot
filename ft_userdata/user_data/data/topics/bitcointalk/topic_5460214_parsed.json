Power Glitching2. Side Channel Attack3. Software attack4. Phishing Link attack To prevent from being hacked user have to create a strong password with upper case and lowercase characters and to add another layer protection have to add pin code. Also secret phrases should have a safest backup. I never used a ledger wallet before but shared from my little learning.",

I never used a ledger wallet before but shared from my little learning.Most importantly treats your ledger as a hardware wallet or offline wallet that it is. Do not store any of these back up keys, pins, phrases or seeds online or on PC, store them on a sheet of paper or as other members have suggested on washers. Many of the reported cases of those losing their funds on ledger are through user carelessness.",

Do it healthy and carefully, our devices will be clean and we are safe, our bitcoin will be safe as well.And don't buy used (second hand) Legder wallets. If you can not buy a complete new Ledger wallet, you can find alternative with free non custodial wallets and you can set up multisig wallets or cold wallets. It is safer than buying a second hand hardware wallet and use it with fear that you will lose your bitcoin.",

Let's say you receive a phishing email that deceives you to enter your recovery phrase, if you fall for it, the attackers will steal your assets, and a hardware wallet cannot save you in that situation.Hardware wallets can also be hacked if the physical device is stolen, but in that case if you have a strong password and passphrase you should be able to move your assets to a new wallet with your recovery phrase before any harm can possibly be done. Having said that, Ledger is a bad choice of a hardware wallet, your recovery phrase should be kept by just you, but Ledger in their new update have made it known that they can extract it and send it to third parties all in the name of spurious security; thus you had better choose another hardware wallet if you have intentions of buying one.",

It will surely manipulate the address when you try to send Bitcoin or any other crypto-asset or If you copy your wallet address to send it to someone, it will also be replaced.Other than that, If you are talking about attacks on Ledger itself, there are some of those possible however you would be pretty much fine if you don't allow third person to touch your device.",

Just kidding. but i mean the statement of anything is hackable because let's say you have a ledge Hardware wallet, which you wanted to update but you downloaded the latest version from a wrong website (or i would say from the hacker's website) then your ledger will be hacked. Or if you are connecting your ledger with a website, platform or any computer which has backdoor integrated by hackers. Then your ledge will be compromised too.Overall, until you will not allow hacker to get into your system, either it is down by intentions or unintentional but in both scenario Hackers will find a way to get into your ledger. So, best practice is to remain active and be aware of all the currently on going flaws, backdoors, hacks and scams in the market. Because once you knew those scams then you will be able to avoid from them. Just like a latest case recorded here in which OP opened his wallets after quite some time and did not catch with the latest information that the old version of Electrum had phishing links which will show messages to you to upgrade your Electrum by using their provided link and once you will do that your assets are gone. (that's quite sad because that person got scammed with 600 ponds i think) (Source .The point is, you have to keep an eye on all the news related to ledger and have to remain up-to-date with all the versions and information and what to do and what not to do points so that you could be able to save your assets and avoid hacking of your ledger too.",
