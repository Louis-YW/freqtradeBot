There’s a lot of good developer here on the technical board that can help you verify the code. There’s no way to verify it if you didn’t know how to read a code since you will need to determine how it was coded to verify if the code use is safe for user safety. I was wondering if there’s a specifi code line that a non-developer can use a reference to watch out if the code is safe or not.",

I don’t know if it’s practical but you could watch a few tutorials on how to work your way through compiling the files depending on the language to an .exe file.

You can use websites like https://walletscrutiny.com/ that is from a professional Bitcoin developer.Or some review websites like https://www.cryptowisser.com/wallets/",

Sample Electrum if you download it from GitHub or their website it also provides a GPG signature you can verify it by using the GPG tool.Technically the thing you are verifying using GPG signatures is the authenticity of the binary or in simple terms you make sure that the binary is released by the person who owns that key. It does NOT tell you whether the binary has anything to do with the open source code you saw on the GitHub.In order to know whether the binary is actually built from the source code you saw, the project has to support what's called \"deterministic builds\"[1]. This means no matter who compiles the code and where, they should all get the same exact binaries. That way different people could verify that the binary is indeed built from the source code we see by simply comparing the checksums.Electrum supports deterministic builds by the way.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds",

GPG or PGP or anything that we call a way to verify that we downloaded the right app and not the fake one is not a way to know that a software is open source or close source. Assuming I downloaded Electrum and verify its signature, I will know that Electrum site has not been compromised and that the wallet I downloaded from the Electrum site is from the Electrum developer. If Electrum site is compromised and the hacker that compromised it changed the original Electrum app to fake apps, I will be able to know that it is fake if the PGP signature fails.",

I also have doubts that a cryptocompany may provide completely different source code for testing on specialized resources, such as github. Also, it always seemed strange to me that if the source code is open, then someone necessarily checks this code. What if everyone hopes that the other will do it and in the end no one checks?  Do people have nothing better to do than check the source code of every application? In this case, I am ready to trust completely only myself, but I don't have the skills to independently check the source code of applications. So how can someone like me, who are the majority, check the source code and make sure that it is the right source code and not a fake? In general, I support OP’s questions.",

So how can someone like me, who are the majority, check the source code and make sure that it is the right source code and not a fake? In general, I support OP’s questions.The motivation of others to check an open source project is because they simply use or build something from the particular project, in consequence, they are encouraged to eventually check the code. Furthermore, the question arises about what if there isn't anyone even checking the code is a valid one, hence, open source does not mean it would be automatically secure and trusted. It is still necessary to use a project that has gained trust within the open source community, so there are many eyes that scrutinise the project in case something goes wrong. It also helps to those who can not manually check and comprehend the code by themselves.",

All you need to do is download the repository, and follow the instructions, which more or less go as following:Step 0: Have a compiler (i.e., gcc).Step 1: Install some libraries (the instructions will give you the precise command to enter in terminal).Step 2: Compile. Probably with some Makefile, which is essentially an automated way to build the program. Step 3: Verify the binaries' checksum (as you would in any case).  This way you can verify that the binaries the company has in their main page are indeed not altered.",

The one is to compile the code yourself. This involves the compiler converting the source code into machine code that can be executed by your computer, If you are able to compile the code successfully then you are confident that the code is authentic. The second one is a signature tool that verifies the integrity of open-source code. A signature tool can generate a digital signature for a piece of software. this digital signature can then be used to verify that the software has not been tampered with.",

Compiling the code by yourself and other ways may not be helpful for a day-to-day user who is not familiar with such things., so as above I had mentioned by reading the feedback and reviews, he can judge. Anyway, that was I nice topic for today's list haha I can read others and obtain some good insights as well.",

If you can't review the wallet code yourself, if no one that you trust has reviewed it, then it's not too different from a closed source.
