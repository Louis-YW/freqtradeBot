  "content": "I would have liked to put this subject to rest a long time ago, but since Royse777 doesn't stop crying and some people don't seem to know what happened, I'm going to create this post, as recommended by LoyceV, to use it as a reference.The summary of reasons is as follows:1) His involvement in the Bitlucy case.2) His dishonest way of acting by demanding people who left negative feedback to him to change the feedback and feeling entitled instead of being humble and keeping a low profile.3) His dishonest way of acting by hiding behind an alt in the Casino Critique case.4) His dishonest way of acting by covering up for naim027 scum.5) His dishonest way of acting in the recent case of being banned for ad spam, although this is of minor importance, but reaffirms his dishonesty. 1) His involvement in the Bitlucy case.I'll echo efialtis negative feedback:QuotePromoting and even being part of a shady crypto casino. Poor management, poor excuses with various withdrawal requests not having ever been executed for weeks.Reference: Bitlucy withdrawal problem, does this acceptable?Quote from: Poker Player on October 16, 2022, 05:08:00 AMRoyse777 was a person with a great reputation on the forum, unimpeachable until a few months ago. He started promoting Bitlucy casino, which at the beginning was advertised as Bitlucy777 in which he announced that he was going to be a partner.There began to be problems with withdrawals with what I smelled that it was going to be a scam. When we saw the problem, DireWolfM and I were the first to give Royse777 a red tag and igehh and I were the first to support Solosanz's flag in this regard.In the end, the worst suspicions were confirmed, Bitlucy was an exit scam. This in normal conditions would have meant a total destruction of Royse777's reputation if it were not for the fact that he was a person who has distributed a lot of money in signature campaigns and for wearing his avatars. In this, another DT and I have agreed talking about it by PM.When Royse777 gave explanations, many people who had red tagged or supported the flag started to withdraw the support, forgiving him because we understood that somehow he had been involved in the problem without bad intentions.2) His dishonest way of acting by demanding people who left negative feedback to him to change the feedback and feeling entitled instead of being humble and keeping a low profile.I am not going to back it up in links because it is scattered throughout the various threads in Reputation, but those who have followed the story know what happened. Simply instead of shutting his mouth and trying to regain his reputation with a low profile, Royse777 started to pick on those who had not changed the feedback from negative to neutral, especially yahoo62278 and JollyGood. With yahoo62278 he got him to change the feedback from negative to neutral, I think because he was annoying and not to have to hear him anymore, but if we see the feedback we will see that despite the neutral color it is clearly negative in spirit.Tell me if someone who doesn't know the story and doesn't care about color would make deals with Royse777 based on that feedback:QuoteCo partner of Bitlucy casino that ended up scamming participants. User is also very hotheaded and childishJollyGood was left for dead because Royse777's long whining was answered by even longer walls of text in response from JollyGood.Later he had the same attitude with me.3) His dishonest way of acting by hiding behind an alt in the Casino Critique case.After a short time, he planned a big project that would not only earn him a lot of money if it went well, but also help him to regain his reputation:[IBCO - suspended] ‚öΩüé∞ Casino Critique‚≠ê FREE Chip for BCT Members ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•I, and many, received an email like this:Quote from: Poker Player on October 17, 2022, 03:20:51 PMQuote from: Royse777 on September 08, 2022, 08:56:27 AMI hope you are doing great buddy! I am behind the project Casino Critique and forum account Casino Critique is my official account. Please keep it unpublished.Link of our ANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409868.0I would like to Gift you a Chip worth 0.001 BTC, which is on me. :-) It's under the clause:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409868.09. Team have the right to invite known gamblers, Bitcointalk members or ANYONE to this FREE gift promotion.Would you mind replaying with a BTC address so that I can add it for you?On the ANN thread you will be able to see more details including the Chip allocated for users on the spreadsheet.Cheers,PS: Feel free to reach out to me on my telegram for any question: @Royse777This is dishonest. Potential investors had a right to know who was behind that account. Then a newbie appeared, probably an alt, and when there were already suspicions, he created this thread:Royse777 is Casino CritiqueRoyse777 was slow to show up on the thread, but he did show up not to confirm it was true, but to throw his weight around and accuse JollyGood of using alts to harm his reputation.4) His dishonest way of acting by covering up for naim027 scum.Royse777 was, dishonestly, covering up for a person if you can call him that, who has repeatedly demonstrated no moral principles. And not only that, but that scum was his biggest alibi in the Bitlucy case.Quote from: Poker Player on October 15, 2022, 01:14:01 PMHello, I'm not sure if I post this here but I just noticed the issue about Naim027 and I can't comment on any of his locked threads. I am putting it here because of what I commented in a previous post, and it is somewhat related to the trust system. It turns out that today when I go to check my trust list, I see that AnotherAlt had removed me from his trust list, when I didn't realize that he had included me. When I saw in his ban appeal thread in meta that he said that a casino had scammed him by not paying him for being a moderator, I remember thinking: \"this guy is in trouble for everything he is involved in\".Now I see his confession, after having been caught, and I am stunned.....By the way, I have not even read what he says in his confession. He has no credibility whatsoever. Edit: After rereading the threads well, I think there is a second derivative of this, which yahoo62278 has brought to my attention.Royse777 knew that the person behind AnotherAlt was Naim027, who was ban evading.That at the very least is going to get him a neutral tag of negative spirit from me. And I think it's more likely to be a negative tag, and I don't care about those of you who hold Royse777 in high esteem.Quote from: Poker Player on October 16, 2022, 05:08:00 AMBut, and here comes the important part, what evidence do we have that Royse777 did not play a major role in Bitlucy(777)? Only two: his word and that of AnotherAlt, that is, that of naim027, Dic3L0v3r and Crypt0S0ul. Someone who has shown that he would sell his son to the devil in order to get money, who has cheated in every possible way.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403679.msg60500779#msg60500779QuoteI guess I can help a little bit.@Royse777, I want to be anonymous in this forum. After this post, Only you, bitlucy owner, and another guy from this forum will know who am I. Please don't reveal me.@yahoo62278 I was referred by a guy from this forum to Royse777. Bitlucy was looking for a Support Agent and I was looking for a job.Since there is a question raised about Royse777 being the owner of Bitlucy or not, I can confirm that it doesn't look to me that he is the owner.I was looking for a full conversation with Bitlucy owner and Royse777. But, I figured out either Royse777 or Bitlucy Owner Deleted the group and cleared the conversation. So I am unable to submit the full conversation. But, at that time, I took three screenshots to give to my current employer. 5) His dishonest way of acting in the recent case of being banned for ad spam, although this is of minor importance, but reaffirms his dishonesty. This point is not so important, but, again, we see that he knows he is doing something he should not be doing, and he does it:Quote from: Zwei on January 09, 2023, 07:12:23 PMJust to clear things up, I believe @Royse777 got temp banned for this PM since I was one of the ones who received it, this is for anyone whos wondering what the PM was.And thank goodness he didn't find out who reported him, otherwise he'd already be crying and opening threads against him.The bottom line is that he is a dishonest person and I personally wouldn't deal with him for $0.01. Does this mean that he will necessarily scam all the deals he does? No. In this life you are not either a completely honest person or a serial killer like Ted Bundy who took advantage of the kindness of women to kidnap, rape and kill them, there is a middle ground.I think that whoever makes deals with Royse777 has a certain risk of losing his money, that's why the negative feedback, although for example, I do not believe in the case of the campaings that he will manage them well and there will be no problem, but simply because it is more profitable for him, not because of his (dis)honesty. Bonus: boasts about employing naim027:Quote from: Royse777 on June 18, 2023, 05:46:59 AMQuote from: Poker Player on June 18, 2023, 05:05:16 AMAnd by the way, I forgot one thing. If I find out that in CasinoCritique is naim027 as a member of the team or someone who has 11 red tags, I will red tag the account. One bad apple spoils the basket. Explain why you brought naim027 in the discussion while I was giving a general view without specifying any of the accused account?Oh one thing you need to know.Naim027 works on updating my spreadsheets. One of the many team members in üíπüìà Bitcointalk Campaign Management üí™üî• Signature & BountySome roles that my team members play in the campaign management.ANN managementSpreadsheet checking Graphic DesigningTelegram moderationContent creationTranslationFor each of the jobs I have several people who work to ensure quality service, 24/7 customer service etc. One Naim027 is just a part of the 8 to 10 people who work all the time for campaign management.I am waiting for you to tag me now because I employed Naim027.Be my guest. Quote from: Poker Player on June 18, 2023, 05:39:47 AMWhoever is behind it as the person ultimately responsible must ensure that this does not happen, and if he lets it happen, he is allowing ban evading. And I don't care if the account is run as a commune or cooperative with no maximum responsible, they are as responsible as the individual person who is ban evading. Shut up!",

But I don't think it's abuse of the trust system, i.e. it doesn't really break any trust system rules or guidelines as far as I can see. Negative trust is for high risk, and PP stated as much in the feedback, and also created a thread to substantiate the claim (again, if you disagree with the facts/opinions/conclusions presented - that's a valid concern but I wouldn't call it abuse).As I said in the other thread, I think contacting Royse777's clients is not cool, but as far as trust system is concerned, I wouldn't call it abuse unless PP said something like \"if you do business with Royse777 I'll red-trust you\".I hope this is the last thread in the drama.",

Where is the evidence $6000 was paid by Royse777 and to whom was it paid. Is there any actual link to an actual post (rather than a link to a thread OP) that can be seen to show blockchain evidence?As far as I recall, the few complaints that were made in the forum did not any of the funds they were scammed out of. In one case an alleged threat was made against members involved in the Royse777/Bitlucy scam which was cited by Royse777 as an excuse to not pay losses even though she said she would pay out from her own pocket. Does anybody remember Royse777 wanting KYC from a victim before paying for their losses even though Bitlucy had already exit scammed?Quote from: Royse777 on January 13, 2023, 06:50:22 PMMy actions should speak for me, not the words.The problem is your words which come secondary to your actions. When you do not get your way you cannot even handle a decent debate without getting extremely agitated and aggressive. As English is not your first language it is clear that is part of the problem but that does not negate the aggression and petulance on your part.Quote from: Royse777 on January 13, 2023, 06:50:22 PMThank you poker player to give me the opportunity to leave an executive report of the work I do while you are busy spreading hate against me. See you some day seeking a position in one of my campaign.Such arrogance with an overinflated ego. Why could you not start the new year off with a change in attitude and be more approachable and respectful ¬†Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on January 13, 2023, 07:29:20 PMI don't 100% agree with negative feedback for Royse777 (though he was definitely evasive about his role in the Casino Critique case), but I don't think Poker Player leaving a neg or starting up this thread constitutes abuse, either. ¬†On the other hand, I think everyone who's already familiar with the issues he brought up has already made their judgement and justifying the negative feedback in this way is unnecessary.These are kind of old issues at this point, no?You are right if I read correctly, these are old issues but have now have a singular reference point compiled. Like you I do not see abuse here because a reference has been compiled.",

You are insane. Prove that, liar.I'm not going to have long discussions with you because arguing with you is almost the same as arguing with crybaby777, but what I will not tolerate is your blatant lying.Quote from: suchmoon on January 14, 2023, 05:34:22 AMAs I said in the other thread, I think contacting Royse777's clients is not cool, but as far as trust system is concerned, I wouldn't call it abuse unless PP said something like \"if you do business with Royse777 I'll red-trust you\".What? Do you mean crybaby777 is saying that I have been PMing his clients and telling them no to do business with him?Quote from: dkbit98 on January 13, 2023, 07:03:08 PMPoker Player you are calling Royse a crybaby but at the same time you are acting like a spoiled brat who is changing his trust feedback all the time, and you look like obsessed with Royse.If you weren't so biased, you would know that the changes were started by me softening the negative feedback, followed by your friend crying.Quote from: dkbit98 on January 13, 2023, 07:03:08 PMFrom all the scams and lost funds that happened recently (including another bounty manager recently) you only choose to target one person, so I have to say that looks very bias.False, you are a liar. For starters the other manager had a completely different attitude from the start. He has an inactive flag due to lack of support and only negative feedback. Nothing to do with your friend. I'm not going to put you on ignore at the moment to control what lies you tell about me, liar.Edit after unignoring Royse777 and reading the blatant lie he's told about me:I will post here the link to my demonstration that it is a lie that I am PMing anyone to tell them not to do business with crybaby777 and I have the content saved. If crybaby777 happens to delete the thread I will post the proof here.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434476.msg61610794#msg61610794By the way he got another negative feedback for that blatant lie. On top of that he has the nerve to say that if we wanted a screen recording. Yes, we want a screen recording, yes.If you don't like my second feedback you can distrust me, ignore me or whatever. I'm not going to change it. This person is not to be trusted and proves it every day.",

The good gesture to any peaceful coexistence is understanding each others differences and be willing/ready to make necessary adjustments. Being right in a contest of words with nothing else to hedge on could be such a difficult thing to archive when it's put in contest. Its always going going to have a direction to turn with any capped pinnacle and so, I'll suggest they both be wrong in there perception of long ago and current claims to move on. That feels like the more easier thing to do.I don't xoect my word to mean much here, like Suchmoon has stated, opinions don't significantly matter with all sides believing to have something to prove so, let the parties be wrong to be peaceful than be right and throw punches.",
