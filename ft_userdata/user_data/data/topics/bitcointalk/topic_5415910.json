  "content": "Websites like Coinmarketcap (owned by Binance) and many crypto exchanges give us the impression that all cryptocurrencies are the same thing, and that they can be \"ranked\". Some of these sites at least separate between \"currencies\" with their own blockchains and \"tokens\", some do not even that.But there are big differences between cryptocurrencies. Only Bitcoin and a few other altcoins can really be described as \"decentralized\", while about 99% of the rest are centralized.Most altcoins are businesses with \"providers\" and \"customers\", Bitcoin is notThe biggest centralizing factor is the premine. A premine from the start makes it clear that there is some entity, a person or a group (often called \"the team\" or \"the devs\") who are the \"owners\" or \"providers\" of the coin. They are responsible to conduct ICOs, giveaways, bounty campaigns and so on - which is easy for them as they have generated these coins for free. Development work may be significant in cases like Ethereum. But the relation is always pretty clearly one of a single \"provider\" or \"issuer\" (the team, devs, foundation etc.) and \"customers\" (the users).Compare that with Bitcoin, where no such \"owner\" group or \"team\" exists. There is of course a development team, but Bitcoin Core is simply the group who develops the most popular reference implementation. And it's perfectly possible that an alternative team eventually develops a more popular solution and becomes themselves the group who works on improvements of the \"protocol\", and that would be perfectly ok. In the case of centralized altcoins, in contrast, the \"owners\" can threaten alternative implementations with protocol changes with legal action (due to trademarks), or a fork and a dump of the coins of the alternative implementation (ETC case) due to their immense economic power.The development team, in the case of Bitcoin, thus is not a \"provider\", but simply one of many \"user\" groups, like miners, exchangers, Lightning channel operators, merchants and simple \"private\" users.I would argue even that the differences between these two kinds of cryptocurrencies are bigger than between distinct types of traditional financial products. The Bitcoin type is the only one that is fundamentally different from other products because there is no provider, no owner and also no issuer. All other financial products have clearly an \"issuer\".So even a possible \"flippening\", where a centralized coin like Ethereum achieves a higher market cap than Bitcoin, would be absolutely a non-event. Because it would simply mean that an asset of a completely different category is currently more \"valuable\".100% premined currencies and tokens should be viewed directly as securities or loans. This is not a stance of mine against these assets at all. I'm pretty positive about ICOs, security tokens, and utility tokens actually, they are a good opportunity for young businesses to raise money and should not be \"regulated to death\" (although they should offer customer protection). But they are a different thing than Bitcoin (and a few other coins like Monero, NMC or Groestlcoin). Coinmarketcap thus is worse than an infomational website mixing the \"market cap\" of shares, loans, derivatives and commodities together. Would a trader of traditional financial products accept that kind of site?Enough rant, what should be done?Exchanges and informational websites should help users to be able to separate the markets between Bitcoin and Bitcoin-style decentralized currencies, and centralized altcoins or tokens. So the users can actually know which kind of asset they are trading, and are not forced into thinking that \"all coins are the same thing\".At the very least they should be transparent about any significant** premine that happened. Coinmarketcap did this until 2016 or 2017 (I'm not sure about the exact date) but then decided to mix everything together. Among alternative sites of the same kind, neither Coingecko nor Coinpaprika seem to have such a categorization.Premine is an extremely easy to detect in the software as it can be always seen in the first block and in the part of the software creating the Genesis Block. The work has to be done only once per coin. So there is no excuse for not doing that.Ideally of course the operators of these sites and exchanges read this post and take action. But as this isn't exactly likely, also users can request and try to convince them to implement this simple change in their interface - in their Bitcointalk threads or chat/communication platforms. There may be reason they won't like that proposal, but I think it's worth a try *I would only include those coins in the decentralized \"Bitcoin category\" that have strictly no premine, ideally also no instamine, where at least part of the blocks is generated by PoW and similar \"open\" methods (in contrast to close/permissioned methods like PoS) and obviously an own blockchain.**A \"significant premine\" should be anything more than one single standard block reward. There are a few currencies with a few pre- or insta-mined \"test blocks\" like Litecoin; these could be included in the premined group or not.",

I think you and @hatshepsut93 make reference to the same problem:Quote from: hatshepsut93 on October 04, 2022, 11:49:47 PMThe whole crypto ecosystem is profiting from centralized coins, shitcoins, ICO scams, NFTs and all other useless products.That is true partly. I wrote already in the OP that ICOs can be a positive way to raise money, if it's clear for the potential customers which niche these ICO coins would cover. As long as these do not claim they're decentralized and \"the same thing\" than Bitcoin, and protect their customers, then I have absolutely no problem with that kind of tokens or coins. Same with NFTs, social tokens, et cetera.The crypto ecosystem could benefit from honest projects of this kind to the same extent or more than from scams. These projects can of course also allocate tokens for bounties and influencers. I write \"or more\" because once the scams were a thing of the past or at least \"crypto\" doesn't get associated anymore with scams, the potential number of customers would be much bigger. It could grow into a really massive market.The problem for me instead is when some coins claim they're a real Bitcoin competitor even if they clearly aren't, due to their centralized nature. Of course these projects want to ride the Bitcoin train, and exchanges can benefit from them. But the community as a whole I think is harmed by these projects.I'm not making a point for government regulation here*, but for community auto-regulation. And while I think it may be illusory that Coinmarketcap adheres to the proposed transparency criteria (i.e. clearly marking premines and coins where a big part of the nodes are operated by the \"founders\" or the \"team\"), alternative, more community-focused coin-ranking sites like CoinGecko should be able to provide real added value if they incorporate this feature in their sites. Almost everybody would benefit, minus the scammers.*In the EU and the US there are indeed projects planning to separate these two spheres, like the Markets in Crypto-Assets proposal (MiCa) which would require a mandatory whitepaper for all premined coins to be marketed in the EU.",

That's the point for me, and the reason why I think action should be taken. Centralized online currencies did exist up to 15 years before.What the exchanges/ranking sites are doing if they're equiparating centralized and decentralized currencies is, at the end, harming the whole market.

There are definitively incentives for the way exchanges are \"blurring\" the markets.

That's all. Coinmarketcap doesn't compare and rank blockchains.Coinmarketcap provides already some filters and tags. But, \"strangely\" premine/non-premined or centralized/decentralized isn't among them.I also already wrote that I've more hope that smaller ranking sites like Coingecko could introduce at least the \"premine\" filter. I've requested that here, but there was no reaction (I'm doubting they ever read that thread, so I maybe should go for another communication channel). These sites are more likely to be used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts which do care about the decentralization issue, and so they could benefit from such a filter more.Coinpaprika, a very small ranking site, has at least an item called \"organizational structure\", with the values \"centralized\", \"semi-centralized\" and \"decentralized\". But it's not possible to filter coins based on that attribute, afaik. (They even have a \"premine\" tag but it doesn't work at all.)Quote from: davis196 on October 05, 2022, 11:07:53 AMShould Bitcoin be divided from the centralized altcoins? This division definitely won't stop the endless comparisons between Bitcoin and the altcoins. I think that this is a pointless idea.It isn't that pointless if you read many articles in big media outlets after Ethereum's \"merge\". Many of them argumented in a way like: The world's second cryptocurrency changed to a \"green\" algorithm (PoS), when will Bitcoin follow?They ignore that Bitcoin is a completely different asset than ETH and has no \"staff\" which can \"order\" a transition to PoS (the Core team could \"propose\" such a transition, but it's unlikely everybody will follow). That's exactly the point I want to make. The \"blurring\" between centralized and decentralized cryptocurrencies affects the public opinion through this kind of media articles, and have influenced also the \"Bitcoin is a scam\" hipothesis which is very popular among non-Bitcoiners. A clearer separation between both would immensely benefit not only Bitcoin, but also other decentralized crypto projects and also honest centralized token projects.Quote from: Rikafip on October 05, 2022, 09:41:32 AMThe thing is, I don't think that an average user actually cares whether some cryptocurrency is centralized or not,This may be true, at least for a big part of the user demography which are only \"in crypto\" to make profit. However even this group could profit from a separation: as I mentioned above in the mid term a stricter regulation of centralized cryptocurrencies is likely in the EU and the US, two big markets. It's possible that it won't be possible to trade a big part of those assets in these locations in 2-3 years anymore on centralized exchanges, so they should care.",

How can Blockchain achieve its full potential this way?Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do since greed (money) goes above all else. Wall Street has invested deeply into crypto, so centralized \"shitcoins\" will keep \"pumping\" like there's no tomorrow. The newcomer into crypto thinks everything is decentralized, when in fact, it's not. The more people support centralized altcoins, the easier it'll be for governments to enforce regulations at will. Let's hope Bitcoin does the difference by keeping itself as decentralized and censorship-resistant as possible. Just my thoughts",

This concept is up to the mark. Thats where the separation comes for bitcoin and altcoins. On the other hand now I highly doubt if Satoshi ever imagined that his world will be messed up like this?",

Maybe in the case of exchanges they can try to separate them but this will only be useful to certain number of people (probably the well informed minds) but for the average Joe's who are the majority may not really care much about such details.",
