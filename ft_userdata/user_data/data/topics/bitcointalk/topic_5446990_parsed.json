It aims for people to enhance their basic knowledge in trading to familiarize to it. There's a lot of free websites online that could help you to deeply understand trading. Which is better since in online some of them is updated unlike in the book was published, it would be hard to keep on the trend. That's why some of the books teach the basics on trading.",

But if you want to become a professional trader, you must take the time to learn.Don't trade using leverage if you don't have enough experience, skills, and analytical skills because it can give you a bigger risk of losing. It's better to trade using spot trading and take profits little by little while continuing to learn. It would be better than trying to trade using leverage right away. And never trade in a state of emotion because it can affect your analysis. If you have made a profit, immediately withdraw it and don't wait long because the market can reverse direction soon, and you will lose that profit. And don't forget to use stop-losses to avoid bigger losses.",

In this vast universe of trading, endless opportunities await, though it's not a playground for the timid. A cocktail of determination, tenacity, and most importantly, profound self-comprehension is imperative. As you've pointed out, discipline is a cornerstone of trading triumphs. However, discipline in isolation is insufficient. Continuous introspection and self-improvement distinguish exceptional traders. From my perspective, journaling your trading adventures is a potent way to foster self-awareness. Document your musings, emotions, and insights about your trading escapades. You'll be astounded by the revelations about yourself and your trading strategy gleaned from these journal reflections. Plus, you might unexpectedly unearth a flair for penning amusing trading tales!",

To be a successful trader, you need to go through a lot with seriously reading various materials to guide you at first before you decide to put it into practice. Let's just keep in mind that if we don't do research, we will stay where we are, and everyone wants to improve their trading style to win more. Researching by reading various materials or watching videos tutorials can help us learn more information that we can put into practice.",
