  "content": "Hello ! I hope you are all wellI had a question, most likely someone has already commented or mentioned the topic but I haven't found anything.I have a text file with 1 million ethereum addresses 1 on each lineI would like to know if any of those addresses have had more than 1 transaction in the ETH BNB OR MATIC network or if any of the addresses have a balance greater than 0 in ETH BNB OR MATIC, whichever works faster I currently use the blockchain, moralis and ethscan API, but when checking 100,000 or 150,000 addresses, the script stops, and since it is not saved, I have to access the text file manually, select the last scanned line and delete from that line to the first to do not check the same addresses againI have also tried a code from javascript that checks the addresses here: https://blockscan.com/address/0x98f39d0f8c67885071cc99c5af1d4cacbcc89b0c?t=tx where does 0x98f39d0f8c67885071cc99c5af1d4cacbcc89b0c go try the ethereum.txt addressesIf the result is: Your search - {0} did not match any tx hash. - means that that address HAS 0 TRANSACTIONSIf the result is different, it means that that address has more than 1 transaction, that code also works correctly but since it is through http, every 1000 wallets checked you have to wait a minute to continue checking more and it is very slowAny help is appreciated!!PD: Excuse my English, I am from BCN (SPAIN) and I only speak Spanish and Catalan, so my English is translated",
