I guess theymos is the only programmer who wrote those customized codes since he was handed over the forum. Recently PowerGlove volunteered by coding some forum patches! PowerGlove always creates a thread and posts the sources in forum. So, there are open source as well. But, we don't know about the modifications made by theymos.Some times a website can get attacked due to it's poor coding, but I do not have proper knowledge to talk about it. Being a open source software helps other developers to check the vernabilities.",

There are many security bounties for the ones who can find vulnerabilities on this forum and the highest amount that a security tester can get is around $50k and if you or someone else who knows hacking very well can find those vulnerabilities then the person will be rewarded for his/her finding.Here's that page where you can learn about those bounties:https://bitcointalk.org/sbounties.php",

Even if I don't respond to suggestions, I do read them, and they float around in my mind going forward. If it's not already done, then there's some reason why. A big possible reason is that I'm the only person who does development on the current code, and my time is limited. Another big reason is that this is a huge forum with complex dynamics, and even small policy changes can have big effects which need to be thought through very carefully.",

Hackers can view the open source code and exploit the loopholes in the code to attack the forum.Open source is best when there are so many people interested in the project and its code. So, many developers will be working actively to monitor vulnerabilities and will like discover a bug before it will escalate. An open source code project where many people are not interested in the maintenance of the code is a time bomb waiting explosion. This is because, since not many people are interested in the project, bad players will have enough chances of exploiting the code and do their worse.
