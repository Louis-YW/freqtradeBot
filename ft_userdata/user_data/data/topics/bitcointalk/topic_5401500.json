Anything that does have some significant application and utility will really simply getting that kind of recognition in the community but not all does have the same utility or function yet there are even top coins in the market doesnt really able to follow up their roadmap which is epic fail but surprisinglythey are still getting sufficient support and engagement in the community but in overall i dont really see the relevance of it but lets just go along with the flow.",

If that's the case then they could have made a comeback in the last cycle's bullrun. I don't want any dead projects back. Why? Because they were dead for a good reason. Rebranding could work but only if people still remembers them. I doubt that would be the case fpr old projects since there are hundreds that pops out every day or every week.",

If you are seeing the market correctly and then when the project dead and there would be another project that is still exist in the market become a backup for the dead project. So, recycling the dead project will never work especially when it already tagged by majority of investors as scam project. This can't be called as modernizing the old project but i prefer to call that as an effort to revive the old project. That means if you wanna try to revive it",

I've known it since 2020 maybe it's not too late.I support any efforts in redeveloping developers, but I personally prefer a new project with a new whitepaper (if that's potential).",

Then there were many projects with good concepts but with bad intentions scammers were providing all necessary information to run the marketing, promised all their good tidying about the project without knowing their purposes after they hits the certain amounts they projected on its leads to automatically folding/shorting down websites either for no reason. Some could say website update or rebranding, they will locked their telegram group so none could be able to contact them or to question them for their actions. I could also remembered then lot of project refused to reveal their team members which was a very slim chance for them to succeed then. But today lot of projects presenting their faces on whitepapers with their media handle for authenticity attracting more investors, coupled with VCs (Voice Chats, Video Calls) gives them more strength than ever., all these features weren't there as well.",

One main reason is that there was never a solid business usecase from the start. Projects are building blockchains but they have no business customers, only users. This is one reason why I feel safe investing in HBAR and CNDL. HBAR has a couple dozen real enterprises on its governing council (like IBM and Google) and Candle Chain is engineered to host metaverses on top of it. Metaverses are going to be the next wave in crypto, and should pump massively when Facebook META releases its beta later this year.",
