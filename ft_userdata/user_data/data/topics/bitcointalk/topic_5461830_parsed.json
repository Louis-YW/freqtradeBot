Did you do research in which of the altcoins are good to invest nowadays here in the crypto space? Or your just feel lazy that's why your asking and made a post like this here? Because,  all things that we want to know now is very easy to find the answer.We already have a google search, social media platform such as youtube where some of the influencers giving a review about the crypto in which is the best for them to buy or to invest.",

The only risk in altcoin is price dump and that can only happen when you purchase the coin at its high price but for Pawswap, its price is low and its risk will be minimal with the tendency for the price to increase when there is a push on the market.",

People were also mostly using L2 blockchain caused by how expensive ethereum fees is right now. L2 was offering an alternative solution in using ethereum in the secondary blockchain which has better scalability. that makes the fees become very cheap compared with using ethereum native blockchain itself.",

Many of them are like made to be cash outlets of the developers and the investors will be left behind. It's an easy way for them to swindle the money of these innocent investors like you. That's why if it seems too interesting to get on hand with them, you just don't have to do that and focus with some other altcoins that you're researching about. Make sure that you don't just listen to anybody but at the same time you're doing your own research as that's much needed for someone like you who looks further to the market before the bull run.",

That's why always avoid investing in altcoins. Because most of them will have no value in the future. For me, the only altcoin I have invested in ETH. They are the pioneer in smart contract world and no one can beat them. So my portfolio contains only ETH and Bitcoin. No need for a third one to be honest.",

A best investment will be made which will keep you 100% safe and if the bull market comes back you will get a bag of best profits.",

If there is, please help convey it, because a lots of new altcoins was born every day.If it is altcoins that you are looking for then I think some of the big coins are the solution like ETH or maybe BNB but in this case I would like to suggest something else because if you really want to be more certain why not just be in bitcoin.Even though maybe in this case the return is smaller than with altcoins or most shitcoins that are always with their hype and pump and dump schemes but when talking about risk and feasibility of course bitcoin is still the first choice.IMO in this case bitcoin is the most feasible choice and must be prioritised after that just look for other alternatives that can support it like some of the altcoins I said earlier.",

The more stash you have the more profit you make than just holding 10ETH. Quantity matters because even a small increment in price can equate to huge wins.I believe that because of the high risk associated with altcoins it is very I hard to give out a guide as to what will make a good potential altcoin for investment and this is something that has indeed led many into investing in shitcoin thinking that their good coins and for that we have to take out extra effort to make personal research on any coin before we put our money down on them and as an investor you have to be able to weight the risk and know what you are in for. Dogecoin as you mentioned is good but I think Dogecoin has outlived its popularity in the market if you looking for a coin that could give real-time value then Dogecoin should come not in the top 3 of your portfolio but that is my own analysis.",

I think the most coin that good is ethereum as there are plenty of lsd platform that benefited on ethereum staking. Also theres chance for some airdrops from remarkable defi project by boosting on their tvl. Well if you are into defi then eth is the best you could utilize while holding. But there are many projects that have potential in my opinion that could make x10 or more in the coming bull run.",

Top coins like ETH, LTC and XRP can give you peach of mind in the next bull run, I prefer to hold more of this than to buy a new project that are still risky since they still have no market exposure.",

I will not give suggestions on the kind of coin you can likewise buy and keep for the bull run that is coming but I will like you to do research on your own so that you can make your financial decisions by yourself because the crypto market is very risky and anything can happen anytime so there is no 100% trusted coin in the market except for Bitcoin that is the brain behind cryptocurrency. There are so many coins in the market that you can buy and hold depending on what you want and how long it will take for the bull market to come to us.
