It is certainly better to focus that budget on improving SEO, in the worst case you will get approximately the same traffic, but this time it will be visitors who are really interested in the content of that website.",

Make your content attractive and meaningful, things like! What is the benefits of this website to subscribers? What do my content influence? Negative or positive impression, who are my target audience? Which social media should be advertise and partner with? These goods or service is this the right season for it? Who needed it most! And most important the lead topic has to be brief, unique and attractive e.g Donald Trump is in Lagos Nigeria.Or are you running ads? If not this things I mentioned matters a lot.",

And there are many tutorial videos on youtube, many articles and there are many webmaster forums which has latest news about SEO. We can give you a better idea if you specify your website (the link, software, target audience) clearly.Edit: Btw I have to add something on it.Seo isn't the only solution for increasing your web site traffic. First of all, you should determine your target audience very well and you should do a promotional work accordingly. Using Social Media and hashtags correctly will indirectly increase your website traffic eventually.Advertising your web site with Google Ads, Facebook, Twitter, İnstagram etc etc with small budget.   Finding niche platforms (web site, forums, social media accounts) and posting your services on there or collabration with that account  Organizing raffles etc.",

It can take years of hard work before you finally start to see a return on that effort. If you focus on your passion and there is a decent amount of interest in your field of work, then your passion should show through in your work and you should be able to generate solid amounts of traffic. If you're only building a website so that you can make money, then you won't likely get a whole lot of traffic because your motivations is backwards and people will be able to sense it from a poor user experience.
