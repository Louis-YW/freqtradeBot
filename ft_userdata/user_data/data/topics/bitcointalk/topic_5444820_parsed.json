  "content": "Good day everyone, I am here to share my testimony on how Bitcoin has favored me, I have been a Bitcoin investor for a couple of years now even before I joined this forum,  although I don't know much about Bitcoin I have been quite favored through bitcoin. This should be a word of motivation to all newbies and for those who have joined Bitcoin investment recently,  I have to enunciate that it endures patients and courage to succeed in any investment, I have to use the little profits I earned from bitcoin investment to renovate my one-bedroom apartment for me and my family so we all can be comfortable, my parents are aged and they all need good occupancy. I want to thank the founder of bitcoin and bitcoin talk forum for their good works and I UCHE6215 promise to spreads the good news from bitcoin to my carers,  it's been an honor to be in this forum",

Or maybe you are a long time investor who has held bitcoin for several years (at least during the covid19 season).But that doesn't mean it's wrong if you are forced to take losses for urgent reasons, especially for the benefit of your family. It even sounds more useful.",

That's a good news! Congratulations from renovating your house. It's a good move to use your profits little by little from bitcoin which shows how bitcoin could help people. I confess that I like your idea of spreading your experience here, because it has inspires me to establish some small business also using my profit from bitcoin. Whether a laundry  shop or a convenience store sounds good. A little income from this business would also help me to have some more investment in bitcoin. Keep up andutilize your profits to a good investments.",

Most young people in my country will use the money they made from Bitcoin to buy new clothes, shoes or chains. Others will even spend it on drugs or clubs. But you decide to use your proceed to uplift the life of your family. I want to encourage your to keep holding and only sell when the price is high. Bitcoiners are currently making small profits from the recent rise in the price of the coin. I am also grateful to Satoshi Nakamoto for discovering Bitcoin.
