What about bitcoin when there is no internet network?That idea is very interesting and addresses a potential challenge for Bitcoin and also other type of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin are like always relied on the internet for transaction verification and communication, there have been discussions and developments in creating offline solutions or alternative methods for transacting. These physical bitcoins or crypto tokens can take various forms such object that hold the cryptographic keys necessary to access the digital funds. Introducing physical representations introduces elements of centralization, counterfeiting risks, and potential security vulnerabilities.",

As people are trying to develop the core, the backers offline will be a game changer in my thought.Bitcoin is more decentralized then altcoins. There are always whales in either Bitcoin or altcoins but with Bitcoin, less centralized power from whales then with altcoins.Altcoins always have backers behind because they have to raise funds from community with ICO, IDO, IEO ... Those backers, venture capitals used to be considered as important indicator for quality and success of on altcoin project. In fact it is not true and collapses of Terra, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, FTX and more in the last two years are very good reminders and examples for altcoin investors that Backers don't bring guarantee to quality of one altcoin project.",

What about bitcoin when there is no internet network?Sadly there is no way to go round this. The idea of paper money will defeat some of the advantages of bitcoin and will just make it not different from the fiat currency. If you observe it is the printing of this paper money say excessively that has contributed to the devaluation of the fiat money and should bitcoin adopts this method then it will certainly loses the store of value asset that is. Also again paper money will require something like a bank where it is issued and this will certainly be done physically not minding the KYC protocol that would be involved and this process will certainly defeat the sole purpose of bitcoin which is total decentralization.

Also the bitcoin ATM is just a means to transact using bitcoin when you gadget is not around but who issues the card? More so the ATM somehow also reduces the total decentralization, because one need to use the ATM physically and this exposes the user.",

      "body": "I have been thinking about this a lot lately as well. I don't think there is any way to use bitcoin at scale without internet. You can do some stuff on lightning with a mesh network but that would still require electricity. You can rely on peer-to-peer marketplace with physical goods but once the number of social connections within a \"tribe\" or society is greater than Dunbar's number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number), you will need something to authenticate payments between 2 or more parties that do not know each other. I don't think that is possible at scale without bitcoin. I think the closest you can ever get to physical tender is something like an OpenDime or the new SatsCard which enables you to load a balance with a single on-chain transaction and then unload it with another single on-chain transaction and it can be transferred by hand a countless number of times as anonymously as cash. In the unfortunate event that the device is lost, stolen, destroyed, etc, the bitcoin on the device are considered burnt. I don't think there is any way for bitcoin to function as a global peer-to-peer electronic cash system without a global electronic information communication system; the internet.",

I think a better solution would be to have Bitcoin not have a single point of failure, like the internet in your scenario. Radio frequencies have been demonstrated to work to keep BTC going without the internet. Same with satellites.

Without the internet, all these won't be possible.  If this idea is created and implemented and not carefully monitored it could cause a high level of insecurities including double spending(when people spend the same Bitcoin note twice or more), counterfeit, scams and many other factors that can put Bitcoin at risk.

Thus, you cannot alter the fundamental rules governing cryptocurrencies. Regardless of the specific project you are considering, creating something like Bitcoin would make it centralized, which goes against its core principles. Given that the internet is rapidly expanding globally and we have become heavily reliant on internet connectivity, it is difficult to envision a world without it.

That's why bank release a card so that their clients can transact without any hassle if they want something especially during holidays. We can swipe our cards if we want to buy something and also there's atm machine if we need immediate cash.

I don't know how these codes could continue to run Bitcoin when you are dealing with physical notes. Although there are indeed loaded Bitcoin bills and coins, they are mostly collectibles. I think they won't work like the fiat cash that we have primarily because the issuer generates the private keys, and we have to trust them.
