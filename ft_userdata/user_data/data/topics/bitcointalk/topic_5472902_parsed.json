All not in English but let me quote this:Quote from: Charles-Tim on November 03, 2023, 09:01:45 AMThe new CBN governor said he would address the backlog of unpaid foreign exchange commitment. The Federal Government through the Central Bank of Nigeria, has commenced the payment and this is what stated to have been the reason for the recent increase in naira price. https://punchng.com/naira-gains-as-cbn-pays-banks-6-7bn-forex-backlog/https://www.legit.ng/business-economy/money/1561653-dollar-set-crash-n1000-cbn-finally-finds-solution-forex-challenges/superior.",

Lemme explain further; if a dollar is 750 in our Nigerian bank they will give to roadsides seller to sell at 1000 or 1200 then will return 750 to bank, then among the remaining balance is to be shared between themselves and also to pay those workers who sells at the roadside. Then those who trades on binance p2p uses the current price which is being traded on the Aboki trade (roadsides) to place on the exchange. So in my opinion Binance is not our problems the real case is that the government should stop playing politics over everything and for that bank managers needs to be questioned as well because it's a collective business.",

Is The P2P responsible for the massive surge in Naira to dollar rate? And I read that the CBN once call for the ban of Binance P2P because they believe its the reason why the Naira keeps losing value against the dollar, what do you think?I don't see anything wrong with Binance, and they don't have any negative impact on the high rate of the dollar to the naira. The thing is that the country has failed to implement a good working money policy, and they don't have a balanced economy. The high demand for the dollar is not just on the crypto market; it's also out there for those leaving the country and those who import goods into the country. Aside from Binance, Nigeria is now into real crypto trading and forex. They need to buy the dollar in order to use it and buy the currency of their choice. To reduce the price and rate of the dollar to naira is not about pumping in some of the countries reserve money into the forest market. How much do the countries think they will have to push in every month in order to sustain the market? The dollar demand is high, and any amount they push in will be exhausted; it's just a matter of time. What the country needs to do is be productive, give external investors reason to come and trade in the country, and make the demand for the naira increase. When foreigners have what they need from the country and they can only get such products by using the local currency for trade, the country's currency value will increase. The government's actions are similar to those of a crypto project with no good use case to attract good demand for its coin. When the liquidity provided by the project owners is exhausted and the coin is left to survive on its own, the price will crash.",

      "body": "Binance p2p is not considered a representation of the exchange rate, but rather a reflection of supply and demand. Therefore, we cannot judge the decline in the exchange rate, but rather it depends on demand and supply, as I remember in Venezuela the opposite happened, as the dollar/bitcoin price was higher than the official exchange rate, so that I bought Bitcoin in the local currency and sold it. At the same moment, Bitcoin and the dollar will make a profit, so whenever you find high demand and low supply, the exchange rate will be different and may change every hour.",

This is what many are saying after Naira dropped back to 900+ range since few days now, it looks like Binance P2P is where all the mess is coming from? Or it's not?It is big true because CBN can never dump USDT on any exchange, this drop of value of USDT you experienced on binance in last two days is not related to Binance only but is experience in all exchanges having the NGN/USDT trading pair. The reason why this is happening is because the Naira is gaining value against the traditional USD and this in turn is affecting the rate of USDT because USDT is said to be pegged 1:1 with the USD (although many disbelief this). So with USDT been pegged with USD anything that happens with it in the traditional market will affect the USDT. The reason why the Naira actually gained value a bit was according to reports that the Nigerian government had taken $10 billion to issue to banks so that there will be more availability of USD in the market (that’s like increasing liquidity) as they perceived that dollar hoarders (aboki Fx) have been the reason why the Naira has been losing ground against the Dollar. This report was what cause the FOMO.

I would have faulted the government but they own 90% of the banks in Nigeria, it is this banks that have actually hoarded the naira and sold them to black marketers as you have pointed out. I drew my conclusion on this since the government stop the apex bank from setting the rates for foreign exchange and allowing I&E to do that. If we all look at the this Naira Saga one will come to a conclusion that the fiat currency can be manipulated just anyhow to suit the whales or the government and this is why one needs to incline to holding bitcoin than all this fiat.",

You might also want to know what is happening on the Binance P2P platform is almost the same thing with the parallel market, they work similarly all the time, and there is no manipulation here.What is causing the current appreciation of the Naira is simply the reversal of the trend where consumer confidence is being rekindled towards the country. The CBN recently cleared the FX backlogs of $6.7 billion owed by paying banks the backlogs of the foreign-currency forward contracts. The USD/NGN market reacted so well to it and the rest is speculative in nature which has turned the market bearish since then.You might also want to read my response here.",

      "body": "The government of Nigeria and her financial institutions have been the greatest manipulators of the naira. The individual person's that are in the government deal with the dollar and as such they don't mind if the dollar gains more strength than the naira. On the issue that the government had always refused to take responsibility of the fall of naira. Nigerians will also recall that there was when the government accused Aboki FX as the cause of naira decline and they banned the FX and the naira continued to fall.Binance is an exchange that uses the rate of the black market, why is Binance p2p accused of manipulating the naira. It is laughable.",

I thought he is from Nigeria and since he is not from there then it is better keep the thread here in the general board. And one thing I will still add to what others have said, the NGN/USD in Binance is not the same with the Nigeria stock exchange price. I don't know if other people also noticed this. What I exchanged from the black marketers is different from the Binance rate. This days NGN/USD is having some conflicts that thy are drifting who will go down for the other. Last two days dollar was drastically going down but today it getting some appreciation.But let see what will happen in the next three months. According to some analyst the president might reduce NGN/USD exchange to 1 naira equal to 1 dollar but I don't think that can be possible in the country again.",

As far as I know, the Nigerian government does not have any power over Binance, and the price is subjected to pure speculation. If tomorrow the government of Nigeria decided to liquid a lot of USD for Naira in their own national system, it will certainly impact the price is the USDT in binance as well.",
