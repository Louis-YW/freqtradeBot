That is what really happening to most of the newbies out there. Either they end up quitting or they continue trading and become awakened traders because of their past mistakes and losses that made them stronger as traders. Also, for those who really want to chase over their losses, they don’t have choice actually but to change their mindset and adopt new skills and working strategies that will make them successful and profitable in the future.",

Traders should aim for profits and not the other way around. So if they see they are in constant losses, that will make them think that there’s something wrong with how they trade. And that will serve as their eye opener that trading is always hard especially if they trade blindly. If they want to make profits and prosper in trading, the best way is to change their trading approach, and resort into being awakened traders that are now more capable to attract more profits and trading success.",

It is because according to your explanation this trader you are talking about is very clear gambler who is willing to take riks in it. A true trader is not like that, if you buy at a high price and then sell at a low price, that is not called a trader. Unless it falls by 30$ from its 100$ price, then I can say that you can sell it at a loss because we don't know when it will recover to its original value.Because they may only think of themselves as traders but the only basis is just a guess or just let it be, you are called a gambler then.",

I used \"profitable\" instead of professional because I believe profitable traders last longer in the business than professional traders. Both make money but one outlasts the other in the business. I've read about certain professional traders who later got wrecked. Sometimes professional traders get carried away by their wins and become too arrogant and mindless of their trading plans. Once that happens, it often leads to burnt or wrecked account. Again, we've to remember that it's not true that there aren't traders who make a living solely from their trades and depend on doing some other businesses. There are traders like that, only that the number is infinitesimal.",

So, regardless of your efforts on studying the market sentiment, you will become a 'blind trader'. These days, every market is controlled by whales and you cannot escape unless you keep your targets and stoploss small. It means you may get chances to make profit within the manipulations but not per your analysis.In my experiences, no trader can remain as awakened trader all the times but can escape from not being a blind trader by understanding the patterns of whales' manipulations. I mean these days we need another kind of analysis to spot out whales' actions to secure out status of being a profitable trader.",

They are people who are willing to learn to know everything there is to know in trading. Of course they won't be 100% right either, but it is traders like that who will become highly skilled traders in the future. As said they know when they have to do something. Meanwhile, traders who only guess and guess where the price will go, I prefer to call them gamblers, because every trader must have knowledge about it. The reason is, if you just guess, everyone can do it very easily, and the results will be correct if they are lucky, and lose if their guess is wrong.",

If a trader is making money from trading, there are some things that will come his mind by that time.Well, as a teacher I like to tell my students all there's to what I'm teaching them. I let them know the facts from the beginning and not hide anything from them. If I know of a trader I can cite as an example who is earning well at the time I'm teaching them I don't think it's good not to let them know of it. For me, it's a no holds barred situation when it comes to knowledge. So, are you saying newbie traders shouldn't be told that there are traders who live on trading because you don't want them to start thinking they too can achieve that height that early? I believe not laying it bare will even limit the potentials of the newbie traders.",

It is the state of blindness that will make you want to wake up from your mistakes. A scenario of a blind person seeking for sight is handy here. If you are blind, you will wish that you get sight so we won't leave out passion here. Your passion is a contributing factor that will keep you going but if you lack passion then a blind trader will one day give up just like every other endeavour in life.",

He did not actual study the fundamental or technical analysis but proceeds with his own thought-out strategy which is purely based on coincidences or fake analysis from influencers who pretend they know how to trade.Myself, I studied as much as I could and continue to study to this day. But really, its not something you can learn but something you have to also experience in order to learn. Which explains why I lost so much money trading as a newbie. But now I see that lost money as education fees. I would say that its definitely better to learn this stuff from a reputable source.",
