  "content": "Hey Everybody! I would like to introduce a new cryptocurrency I recently released called Softnote. All the code is ready for download at https://github.com/softnote?tab=repositories The full coin parameters and specifications can be found at http://www.softnote.org/faq.htmlThe key features that make Softnote a unique and useful cryptocurrency are that SoftNote has a 3 megabyte non-segwit block size and a 12 megabyte segwit blocksize, a 90,070,000 maximum coin limit and a reward halving interval of ~9 years.SoftNote also utilizes arbitrary data insertion into its blockchain to provide NFT/Smart Contract capability using the techniques shown here: https://digitalcommons.augustana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=cscfacultySoftNote also allows low-difficulty blocks if its been 70 minutes and a block has not been mined. Anyone with a laptop or desktop CPU can mine these low difficulty blocks for basically no effort or resources at all. I included a bash script that is compatible with all platforms that will wait until a low-difficulty block is allowed to start mining, then stop mining once a block has been found, then start mining again when another low-difficulty block is allowed. You can see a video on how to use that script here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Tw06foQVoThe block sizes may seem large but it really only amounts to sustained 1 minute of 25 mbps for a usual block and 75mbps for a rare large block which most developed world internet connections can handle. SoftNote block sizes provide ~7 transactions per second utilizing only low difficulty blocks and ~47 transactions per second while mining competitively at the current difficulty. Softnote uses Segwit3x based on its block size and also has taproot enabled.As you will see on https://github.com/softnote?tab=repositories SoftNote also comes included with a state of the art blockchan explorer, an electrum wallet adaptation and an electrum server adaptation.Instructions on how to use all the software, including instructions on how to CPU mine are all on the SoftNote youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlaF61ohMD8ofLA-_VpQ3g.Happy mining!www.softnote.orghttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlaF61ohMD8ofLA-_VpQ3ghttps://twitter.com/SoftNote_Cryptohttps://www.tiktok.com/@softnote_crypto",
