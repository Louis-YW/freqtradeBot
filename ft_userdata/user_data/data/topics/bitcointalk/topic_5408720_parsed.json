  "content": "Are you important enough to have Theymos and forum members close to him comment on your threads (or quote your posts) to have positive conversations with you? Well, that happened to me in the past and it gives me great joy considering how humble they were to then nobody. I often check out his/their comments & posts back then and I see alot of intelligent contributions I have seen no where else. I used to be regular visitor of Sci/Tech forums/platforms long before I knew Bitcoin/crypto and the conversations/brilliance compared to those from top members of this forum esp the one in charge of the forum is less awesome. I believe you can find potential World Leaders from forum superiors here. They seem to understand what people from different countries want and they approached it in relatively humane manner. Alot of times I ask our CREATOR to please not to harm them when I feel wronged because they have been so awesome... Which is part of my contributions/efforts in keeping the forum great. Do you think it's easy to understand and manage people from different countries all over the world? It's not! You have to be really careful and right at judging alot of cultures and mindset to help keep the forum great, despite the hugh differences in ways of life of people coming here. GOD Bless and have mercy on them, and bless their hearts to do right, for It's not easy.  I hope everyone do what is right always to lessen the burden for them, and perhaps you will be visited to have good/positive conversations with them. I think my conversations with one or few of them were in my early days, about development of cities floating on water, using finger print for biometric on decentralized/crypto space to prevent to prevent people from cheating, doing something about corruption (I think that was part of my conversation with Mprep or Achow... Theymos was probably about floating cites and fingerprint biometric which he discouraged me due its flaws) etc . Hope they understand me and know I care alot about them. People who contribute something positive/good in Bitcoin space please me alot. They need to know i understand them alot and pray/\"fight\" for them every single day. Grace to you.",

This topic is not a good one and it is like a spam.Eh, I don't know about that.  A lot of you know that I've offered (and still offer) post reviews on a monthly basis to any member of the community under Legendary rank and without enough merits to reach that rank already.  I always say just send me a PM requesting a post history review, and I'll be more than happy to do it.You wouldn't believe how many members have phrased their PMs to me like I'm some kind of forum diety...!  They think that because I've been around for years and have that coveted Legendary rank that I'm something other than a regular guy who treats newer members just like peers (assuming they're not scamming/spamming/account-selling jackasses or idiots who want red trust removed when there's no basis to do so).  So you'd better believe that when a lot of members have personal interactions with Theymos--who was around during the days of Satoshi--they figuratively piss in their pants as if they got a phone call from Chris Pratt [or pick your celebrity].  So anyway, how important am I to bitcointalk?  Not very.  99.5% of members are more helpful, knowledgeable, and smarter than me, and I'm probably underestimating that percentage so as not to go to bed tonight with my ego deflated like a used sex doll.  I'm not humblebragging *edit: fishing for a compliment, I mean*, either.  If I just disappeared tomorrow, I doubt there'd be much notice at all.",

You are humble, mate.  I can probably say that I am an useful user on this forum. I don't have as many contributions here than most other contributors, they are more knowledgeable, experienced and have a great contribution to the forum. But I think I should be a little more confident to say that I am here to help, but I don't feel that I am important in this forum, but otherwise, this forum is important for me to learn a lot of things especially about bitcoin.",

For example you are proposing a new board or maybe your proposal is important to get attention, then maybe you can hope they will appear in that thread. But you can't expect them to be eager to reply or quote the posts of thousands of spammers on forum just to be seen as friendly.This forum is moderated by both admin and staff, but for things that are not important then I don't think they will respond. Look how much drama there is on the forum, they ignore it and probably prefer to be silent instead of saying something. So this has to be seen on a case by case basis, no generalizations.",

Again, you scored high here. Your charisma and audacity projects you as a demi-god to people who haven't approached you or who has intentions to cheat or scam. But any newbie who has the opportunity to interact with you personally will attest that you treat newer members like peers and always willing to help newbies grow by advicing and handing out merits to deserving posts.Quote from: The Pharmacist on August 04, 2022, 06:49:32 PMSo anyway, how important am I to bitcointalk?... If I just disappeared tomorrow, I doubt there'd be much notice at all.If you disappear tomorrow, bitcointalk might forget you, but there are individuals who will not forget you for goodness or maybe otherwise. But then, when you disappear, your case would exactly be like that of Lauda and Vod. I didn't meet them but I heard much about them. So, next-generation would remember you. Myself and the likes of Lovesmayfamilis would surely miss you and she will likely create a thread in reputation for you. She did it for Nutildah",

For someone to recognize themselves as an important person?The strongest people are usually quiet and modest, they do not need to shout and exaggerate their strength, which is not the case by looking at your trust.First, a person must respect himself, namely respect, and not seem respected. People see sincerity, a desire to help someone disinterestedly, and it is because of this that a person becomes important, as you put it, or rather useful.

Community is composed of different types of people such as dumb, normal, clever and other personalities. This what makes the forum balance. Without dumb there will be no smart people and vice versa.
