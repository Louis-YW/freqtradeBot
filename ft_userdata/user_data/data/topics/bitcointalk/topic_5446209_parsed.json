If I have any chance to win such amount then I am certainly investing it into my business to allow it to grow or even expand to other businesses. Taking the money into gambling again is just like returning it back to the owner without any hope of getting it back. But with it in business one is guaranteed a constant flow of income",

Holy f*ck.This story is as scary as funny at the same time,it shows our nature,deep in our roots is the insatiable desire of greed to have more and more and people will find all means to get what they want.This is I think one of the rare cases where people of religion deceive so openly,I know all of them or almost all of them do deceive people and nowadays I am pretty sure no one feels the call of God anymore and that is worrying.I go to church on Sundays and I believe God but I do not believe much the priests and rabins or imams for that other religion,it shows they are all in for the money.As this decision I think this shows how grave the case was and that this pastor deserve to be in prison for sometime after deceiving so many people for so long,I know no one forced the believers to go to this specific church but this consists of a crime,the crime of cheating and scamming people.I would not quit my job but I would invest that money in a lot of crypto rigs,buy crypto,stake them and earn passive income,that is my dream,first and foremost but no I would not quit even if I won that amount.",

But on the case of that fake pastor, it’s really reasonable to quit and close the church so he can stop from his wrong doings. Maybe a big win from gambling could offer him a lot of help so he can establish a legal business that will generate him good amount of income so he can provide for his family.",

This is why more fake pastors seen around.I do agree that being a priest and a pastor has a lot of differences. Also, before becoming a priest, that person is given the chance to live outside the church to determine if priesthood is really his calling.Whereas, you can be a pastor with little effort on your side. Maybe, just deceive even yourself that you want to preach and know something about your holy book.And one example is the OP's story, I believe that pastor had difficulty in moving forward to be a pastor once he got such money.Because if he doesn't have that amount, he can always be a pastor and live not in hunger, because he can always get something from church people.",

Because people believed him. Faith can never be earned by money. Faith is created by giving love. And that love is ended by this priest in an instant due to greed. And he should be severely punished for this crime of cheating so that no one dares to commit such cheating on religion.Quote from: swogerino on March 24, 2023, 08:59:02 PMI would not quit my job but I would invest that money in a lot of crypto rigs,buy crypto,stake them and earn passive income,that is my dream,first and foremost but no I would not quit even if I won that amount.In this situation I can never be deprived of people's love. If I had this same amount of money, I would use that money for investment. Or I used to trade in trading with this equivalent amount of money. Especially in the current market position if you can buy and trade five bitcoins from there and profit $5000-$10000 per trade. So if I had this same amount of money I would do this.",

Although this hasn't been the first time we see evangelists doing weird shit, even saw a news back in 2018 of some African Pastor using people as his stepping stone literally because \"he's so holy that he can't be stepping on unholy ground\", and of course, the Jonestown Massacre incidnet.
