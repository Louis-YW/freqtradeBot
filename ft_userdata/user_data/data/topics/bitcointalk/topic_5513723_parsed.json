Analyst Tuur Demeester warns that the report’s negative portrayal of Bitcoin could justify harsh ECB Bitcoin regulation, including potential bans. The recent European Central Bank paper, “Distributional Consequences of Bitcoin,” has undoubtedly created controversy among most cryptocurrency advocates.Demeester thinks this is the most aggressive attitude toward Bitcoin central authorities showed. For him, it is a kind of “declaration of war”. The framing could open the door to restrictive legislation, such as severe taxes or outright bans on Bitcoin ownership.ECB Bitcoin Ban Possible, Analyst Cites ‘Luddite’ Argumentnews link: https://coingape.com/is-ecb-preparing-to-ban-bitcoin-top-analyst-warns-of-harsh-taxes-crackdown/",

That doesn't make any sense in any universe. How is it unfair if someone bought or mined Bitcoins years ago and now became a millionaire or billionaire? If that's the case, then what about those people who want to buy the house but can't because of unaffordable housing prices? Early real estate investors got houses for a few bucks and today it's impossible to even buy a small studio apartment. They might even say that it's unfair how senior software developers earn 6 figures because they are early adopters of programming languages  This is insane.I think they won't ban Bitcoin. First of all, this argument doesn't make sense and second of all, why should they ban it? It will be a huge step backward. EU needs advancement in IT technologies. I hope they won't do that, especially when even the USA accepted Bitcoin Spot ETFs.",

From its part, the European Central Bank underlined the risks of energy-intensive mining processes involved in the production of Bitcoin and the volatility of its price, which-as far as they are concerned-makes it unreliable as a store of value.That said, outright bans in the near term do not appear likely. It would seem that more will be done to regulate Bitcoin's role within the EU, with the ECB still considering its implication on energy security and financial crime, some speculate possible restrictions by 2025. If tougher regulation does come along the way, Bitcoin has shown it can survive some amount of crackdown from regulators in the past, and all this may mean enhanced oversight rather than a blanket ban. Not everyone has the same story to tell of Bitcoin's failure as a form of currency, seeing how it is being integrated into the mainstream with ETFs and institutional acceptance.",

It reminds me a bit of the communist era, when the communists always fought against internal and external enemies, even if they had no one to fight against because they had already either killed everyone or locked them in prison.I think that the ECB basically just wants to suppress BTC as a currency as much as possible, while trading is not too much of a problem. This is something that exists in countries such as Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and some say Nigeria, and it will obviously spread more and more around the world - because \"they\" are most afraid of what Bitcoin represents as a decentralized currency, but trading with it and taxation it is not something they are against.",
