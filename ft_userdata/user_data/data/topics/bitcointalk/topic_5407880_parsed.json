  "content": "For the three months ended in June, Meta (FB), the parent company of Facebook, reported sales of $28.8 billion, a 1% decrease from the corresponding quarter in the prior year and its first year-over-year revenue reduction since going public in 2012.The company's profit decreased even further. A significant contrast to the previous year, when its earnings more than doubled, was the net income for the quarter, which fell 36% year over year to close to $6.7 billion. The average price per ad dropped by 14 percent year over year according to Meta, which is concerning given the weakening demand for internet advertising brought on by the recent economic crisis.According to a Reuters article, Zuckerberg told staff in a Q&A that \"this might be one of the biggest downturns that we've seen in recent history\" when he announced earlier this month that the business will reduce plans to hire engineers by at least 30% this year. The company said in its earnings release on Wednesday that it had \"continued to concentrate resources toward our company priorities while reducing our recruiting and total spending growth expectations this year to account for the more challenging operating environment.\"Following the earnings report, Investing.com  senior analyst Jesse Cohen wrote in an investor note that \"the social media company faces several challenges in the months ahead, primarily a slowdown in revenue growth due to reduced ad spending, as well as a lack of innovation and introduction of new user-friendly features.\" Investors \"need to worry about the negative impact of prospective regulatory moves by the U.S. government,\" according to Cohen, in addition to the other factors.Also, on the call, Zuckerberg also discussed the company's decision to increase the proportion of suggested posts that Facebook and Instagram users see in their feeds as opposed to posts from accounts they follow. Zuckerberg has described this as turning the company into a \"discovery engine.\" This week, when a post urging users to \"Make Instagram Instagram again\" went viral and was reposted by Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, user backlash to such changes on Instagram reached a fever pitch.https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/27/tech/meta-q2-earnings/index.htmlHow does mark plan to maintain Mata as a social media platform and a search engine all at the same time?",

      "body": "The reduction of hiring new engineers is a big sum with that 30% for this year and we can say that there's an impact from the current global recession that we're experiencing since Meta has that decrease of 1% which is already big to consider for such companies.I thought that companies like Meta are exempted from the global crisis including the pandemic that we're experiencing since they're tech companies. But it seems that it's not just the timing but they really are facing challenges that would impact the whole thing.Isn't it that they also have that plans about NFT related stuff?",

Millions of NFT aficionados who use social media may be excited by the news, but all of the projects are still in their early stages and may change as a result.The truth is that Potential earnings in the NFT sector are become increasingly difficult to ignore. Even conventional brands are expected to enter the NFT sector and look into ways to profit there, according to businesses. Its really not surprising that Leading NFT marketplace Open Sea just exceeded the $3.5 billion barrier for monthly transaction volume, and this only indicates that simply within the platform, NFT trading costs more than $169 million each day. NFT market sales tracking data also indicates that there have been $25 billion in total sales to date.https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-reportedly-plans-to-integrate-nfts-on-facebook-and-instagram-profilesI actually think this plan is a better one.",

It doesn't seem that the team from FB had a clear goal for this (I could be wrong tho), but rather to take advantage of the situation and be the first in a space that had pretty low to no competition. And kinda thought they would find their way and concept along the way. It seems they were so sure of their idea that they thought that would be enough for now.",

It's connected to Trump & Russia issues which it judged poorly. Poor judgment = Â sign of getting de-ranked or demoted in human affairs.. . Only a few understand this. Justice is constantly served from above , whether humans judge right or not.When you realize we are being watched by Higher Beings (not aliens) who own this world, like people watch television you will never remain thesame.A big sign you were demoted = Your power to control things is diminished",

Â where the users can then with their rented space and built 'shopping mall'(3d webstore), offer 'store shelving space' and wall advertising space to not only sell goods(real world physically then dropped shipped to peoples real homes) displayed in the webstore, but get better deals on the wholesale price of dropshipped goods displayed, via by production location priority/product placement and such within the mall spacehowever by meta(FB) just wanting to sell server space. they did not concentrate much on the 3d design and tools to build online properties on/within. instead they done cartoony animation style childish stuff.. and as such they are not ahead of the curve in respect of NFT possibilities. becasue no one wants to buy childish 'zones' if they want to start a real professional businessinstead its just become a gimmick of purchasing server space in a visual world that just no longer looks like a white page webbrower index.html file. ..rather than building actual cities and landscapes to then build and sell professional grown up online city space such as webstores and shopping malls and such, which is where the real money isQuoteHow does mark plan to maintain Mata as a social media platform and a search engine all at the same time?he isnt making a search engine.he is calling some tweaks to the display of posts, feeds, adverts, followers a \"discovery engine\"it is basically saying that his algo will more intensely review what you click on, look at, and write in their platforms. and then advertise more suggested posts that fit your pleasures/interests more so than let you just see what your friends are upto. its not a case of you typing into a search box. its more of just plastering the platform page with things it thinks you would like to see that you may not exactly have seen before but are in your interest.",

And that's not even their final form.Â  I think facebook (meta) is failing to align their business model with their strengths. Search engines have spiders and crawlers which visit most websites and index the data accordingly to make it searchable for end users. I think this is where their focus of search engines should be. Capitalizing on that capability. To deliver better targeted content to users. Rather than give them what they're searching. Serve up content they didn't know they wanted. In that the crawling and spider capability of search engines is underutilized.1% loss on revenue is better than expected performance from facebook. Mark Zuckenberg may be better at his job than he's been given credit for being. There have been past years when AMD and other tech laid off a good percentage of their engineering force. Its a recoverable trend. Hopefully, it will pass and be replaced by more positive trends in the future.Many corporations have billions in capital. Maybe they can re-allocate to growing food and becoming farmers if the price of food continues to rise. There would have to be expanding profit margins in the industry, they could leverage.",
