As with almost everything in life, learning is usually the first step before you can even put what you learn into practice (after building a solid KnowledgeBase that is).The forum has a gold mine of knowledge which is what made it standout to me vs other forums I visited at the time. Came researching researching about TBC: The Billion Coin but I stayed for the potential learning impact and it was one of the best decisions I've made in life.Btw, Goodluck on your journey.",

Everybody in the forum learn one thing to the other and nobody is an expert here because nobody knows everything in the world.

There is knowledge here, very large and beautiful but you have to dedicate your time and effort to accomplish it and if you understand how they are been written, and can translate them for newbies, having merit will be easy task to accomplish.I also learn that knowledge is not a proof by rank, you can be a newbie and you can still school lots of people who need the knowledge and merit will come from the people that will appreciate your work.",
