      "body": "I've seen this idea but haven't seen the actual application of it. Well, good luck finding the right people because if ever this becomes big, you'll be one of the games that will be played by most players that are into enjoyment and at the same time likes to earn some.I assume it's a P2E concept. But if no, still not that a problem if this is going to be for enjoyment and all of the goods are just for the in-game economy since everyone can still earn through that business model as that's the usual game economy that I've been with.Aside from posting here, look for other communities like in reddit and freelancing websites.",
