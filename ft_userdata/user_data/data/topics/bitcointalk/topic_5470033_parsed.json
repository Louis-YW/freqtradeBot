Â The Otoh collection...I wonder how many more of these in his other collection Â Â  Thanks for sharing this with us...should be interesting!Absolutely! I know the announcement has been due for a while now, and I didn't see any thread with the official announcement so I took the liberty of sharing with the group. I am very pleased with NGC finally grading crypto! Now if they could just make the service public on all other outlets, NGC IG, Emails, Website, etc. I have to hand it to Otoh, like 250 Cass coins has to be just a small fraction of his collection. Definitely well played!! Its always good to cash out at some point in this case he has done us a huge favor getting with NGC who has been so stubborn to grade these coins in this space for so long. Otoh has done this at such a great time and for the good of the community, I hope he makes a killing on this!",

IDK. Never been a mainstream online auction house-follower either, so there is that as well. Now that I look deeper, I may contact them about a rare 1969 set of sterling dinnerware that my parents received at their wedding and was never used or opened, so in great shape box and all.

That is a bit much, but I guess it's understandable considering the risk factors. Then again, Id' probably need a deposit of that much in some $ or proof thereof even to participate anyhow, amirite?",

Currently looking at the credit app and the requirements and it is borderline an \"anal probe\" about 2 feet inside. lol. along with $5k deposit bank wire they want a letter signed by bank like a power of attorneyÂ  that allows the bank to release all banking account info showing current balances and such to the auction house. along with a resellers tax ID and a personal guarantee. As a long time business owner the only time I have seen more credit verification needed from myself was when I was trying to get a loan on a commercial piece of property, its almost that deep of a dive. I will continue to keep you all posted on my experience if you like.",
