  "content": "Hello, I want to sell my handbike. I bought it like 2 years ago from second hand for 5 400 € (First owner paid 6 800€ (ONLY FOR BIKE,  not wheelchair). It’s specialized bike for disabled people like me. I can’t move with legs, so every move on this bike is thanks to hands – thats why it’s called handbike.  I was excited to buy this handbike since I couldn’t walk anymore because of Scoliosis and surgery failure when doctor interrupted my spinal cord. But now, anyway, I need to accept my health status and definitly can’t use it anymore, because I’ve got this year accident in gym and I broke my leg :/ I’ve got surgery because of that and actually this problem make me unable to use it like before. :/ Yes, someone can ask why leg problem make me unable to use bike when I need use only hands. But its more complicated, because of spasms etc. And while I’m using it, I don‘t feel so comfortable.. I have now  other planes and goals how to improve my health condition and thats why I want to sell it for atleast 4 900 € included wheelchair  - can be paid in BTC of course. I’m from Slovakia, so would be perfect if buyer would be close. First Owner wasn’t using it a lot because of health problems, and I drove only 100km cca, so it’s like a brand new.If there is a chance to find a new WHEELBOY / WHEELGIRL user to make him happy, I can accept little bit lower price, but of course, this handbike can be used by healthy people. If someone want to get stronger in arms. Thank you for the opportunity to advertiseI was trying to add video, but I couldn't, so if someone want to see it I can send it on Instagram for example, in my profile.",
