  "content": "Work always do not give satisfaction, sometimes you think of your family. Go all out for vacation, holidays, picnics and eatery, cinemas and catch fun with your family. Some people loves works and money more than a memorial time and excited period with families. What do you do with all your time? Do you love your wife, hubby, children and parents? Take them out for enjoyment mostly weekends. How often do you go out with your family?",

We always take a few days off during the holidays to get away, relax, and spend time with each other.",

      "body": "Well I think about my family alot especially both of my parents. Both of them are not in my life and I never did really know much about my father but even that makes me think about him. They are still my parents and I will not be here if it isnt for them.My family now is a small one. We do not go on vacations very much anymore just sometimes when I was very young. We are trying to be together for Christmas and other holidays but we all have different lifes so it can be difficult for this to happen.Family is very important though so spend much time with them as you can. We will not be alive forever and you do not want to hold any regrets when your family members begin to pass away.",
