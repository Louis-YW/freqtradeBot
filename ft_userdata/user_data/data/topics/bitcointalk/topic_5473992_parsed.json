Meanwhile, taxpayers who previously used HIFO (highest in, first out), CCFO (closest cost, first out) or some other cost-basis method in prior years end up with a perpetual cost-basis mismatch. The exchange issues a 1099-DA on a FIFO basis and taxpayer A calculates a totally different gain or loss using their own cost-basis method. You should start to see where the extra work is creeping in.get ready for a new IRS tax form guys. it's called 1099-DA. Double trouble that's what the D stands for.   all you can do is hope they don't come out with it.QuoteTracking and calculating gains separately for each address is a never-ending headache and may lead many to stop trading, so imposing taxes based on returns will solve many of this headaches.who would want anything to do with anything that made them have to do something like that? i would have to be guaranteed 100% returns to even go through something like that.",

Typically, if you don't want FIFO, you go into your account settings and change it. I don't see why Coinbase couldn't do the same thing. The setting would apply to all the sales that follow so you don't have to notify Coinbase before every sale.Furthermore, it wouldn't take much to add a feature to the sales process that lets the seller specify which lots they are selling from.Now, of course the exchange has to add this capability, and if they don't then I don't know what happens. It might be a good idea to avoid exchanges that don't let you specify. OTOH, it might not even matter because if they don't do that, they probably aren't going to file the 1099, either.",

The group is backing crypto representatives and lawyers who have called the proposed taxation scheme “dangerous and improper overreach.”Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry (R-NC) and Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y) led a group of nine lawmakers in the effort calling the tax reporting requirement “unworkable.”so it's not like they're taking this lying down. it's being protested against so if this thing really passes i would REALLY be suprised.

The bill stated that cryptocurrency exchanges would be required to report their customer’s capital gains and losses to the IRS through 1099 forms starting in the 2023 tax year. This law drew criticism from prominent voices in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Cryptocurrency’s unique properties make it difficult for exchanges to accurately report their customers’ capital gains and losses. It’s likely that the IRS is creating Form 1099-DA to tackle this issue and make it easier for cryptocurrency exchanges to report their customers’ activity. they snuck it into the American infrastructure bill, whatever that bill was for. they just snuck it in no one knew about it until after it happened probably! thanks biden.",

Migrant crisis has US taxpayers on the hook for up to $451B, House GOP report saysAmericans could pay up to $451 billion to care for migrants who entered the US illegally, but have been released into the country or escaped from custody, according to a new report due out Monday from House Republicans and obtained exclusively by The Post.The bill for government care and housing could total as much as $451 billion per year nationwide for apprehended migrants and known “gotaways” who have entered the US since 2021, according to figures the House panel cites from the Center for Immigration Studies.https://nypost.com/2023/11/13/news/house-gop-report-cites-historic-451-billion-cost-of-migrant-crisis/that's not just a one-off cost. it's per year.

The media are experts at taking numbers out of context and selectively reporting the things they want you to be angry about. National Health Expenditure was $4.3 trillion for 2021. We spend significantly more money than any other developed country and yet have significantly worse health in return, because our healthcare system is uniquely filled with unnecessary middle men who only care about making profits for themselves:Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_finance_in_the_United_States#Reasons_for_higher_costsAbout 25% of U.S. healthcare costs relate to administrative costs (e.g., billing and payment, as opposed to direct provision of services, supplies and medicine) versus 10-15% in other countries. For example, Duke University Hospital had 900 hospital beds but 1,300 billing clerks during 2013.Tell me why a hospital needs more billing clerks than actual beds? Cut that 15% excess compared to other countries from the $4.3 trillion budget and you are saving $645 billion a year, every year. Why is that not reported on?

I'm also highly skeptical of this number.The article you linked says it takes the number from this report: https://homeland.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Phase4Report.pdfThat report takes the number from this article, published by an anti-immigration think tank which is widely discredited: https://cis.org/Arthur/Bidens-Border-Fiasco-Costing-Local-Taxpayers-BillionsThat article reaches that number by multiplying the estimated cost of an immigrant in NYC by the estimated number of immigrants in the country. It's estimated cost of an immigrant in NYC comes from this article: https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2023/04/20/where_did_all_the_biden_illegal_immigrants_go_hard-up_sanctuary_cities_like_new_york_are_only_part_of_the_answer_894505.htmlThat article reaches its estimate by saying that NYC pays $150,000 per immigrant, but it also says that 40,000 immigrants have cost $2 billion, which works out at $50,000 per immigrant, so the numbers are simply wrong.So incorrect numbers, multiplied by guesswork, based on one of the most expensive states in the country.

We can also use them as currency, particularly bitcoin. Does the rule say something about taxes and using your cryptocoins as currency? Also, what about coin to coin trades?The IRS are already very clear on this matter and have been for some time. Spending bitcoin on goods or services or trading it for an altcoin is the same as selling it for fiat as far as they are concerned.",
