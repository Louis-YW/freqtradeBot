And that means if the coin does well in the future by going higher in price then your investment is yielding profits, Crypto-currency investment isn’t complicated. It doesn’t have a fix value so it’s a good source of investment when you make wise choices.",

I know some tokens give you votes and others are used to pay fees on the networks.  It’s kind of like generating tokens called Cubs baseball team token and trading them on an exchange.  But you don’t have ownership of the Cubs through the tokens or any other benefit if they do well other then popularity.  Do I have this right?",

Although in easy understanding, there's sort of similarity but they're completely different. Having Ethereum, means that you own it as long as you have the private keys of that wallet where your Ethereum or any other mentioned crypto deposited. If you're looking for the cash flow, you should take a look at the daily volume of these projects for you to have an idea on how much cash is flowing within these projects on a daily basis from exchanges and other moving transactions.",

The value of the token basically revolves around the supply and demand concept. So much better if you will invest on a project with actual applications in the market, where users are actually using it. Their price is very subjective as it depends on the market itself, how people perceive the token's usefulness and value in the market.",

In crypto market or at least in projects, there is no central authority, of course there is a developer like Vitalik for example with ETH. But they don't have control of the price and cash flows.The only thing is that you will invest, buy ETH at a certain price, hold on it. And if the value goes up, then you can 'trade' it in a crypto exchange and that's where you get your profits.Fiat is also not back up by anything.",
