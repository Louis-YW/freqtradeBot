      "body": "Nepal has set a huge target against Zimbabwe in 50 overs.  Zimbabwe need to collect 291 runs in 50 overs to win.  Nepal's top-order batsmen were very good at scoring runs.  Kushal Bhurtel missed the century by just one run. If he could have scored a century, Nepal's innings would have been complete. Maybe that's why scores between 90 and one type are called nervous nineteen.  Zimbabwe has already entered the field against Nepal to chase the target of 291 runs. So far Zimbabwe have managed to collect 33 runs without a wicket in six overs. In order to win with such a big target, the first-line batsmen have to do well, only then it is possible to win this match against Nepal.",
