  "content": "Hey, has anyone facing this error? SSL handshake failed Error code 525I have tried to change browser but it won't go away. I don't know if it's my side problem or bitcointalk side. Even 5 minutes ago everything was fine. Now I'm unable to login. Recently there was a fire in our main ISP provider company. That's why 70% wifi was down throughout the whole country. I don't know if that caused it. Other sites like youtube, facebook are still working. Weird.Note: Miraculously got Fixed.",

I understand that threads like this are opened when access to the forum is not available for a long period of time, but for such a short period of time it can be for any unimportant reason. I would lock the thread.",
