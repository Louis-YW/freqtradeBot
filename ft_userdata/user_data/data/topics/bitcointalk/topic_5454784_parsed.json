I know some will kick against my tips but what's your reasons?You're right, investing in Bitcoin can be risky because of its price can change a lot. While some people have made money from it, there is still no guarantees. The market is so unpredictable, and it's hard to know what will happen. Bitcoin's long-term potential is debated, so it's important to learn from experience not just by experience but also doing some research.",

I have a mindset this year do not expect more surprising increases, but focus on accumulating bitcoin and hold until it's time you enjoy the results of your investment.",

So in that case if you can't be patient and hold bitcoin for long time then you won't get any good from bitcoin.",

Don't sell your bitcoin around halving and don't try to be smarter than the market, it can turn to be bullish and you will lose your amount of bitcoin by trading badly like selling low, buying higher.QuoteI know some will kick against my tips but what's your reasons?You forgot about what you will do after buying dips.Buying dips and storing your bitcoin in your non custodial wallets. Don't store your coins on centralized exchanges which can collapse like FTX, Hotbit. If their exchanges close their services, you will have two possible endings: be able to withdraw your coins; not be able to withdraw your coins if they are bankrupted.",

People will only to get panic to sell only if they don't understand the market and just want  to  make quick money from bitcoin.

We need to realize that trading is not a problem in this case, but I still feel that there is a significant difference when talking about investing, and in my opinion, these are two different things.Because according to what you said, this is the right period to buy, not to sell, and this, of course, contradicts the concept of trading.",

However, if you believe that the price may fall even lower, you should start using the DCA method, which will be very helpful.In the this case that nobody can predict what will truly happen to the price of Bitcoin in nearest time as the bull run is nearing, the best for us to start buying, with any amount we can afford to lose. When the price of Bitcoin dropped to $16,000 in the past, many people might have missed out on opportunities because they believed or were convinced by others that it would similarly fall to $10,000, but this was not the case.Now, those that amass Bitcoin at a price between $16 and $20k have already made a profit.",

The fact is that if bitcoin falls, it's also good! This is an opportunity to buy it cheap at lower prices. But of course no one will do this, because inexperienced traders will be seized by fear. I am waiting for the price of bitcoin to drop to 20 thousand, that's when I will buy it as much as possible.At the same time, I already have bitcoin, and therefore, if it grows, I will also be in the black.

No bank sets limits or restricts you in any decision. Another point is that Bitcoin has a limit and that nobody produce more Bitcoin, the limit of 21 million is fixed. The FIAT money is getting less every year due to inflation, so why not invest it in bitcoin, so that in the best case it is worth even more. So it is not only profit. In a few words, this is what many love about bitcoin.",

Nevertheless, if such events do not transpire, accumulating now and waiting for a price increase can be a profitable strategy, considering Bitcoin's inherent volatility.",

Buying more bitcoin as the price declines is the best way to increase your bitcoin savings. You may also utilize the DCA method to avoid missing out on buying more bitcoin as the price fluctuates since the market is simply unpredictable at the moment. Regardless of how long Bitcoin is down, it will recover its value. whether you have this belief and understand the principles of bitcoin, you will not have any difficulty deciding whether to buy or when not to buy, especially when the price is decreasing due to market volatility.",

For sure majority has taken advantage of that as the price rose tremendously, we have have doubled it when we hit $31,000 a couple of months ago. So I guess that opportunity will not come again, unless there is another black swan event that will push the price again to lowest lows this bear market. However, if we keep on waiting for that, that opportunity might not arrived. So the best way to buy is just to do DCA and slowly stack sats as much as you can, or what you can afford.",
