  "content": "Antoine Riard, one of the core Lightning Network developers publicly announced his resignation from the project, citing some serious concerns. This puts some serious doubt on the future of lightning and the viability of it as a scaling solution. What are your thoughts? Is there a path of recovery for developing scaling solutions? And how about the years of waiting and supposed progress of development on the lightning network? Does it all go to waste? For many, lightning network was the go to solution to bircoin's scaling issues.",

Soft forks are very controversial with bitcoin, remember Segwit? So hopefully there will be enough consensus and after we patch all the bugs and holes, we can run the new code and all is well.

BUT thus needing a hard fork upgrade on the bitcoin network to ensure its enforced, bitcoin has become easy to let in soft nonsense, unchecked data.. but to strengthen the rules to reject transactions of a certain format requires a hard forksome of them wanted work arounds like having centralised services to manage funds or watch for abuses. but these do not help the decentralisation promise..the great thing about code is you can write your own rules on their own network, but if their code has a problem. putting a plaster on it or asking another network to provide them a feature, just shows their are problems at their rootthey have became too lax about their scripts. where they have not thought about security, but instead malleability. having a mindset that everything should be soft and not hard has meant many people can find exploits. and even if they try to fork bitcoin to add in a output deadline. it wont fix the issues, there are many other scripting exploits people can use to perform the same attack, the latest one relates to how participants of p2tr do not know all the scripting conditions of all methods to spend. they just blindly sign a part not realising that part can be used against themi am not going to explain all the flaws(giving scammers ammo) nor logical fixes due to simply not liking their network so they dont deserve help. but atleast now the flaws are starting to get noticed.. best suggestion .. start afresh and use a different payment system model.. make a subnetwork that actually meets its 6yo promisesthere are millions of people that tried LN and experienced its flaws and instead moved over to other subnetworks. this is not just one guy leaving. but just a notable guy of millions leavingi might actually respect core devs again if they made a subnetwork that is truly functional without having to mess with bitcoins rules just to fit. because messing with bitcoins rules has made bitcoin soft. and thats something we should not allow, just to populate someone elses network",

      "body": "Quotebut to strengthen the rules to reject transactions of a certain format requires a hard forkWhy? Rejecting transactions is not a problem in any soft-fork. Accepting more transactions than usual is a problem.Imagine an extreme soft-fork, that would reject all transactions, and would allow only coinbase transactions. Peter Todd described it there, it is perfectly valid soft-fork: https://petertodd.org/2016/forced-soft-forksWhich means, adding any kind of \"expiration\" to the transaction is not a problem at all. You have a node, you receive a transaction, you see \"Oh, it's five o'clock! That's all for today!\", and then you simply reject that transaction. And then, if most nodes do the same thing, then you cannot send transactions after 5 PM, because it is a soft-fork rule, and if some miner will include it anyway, then the soft-forked network will reject that block. And if soft-fork has 51%, then it becomes a consensus rule.But yes, the hardest way to reject a transaction, is to include a double-spend. Then, all other transactions, spending the same coins, will be always rejected in the future, because of already existing network rules.Quotethe latest one relates to how participants of p2tr do not know all the scripting conditions of all methods to spend. they just blindly sign a part not realising that part can be used against themYes, of course. If you sign a TapScript branch with any OP_SUCCESS, it can be always used to attack. The same will happen, if some soft-fork will not reach 51%. And yes, signing a blind TapScript branch is stupid, because it could be just \"OP_TRUE\" or even simply \"<attackerKey> OP_CHECKSIG\". In general, it is the first time, when OP_SUCCESS was introduced, and it can be painful to prove, that \"there is no OP_SUCCESS\".Quotebut atleast now the flaws are starting to get noticedYes, it seems some things are getting more and more soft. And that process will continue. It started with soft-forks, instead of hard-forks, and soon we will reach another stage: no-forks, instead of soft-forks. People will start building more and more stuff, without going through soft-fork signalling, and all of that. The most recent case was Ordinals, that could be somewhat-safe if deployed as a soft-fork, but was deployed as a completely unsafe no-fork instead.Quotebest suggestion .. start afresh and use a different payment system model.. make a subnetwork that actually meets its 6yo promisesWell, you can always start with unidirectional payment channels, and just disable routing. Then, if Alice has 1 BTC, and Bob has nothing, Alice can give more and more coins into Bob, but she cannot take any coins from him. And then, everything is simple: if you sent some signed transaction, then you passed some coins. It is irreversible. Bob will always get the last transaction, because it gives him the most coins. That model meets all assumptions, but has one drawback: it requires more on-chain transactions than LN, so it will not be deployed. But the funny thing is that some Bitcoin ATM operators supported that proposal more than LN.Quotei might actually respect core devs again if they made a subnetwork that is truly functional without having to mess with bitcoins rules just to fitYou can deploy payment channels, that I described above, even without Segwit. The only thing you need is to eliminate malleability. And you don't even need multisig, because Paillier Homomorphic Encryption can do the trick even on P2PK: https://duo.com/labs/tech-notes/2p-ecdsa-explained",

Most of them are so esoteric / expensive / just about impossible to implement as to not be worth it.Want to destroy LN or at least set it back years and years? Heck I can do that for you for less then BTC20000 / $600 million USDAs of now LN has about 5500BTC in it.Just start spinning up nodes and connecting to other nodes and charge 0 fees. Just keep adding and adding and adding.People will connect to you, you connect to others and soon just about every lowest cost route is running thought you.There are people who have 10+ connections to other nodes but they are all yours.But you now have 45000 nodes which is 3x as many as there are now and those 20000 BTC are all in LN so you own control 75% of the LN. Probably take about a year and everyone would be amazed at it's growth. Then you come in one morning and close all the channels to nodes that are not yours at once. Insane high fees so they are all in the next hundred blocks. Then when you have time you close the channels between your nodes, sit back and watch the chaos.But, nobody has done it. So worrying about some other attack that requires some extreme programming and other things is not a real worry.-Dave",
