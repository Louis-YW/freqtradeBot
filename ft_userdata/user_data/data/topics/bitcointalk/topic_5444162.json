  "content": "I didn't see anyone talking about Peach Bitcoin, but this is probably one of the best mobile P2P trading app alternative for Bisq exchange (that only works on computers).Peach Bitcoin is mobile application that connects Bitcoin buyers and sellers without the need for any KYC verification or registration.It works anywhere, anytime and you can choose many payment options including cash that you can exchange in bitcoin meetups in Europe.Other payment methods available are Bank Transfers, Online Paymemts (Paypal, Revolut, ADVcash, Mobile Pay, Wise...), Gift Cards, and various National Options depending on your location and currency.I think that Peach Bitcoin is currently available only in Europe, but there are plans to expand to other regions in the world.All payment methods are available are listed on their website:https://peachbitcoin.com/how-it-works/#paymentPeach Bitcoin app is available both on Android and iOS devices and only supported cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.One issue I have is the fact that source code is private and not open source, but maybe this can change in future.https://peachbitcoin.com/If you downloaded and tested this app please write your feedback below with pros and cons.I am not affiliated with PeachBitcoin in any way, so use it at your own risk.",

      "body": "Doesn't everything sound too good about PeachBitcoin to be true? No registration, no KYC. Although the source code is closed, what could be a reason to pause is introducing large sums to this platform. Unless to test with a small deposit.Have you, dkbit98, used this P2P mobile app yourself? Why do you consider \"this is probably one of the best mobile P2P trading app\"?The question of the number of active users of the exchanger also remains open.If this trading platform takes into account the interests of its users as much as possible, simplifying the exchange process, then how soon will regulators pay attention to this mobile app and tighten the use (or block it altogether)?When everything is very good, this is a reason to be wary. Also, regulators will not like such sweet conditions either, like PeachBitcoin.",

Why do you consider \"this is probably one of the best mobile P2P trading app\"?I didn't use it yet because there are currently no cash meetups in my region, but I will try testing it with PayPal and few other options soon.It's the best P2P mobile app simply because there is nothing better available right now, it's like Bisq for mobile.Quote from: m2017 on March 10, 2023, 02:16:15 AMIf this trading platform takes into account the interests of its users as much as possible, simplifying the exchange process, then how soon will regulators pay attention to this mobile app and tighten the use (or block it altogether)?Nobody stopped Bitcoin, nobody stopped Bisq, and nobody stopped torrents, so it's not going to be easy to stop PeachBitcoin, but that is not my concern anyway.Quote from: hugeblack on March 10, 2023, 08:21:31 AMIt is difficult to trust them, especially since they do not have a web application.

Bisq uses a custom script with different levels of fallback (mediation, arbitration; 2-of-3 in the past and yet another, better system in Bisq 2 as far as I know).

My oppinion is that Bisq is better option for computers, but PeachBitcoin is very good alternative for mobile devices, if you are willing to accept some drawbacks.",

In addition, there are not enough reviews about this platform on Google or YouTube, although it has been live for nearly a year. In addition, the domain owner's information is hidden, and we cannot identify it or the platform team; also, why did PeachBitcoin put the whitepaper for Bitcoin on their platform? Why didn't they put a whitepaper containing important information about their platform, application, and team? The last thing is that I could not download the application from Google Play or the App Store because the application appears to have been deleted or does not exist.

This is not some altcoin project that is trying to raise the money so they have to make bunch of bullshit claims in order to persuade people to invest.App looks interesting and could be used (at least speaking from my pov) for example when you are in a different country and you have to sell some bitcoin ASAP, but for domestic use here in Croatia we have local TG groups where you can do the same thing.",

They ask verification for larger amount of money, I think for more than 1000 CHF per day traded you need to do verification anywhere, and you can easily override that in Bitcoin meetups.
