  "content": "Hello, BitcoinTalk community,I've been working on a new concept for an online game called \"Krypto Quest\" and I would love to get your thoughts and feedback on it. The game is all about trying to decrypt a seed phrase that is hidden in 12 different pictures. These pictures will be released over a period of time, and the objective is to figure out what word is encrypted in the picture. Once you figure out all 12 words and put them in the correct order, you will have access to the crypto wallet.For now, it's just on Twitter to test interest. But later it'll be on the website and will be played pretty much like notpr0n (if you know what I'm talking about).I believe that this game could be fun and educational. So, if you're interested in participating, you can follow me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Krypto_Quest",
