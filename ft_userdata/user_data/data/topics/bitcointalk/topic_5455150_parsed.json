  "content": "My younger sister told me that how you bear your pocket money because dad doesn't give you much money without education fees. I told my sister that I have a little investment in Bitcoin and I am a short term trader (though the fund is little). She told that she learned about Bitcoin at her ICT related books. But she has not much knowledge about it. Then I tried to teach him the basics of Bitcoin. At last I succeed though there are enough information to learn by my sister. She told me that she is interested to be a Bitcoin user. And already she started to keep some money from daily pocket money and after that she will invest in Bitcoin. I told that not only you but also other girls should learn about Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. She told me that she will share her experience about Bitcoin with her college friends. I am now much happy by sharing with my younger sister about Bitcoin and will be more happy if she share information and teach other friends.",

Anybody that has an interest in the sector is free to join regardless of gender or race. Everybody has equal opportunity in the Bitcoin sector. But I also understand your point OP, the crypto space is dominated by men. This might be because women are restricted by finance, childraising, cultural barriers, and other impediment. In my area, most parents restrict their female children from owning mobile phones while male children are free to own one. But it was great you shared the Bitcoin experience with your sister. Bitcoin education should be continued so ensure you keep exposing her to other areas such as Bitcoin transactions, wallets, privacy, security, etc. You can also arrange for a Bitcoin lesson for your sister's friends if they are interested.",

They love the technology, and most of them are doing far better than a few of us, but they don't just show themselves; a lot of them just like leaving their private lives and doing their things the way they want to do them.Since she already has the basis or just the name from a computer book, it will be easier for you to lecture her more about the coin, but before you advise her to also bring her schoolmate onboard, you should educate her more first. She really needs to understand what she is about to teach someone before she can move forward in doing that, or she will misinform her friends and they will have the wrong information about Bitcoin and invest in it from the wrong perspective, which might end up landing her in trouble.",

There have been a bunch of women that's also into Bitcoin so that's not something new anymore.But still, good job on introducing bitcoin to your sister but you don't have to force her to tell it to her friends. That can even be a problem that she'll bear soon when one of her friends invests and then not patient enough but only sees the daily losses because of volatility.Educating her is enough already and you did a great thing there.",

Anyone can learn about Bitcoin regardless of their gender, as long as they're interested in learning and exploring Bitcoin. Glad for you, that you're able to convince your sister about Bitcoin and she seems interested in learning. She might be able to influence her friends once she has enough experience and knowledge in Bitcoin.",

I am a female and I have introduced my female friends to bitcoin and only one of them was interested and she have her bitcoin investment portfolio. I love what you did by teaching your younger sister bitcoin and she has already invested in it. I hope you told her about the risk involved,because she should know that it is not a get rick quick project. Also advise her to go into a long term investment for her not a panic when bitcoin price dips below the price she bought it. Lastly,bitcoin knowledge doesn't end at the basic concept alone,she needs to be learning constantly for her to be able to keep her funds safe in her wallet. You should introduce her to the forum so that she can have a successful bitcoin journey",

The lots of persons that kicks out are those that are unaware and don't even care to find out.The case is always different when the bulls starts running the market trends.Anyway, bitcoin is not sexes and as such, there isn't any gender segregation. Anyone who is interested can always start from somewhere and build there portfolio but first, you get to learn the pros and cons.",

When introducing something that has the potential of making someone lose their money/investment make sure you also tell them able the possible disadvantages associated with it, that way they will be more than rest to shoulder anything that might happen in the future.I'm very sure your sister is delighted to have heard that she can make money by investing in Bitcoin but is she also away that the price of Bitcoin s volatile and my drop down at anytime? No! What then do you think will happen if your sister successfully makes her friends interested in Bitcoin by also sugarcoating it the same way you did to her and eventually none of them profit from it and at that end were forced to sell at a lost due to an urgent need for money? What do you think you will be labeled as? It's certain that you might be called a scammer for trying to help people.Please always try to talk about the things that people wanting to go into Bitcoin should bear at the back of their mind, the risk involved and they are fine with it then let them proceed.",

Perhaps for technical issues in Bitcoin, not all girls will be interested, but everything related to investing does not present any difficulties; moreover, girls are more accurate in learning, and if they wish, they can still argue with men. But I’m sure that girls in storage, and the patience to keep up with the price they need, are stronger since many have innate accuracy.
