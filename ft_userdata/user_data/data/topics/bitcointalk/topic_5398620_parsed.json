Reading or binge watching stuffs would allow you separate the garbage from content that are useful to newbies.What do you wish to understand about the crypto market? That's a long train with lots of smaller coaches.I am mostly interested in understanding Bitcoin and how it works so this forum, Bitcoin wiki and some other resources are what I use. If you're interested in trading, you'll meet lots of shillers on social media who only talk about what's going 100× in a week, but there would still be the tiny minority that share useful content, just do a bit of research and then some more.",

Before you start following some reputable traders or investors on social media, I suggest you master the basics first. Try to get a basic understanding of how the market works, and how to use different trading strategies. Many of these traders also talk about fundamental and technical analysis, so I suggest you read up on those as well. This will help you to understand about their trading strategies, and you can then follow them without any fear of being lost in the technical jargon.",

No one can be 100% perfect in cryptocurrency, I don't see see cryptocurrency influencers to be perfect in every prediction they give concerning cryptocurrency.  Some update they give are can be real while some can be unreal too. So it is left for one to make research to know which updates that can be accepted from cryptocurrency influencers.",

What will that be for? I doubt. What I think can happen is that genuinely made calls turn out to be inaccurate. Influencers like to brag when what they say comes to past. That even earns them more subscribers or followers and then earned trust.
