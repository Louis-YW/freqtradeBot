Thank you for good review!Also we think you will really like it in the desktop version.We made an update on this.In fact, our policy on this issue is clear:Slotella doesnt bother its players as much as possible with policies like KYC. We are a casino in the crypto industry, but we require KYC submissions from our users for major suspicious transaction activities.Not every detail in our terms of use has been prepared for a standard player. We only require KYC for major suspicious user activity.",

I know casino can do it but this value is not too big. I understand that each casino has their own bankroll, big or small so their rules for additional KYC and withdrawal value to trigger it are different.This rule can be a negative one for guests and they might choose another casino that requires additional KYC with higher withdrawal, maybe 10,000 or 20,000 Euro.",

I'm just saying all these because competition is quite tough in here and you might consider making changes/adjustments.Anyway, welcome and goodluck!Quote4.2.
