  "content": "There are still so many developers that don't understand how important multichain is, just because your project is on solana network doesn't mean everyone will want to use your project or play the game, there are few projects that I decide to let go because of their smart contract, I am a ERC 20 projects fan not solana or matic, make sure your project is available of every chains out there for easier adoption...In the near future only multichain can bring all good projects together either in the payment field, layer 1 or gaming field, this is the definition of a fulfilled crypto future.",

      "body": "It can bring more conveninence but at the same time also results in more risk.Mutilchain means more options but you will need bridges to convert your token from one chain to other chains. Bridges are not safe with current technologies.You are taking high risk wheÂ  you use crypto bridges at this time. Many hacks on bridges and projects likely have yet upgraded technologies well enough to eliminate compromiseling risk.",

      "body": "I am more into bep20 projects because BNB gas fee is cheaper but once Ethereum merge works out all these multi chains won't matter, if you have to pay in a store to an item the store owner should be the one opened to more than one crypto for payment, no BNB? Good, how about LTC? No LTC? Good how about Polkadot? Simple this way than taking risks with bridges.",

Because I think that any smart-contract cryptocurrencies or multi-chain solutions will also compete with each other, in the end, it will keep popping out so there won't be any single solution.This issue reminds me of some xckd comic:https://xkcd.com/927/Which to say the least, we already seeing it now. One's project/solution claim to be better than the others.",
