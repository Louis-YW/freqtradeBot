If you manage to be lucky, new money may come into the shitcoins if they pump it in the future but it is not an assurance and patience will be a waste of time and emotions.Always look for good list of altcoins to buy so that your patience will be worth it.",

Trading is just transferring of money from impatient people to patient people since you will never loss on crypto trading unless you sold or the project you are investing turns into scam. But currency like Bitcoin has no way to turn zero value so selling at loss doesn’t make sense while the price will eventually recover and go ATH in due time.Patience is the key if you want to be successful in crypto trading. I think it will be helpful if you attached the link to the courses you take that makes you improved on trading to help newbie user here that struggling on same problem like yours before.",

You can only have hope for something that you know a thing or two about but not something you basically do not have knowledge about. This paragraph of yours that I quote means that you weren’t only impatient but you basically didn’t have any prior knowledge about bitcoin or cryptocurrency at large and you went on to just invest without the knowledge. When you went back to seek this knowledge that was probably when you were taught patience in holding bitcoin and Altcoins because they are volatile. So one thing I also guess when I see people either buying shitcoins or selling off their bitcoin holdings is that they don’t have knowledge and not really patience. Once you have the knowledge the patience will be instill in you because you already foresaw the drop in price and also have the optimistic of it raising, a less knowledgeable person wouldn’t posses this Quote from: Coin_trader on October 08, 2023, 12:25:59 PMy newbie outCorrect. Trading is just transferring of money from impatient people to patient people since you will never loss on crypto trading unless you sold or the project you are investing turns into scam.Most at times this is true but sometimes it is not, selling off during bear periods could also be from a patient person but in need of funds due to unknown emergency that arises. Someone will say you should keep extra money for emergency before investing in bitcoin so you don’t sell at loss but there might be some big emergency that will arise which even the emergency funds would not cover and the last resort will be selling your holdings at a loss.",

      "body": "That's the worst thing that any trader does because selling one's assets at loss is mostly done by the ones with weak hands. The trading requires patience and if someone doesn't have control over their emotions then it's almost impossible to make any profits. I said trading because it's not the way of investing as investing needs patience and belief in an asset and that type of approach requires understanding of the assets and the market conditions. The traders often lose money because they set the goals to earn 1% or more per trade and when their trades go wrong they start selling their assets at loss in belief that they'll recover the losses and earn profits if they continue trading. Those are the traders without any proper trading plans and that's the main reason of such losses. Good traders are patient by nature and they don't rush buy an asset because the market is pumping it instead they do proper research and make proper trading plans before placing any buy orders. I must say that without patience no one can be successful in life whether it's trading or investing or anything else, the ones who have patience will always have lead over the ones without it. Now you have learnt the way of investing which requires holding an asset for a long period before making any profits.",

And I also learned from that mistake. I not only learned about patience but also how I can control my feelings of greed and how I can control my FOMO sentiment. I don't think any person can actually suppress such feelings totally but partially yes they can. This means, sometimes I am able to control my feelings of not falling prey to market sentiments and losing my patience but sometimes I am not able to control them. Newbies always take BTC and the crypto market as a quick rich scheme, but to be honest, those who did not take it as a quick rich scheme are the ones who are still safe here and getting rich every day. And you know what rich minds say. Holding is better than trading. Because in the long run, a person is making efforts daily or weekly or whatever time period he has selected and earning and losing money at the same time, while facing market pressure too which might make that person mentally sick (of course for some time). But the ones who have done holding in BTC for a longer period of time are the ones free of all kinds of tensions and pressure from the market because they have a strong belief that the market will go up due to the scarcity factor of BTC.",

Sell altcoins immediately you make ROI, and do not hodl it even when it is dumping, sell it at a loss or you end up being a badholder.Quote from: Kara3 on October 08, 2023, 11:31:15 AMThrough reading and under going through crypto courses, I became more enlightened which made me hold high value asset like Bitcoin, Entheruem and Bnb.You underwent crypto courses to learn how to hodl crypto assets, lol,  are you kidding me.

Without patience you will never survive here. Again patience does not always work for those of us who are in the middle of the family situation. Lack of patience defeats. Here I had some bitcoins invested but forced to spend it for my family needs. That's why I'm forced to say here that I patiently tried to accumulate bitcoins but the scarcity didn't let me hold on. But I have enough patience that I will not lack throughout my life. I will patiently keep investing again when I am not lacking and I believe I will definitely succeed. But I am telling those who do not have family problems to be patient, if you are patient you will definitely get success. And those who don't have patience will never succeed here.",

I gave up cryptocurrencies in 2018 after the market crashed, which, up to this day, has been the worst mistake I've made during my time with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I wasn't patient nor persistent at the time; had I been and not given up completely for over two or three years, now there's a decent chance that I would hold up to one bitcoin for sure. Thus, you need to be able to sustain yourself during unpleasant periods. I wasn't and ended up with almost no Bitcoin when I had a pleasant amount at that time.

If you have engaged in studying and researching about bitcoin, at first you will understand more about it before you start, so with that, you will enjoy it and have many profits.My advice to other newbies is that before starting anything in life, not only bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, you should engage in research and studies; it will help a lot, and you should also be patient because patience is the key to success.",

It can be difficult to find anyone who will say they have not been in this situation, where you are under high pressure, but all you need is patience. At some point, I was very reckless when I invested money in Bitcoin. The only advantage is that my mindset changed, and I started thinking about the long term instead of the short term.One thing to keep in mind is that we need to have realistic expectations when it comes to cryptocurrency. You shouldn't expect to invest an amount and see a huge return in a short or long time without taking note of the cycles involved. There is the bull season and the bear season, and during each season, there is a strategy to follow in the cryptocurrency market to avoid losing the money you've invested.

I couldn't take my eyes off my wallet because I wanted to know how my investment was performing. But with time I began to understand the workings of the bitcoin system and it was clear that checking my wallet consistency was needless for a long-term hodler.  Traders might always monitor the market but long-term holder follow their plans. My take is that sometimes experience is the best teacher. Most newbies might not learn patience by reading but by experience. It was good that you put up this post to remind them but I also believe that they will learn as they spend more time in the Bitcoin ecosystem.",
