If I discovered dat my father is d founder of BTC, I will first ask him to show me his Bitcointalk.orgaccount Â password to confirm and other BTC document dat guarantee him as d founder of BTC, so dat when he fulfill his destiny and pass away from dis earth, I will now have full evidence as d next of kids to his personal identify as founder of BTC because, what belong to my father Belong to me. What will you do when you find yourself in such favourable condition? Â Will you expose him now for d whole world to know dat your father is d founder of BTC? Or you will keep d secret as anonymous till him leave dis earth before you can prove it to d whole world? Your opinion is highly welcome.",

So cute, that thought (lol). But first, if you discover that Satoshi is your father, I know some people will, out of excitement, whisper to their best friend that Satoshi is \"my dad,\" and that your best friend will whisper it to another friend who will whisper it to the government (lol). Well, I don't just like how I feel imagining that BTC's founder is my dad. So I don't really have any cool answers for this. But I must say, I really love the idea of this thread. OP, if you don't mind, you can edit the topic and add \"For Fun.\" Let's see some funny replies.",

      "body": "; Then after you jump into the lagoon in excitement, this is so sarcastic Â , ops can you just stop thinking for a while and wake up from that imaginary dream? Satoshi being your father can not guarantee you a peaceful and stress-free life because there is a lot of responsibility that comes from being Satoshi or his next of kind, and again from all that you have mentioned as your desire from being a Satoshi it makes you lose your freedom and one thing you should ask yourself is that. 1: can you pay the price that Satoshi paid, because from the single event of being the Bitcoin creator, he lost his identity forever this is one big sacrifice anyone will pay, and if Satoshi is an individual, it then means he has paid a very big price, but most people believe that Satoshi is an acronyms and code name for a group. 2: If you become Satoshi next of a kind, what development can you bring on board that will help the Bitcoin network in general, do you have the necessary cryptographic knowledge to purses that name and identity?",

Your opinion is highly welcome.One of the most amazing inventions of all time was the invention of Bitcoin, which has significantly improved the global financial system to the point where some nations now accept it as legal tender. Bitcoin has attracted more attention and is still attracting more, and I hope the government will be more lenient with it. how hilarious what do you want to do with the login details of the founder? I will just tell him to wire my wallet with Bitcoin I don't need his account details.  All I want is Bitcoin shining in my wallet. and another thing is that it will be difficult to prove that his satoshi.",

If Satoshi were your father there's no way he would tell you his identity because telling you his identity would only put you in danger. The only way you could actually find out might be after his passing... Which is still very unlikely, because if Satoshi was just an individual and not a group of persons, I don't think he would want to leave any trace to his identity even after his passing. If such information gets into public knowledge they might want to target his family after his death.",
