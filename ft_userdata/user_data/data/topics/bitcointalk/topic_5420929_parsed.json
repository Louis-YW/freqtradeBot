The price is cheap, one thread says that we are in 2018 price, or 2017 prior to the all time high that time. So yes, generational buying period or simply accumulation phase.History already tell us that in the future, the price will experience a massive growth.Just a matter of time on how we are going to see and seized the advantage that we have today.",

Most important is that many are calling bitcoin a scam and are withdrawing all their funds into their bank accounts, usually when this happens. Its a perfect time to buy.How many people do you know that are buying now? Most I know are either holding for lower prices or they are selling. Seems like the perfect time to buy...until it isn't. I think we had these \"perfect time to buy\" about 5 times this year.",

Work around it, grind everyday, but the reward will be worth in the future.And so it could be like less than $100 per month, just because that is the only amount we can allot to buying Bitcoin, and it should only be BTC, not shitcoin or meme coin or some altcoin. WE should just focus on buying Bitcoin as this point, in whatever way we can, as I have said DCA, or maybe if you have our Christmas bonus already, maybe you can try as little as 10% and then HODL.",

Fortunately, people have a very short-term memory, which means that in 6 months, things might get better, and as the halving approaches, the economic situation might be better than today, which will encourage a new wave of investments in Bitcoin.",

It's a nightmare that will keep on visiting you in your sleep. The \"what if's\".It should be remembered, that is for us to know if it's now ready to sell and take profits. If we are buying too often, we can also write it down in the notebook or on our phone. But, it's great that you are smiling instead of regretting on why you didn't wait for the price to drop but many are not like that. This is why DCA is invented and being recommended the most to avoid regrets and get involved in each dumping of the price. I guess your last buying price is at $25k, judging on how you calculate how much you can save if you will buy again today. $25k is a decent buying price IMO so don't worry. It should gave you a great returns already by the time we get back to the last ath.",

Well said!Not all things happened in the past would eventually be happening in the future.We might be seeing similar behavior or patter but doesnt mean that it would be 100% be happening in the future.This is why people should really be realizing about the certain risk when you do make yourself so sure about those ATH movements which its never been a guarantee.Always set or take precautions when it comes to your trading decisions specially on buying entries.Dont make that all in kind of behavioror always having that risk management always intact.",

And regardless, this crash couldn't have happened at a worse time, because inflation is such that very few people can afford to invest in Bitcoin or anything else because they don't have enough for basic life needs.I agree this is the most dominant reason why people will wait, again the crypto market is currently experiencing a bit of loss of confidence due to some big projects failing like the two cases of Terra and FTX recently. This has made a lot of people out there wary of crypto even though it is recovering gradually.Quote from: Lucius on November 18, 2022, 11:14:48 AMFortunately, people have a very short-term memory, which means that in 6 months, things might get better, and as the halving approaches, the economic situation might be better than today, which will encourage a new wave of investments in Bitcoin.True, but if the aftershocks are deeper then I believe 6 months is too short to get much faith in crypto again. Maybe a little longer, but who knows. Fortunately, the halving is getting closer, it will create a better mood for crypto among its traders and investors.",
