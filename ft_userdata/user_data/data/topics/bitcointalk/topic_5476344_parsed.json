I agree with this suggestion. I have had experience with predictions website and there is no certainty with them, they could get the predictions right this week and go horribly wrong the next week, so I will not want to be that guy that recommends a website and it turns out that you follow it and lose out on whatever you stake based on their predictions.I personally just follow weekend build up for the different leagues with break down of injuries, current form, head to head and historical performance.- Jay -",

I always thought that the guess work is personal or with people who have the same interest in gambling. It would really be nice to visit these sites on Google to see how they help in predictions and how accurate their predictions are after a game.True, OP should have been specific with the kind of game that he's into it's gambling, and if he has tried any sites that perhaps didn't give him accurate predictions. Maybe he just needs a site that predicts different types of games, anyways I'm eager to learn with him.",

It would really be nice to visit these sites on Google to see how they help in predictions and how accurate their predictions are after a game.No, this doesn't mean you are an amateur and don't have to use sports prediction site to take into account every bet you make because when the match is clear then of course you can guess with your own ability to make good bet.But using sports prediction site is also quite helpful for some people who are still not sure about their own predictions, just don't really bet on the results given by the prediction site because it doesn't guarantee anything and only gives you anger or regret if you lose.You have to learn everything and you need to look at your own predictions with considerations from the prediction site so that what you bet on is not in vain.QuoteTrue, OP should have been specific with the kind of game that he's into it's gambling, and if he has tried any sites that perhaps didn't give him accurate predictions.

You can't trust them with your money as they can make predictions that has no guarantee will win, so you would like only be following it blindly which is not good for you if you want to succeed in sports betting. You're in the forum where lots of threads are active about sports betting, I think you should explore that and try to utilize the information you'll get from their, at least you'll deal with real people with different opinions and prediction, just follow the known winners.",

Long story short, I got weary with them and now have to be doing my analysis myself and it has been better for me as my loses ain't that high anymore as it were. So Op, I believe you can do it yourself stead of depending on those supposed professional analysis, some are sponsored analyst by sports betting sites to draw more bettors with higer stakes.",

I guess most of the websites OP is looking are already posted above, but as to the prediction site, honestly I don't find it attractive as it teaches bettors to be lazy and stupid. I mean, if we just follow a prediction from other people or a specific site in this matter, that would simply mean we don't trust our knowledge and skills in sprots betting, which actually what we need to succeed. So it doesn't make sense why we seek on that thing that doesn't help us in the long run.",

Most prediction sources I followed are not always accurate and the reason I choose to go this road was because I don't have time to watch sports myself, so my best advice for you is to start watching sports yourself, and also know that with prediction sources you can still lose your money.Predictions or no predictions you need to focus only on what you are willing to risk, do not ever rely on anyone's prediction because you can still lose your money so make sure you risk money you are willing to lose. There are many people that have followed predictions just like me and still they lose most of the time, gambling is something you shouldn't completely rely on to make some income like a real life job, it's all about trying your luck over again until you make it right, so ask yourself how much you will be losing in the trying again and again strategy?",

If you want to make a profit in anything, then you need to learn how to make a profit yourself, and not rely on someone else’s forecasts.",
