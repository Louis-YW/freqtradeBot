  "content": "Its quite normal now for business moguls to up and make decisions that could affect the public and investors at large positively or negatively. Yesterday saw the media flooded with news of Binance, world's largest crypto currency exchange, come to the rescue of Sam Bank Friedman's FTX and proposing a buyout but it looks like the billionaire is trying to borrow a leaf from Elon Musk and taking a chill pill on the deal. There seems to be a lot of skeletons in FTX cupboard as it was revealed by Chang that his reasons for pausing are \" there are mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations\". FTX has been struggling with a surge in withdrawals that caused a liquidity crunch. It actually became worrying when the company's financial frame of mind reportedly triggered $6bn(£5.2bn) of withdrawals in a space of 3 days. Will this issue be later rectified and his mind be changed or would he be forced to go ahead with the deal like Elon did? https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63577783&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjQx9bnjKP7AhXz_rsIHU6DBIcQFnoECAQQAw&usg=AOvVaw3mRlYF8iI-bcGpo2kXSvpo",

It actually became worrying when the company's financial frame of mind reportedly triggered $6bn(£5.2bn) of withdrawals in a space of 3 days.Well! that's sudden and I don't think they have any solutions to that kind of surprise. looks like they will gonna halt their activities if this will not cease and there's no doubt that this is already considered panics withdrawals. Damn! I can understand the owner's frustration but they also need to save their users because if I were only one of those guys, I would have done the same thing when I see everyone getting their money out of FTX.",

The problem of private company if the financial will never be reported whether it would be good or not. Binance walks out due to the some reasons. It's clear that these reasons already fully explained by binance. The reason is the financial report from FTX is helpless. It can't be helped by binance and another reason is binance doesn't wanna try to be involved direclty with US regulators who have been doing investigation to the FTX. US has been paying so many attention to the FTX recently. That was forcing binance to go out from the market as soon as it can. No choice for binance other than walking out from the deal. there's no good sign from FTX.",

And so the market continue to suffer, bitcoin for example capitulating at $15,500, while the rest of the altcoin market is bleeding in the last 3 days.I know that others says the CZ is playing us, but he can only do that much to save FTX. So the whole blame should be on the people behind FTX, they are the own who let this things happen to their customers in the first place.",

He is a serious businessman and always try to stay clear out of legal troubles. If in case FTX is declared free of any financial irregularities, then CZ might go ahead and save the bill but at this situation it looks highly unlikely. For us, it's an opportunity to buy at dip and save some more bitcoins for future use!",

Not just this, FTX also impacted investments of Tom Brady and Gisele have caught up the fire of FTX dump. You never know who will be hunted down by crypto.

It is very interesting how the SEC investigation will end.True, it would be like catching a falling knife, CZ won't even think of buying the exchange since it has already a problem and the investigation of FTX is yet to be concluded.  CZ possibly mastered the art of the business and won't make the wrong call of buying that exchange.  Besides, FTX is on the verge of collapse due to the rumored user fund mismanagement, so I think aside from the current investigation, tons of possible lawsuits will be filed against the exchange owner.Quote from: JustEducated on November 10, 2022, 05:16:29 PMTo me, this seems like some kind of manipulation.And just when the market is recovering CZ and FTX issue came up.No wonder we're always adviced not to save our funds in Central system.

I think mark Zuckerberg for example tried it and we can see how he has dropped in the Forbes list.It's a big world and competition creates room for growth CZ should focus more on Binance and end this drama about FTX.",

It is very interesting how the SEC investigation will end.Let’s exclude that politics side but FRX is really on a big danger here, most probably cases against them will soon be filed if they can’t survive on this, this is a wise move for Binance not to bailout FTX or else they will be part of the problem of FTX. USDT freezes the holdings of FTX, that could be a good fund to compensate the losses I just don’t know how long they can take it, but it looks like they are already getting there.",

CZ on the other hand would love to do this, but the offer is not good enough, plus there are tons of risks involved, if there are no more risks and all is cleared, and if the offer is on the table at that point and looks good, of course, he will take it.
