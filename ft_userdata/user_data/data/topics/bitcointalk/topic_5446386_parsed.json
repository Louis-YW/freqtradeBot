  "content": "Hello,General topic on the coming S19j pro+ 122thAnyone received the S19jpro+ ? I need to know in advance the type of control board associated to this machine..What are the chances that Bitmain used the latest control board CVITEK (CV1835) ? I would prefer not as these CB are not working well with fan spoofer (I tried with the XP model with CVITEK, did someone faced the same issue ?) and are not yet accepted by Braiins OS+...Making it difficult for immersion cooling.Regarding the connector I got the information that an adapter will come with the machine.Let me know your though.. and info,+",
