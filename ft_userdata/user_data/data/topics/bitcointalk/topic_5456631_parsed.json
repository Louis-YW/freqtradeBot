What they did know is it's hard to make money through gambling.Quote from: alastantiger on June 17, 2023, 07:53:54 AMWhat other categories of unrealistic sports betting expectations have you encountered?Not unreal and it's not categorize to what you've mentioned but a surprising bet of a million with an odd of 1.01 and then that guy lost that bet. That was posted here as well, it just got stuck on my mind when I've read that story.",

The only thing that surprises me most is that, if most of those people are truly having the signal, they won’t be going around and be disturbing people to pay so that they will be added to group. We all have to be careful, their is nothing like fix matches, most of them are just trying to make use of opportunity just to scam, and am sure newbies and addicted gamblers are the once that will easily fall for that kind of scam. Seriously if their is anything like fix matches am sure every gambler will have been rich by now, most of those people providing signals are even poor, they are looking for people to scam so that they will make money.",

A forum user managed to do that already by playing only sports betting. You can refer to the quoted post below. His post is not bullshit because you can see that he really have a huge bankroll and involved in extreme sport betting if you browse his post history.Quote from: NAPK1NS_RA3 on June 09, 2023, 06:34:18 AMI’ve turned $1,000 into $100,000I’ve turned $6,000 into $80,000I’ve turned $11,000 into $550,000and recently I’ve turned $4,000 into $90,000This possible but it’s very hard if you think about it.",

And that's why it is called inside information, because only a few individuals could have known that they are going to fixed the match, hence, they are the only once going to benefit from it. Unless someone blow it off and tell others about it.I think unrealistic sports betting expectations is subjective if we talk about gambling though.",

We know that parlays arent something that would really be so simple for us to make those sure hits and making those bet amounts to be on multiple folds but im not saying that this one is impossible.If a certain individual does have that kind of target then just let them be because its their money to be used and not something that you could really be able to do on what they would really be tending to do so. This is why it would really be that much better on letting them on what they would gonna do with their 1k. For those people who do believe on fixed matches and trying out to believe to those who do make out some false or scammy claims thenfor sure they would soon realized on the time that they had been scammed.",

About more realistic expectations indeed as the OP said i.e. increasing their bankroll. Few people can afford $100k amount in sports betting. many want a big win right now, even though that doesn't look realistic and is just a wish that won't come true, in the end they will waste bets with little wins.",

Because usually parlays have a smaller RTP than single bets with the same odds usually. Because the margin of each leg is multiplied by the margin of the other legs, so at the end you can get a parlay with a big margin.",

It is a year after all, it's not like they're trying to go and reach the goal in one bet. While it may seem close to impossible but hey, there's probably a really small chance of them being able to do that. Especially if you take big but calculated risks. Granted that one win is all it takes to ruin it if they're trying to maximize profits  but as I said, it's over the span of a year. Can take calculated risks every now and then so no need to rush on their side.Quote from: alastantiger on June 17, 2023, 07:53:54 AMWhat other categories of unrealistic sports betting expectations have you encountered?In the first category, but rather than in a year, it's more like in a single bet. People expecting to bet like idk, $10 and suddenly win what, $1000 or $10000? Man should've went for lotteries instead. It's pretty dumb but hey, I've known a few people who have that kind of mindset in the past.",

Maybe if you said from $1000 to $1million then that's when some doubt would had come in because that's looking very impossible although not saying it isn't achievable, some gamblers has luck on their side..Using compounding any gambler that's very knowledgeable in sport betting and also has luck on his side can turn $1000 to $100,000. If he could double his wins every weekend, it won't take him more than six month to be able to reach $100,000 considering some lose in some weekends.I don't think there's any unrealistic amount of profits to be made in betting, it might be unrealistic to you when you limit your mind to what's possible.

But it is more achievable in sports betting because if one knows one or a few sports well, they can get a nice win. But it might be more difficult to achieve if it's in a luck-based gambling game.The second category is that there is no guarantee you can win from gambling, but you will probably encounter losses more often than wins. And again, sportsbooks have more chances of winning because they can analyze to find the team with the best chance of losing.Maybe this third category wants to make gambling a steady income. It's unrealistic because they have to calculate how much money they will have, when they can win, etc. It would be even more difficult and even if they were an expert in sports betting, they would not be able to win all the time as the match progressed, there could be changes which would result in them losing the bet.",

Maybe such sports bettors do exist, but they keep their lifestyle a secret.The tipsters, who are selling sports betting services(including fixed games) are 99% scammers. There's no doubt about that.Some people have unrealistic perception about their luck, while other people have unrealistic perception about their skills.There are people, who are dumb enough to think that they could outsmart the bookies or trick the system.",

In what universe do they think this is possible? Such expectations are unrealistic and only occur in the lottery, not in sports betting. Even in sports betting, it would be a chance occurrence, happening only once in every 100 bets. A more realistic expectation would be to aim for increasing their bankroll.The second category consists of individuals seeking guaranteed wins and fixed bets or matches. These individuals are frequently seen on platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and others where sports betting is discussed. They are often the first to express their desire for guaranteed games and fixed matches/bets, believing they will surely win. Unfortunately, these individuals are easily scammed due to scammers taking advantage of their gullibility.What other categories of unrealistic sports betting expectations have you encountered?Actually, the first one is possible but only if someone has god-level accuracy where they won't get a single loss and they keep placing bets with everything they manage to win from their last match, but that is very unlikely to happen because one can basically keep winning all their bets until they reach $100,000 from just $1,000, so though it is possible but the probabilities of it happening are very low.Those who go after guaranteed wins are mostly going to lose because there is basically no guaranteed win in sports betting as anything can happen and sometimes, even the favorite team loses against the team that is always losing and isn't performing so well at that particular period.",

There is a lot of fakery out there, where people claim to predict certain outcomes but if you dig a bit deeper, you find out that they actually \"predicted\" results after the outcomes were realized, or simply that they hype up their wins while ignoring their loss ratio. Many of these people will be asking for money in order to access their tips, but that is where they really source their income. If they were genuinely profitable then they would have no need to create such a side venture as selling profitable ideas, they'd just use them.",
