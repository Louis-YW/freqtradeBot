Get an old laptop or desktop you never use and use Electrum for BTC or use MyEtherWallet for ETH and ERC20 tokens. Don't connect that laptop to the internet and you got secure cold storage. If you have a hardware wallet then use that.If you have any fiat on exchanges. Withdraw them into your bank account ASAP!. If you have any stablecoins either convert into real fiat and withdraw into your bank account OR buy crypto with those stablecoins. This FTX contagion keeps spreading. Right now the issue is with Silvergate bank. They are one of the banks which transfers and holds crypto for most exchanges. The banks stock value has already plummeted 50% since Nov 8th. They claim to have little exposure to FTX. However why is the stock going down everyday??? If Silvergate bank stops operations. What will happen? Who knows. But I don't want to find out.I don't believe anymore \"We are fine!\". \"We had little exposure to FTX\", \"etc\".",

Now all of a sudden everyone is fussing about it. This is another hype, but if earlier it was hype for the growth of the price of crypto currencies, now it is a hype for the withdrawal of crypto currencies from exchanges. It was necessary to prepare for this in advance, and not when exchanges freeze funds and block withdrawals.",

The warning is all there, it's all up to you if you are going to still keep your coins on changes. The ones staking coins will have second thoughts about withdrawing them, the earnings are hard to resist and it's easier to dump also when the coins are in the exchanges.

I think a lot of people don’t understand that dynamic and invest based on the premium alone, which is why so many people have lost money with it. However, we are nearing a point where the fees are worth the risk in order to capture the premium while Bitcoin is cheap.

I'm sure crypto users on forum already know that exchanges are not the best depository of assets that will give them security, exchanges are places to trade so it's hard to believe the panic would set in as soon as they read a topic like this.But actually unexpected things may happen due to media action, they can say that millions of bitcointalk users have to plan withdrawals on crypto exchanges.

If you have accumulated enough coins from the past then you can lay low for a while because the market is toxic right now and it can affect your decision making. It's impossible for stable coins to dump unless if that stable coins are same with UST but we should properly pick a stable coin or the one which has a better reputation. It's not wrong to have some fiat but cryptos are still way better for some reason.",

There is some article out on Twitter about 3AC borrowing BTC from Genesis and converting them to GBTC.Do you remember in 2021 when you were offered almost 10% to lend your BTC? There was also huge premiums on futures BTC and ETH. Something like 2% a month.So I think 3AC borrowed BTC from Genesis, converted to GBTC and wereGoing to capture the premium but the premium disappeared. So now I think they owed a lot of money to Genesis and went bankrupt.It was fine for the last few months because there was no bank run on Genesis. But after FTX collapsed people requested their crypto back from Gemini, which was held by Genesis and they don’t have enough to cover withdraws, hence they need to raise funds.Basically contagion keeps spreading.",
