  "content": "hello everyone, an issue was brought to my notice by a friend concerning a Bounty manager called \"Bounty Star\" he brought a bounty called \"BITCOIN FUTURE\", from my findings it was stated that the bounty was ESCROWED to him by the project owner which was $15K to pay the hunters after project ends. so from my findings the bounty started on February 12, 2023, 04:00:32 AM and lasted for six weeks which 26 March was the last day but the the total number of stakes was calculated and finalized on 25 march.on that finalized spreadsheet the Article, Tiktok was just only 1 stakes per accepted hunters but to my greatest surprise some strange names whom did not participate on the bounty was inputted by Bounty Star and was given 5 and 4 sakes, so i was i very curious to know how come about those names so i decided to track those names listed bellow:1) Bitcointalk Username: Urmi3from my findings this name did not register or submitted a report  on the ''BITCOIN FUTURE'' bounty but was given the highest stakeshere is his profile link you can scroll to verify my claim.: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3480406;sa=showPosts;start=40preadsheet proof: https://imgur.com/ySV6Dtv2) Bitcointalk Username: GwenStacythis Username again only submitted proof of Authentication on the bounty but did not report, and was given the highest stakes.[https://imgur.com/6p7lc9z]here is his profile link you can scroll to verify my claim.: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3460161;sa=showPostspreadsheet proof: https://imgur.com/S7fHZY63) Bitcointalk Username: yashmahfuj1200this Username was last seen on March 03, 2023, 09:51:20 AM and has not ever submitted any report but suddenly given the highest stakeshere is the proof of las seen on he forum: https://imgur.com/nLR82uc here is his profile link you can scroll to verify my claim.: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2788728;sa=showPostspreadsheet proof: https://imgur.com/AJXDENH4) Bitcointalk Username: kenaz198this Username was not registered on the bounty and did not report, and was given the highest stakes.here is his profile link you can scroll to verify my claim.: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=145178;sa=showPostspreadsheet proof: https://imgur.com/xyxYbCK 5) Bitcointalk Username: ARNI4this Username was not registered on the bounty and did not report, and was given the highest stakeshere is his profile link you can scroll to verify my claim.: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3534372;sa=showPostspreadsheet proof: https://imgur.com/0PcePEZ6) Bitcointalk Username: INMYROOMThis username was last seen on November 04, 2022, 04:31:52 AMhow come he was given the highest stakehere is proof: https://imgur.com/8j7zEyypreadsheet proof: https://imgur.com/2XuuQcm7) Bitcointalk Username: dammyzee1This username was last seen on December 25, 2022, 12:24:56 PMhow come he was given the highest stake when the bounty started on February 12, 2023, 04:00:32 AMProof: https://imgur.com/Vv59Wu5preadsheet proof: https://imgur.com/Keifo3fThere are still so many fake names and deferent wallet address on the spreadsheets but when they noticed the complaining of hunters they decided to hide the wallet addresses. i believe Bounty Star was paid handsomely by the project owners, why then go for hunters reward, from my findings 80% of the bounty Allocation was stolen by Bounty Star and left with hunters nothing.A friend told me they use his username on the spreadsheets and when he confronted them on the chart, they his message. here was his message to them: https://imgur.com/57l6upj here is bounty spreadsheet : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qeMswjPPtRL1B2ggTB8yCvX5YBuK4Z1g7O9WhSvUA7o/edit?usp=drivesdkand here is the bounty: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439538.0I was very sad when a complained to me about this scam, i was compel to open this thread for you guys check and air your opinion on this unjust act.  thank you.",

In the best possible scenario bounty manager is completely incompetent and managed to get tricked by bounty scammers while more probably scenario is that he simply inserted those accounts in order to get some free tokens. Btw, have you confronted him about all this and if yes, what was his answer?Quote from: YOSHIE on March 26, 2023, 04:41:33 PMWe here don't see anything strange about the account above, I don't know what we see with the account above.

Most of the campaigns prohibits any form of cheating, why the manager himself engaged in cheating? Very detestable from a manager. Such managers can not be trusted.",

Seriously, you should read a post and comprehend its meaning before putting some bs spam post. You want to make a comment, that's fine. Just stay on topic and throw shade where it belongs.I am arguing the fact that people think managers are paid well. They're usually not. Then I'm saying that likely the names in the sheet are prob his alts or bs so that he can collect more money. Most of these bounty managers are shitheads that are just looking for opportunities to scam people IMO.",

      "body": "I have just gone through the bounty thread and I noticed it was $15k worth of the token not directly $15k that is awarded to the campaign, so to me at this price may varies. Down to escrowed funds only 300 pieces of their tokens was escrowed with him meaning, 300 token is worth $15k at the time of sending to him this may be true or false it was based on what I found out from the bounty thread.Now let me clear you something you don't know very clearly about project owners, they will give you a fake token price in other to release little percentage of their tokens mainwhile at the list period it will worth zero whereby anyone who participated in the campaign may not get at least 1$ after the campaign ends or even if at all the campaign will get listed in an exchange before you possibly trade to get something out of it.Keep in mind that before any campaign is being launched there are some certain rules and regulations that managers always fix in other for hunters to abide to it. So if in a way you couldn't abide to his rules and you got messed up doesn't mean he should called scammer, then lastly I know what it takes to manage a project it's very difficult to fetch out all fake entries though it is the managers fault not to get a credible hands to work with him to fetch out all those people with fake entries, as a matter of fact hunters are the most difficult people to handle.NB: I am not siding on bountystar nor even siding for you but I am only giving my statement based on how difficulty it's to handle bounty's. However if you had any issues or complaint you should better pm to query him as to know why such thing happened maybe he would get those accounts phished out from the campaign. Btw is this your alt account because you refused to use your main account to create this accusations lol 😂.",

There's no verifying before they can enter a username or a link. I remember a few bounties where some scammer had entered a bunch of high ranking names on the forum at the time. I messaged a couple because I was pretty sure they didn't participate in bounties and found that I was correct. As a manager you sort of need some help from users in finding cheaters. You also have to check the work and look out for duplicate entries who just gave a different forum name. There are all kinds of cheaters in bounties period.Quote from: T3PR00T on March 27, 2023, 12:09:59 AMQuote from: MainIbem on March 26, 2023, 11:28:34 PMIs there anyway those accounts could be pernalized or bounty scammer randomly picked those accounts from unknown user and then fixed their wallet?

You cannot control if someone used your name and account link. You also cannot be punished for something on a spreadsheet unless it can be linked to you 100% and you were cheating a bounty.",

They were not saying they are letting go and hiring four different people in a row, they're saying that they have to change the spreadsheet four times during the duration of certain bounty because people keep asking for revision, changing their database --I think most likely they're referring to address--, complaining for missing stakes, etc., which they consider as something they can't afford to keep on going and keep \"compromise with the rules\" because it's participant's responsibility to keep the data being submitted \"clean\" --worth mentioning that the rules of no address change is applied by many BM--, hence the new set of rules below the paragraph stating that no data may be changed after initial submission, complain will only be handled by the end of the bounty and no more late submission.",

For him, this forum is just a source of bounty hunters to justify in front of his employers that he was still doing something. A neutral or even negative tag won't change anything, because he doesn't care.Unfortunately, neither the bounty hunters nor their employers seem to pay attention to such warnings. I guess they think that creating cheap but useless noise on social networks is a good thing.",
