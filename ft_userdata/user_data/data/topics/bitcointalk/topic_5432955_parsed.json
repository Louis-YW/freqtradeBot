      "body": "Quite made some profit during third quarter of last year because of esports betting,to be specific- on TI. Had some lucky guesses which generated profit. But since I've lost somehow of a huge amount on the first quarter, I did not earn that much if I would sum it up but still, I am happy for my gambling result in 2022, hopefully, things would be better for this year. I am planning to engage more with fighting sports 'coz there are many line ups for this year. But ofcourse, I'd be needing to manage the risks and avoid multiple bets I guess to make it a less risky gambling routine.  But in general, 2022 is a good gambling experience and is a better one compared to my 2021 losses.",

No unscheduled deposits whatsoever meaning I haven't made any money apart from what I'm making in my job and business. This 2023, I'm trying to make some changes on my gambling habits and focus more in sports betting and slowly leave casino games behind. I like slots and roulette still because they have fancy multipliers and bonuses across the board, but for dice? I think it's time to say goodbye to it.Hopefully 2023 brings a fruitful year to our gambling activities. The first 3 days of gambling brought forth some greens in my initial bankroll. A good opening for the year but it can be better.",

I mostly bet on football because there's a high chance upset can happen rather than the other sports where upset is really hard to happen and the odds isn't really so high. However my betting result isn't always make profit, maybe this year I will suffer losses since luck isn't always happen lol.",

Although I'm not going to be surprised if there are gamblers not really jotting everything down in paper and look if they are plus or minus in this gambling activity.",

It can give us wins and losses on the same day.If you gamble or bet just for fun, then don't think about losses or gains.Because basically you can only win or win if luck is on your side, especially if you only use a relatively small amount of money.From my personal experience, playing with more capital can also provide greater profit opportunities. However, everything must have the right strategy and analysis calculations and the method of placing and the amount of bets is also very influential.",

I just spend the money I win or immediately forget about what was lost. But I think it is very important to have such records because even if you don't see gambling as a business, its good know if you gained or lost a the end of the month/year. This year I have decided to record all my gambling activities. The polls would have included option for \"No record or Don't know\"",
