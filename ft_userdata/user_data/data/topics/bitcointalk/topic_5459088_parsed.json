  "content": "Here is a post that drew my attention to writing this topic. The biggest hedge fund manager, BlackRock sometime in 2017 criticized Bitcoin, and presently they have filed for Bitcoin ETF approval and gradually becoming a Bitcoin evangelist, not only BlackRock, other folks like Jamie Diamond, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and Micheal Saylor the former CEO of MicroStrategy just to mention a few.https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1677710039660855296?t=_GSHd-hYZ89mRszuoEu2UA&s=19My perspectiveJust as the future is uncertain and no one can predict the future, The government may seem aggressive today on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption, and tomorrow change their stand due to high pressure and demands from their citizens to use a technology like Bitcoin in the coming years. If BlackRock CEO criticized Bitcoin in the past and later turns to embrace what he kicked against, the government may do so because the government is run by friends of these individuals or people who own these companies, and they may have influence When it comes to government matters.El Salvador is a leading example of government in the front run of Bitcoins adoption and when more countries' governments follow suit in the race, other ones will not want to be left behind, they too will join the queue. Let's have a general discussion, what is your standpoint?",

As long as governments are sure what they will gain by adopting bitcoin, then they may adjust in the future. Of course it won't be easy, it takes time and it takes a lot more to expect the government to change its policies.I expect the government to change its attitude towards bitcoin over time, but they shouldn't rush into it without a lot of consideration. We know they don't want to get out of hand and don't expect a lot of people to be breaking just after the adoption is announced, that includes preventing abuse and other precautions.",

      "body": "Definitely the government will have a change of heart towards bitcoin not because of blackrock or other institutions but because it is a technology that is here to prove many wrong. Just like the internet and some other technologies came into existence and it was frowned upon by people and later embraced after finding out how easy it could make the daily lives is the same way bitcoin adoption will rise. As we grow into more economical difficulties caused by inflation, fiat devaluation and the hassle of doing cross boarder trading many will turn towards bitcoin. And if the number continues to grows then as we all know the government they wouldn’t want to be left aside so I am sure they will jump on it just to regulate it and possibly place taxes on it. So yes many people begin to realize how bitcoin can solve some of the modern day problems faced in economy/finance more adoption will grow and so will the government also relaxes the laws against bitcoin",

I don't think we are going to experience centralized governments massively adopting BTC as a legal tender, especially the governments of first world countries, because in my honest opinion they don't have to and they won't achieve anything doing that, instead they'll lose some of their censorship strengths.What we can expect is more governments setting a standard regulatory framework for BTC, they will accept it as a financial activity in their country, but they will regulate it and earn taxes from it.",

Also, with the positive reception of the masses to what they're doing with the ETF, they know that they can make a lot of money with it that's why they're trying to push it with all their might. They're an entity trying to make more money, so it makes sense that their perseverance on the matter is really high. The governments however, they don't have anything on bitcoin yet. They are still reliant on banks making them money and bitcoin is something that could change that. They are still trying to weigh their options before going full steam with bitcoin. Í",

Let's watch what the future brings. For sure there would be several countries which really be having that reconsideration but the numbers wouldn't really be to outweigh to those countries who would really be totally opposing such idea or acceptance in according into its existence which it isnt really that shocking if you do ask me. Government would really be always having that bad impression towards Bitcoin or overall crypto space Dont make ourselves that too optimistic or really that hopeful that there would really be some change of heart or decisions that they had made because whether we do like it or notthey would really be making up decisions on which they would be able to see that it could benefit them, but if not then it wont really be that shocking that they would really simply ban it or prohibit which its better to anticipate or expect that way rather than on being too optimistic which it would just bring out disappointment.",

They're probably just weighing things around so that they won't compromise the bigger institutions favoring Bitcoin with their policies, so, they really are careful in balancing laws and reviewing the benefits of it upon adoption.",

I don't believe governments in underdeveloped nations will accept Bitcoin as legal tender; so, the only thing that might happen in certain countries that have yet to legalize Bitcoin is that its residents will be allowed to use Bitcoin at their own risk.",

Let's have a general discussion, what is your standpoint?Technically, I don’t see the government adopting bitcoin now or anytime soon as long as they continue not to have control over it. Bitcoin being a borderless and decentralized digital currency challenges the traditional notion of centralized control and makes it less likely for governments to fully adopt Bitcoin without imposing restrictions. It is also important to know that while governments do not fully accept bitcoin, individuals within the government use and invest in bitcoin on personal level but this doesn’t necessarily reflect on the government’s official stance.",

For instance, we have some countries where you cannot do anything related to crypto because of their government's aggressive policy and the question is, will the government later change their minds?
