  "content": "This user is using the Ai tool that is prohibited in the Signature Campaign and doing scams of almost 80$ in the signature campaign. Most of the post of this user is written by AI Text Generated Tool please take a look and check the details I have mentioned.Scammer profile link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3431739AI Tool Generated ContentQuote from: bbigtart on April 20, 2023, 01:22:43 PMsomeone's habit of making topics that are trending outside the forum will be brought to the forum as well, this happens because these issues are being widely discussed such as COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the rejection of the USD rejection. so often such topics become the dominant topics of discussion in forum a because of their relevance to the current situation and their impact on everyday life.However, in bringing such topics to forums it is sometimes important to ensure that the information shared is accurate and valid, and that the discussion proceeds in a way that is dignified and respectful of different views. This will help ensure that the discussion goes well and benefits all members involved in the discussion. I think it's normal for things like that to happen in forums about discussing topics that are being talked about outside the forum.Proof Links:[/url]ArchiveAnother AI Written Text and Many more postQuote from: bbigtart on May 23, 2023, 06:45:10 PMWhat we need to know Entrepreneurship education plays a very good role in developing the insights and skills of students and students. Because through entrepreneurship education we can help foster an entrepreneurial spirit among the younger generation and prepare them to face challenges and opportunities in today's business world.Entrepreneurship education at schools and universities can provide opportunities for students to learn about various aspects of business such as business planning, management, marketing, finance and innovation. This really helps them understand the processes and strategies involved in starting and running a business. And with entrepreneurship education can also help improve creativity skills, problem solving, leadership and communication skills. because this is really needed in developing an entrepreneurial spirit and preparing students to become successful entrepreneurs.Especially with today's economy, where employment opportunities are limited, having entrepreneurial knowledge and skills can provide a good alternative for students and students to create their own jobs. They can see new business opportunities, develop innovative ideas in business and turn them into successful businesses. The Government's role in emphasizing the entrepreneurship education curriculum in schools and universities. With the development of a curriculum that includes entrepreneurship subjects, training and guidance for teachers and lecturers to increase their understanding of entrepreneurship.With a strong entrepreneurship education, there will be an increase in the number of innovative and competitive young entrepreneurs, which in turn will drive economic growth, create jobs, and have a positive impact on society as a whole.Proof links:ArchiveAI Generated Content Regularly Uses in Signature compaign Quote from: bbigtart on March 26, 2023, 01:21:01 AMSocial media was originally created as a platform to socialize and connect with people from all over the world. However, over time, social media users began to use it as a means of marketing their business. This is because social media is an effective way to promote products or services to a wider audience and build relationships with customers.It is undeniable that many businesses and companies use social media to expand market reach and attract new customers. By using the right social media platforms, businesses can build their brand, generate more sales, and increase their online presence. However, that does not mean that social media has lost its original function as a means of socializing. Many social media users still use it to connect with friends and family, expand social networks, and seek information and entertainment. In conclusion, even though social media is currently also used for business, this platform still maintains its function as a means to socialize and connect with other people.Proof Links:Archive",

The campaign manager banned him from any campaign - and now he deserves to be on the manager's blacklist.I also don't know if a user using AI deserves to be called scammer or not, but he's just dishonest and have no ethics about its quality which is not liked by any manager and many forum members in principle.",

He also uses the signature campaign BetterCallRaul.it which is managed by Royse777. And there he also gets paid every week.I do not mean anything.

If he just do pure effort to post quality contents for sure he will never go in that situation. But unfortunately his lazy so I agree to people calling him a scammer since he choose to cheat on his campaign just to get money without doing big efforts. Good that he is busted since this case remind to other people that they should not use AI tool to take advantage on their campaigns.",

I know my opinion is not the most popular here, as I understand that it is one thing for someone to engage in massive copy-pasting of AI-generated texts and another to use AI to gather information and from there rewrite, modify or extend what is generated. I see that in the case of bbigtart we would have both cases.While here in the forum the debate focuses on how to stop AI from being used on it, outside this cave the debate is simply how it is already being integrated into our lives. The latest is that google is going to integrate it with the search engine. In the same way that first google lens came out and now you have it next to the search engine without having to go and open the App separately, the integration of AI with search engines will allow us to get more accurate information faster and with even less effort.The debate reminds me of the people you would still meet years ago who refused to have cell phones because they said the powerful would have us monitored and such.",

A good idea would be to hire an individual only to detect whether participants under their signature campaign are using AI. The pay grade for a bounty manager is only enough for them while adding extra employee that will check regularly each post will just an additional cost. Royse have a bounty program dedicated for busting this kind of cheating. I think it's already enough to bust them using the payment of the cheater.Doubt it!A minimum of $50/week let's assume a BM earns. Hire someone who can detect for just $10 per week. Considering 5 projects the hired individual gets paid $50 per month. Nothing is impossible if a BM wants to safeguard the brand name. Being transparent and professional is an USP of a BM. Being proactive makes it more lucrative for a project to employ that BM.",
