In 2019 election the former president buhari didn't win the election but it was rigged and the supreme did nothing when the case brought to their table,  in the last election it was very obvious to see that the ruling party rigged the election,  even a blind man knows that the election was rigged and everyone was expecting the judiciary to do needful but to our surprise the judiciary was in support of the ruling party, everybody thought judiciary won't compromise in their judgement buy it was very . It is a very big Shane that judiciary don't have power to do right things, they allowed politicians to use them the way they want, judiciary have really lose their respect.",

It is obvious that those who are supposed to protect our laws and constitution are the people breaking them and damaging the our reputation home and abroad. I'm not surprised sha because the CJN is an appointee of the president so he is bound to do his biding. Until certain things are changed like removing the appointment of CJN, INEC head and IG of police, from the president, nothing will change in Nigeria. \"He who pays the piper, dictates the tune\"",

You cannot say they don't have no enough evidences to trace the solidity of cases. Just merely interpreting the law alone or looking out the INEC guidelines which was pass at the National Assembly it takes care of 95% of the cases. P.O provided a lot of evidence in the sense that there was no much time to compile all his evidence, on what ground did the presidential tribunal judges throw all cases away and refuse to accept statement from expert witness on subpoena. Mind you another judge in another state use those same reasons to disqualify another candidate as in the case of Sen. Abbo.Also read the way the American George dispersed judicial judgement it was very easy to understand even the lay man could read the judge statement and know how cocclusions were drawn. Go and read the Presidential Election tribunal Judgement fill with Ambiguity and empty technicalities.",

In Nigeria is the other way round, as our judiciary in Nigeria  is a lost of hope for the common man, due to the fact that the whole system is corrupt and they turn white to black in favor to the highest bidder of the case.Justice is far dead in Nigeria because the law only affects the poor, while the rich people and connected people are above the law. This is what is killing Nigeria as a country and messing up the whole economy and political system. I think that everything will be judge in the favor of the president on seat because he is on power and have access to keep them appointments and big bribe because he is in the position to buy the judiciary and put them in his pocket. The love of money has killed the honesty, truth and uprightness in our leaders which make then to allow the wicked rich people manipulate the poor through the way that they rule and lead the citizens. Imagine how the economy is getting worst everyday by day and nothing can be done about it because the people that are suppose to stand up and oppose the government have been bribed to shut their mouths.",
