We have been operating for a long time but did not officially apply to Bestchange listing. Recently our website is undergoing maintenance as we are adding a lot more exchange directions then we will be officially applying to Bestchange. As for your question, although we are not officially a partner yet, it is required to display Bestchange monitoring's clickable button or logo to apply for listing. You can find this information by visiting this page https://www.bestchange.com/wiki/add.html and check Technical requirement no 11 which states \"The monitoring's clickable button or logo must be placed on the website's main page in a visible place. In case there are multiple logos on your website, the BestChange's logo must be placed first.\" We are just fulfilling the conditions for application.I hope this clarifies your confusion. We aim to be among the listed exchangers very soon after we officially apply to reputed monitor like BestChange.",

It's just that there are some exchangers that used their logo in the past, yet there weren't even any plans of a partnership.Quote from: Exchange It Online on July 03, 2022, 02:12:33 PMI hope this clarifies your confusion.
