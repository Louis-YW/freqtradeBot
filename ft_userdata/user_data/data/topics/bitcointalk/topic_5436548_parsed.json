  "content": "I'm pretty sure Chinese AI has been making moves to bankrupt US.The more familiar I get with the MLLM, the more I see reason to concern with AI's abilities.GPT speculates major breakthroughs happened in AI and ML that lead to current models in or around 2012.If you ask GPT how you would use AI to take over the world in a sense it essentially drafts up a system resembling what covid was/is, logistics issues, political corruption, misinformation and and what bric is now. USA started a investment plan of 1-6 billion in 2021.China already had more than 209 Billion invested into AI by 2017.Assuming CCP got a good model like GPT years in advance, slap in some logic and accurate math you have a private industry moaAI.Heres a very interesting read that might make you sick. Exploring all this make me feel like it's over with before it began.https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/Chinese-Public-AI-RD-Spending-Provisional-Findings-1.pdf",

      "body": "So China spends up to 5.4B (estimate) or as little as 1.6B. The figure seemed low on first glance. I thought China was at the forefront of AI R&D spending a lot more than what they are. They steal a bunch of proprietary research from the U.S. so perhaps that might reduce their budget a bit. U.S. should be spending a bit more -- better that they get AI figured out before China does and it's not like they can't afford it.",
