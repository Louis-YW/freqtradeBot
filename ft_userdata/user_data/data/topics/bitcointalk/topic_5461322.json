  "content": "Good day all,Maintaining the entire blockchain ledger and running a full relay by general public is a crucial, foundational aspect of BTC. It's also a substantial commitment in storage, bandwidth and increased need for security. While IMHO those who can, should do it as a public service, there's also a possibility of network somehow compensating those who maintain full ledger. I wonder if this has ever been pondered : can it be done in a way that would incentivize it for individual, independent users vs corporate agents with quasi-unlimited resources ? What are the downsides and upsides beyond obvious ? What does the future hold - what will full ledger look like in a decade from now and how viable will it be then for Joe Internet to keep it on his home network ? Has anyone considered a compression algo that would specialize in good blockchain performance ?Currently (2023) full ledger is about 435 Gb.  Bandwidth consumption of 200G/month in UPLOADS is reported norm, if left unchecked. I feel a systemic risk to the network that may drift momentum towards large users with unlimited storage and bandwidth in a way that may jeopardize security and decentralized nature of the network.On other hand, how critical is most of that data to stability and security of the blockchain ? Perhaps my concerns are out of ignorance and it will do just fine when less then 0.01% of all self-hosted nodes maintain a full copy. With respect unixux",

So all the nodes running are driven in the sense of contributing to the network.But having your own full node gives you complete privacy, and mitigates the reliance on someone's information.Alternatively, you can find ways to run nodes in the most efficient ways and already an idea proposed by @n0nce[Guide] How to run a Bitcoin Core full node for under 50 bucks!",

There are other advantages to running a full node, like full 'independence' and privacy; you can validate transactions locally and you don't have to connect to third party servers. If the incentives you are looking for is through earning, there is none, but you can always buy mining gears and try competing for blocks.",

Is that truly a negative thing, though? Its easy to get lost in the weeds and start worrying about every little thing. Perhaps major firms will be able to exert more influence. Perhaps they will alter Bitcoin into something completely different. Or maybe, just maybe, they'll aid in its development and steadiness. It has nothing to do with incentives or algorithms, but rather the network's general trajectory. Bitcoin's strength is in the hands of its users.

(its time you drop the cult narrative)you dont need to shout its 1999 and storage is limited.. (its time you drop the cult narrative) its 2023even if you dont want to use a microSD card the size of a fingertip and went for more conventional hard drives. you can get more then 1TB for under $100 in this modern age of post millenial mindset. remember its 2023 not 1990sanywaysif the byte miscounting cludge and the segregation separation were to be removed and everything went to a lean legacy tx format of utilising the SAME 4mb space per block allowed today.. the storage would grow at the same rate as today.. not faster. and the amount of tx count per day would grow meaning the cost per transaction would come downalso it would stop the ordinal scam tx's from being in blocks meaning even more room for genuine transactorsalong with a better fee formulation than the current:  legacy *4. and instead have utxo age <70= *100 would penalise other types of spammers too.. meaning less spammers and only penalise spammers for premium fees. would reduce fees even more and make more room for genuine transactions to take priority thus allowing more people to get priority sooner rather being treated as second class users. thus make people want to be active and help support the network and want to run nodes more regularly.. all without \"required storage would grow much faster\"again looking at a 4mb block space as being the equivalent of 208gb per year (1tb /5 year) meaning $0.06 a day storage cost comparing to todays ~$2 per tx FEE cost... its the FEES that make less people want to use bitcoin daily as most people on the internet already paid for a modern device just to get online so the device cost is not really a main thought.. its the utility of a payment system cost per use. when fees are over 30x more then storage and storage comes as standard with most devices these days.. storage is not the main concern",
