If this features is actually that active I will like to give it a try, but then again why just telegram?

This raises questions about the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of the project.The return sounds too good to be true and might be a deceptive tactic to lure participants. Also, the lack of transparency and the potential for scams raise significant red flags. It's crucial to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing any funds.",

You can ask all this there from support and talk on chatbox with others.Im not support i just belive on this becouse it's fast payouts Everyday and transparent and they have chatbox so If anything wrong users can talk openly with each others i have not find any kind of good service like this.I don't think the creators are so dumb to scam the idea of project is good so If they can earn long term then i don't think they are so dumb to scam.Also Tron price can grow high so it's best that its on tron blockchain.",

This is how it will work, first, understand that there is no transparency here, there is no way to know who won exactly they could send coins to one of their random wallets and claim the owner of that wallet won, meanwhile the participants in the game won't have any means of knowing who that wallet belongs to in other to confirm if he or she really won or not.Imagine 100 persons send 1000 trx each, they send back 300 trx to each of those 100 persons for them to appear legit, then send the remaining trx to one of their wallet, and claim the owner of that wallet won the jackpot, meanwhile, that wallet belongs to them, and then, they move on to another round, they keep repeating this over and over again scamming unsuspecting Victims their trx.This is a scam guys. Please avoid.I have try your stake.com and never win and there is no transparent service the support not reply 24/7 and even this i never called this scam i just Avoid.Most of the casinos are full scams If this one the tron is good then it's best If this one is bad then no hope for anyone who want to earn crypto.Anyways it's all about Community If Community is strong project can be successful If Community is weak project don't stay long term.That's bad Im tired of anything i come to crypto to see results to improve my financial situation that's why this one seems to be good becouse 247 fast support and transparent.I tell you If this one is scam then i leave crypto it's my last hope i have tried so many things and everything taking money not giving money.Im in crypto to recive money not just give out and nothing return i support this project becouse finally i see something different You are joking right?, Stake has millions of players who bet on the site every day, and out of this millions of customers, there are hundreds of customer who win nice sums of money every blessed day, this claim, you can confirm it by taking a look at the payout log, and you can even check out the profiles associated with those wins to be sure it's a real profile - am I even telling you this? You said, you have played on stake, you should know all of this already, not until I explain them to you.What I did tell you is, you are in the wrong place to advertise this scam betting program or what ever you chose to call it, here is not like telegram where you easily ban and remove user who oppose the legitimacy of your claim, it is completely different here, take this scam else where bud, you wil not find a victim here.Before you even compare this to Stake, get this program of yours to become as big as stake first. Everybody have to start from somewhere.But does stake customer service reply so fast ? Do they pay out so fast ? And Im sick and tired of waiting and kyc Im not DOG Im human Im tired about treated as dog also i got email from one of the so called \" legit \" casino that Im winner but i have to first make deposite i m tired of still scams.You are tired of it all and you think the best thing to do is start your own scam activity right? Not the way to go bud, you can do better than this.And by the way, talking about Stake, if you do not know if stake customer care responds fast or slow, then that makes you a lier, because you truly have never played on stake as you claimed, if you wanner proof me wrong, then post your bet history from Stake let's see, I can post mine if you want, but post yours first to proof me wrong.Stake.com is one of the fastest payers when it comes to crediting winnings and processing withdrawal requests, any stake user can testify to this, Stake did not become the biggest online crypto gambling casino by displeasing their users, they became the biggest because they are one of the best, take it or leave it.",
