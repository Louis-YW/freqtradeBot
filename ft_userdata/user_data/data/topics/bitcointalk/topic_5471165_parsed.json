  "content": "According to coinmarketcap (which we all know is owned by Binance too), binance.com has the biggest volumes for cryptocurrency futures... https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/derivatives/I'm just wondering if we're supposed to believe that they're actually ahead and also ahead by that much. I mean for sure a big part of these volumes must be wash trading or outright fake, but binance does indeed appear to be the most liquid exchange if you have ever traded on it. By looking at the order book while trading it's obvious that there's a lot of activity with orders being filled all the time. However Binance isn't all that known for having the fastest mechanism or most sophisticated engine. I tend to like to trade on BitMex but it's obvious by the price spikes that their volumes are very much inferior to Binance. So while BitMex has a good engine liquidity is an issue. If the volumes are anything close to resembling Â the truth, Binance is the undisputed champion in that. Which is a big plus for futures. But also this is a catch22 issue kind of... People don't trade at futures platforms with a better matching engine due to low volumes, Binance continues to dominate, volumes in other platforms remain low...",

      "body": "I have made use of OKX and Bybit very well and I like their derivative trading. If it is volume, my trades are often filled fast also in spot market, not only in future market. The only reason I use Binance more is the trading fee which is lower. I have used Kucoin before and it was also good. I do not really like their trading fee. I have also used HTX and it was also good but I do not like the trading fee. I was addicted to Bybit but their trading fee is a bit higher than Binance. Aside that, it is a good exchange for me. Also OKX which I used very well last year was excellent. It even has low withdrawal fee than Binance.I hate Binance because the exchange is too centralized and encouraging their customers to use BEP20 network. If you deposited BEP20 token, it is very fast for you to move it to your derivative market account, but if you deposit other coin, it will take many minutes if not up to almost one hours sometimes for some coins. I remember when I deposited USDT on arbitrum network on Binance, it mire than 20 minutes before I was able to move it on my future account there, unlike on Bybit which is faster. About the fee, Binance will soon unlist BUSD, and the fee will increased as people will only use USDT trading pairs, although still slightly cheaper than on most exchanges. Without the fee, I would have left Binance since long time ago.",
