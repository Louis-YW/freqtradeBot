If you want to expand your portfolio even more, Bitcoin is always a good choice, especially when its price compared to the last ATH is more than 50% lower.",

You don't have bitcoin so buying it will give you an opportunity to join in the bitcoin holders and wait for profit. Etheruem is the second option. The price dropped from its ATH , you can buy to add to what you have but store in your personal wallet where you have control.",

I do have Nano wallet, so all my coins are with me :-)And on the BTC, I am sure it is good price to enter now, however, the possibility of DCAing ETH and SOL is really attracting for me :-)If not them, I am sure I could just grab some BTC.

The current price of BTC dropped from 30k to 28k so I am expecting more drops to happen soon. You should target for a buy to be safe below 25k level. It is always better to buy bitcoin at low price because when it starts rising it will be going beyond what any other altcoin can even accumulate, which is already evident in the last few years charts.You are free to accumulate any other coin you wish to. But performance wise, BTC is the winner in all cases. While trying to buy altcoins, you will end up drawing money that could have been used to buy BTC and given you a better profit in the long term.These decisions you have to take on your own, but dont worry, it will shape how you decide in future when facing the bear market. What most users say here is also from their own experience.",

Your other options are not that bad, but I trust that BTC will give you a better ROI compared to them. Again, with BTC you're sure the investment won't find its way into thin air.",

You will not lose anyway even if the price dips more because the price will eventually recover after some time, but DCA could be a very good move right now since none of us knows the bottom price for bitcoin. However, with those altcoins you mention, if you still have extra funds to buy, then do it. They are those established altcoins in the market so your money won't still end up in a waste.",

Anyway, thanks.  Personally I would think that not having any bitcoin in your portfolio is a problem, some people do not like to buy bitcoin because they think their profits are not going to be as good as if they invest in altcoins, and while in some cases they may have a point the truth is that you need to always have some bitcoin in your portfolio.So if I was you I will invest in bitcoin whatever capital I had available, and then once I had done this I would think about the possibility of using the DCA strategy to lower the price at which I bought those altcoins you are holding already.",

I still consider $30K is still cheap for Bitcoin, though it may go lower in this year. Focus on bitcoin and you won't be disappointed with it. Seeing the market continue being in bearish, bitcoin buying through DCA is certainly the safest way to still end up not missing the opportunity and be profitable when bitcoin recovers, However, i am not saying that ETH, SOL and DOT will never be good for long term investments, but knowing that they are cheaper than bitcoin, then you can buy them and hold easily if you consider them that will bring future profits too.",
