      "body": "The S&P 500 usually gives hope to traders and motivates them to feel joyful because it gives an easy-to-follow bullish technical signal from this crossover on the price chart because most of the big rises of Bitcoin often begin with a golden cross, and this signal makes us know that the market's short-term gains have exceeded its long-term gains. It is, in fact, a prior prediction of higher prices in the long term, but perhaps not all golden crosses lead to a significant rise, and what I know is that the Bitcoin currency has witnessed eight golden crosses so far, and three of them were with gains that exceeded 100%, and in my opinion, the golden cross on bitcoin often motivate traders on entering the market and buying with fresh bids.",

Technical analysts are generally based on historical data & patterns, but it is not a perfect science. The past performance of any pattern doesn't mean that they will also work in future. I think it is a good idea to use multiple indicators to have better understanding of market sentiment/condition, and to confirm your trading decision.",

It has lot of impact on the crypto actually. One of the article that I was reading earlier this morning suggest same thing. Big investors actually look for the signs of investment into crypto from S&P 500 moves, how they are earning in the current timeline and whether there is any chance if they are having their investments into the crypto market as well. One fine article does suggest big investors actually look for FED chairs speeches all the time to see in what direction an economy is moving and how it could indirectly affect the crypto market. I am positive that you technical analysis data could be related with the increased in bitcoin purchase activity or at least it will spark one day.",

Many time BTC tried to break but buying volume is not enough to do it. Btc need a very high volume to break 24k and then 28k resistance. In previous 3/5 times resulted in BTC Dump.We accept that this is one factor, to some extent it has an effect but there are some other factors like whale pump and dump, economic situation which may has negative affect and Golden cross not work. My personal thought is that we can see small correction in BTC to liquidate long users and weak hand also start selling than BTC price will sudden skyrocket.",

Yeah, if I remember correctly, this is the not the first time, and for sure not the last one that we are going to see in bitcoin. And in the past, it's surely a hit or miss on it. Of course there could be correlation with other market, but we all know that there are times that bitcoin will suddenly divert on these so called indicators like Golden Cross and others. So we will see if this could trigger something big, or obviously, nothing has happen in the last couple of days for us, the price is still very volatile and fluctuating between numbers.",

This scenario is possible because Bitcoin is finding it hard to stay above 23,000, although it broke psychological barrier of 24,000 after 0.25% interest rate increase announcement. which was generally welcomed by all markets. If correction happens, it is expected to drop to its next strong support of 21,700 on weekly chart. Despite this, I remain optimistic on Bitcoin, as long as it stays above its 200 days simple moving average, currently around 19,700.The Golden cross in the S&P 500 index didn't have any immediate impact on the price of Bitcoin, it might be a positive sign for medium to long term outlook.",

The challenges many households facing, such as difficulty in affording mortgages, are also cause of concern. Regarding potential of bull run in the stock & crypto market, there are many factors to consider beyond golden cross , such as, general state of economy, corporate earning, global events.

In addition to golden cross of S&P500, similar golden cross also occurred on Bitcoin chart on Feb 7th, 2023 when 50SMA crossed 200SMA. This provides further evidence of potential uptrend in Bitcoin. Several well-known analysts predict that if Bitcoin can surpass 30,000 price level level and stays above it for few weeks, it could trigger significantly in Bitcoin. however, it is important to remember that technical analysis is one part of the larger picture, fundamental factors can also impact price of Bitcoin. https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-golden-cross-confirmed-what-next-for-btc-price.htm",

Sometimes price is up with death cross and sometimes price is down a lot with golden cross. You can check those crosses and price of Bitcoin in the past with chart. You can also check those crosses with SPX that has longer data than Bitcoin. No constant impacts to confirm that price will move up or down after those crosses occur.I only know and believe with halving, price will be up.",

Historic data of SPX proves that it is not a too good indicator.I'm thinking more about a fractal between 2019 and 2023 runs and how Bitcoin ended 2019 year with price that is not too high from start of 2019. Perhaps history will repeat in 2023, let's say it will not repeat 100% but very similarly.Some tweets from Lukasz_wydra give you more datahttps://twitter.com/lukasz_wydra/status/1625066779058794497Quote from: Lukasz_WydraFor the first time in #Bitcoin $BTC history, we are witnessing a death cross between the 50-week and 200-week SMAs. To know what to expect let's check out how the SPX has behaved in such situations:1958: +36% in 39 weeks,1963: +65% in 301 weeks,1970: -20% in 5 weeks,1974: -35% in 24 weeks,2001: -29% in 56 weeks,2008: -29% in 20 weeks.As you can see, this kind of death cross on the $SPX chart is also extremely rare. Moreover, the turn of the 1960s/70s changes the narrative around it from bullish to bearish.https://twitter.com/lukasz_wydra/status/1622900213504528389Quote from: Lukasz_WydraThe golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day SMAs has been confirmed. Here is what effect it had on the price when it appeared the previous times:Jan. 2012: -39% in 29 days,Jul. 2014: -76% in 183 days,Jul. 2015: -29% in 39 days,Oct. 2015: +69% in 7 days (and +6592% in 781 days),Apr. 2019: +159% in 64 days,Feb. 2020: -60% in 24 days,May 2020: +28% in 89 days (and +573% in 329 days),Sep 2021: -16% in 7 days (and +46% in 57 days).",
