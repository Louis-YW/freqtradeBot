Crypto is highly risky so either LUNA dies or rises from the ground up.That is where they got it wrong, is it UST that matters, it would have been better if the they did not even go for a stable coin in the first place. Investors are after coins that is not stable, they should work on Luna. Quote from: Abiky on May 16, 2022, 11:58:00 AMWhat do you think? Are there hopes for LUNA to recover some time in the future?

If you want to gamble, buy Luna, you can be very lucky or lose. So I shouldn't be the one to tell you that you should invest the amount you can afford to lose.",

      "body": "No chance for this coin to recover from the hell. Even when terra luna developers were using whole of available reserved funds to pump UST and this will not make the price to go back again to the top. This company and its holders have been loosing everything. No chance for recovery even some parties are also against the new proposal to issue the new token as a replacement for the old tokens that were minted during the worst day last week. I do believe this is the end for this project. Even when they were introducing various proposal so many times and the result will always be the same",

Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. hope is always there, because in the crypto space nothing is impossible. but I'm trying to be realistic here. my conclusion is, as long as UST is still around, luna will never be able to recover. because the mechanism of UST and luna are interconnected, so luna will be forced to return the UST peg. and this method proved unsuccessful, therefore UST had to be removed from the market for whatever reason. then luna can recover slowly with a record of burning coins periodically. but this method also has a lot of risks starting from the demands of UST holders, issues of investor confidence, and many more.",

I mean, recovery is possible, we saw some crazy things happening in the crypto world, but if something happened once, there's a high chance it will happen again! So even if we see some recovery be sure there's another drop waiting around the corner... basically I see this as some pump and dump scheme! I guess betting on Terra LUNA recovery is a very risky bet! People who decide to take this risk should be aware of it, so don't invest more than you can afford to lose it!",

Last week the reserve Bitcoin worth $3.5 billion created to defend and support the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin saw a total crash and no one have any idea how such a large sum of funds disappeared. This shows the reserve inadequate to prevent depegging. This means the mechanism have failed and the chances of recovery is less than a percentage. The team might plan something else than recovering Terra Luna.Around $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in Terra has just disappeared",

That would be a nice capital increase. But I ran into a big problem these days, many exchanges have disabled LUNA wallets and blocked I/O, so buying LUNA at current prices is not such an easy task.LUNA could start rising again if the team solves something with UST, if they did not start UST, LUNA would never fall to these values. If they are going to bring back the old mechanism and tie UST to LUNA again, it will definitely not be credible, because if another market crash happens, all this history will repeat itself.",

The fact that the LUNA price has dropped to almost zero gives some hope that someday it will rise to let say $1. However, in my opinion, there are so many interesting and good projects on the market that there is no need to risk another mistake of LUNA team. After such a big defeat, it will never be possible to regain the previous position on market for LUNA.",

Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. The question is \"At what price will we ever say that LUNA has recovered?\"Because anybody can say \"If it will reach 1 cent then it has recovered\" and some will say \"If it goes 10 cents then it will continue to go high therefore we can say that it has recovered from its recent downfall\".Right now its hard to know the future of LUNA but its just good to see the developers especially Do Kwon making some recovery plans to their project because if this happens to other project, there might be a chance that they will just abandon it and run away. On the other hand though, LUNA did their first step to their \"recovery plan\" and that is to make a fork which is now called \"Terra Classic\". I don't know TBH what will be the future outcome of this but CZ and Vitalik base on articles aren't like it. Also, we already saw that they are doing some recovery plans but another question to their recovery is that \"Will the investors come back and trust the project and invest to the project again?\" because its hard to build the trust again knowing that many investors already lost their money just by investing in LUNA. I'll make myself updated with this LUNA and what they will be doing to recover.",
