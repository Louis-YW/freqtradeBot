The amount may change in time but it is better to spend a certain amount every time. $1000/month or $500/week, it all depends on your finances. You do this till you reach your target wealth and then you can do whatever you like. (buying a home, car whatever) Since bitcoin goes always up in the long term because of its limited supply, this is a foolproof way of making money. Don't be fooled just because btc has been going sideways for a while, it will shoot up again after the next halving.",

So apart from what you just said, another wrong way to accumulate Bitcoin is by taking a loan to invest in Bitcoin, which I can it the worst thing any individual could ever think of doing, because the fact that Bitcoin is a volatile currency which have the potential to rise in price, so does it also have the potential to fall in price too, whereas you loan interest is constant, which makes it a wrong decision to ever make. Because its better to invest little by little in Bitcoin than taking a loan.",

DCA is not about buying the dip. It's about buying in a certain time, like 1 a week or once a month, regardless of the price. It's of course better to buy as much as you can, so looking for the cheapest bitcoin is a great idea, but it's not DCA and DCA is not the best way to accumulate. It's great for people who are to busy with other things and cannot watch the price waiting for it to meet their target, like some traders do.

It's okay to not want to be a short term trader and hodl, but every bull market has a short window of opportunity for maximizing the profit.

We cant really just put everything on one thing which we know that the risks would be always there. Dont make yourself that really too impulsive in towards of thinking that you had missed out the golden train because this is the main reason on why you would really be making yourself that desperate. Well, its their choice to make since its their money but thinking up realistically then it would really be better that they would really be minding about those risks involved or attached to it.There's no assurance that this would last for a life time, there's no assurance that it would be able to surpass a million per coin but since we've seen its potential and the previous achievement or milestonesthat it did reach out then there's no doubt that this is where investors been holding and been hoping into.",

I've come to find out recently that some people have the wrong meaning of \"invest what you can afford to lose\". They believe it's money that is not useful to you or something, which is funny because there can be no money that is not useful. Some believe it's spare money. Money that you do not need for anything at the moment. While this may be correct, if you wait for money that you don't have a use for at the moment, you may not invest in Bitcoin. There are things you have to forego in other to invest in anything, including Bitcoin. The saying \"invest what you can afford to lose\" means to be reasonable in your investment. Don't invest all the money you have when you know you have nothing else to live on. Don't starve yourself to invest. There are very important things that need to be done, maybe for yourself or your children, don't forego things like that and use the money to invest in Bitcoin. There's no point having money yet you can pay the hospital bills of your kids. There are things you can sacrifice, and there are things you can't. It's left to every individual to decide what he can and cannot sacrifice. The bottom line is, to be reasonable, be responsible in your investing.",

I don't think an accumulation target should be a priority because it can cause your mindset to be focused on achieving that target even when you can't afford it at the time, putting you under more pressure and, in the end, you'll still take money out of the investment to pay bills and for personal expenses.
