Another thing depends on the listed exchange; some exchanges have big investors that want to buy everything listed. Another is just a manual pump, from the project owners and the exchange itself; they buy and sell within themselves at a high price just to keep the price up and attract victims of dumping.I will advise you to avoid such coins or tokens because they can most times cost you almost all your assets. You might end up buying the token when it has reached its all-time high and they want to dump it; if you buy within that period, you will be among those who will be victims of the dump.Â Am not saying all 1-minute pump tokens are scams, but they are usually likely to be; even if they are not, after a giving period, the price will have to fall so that it can move as it was suppose to move in a normal market, which might take time again to achieve its ATH again.",

      "body": "Likely you are checking those IEO that is trading for the first time on the exchange they are first listed, or an ICO that has just been listed. If people buy it more than sell it, the price will increase. But what if people only just dump it as it is listed, its price will reduce. Buying or selling of the coins within that minute is what that will determine the price.",

      "body": "Some said insider trading and some said huge buy pressure. Well, I think it's none of that that OP is looking for. When Binance or a big exchange lists a coin, most of the time, the price starts with a significantly higher amount than it should be. For example, I sold $0.10 per EMC (the trash coin) when they were listed on xt.com, that was pretty much higher than the usual price as EMC later after a few minutes, was trading at below $0.01, I got more than 10x price.Well, it's the market maker who buys at a fixed price at the beginning of the trading starts. They are especially supposed to be providing liquidity on both ends. Besides, exchanges charge fees as a form of native coin/token in addition to the fixed fee payable in USD. Exchange later tries to pump the coin so they can sell their holding at a better price. This is one of the experiences I had when I worked with one of my clients for listing their project in some mid-level exchanges.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on April 07, 2023, 09:26:22 AMInsider tradingInsider trading happens before the listing announcement. Say Binance will list ABCD coin, they will announce it tomorrow. There will be a huge buy before Binance makes the announcement and as you provided some links, it will be followed by a dump when people rush into buying the coin.",

A whale can place a huge buy order which can sweep through at the available sell orders in that minute to the top.This happens every time high demand IEO coins/tokens are listed into an exchange",
