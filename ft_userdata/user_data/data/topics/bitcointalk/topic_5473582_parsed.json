      "body": "Hello Bitcoin Forum,We understand that there have been concerns within our user base regarding account security, and we would like to take this opportunity to address the issue comprehensively.First and foremost, we want to address that falsely accusing the company of stealing is a serious offense, and in this case it’s totally unfounded.BetInAsia has never engaged in any activity that involves stealing funds from our users. Our commitment to providing a secure and trustworthy platform for sports betting remains unwavering.Upon investigation, it has come to our attention that the incidents of stolen funds were largely attributed to users accessing phishing websites that mimic Orbit Exchange, our partner platform. These fraudulent sites aimed to deceive users that are googling for Orbit-related keywords, into providing sensitive information, consequently compromising their accounts. We strongly advise all our users to exercise extreme caution and only access BetInAsia through the official channels to avoid falling victim to such scams.In response to these incidents, we have implemented additional security measures, with a particular emphasis on the importance of two-factor authentication (2FA). Since the introduction of 2FA, there has been a significant reduction in unauthorized access and incidents of stolen funds. We urge all our users to enable 2FA on their accounts (both on Portal and OrbitX) to enhance the security of their personal information and funds.We understand the frustration and concern that such incidents can cause, and we want to assure our users that BetInAsia is committed to continuously improving our security protocols to safeguard your accounts and funds. Our customer support team is available around the clock to assist with any security-related inquiries or concerns.We appreciate your understanding and ongoing support as we work together to maintain a secure and enjoyable betting environment for all our users. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to our Customer support team.Best regards,BetInAsia Team",

After stealing user usernames/passwords, why did the hackers place bets that they would surely lose? How did they get the money out of there in the end? Why didn't they, like all other crypto thieves, just withdraw to their addresses?on the link shared by the OP, there is information that there is already a proven accusation that your employee bagged the money.",

Did you write this long post to convince us that the only problem you have is that users use malicious links and that they are safe if they use more protection methods?You did not answer any of the points mentioned in the OP. Your entire position increases suspicions that there are thefts taking place on your platform, and that you are evading answering complaints about them by moving the discussion to another direction. This is the worst thing you can do because users are not stupid and will not be fooled by these methods. I think it would be better to confront the real complaint and try to present a better image in a better way.",
