  "content": "Coingecko warns:\"We have received allegations that SAFUU is connected to Fitrova and Clever DeFi, both which has been abandoned. Proceed with extreme caution \"And SAFUU lost 41% of it's value in just one day. I knew this was a suspect project, but in my experience ( I bought 17 SAFUU, now I have 22 ), it works as intended, they do deliver on their promise, but pay you in SAFUU tokens... not their fault that their tokens are losing more and more value every day, and may eventually go to $1 or something ridiculous like that. P.S. I tried to sell my SAFUU tokens yesterday through bogged finance ( their default trading app ), could not do it. I mean the trade seem to work, but all my SAFUU tokens are still there, 2 hours later ! No Idea why.",

At one time it was in a very good position and everyone invested in this project.But lately I can see that the price has gone to a much worse position.Maybe there is a bad news or somewhere they are in trouble, otherwise the price should not be so dumping.If you do not have any such problems then the price will definitely go up.",

      "body": "So my transaction did not go through even though the BSC SCan reads \"Success\" Very strange.Anyway, I still got my 23 SAFUU tokens. Probably headed to much lower, but I figured as long as the project is still working, it's just a matter of waiting for the bear market to be over. I also thought about the very real possibility this project may try a \"rug pull\".... frankly, I think the chances are extremely unlikely now... as the value of the tokens is lower and lower, there would be no point in trying to steal millions of worthless tokens. The most likely scenario for this or any other DeFi project is that they do a pump and dump, so they get as many people on board as possible, pump the price back to all time highs, and when it's very near the top, runaway with all our money. So the main risk here is the project getting wiped out by the brutal bear market... which is a risk you'll find in most other legit low caps",

      "body": "This project was a fraud since it was started. Very big APY and run by scammers. People are only gambling with this one and when they can't get out from there at the right time and they will be scammed. The scammer who behind this project already tried to go out. The dump was occurring caused by so many people who have been investing in this scam project already known about the truth and scammers who behind this project keep manipulating the project. coingecko has been making a very good decision for sure by giving awareness like that to make people realize if this is a fraud project even since it was started.",

      "body": "it was called a shitcoin for a reason, maybe the fact that you couldn't do anything with your SAFUU even trying it in bogged finance caused by the smart contract being modified by the devs or something else.if you've seen the devs are dumping SAFUU then it could be called a literal scam, even right now the warning from coingecko itself is like a death sentence for shitcoin like SAFUU since its value relies heavily in its reputation.",

      "body": "I'm pretty sure is my lack of DeFi skills that caused the transaction to fail. ( I migrated from a centralized exchange to a DeFi wallet less than 1 week ago ) I will try again once I figure out why it didn't work out.Regarding SAFUU, no need to call every project in the red a scam... especially without specific evidence or references to back it up. SAFUU is down, yes, but so is every other altcoin in crypto. We're in a bear market !Anyway, who knows how things will play out for some of these projects.I did go and check the trust score of SAFUU on Scamadviser, and it was 100 / 100",

      "body": "Okay, so if we assume it is a scam ... can anyone tell me.. how is it a scam ? I've been on it for a couple of weeks only and as I said earlier it is delivering on its promise so far.. 2% daily compound interest on your investment. The caveat is you're paid in SAFUU tokens ( I've earned about 5 so far ), so in a bear market, this will not make you money. The tokens are today worth half what I paid for them, and I thought I was buying them low. But getting back to SAFUU... I think the project is perfectly sustainable during a bear market, as the payouts get lower and lower and the tax rates remain high. The thing is they need to survive this bear market of the project may go under. In a bull run, having 100 SAFUU tokens may make you a lot of money in a very short amount of time, but you'll still need to pay taxes to sell. In a bear market, you will still lose money with SAFUU just like you would with any other ALT coin, and even with Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
