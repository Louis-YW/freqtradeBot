  "content": "QuoteTL;DR BreakdownU.S. advisory warns about the risks of storing funds in payment apps like PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, and Payoneer, as they lack the same protections as traditional banks and credit unions.Bitcoin emerges as a secure alternative due to its decentralized nature, providing users with sole ownership and control over their funds.Recently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a prominent U.S. government agency responsible for safeguarding consumer interests in the financial sector, issued a warning about the potential risks associated with storing funds in payment apps such as PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, and Payoneer. The advisory emphasizes that funds held in these payment apps may not benefit from federal deposit insurance, leaving consumers vulnerable to financial uncertainty in case of app failures or bankruptcy. This advisory has sparked discussions about the security of alternative options, with Bitcoin emerging as a potential secure alternative due to its decentralized nature and user control over funds. This article delves into the U.S. advisory on payment app risks and explores Bitcoin’s growing adoption and its position as a secure alternative in the context of cryptocurrencies.The Risks of Payment AppsThe CFPB’s consumer advisory raises valid concerns about the risks associated with storing funds in payment apps. While these apps offer convenience and ease of use, they do not provide the same level of protection as traditional banks or credit unions. The lack of federal deposit insurance coverage for funds held in payment apps means that if an app were to fail or go bankrupt, consumers could potentially lose their money. This vulnerability has become more apparent in recent times, with several bank failures highlighting the importance of understanding deposit insurance coverage when choosing where to store money.In contrast to traditional banking systems, payment apps rely on third-party involvement in financial transactions. This introduces an element of risk as users are subject to the policies and operational stability of the app providers. Instances of frozen accounts or issues with app providers can result in restricted access to funds, causing financial inconvenience and uncertainty for consumers.Bitcoin as a Secure AlternativeThe advisory on payment app risks has led to discussions about secure alternatives, with Bitcoin being considered as a potential solution. Bitcoin, as a decentralized virtual currency, operates independently of any individual, group, or entity. Its core principle of self-sovereignty gives users sole ownership and control over their funds. Unlike payment apps, Bitcoin does not rely on third-party involvement in financial transactions, which eliminates the risk of frozen accounts or bankruptcy associated with centralized systems.Bitcoin’s resilience and immunity to central control have made it an attractive option for individuals seeking financial security. Its decentralization means that it is not subject to the policies and stability of any particular institution or organization. This quality has led Bitcoin to be described as “digital gold” due to its perceived ability to act as a hedge against inflation. The portability, security, and divisibility of Bitcoin further enhance its appeal as a secure alternative to traditional financial systems.Growing Adoption of BitcoinBitcoin’s adoption has been on the rise in recent years. Major banks, financial institutions, and payment apps like PayPal have started offering crypto-related services, recognizing the demand for cryptocurrencies and the benefits they offer. The involvement of influential figures like Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Michael Saylor has also contributed to the growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin.While it is important to note that Bitcoin is not exempt from price fluctuations, its decentralized nature ensures that funds are not exposed to the same risks associated with payment app accounts. The price volatility of Bitcoin is characteristic of its market and is influenced by various factors, including investor sentiment, market demand, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic events. However, the fundamental security provided by Bitcoin’s decentralized design remains intact.Bitcoin’s decentralized and trustless nature makes it resilient against single points of failure, ensuring that no central authority or entity has control over the network or user funds. This has instilled confidence in individuals who are concerned about the risks associated with third-party control over their financial assets.ConclusionThe recent U.S. advisory warning about the risks of storing funds in payment apps has highlighted the need for secure alternatives. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and user control over funds, emerges as a potential solution. While payment apps lack the same level of protection as traditional banking systems, Bitcoin’s self-sovereignty and independence from centralized control make it an attractive option for individuals seeking financial security.Source: https://www.cryptopolitan.com/payment-app-risk-bitcoins-secure-alternative/Of course, it is well-known that you should not be using Paypal as a bank, given their business practices of locking you out of your own account using \"limiting\".  But the inclusion of the other payment apps inside this advisory is particularly telling. For one thing, it's indicating that these kind of services can basically shut down at any time, or fail, and the result would not be much different to FTX and Celcius.This being a financial watchdog , naturally they are going to tell us to store our funds in a bank, it being \"FDIC insured\" and all. But we all here know better than that, right? Non-custodial wallets are the best, should you use them properly.",

Let's say it's like owning a house: no matter how strong your doors and windows are, if you leave the keys lying around, it's not going to end well.Moreover, while banks are FDIC insured, what's often overlooked is the insidious enemy called inflation. Your money in the bank is continuously losing purchasing power, which might be more detrimental than a temporary app failure.However, I want to strike a note of caution here. While Bitcoin is indeed a secure alternative due to its decentralized nature, it's also subject to extreme volatility. The recent bear and bull cycles can attest to that. This is not to downplay the potential benefits of Bitcoin, but rather to highlight that all financial instruments come with their own sets of risks and rewards. This is a debate worth having!",

      "body": "This is yet another good news, I love reading things like this and I hope everyone and government see the need for people to be in full control of their money/assets. The custodial apps and businesses like banks, PayPal etc have directly and indirectly reaped off people of their money, many of them like E-gold, Liberty Reserve, GlobalDigitalPay, C-gold and more just disappeared with people's money due to issues with the government and intentional scam. Such wouldn't have been with the self-custodial approach as you have all security to yourself, there can't be a foul play.It saddens me when I read how people are being misrepresented, mistreated and scammed by the so-called Paypay, most of these are plain scams but they always hide under the legality of their operations to do this. And the government that is supposed to protect the rights of people would even do nothing about it.At times, they do the right thing if you threaten them with court suits and some with big money that could go to court often win the case, but what about the many more that couldn't afford it?They will just take away your money just like that, citing one excuse or the other. Bitcoin will solve all that.",

I think they just want to warn people to not rely on other companies to store their wealth and use banks or other alternatives. Not really surprising since people can get really stupid sometimes. Not sure how it works overseas/in the US, but in my country payment apps have a limit on how much money people can store (around $700), so it is unlikely that people will use them to store all their wealth in the first place.

Such risk is really small, but it does exist.They are trying to sell insured services at the end of the day, so using a risk of bankruptcy/uncertainty will definitely get mentioned. They can also tell people about the lack of control over their funds when they use a third party, but that is counterintuitive if they want to sell banks. Even if they mentioned Bitcoin, I believe the end goal is definitely to push people to use banks more.",

A lot of people are just lazy and do not want to take their own security up by themselves. They don't trust themselves enough. So they rather keep it with a centralized company that can keep it safe for the. I don't blame them. It's what they're used to and change can be hard. We were born into this system and a lot of factors will try to stop us from breaking out of that system because the system makes it comfortable.Just as @slapper said, Bitcoin also comes with its own risk. There's no point in using Bitcoin for its security purposes and not being able to keep your coin secured by yourself.

What it is better for is to have your money at your disposal immediately but I don't know about how much you are referring to as in Europe it doesn't help to have a lot of cash because there are countries with cash payment limits as low as €1.000 ($1.075).I know it's not safe - but sometimes I also think all options have their own risks. For me it's safer to keep some money in a personal safe than in a bank account for whatever reason - but of course some people are more comfortable saving it in a bank account. After all I don't live in any European countries, so paying for something in cash in any amount is fine on my part.Quote from: Poker Player on June 10, 2023, 03:51:17 AMQuote from: _BlackStar on June 09, 2023, 01:54:23 PM-snip-That is if you have a lot of money in the bank. Tens of thousands of dollars at least. Amounts like $5K you can have in the bank and you won't have any problems withdrawing it and much more depending on the country.That's certainly true - but we're talking tens of thousands of dollars now, not a few thousand.",
