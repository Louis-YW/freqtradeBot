  "content": "The rate of quality posting has grown over the last week, which is wonderful news for the naija board. I'm extremely thrilled about how people are taking posting on this board more seriously these days. There have been a good number of serious members and high-quality posters on this board but in recent weeks, the progress has risen and some low-rank members have also raised the quality of their posting. I also saw a post from Igebotz on the board sharing technical knowledge, which will be very beneficial to everyone on the board and, over time, I believe, will help everyone's understanding of the technical side of bitcoin.[EDU]Bitcoin wallet UTXO and ConsolidationEveryone needs motivation to give their best and if you don’t get rewarded for your work you maybe discouraged, maybe that have been the reason some of the members here don’t like to engage in discussions and who knows if it might have been one of the reasons none of our merit source application for our local board have been approved by theymos yet. I think hugeblack and Cryptopreneurbrainboss have contributed much to this fantastic improvement. Let’s keep up the good work and give theymos a reason to approve our merit source applications.",

There have been lots of engagement within the board and increase of membership is very impressive. The commitment of members are very much appreciated as this would definitely put our local board in the good eyes of Theymos to respond to our request because that alone would steer up more actions from members to do more.I would also want to appreciate CryptopreneurBrainboss and hugeblack for their commitment and dedication in engaging with our local board. Their Swift actions are well applauded and I pray that their merit allocation be increased so as to enable to them meet up with the demand of our local board and monthly basis as per their schedule.",

Bro this is true of matter, as the rate of post and quality was already here in the forum and especially our local board here but the matter wey be day dull the whole issue na the lack of merits given to these post them but like you said this recent activeness of merits source to the local board has indeed awaken some of the sleeping quality poster and I believe say if this continues our local board will be ranked as the most active and lucrative board here for the forum. I aslo pray that this recent increase in quality post also reaches out to theymos to add and make source of our reputable member as merit sources too.",

Motivation is hardly a goal here and I don’t see it yo be better enjoyed when sort out for or when required. I think it’s sweet when it’s dropped on you where you didn’t expect it or having more on a work where you expected less. Trust me, I know the feeling from an early time but then, times change and now, I don’t know but, you could still discuss while expecting nothing.Your offering your opinion and that’s the important thing. Your opinion goes out to help handicap an ignorant situation and that’s quite satisfying as well. On the course of merit source application, I think some has been up way longer than many users on the forum but still, no approval and not just for the Nigerian board but, an additional to what the forum already has.If there is one thing you should know, the forum changes very little and most times, out of the desperate need or to a wide range what the changes could bring.I will continue to applaud those that continues to do there best and be active on the board like CrypyopreneurBrainboss. While we seek appreciation, are these guys been appreciated as well? It’s ironical when your not up the ladder.",

      "body": "Yes merit is a good incentive to do or make better posts but must there be always incentive before we do something for ourselves? My teacher once told me that \" don't read to pass, read to know\" and some of the posts that are coming up, seems like they are more interested in merit collection than anything else. Well, I stand to be corrected on this. It's a commendable effort @hugeblack and @cryptoprenuerbrainboss have set out to do but sometimes this question keeps bugging me; will there be much effort placed in our posts if there is no hope of getting merits?",

Since we received our local board the Nigeria local board have been up and doing in all aspect of activities but are lacking behind in merit rewards. This has been the major challenge which makes is looks like efforts are not appreciated and morals are much down because of this. Members are not looking at it but are trying their very best to making sure this board remains active and lively with lots of quality posts, activities and rewards such as the monthly charts and rewards form @Cryptoprenuerbrainboss and @Igebotz, the best post amongst the junior ranks by @satoprincess and the merit intervention on local boards which @hugeblack  started and already. We pray our merit source application be granted unto us soonest so that much efforts of the Nigeria board would be appreciated accordingly. I know it is not easy but I believe we will get there with time. Let us all join hands to building our very own platform to a greater heights.",

The Nigerian users here in the forum really played a vital role to make this happen, and they should not relent and continue to make the naija local board a resourceful local board that both local community and non-local community members can learn from by disseminating quality posts always. We can do more and I’m sure we can have what all other local boards have in this forum to also help the local board a better place for its members. Thank you for this reiteration call for improving the local board, quality post matters and it’s paramount as long as this forum is concerned.",

I would still encourage every member on this local board to be at their best and still create more quality posts and comments, because I know that the opportunity that brainboss and hugeblack have given to members here might not get to everyone at once, so just continue to make a quality post and believe that your post will definitely receive merit.",
