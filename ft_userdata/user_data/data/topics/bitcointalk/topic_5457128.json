You're absolutely right, his posts here is irrelevant, this is a gambling section, OP posts should be put in bitcoin or trading discussions thread. Talking about bitcoin yields good understandings and solid ideas generates since bitcoin is prominent project in the market. I only shared essential information of bitcoin to my peers who I'm comfortable with, because with no one knows what the other has in mind, so inother to be on the safer side, all news should be kept to oneself. I barely even come up with bitcoin discussion, I contribute only when I feel my opinion is needed.",

Please move the thread to bitcoin discussion that better suits it. Meanwhile, it is not always good to discuss your bitcoin investment or earnings to the public. By public that means people you don't know and people you are meeting for the first time. You can become a target or people can start accessing base on the value of bitcoin and probably you were just hyping and fanning your ego",

      "body": "First of all OP, you posted on the wrong section. This section is visible and labelled as gambling discussion so you shouldn't post topics like that if it is irrelevant to the board. Secondly, this is like an easy story that can be made up. I am sorry if that's what I am thinking of your story. But if the story tends to be true then I am wrong with my thought. As we go outside, you know that everyone is striving hard to get on their shoes and have a better life. If you're just shopping out and talking loudly about your investments and suddenly a stranger comes out and joins your discussion, it is inappropriate to have that reaction of being too open with the topics you're discussing. What if that guy is just pretending to be the owner of that restaurant where you're eating because anyone can easily claim that? And it turns out that guy had already sighted you hours ago or days ago because you've exposed yourself that you're also into Bitcoin. Please be aware of the dangers of discussing things like this on public because of this very known attack: $5 Wrench Attack",

What do you think?what I found ODD is when you say suddenly about owner listening when you obviously an aware of someone can hear you talking (specially in restaurant) and also as he shared His good experience, that is not sudden but that is for good share .",
