      "body": "My search about this news did not bring any quality information why FSC want to ban the company from receiving deposits and withdrawals in crypto but they said if customer have any question or needs help they can contact them directly. QuoteCrypto withdrawals will soon become unavailable. Exchanging crypto for traditional currencies and vice versa is also going away. If clients have funds in crypto accounts/wallets at FXChoice, the company strongly recommends that they withdraw them before 26 December. Clients can sign in to my.myfxchoice.com, check the balance on all Live accounts and Wallets, and go to Withdrawal to claim their funds.Starting 12 December, FXChoice will not be accepting any new crypto deposits.If you have questions or need help, FXChoice encourages you to contact the company using any of the channels via its site, including live chat, email or its ticketing system.I got that from this site https://en.myfxchoice.com/fx-choice-news/crypto-transactions-are-coming-to-an-end/",

FSC may have barred them for some reasons that are yet to be clearly stated and I think FXchoice is kind enough to have ask her customer to withdraw their funds between now and 26 of December. Customers can move on to another broker.",

I think this will happen with some countries until there are successful experiences in regulating cryptocurrencies, which may need another light from The United States or the G7 countries before we see more countries taking serious steps.",

This may affect other forex brokers as well. Does anyone have more information on this?It been a long while I heard anything about a crypto ban in the globe rather we consider the boarders opening up to the tech. Banning crypto because you perceive that it is used for some illegal transactions doesn't make sense. Currencies over decades have been used for the same purposes and no one has banned them. It is understandable to regulate them and create laws that prohitbits them from been used for such illegal transactions but an outright ban only puts you in total darkness.",
