Though I suppose mining companies are probably the vast majority of the mining being done in the US these days.Also it just completely misunderstands the entire role of Bitcoin mining, though that's not surprising considering most people think mining just wastes electricity. Sad to see policy proposals based on misinformation though. The point would be to basically punish what govt sees as a bad use of energy, but of course bitcoin mining is enormously beneficial to society on its own (not even counting the fact that its beneficial to bitcoin which itself is enormously beneficial to society). If bitcoin mining is gonna be taxes why isn't all electrical usage taxed 30%? Makes no sense to single out a specific industry for its electrical use. That's just horrendous policy.Govt is going the wrong way with Bitcoin just due to lack of knowledge and misinformation.",

One is Canada and the other is Russia. Since obviously the second one is a no-go zone, not for US business at least, we're left with miners migrating from the US to Canada, pretty simple in terms of logistics but that would obviously lead to even more centralization of hash power.Quote from: pooya87 on March 10, 2023, 06:09:42 AMIt's a good thing considering how US regime has been anti-Bitcoin and anti-freedom.

Is there a chance that American gangs and cartels might be interested in mining internet money?There would be consequences for sure however we don't know if the sanctions will come to effect that aggressively. In addition, America will have to segregate the unit rate for every state and county based on consumption. They will have to create a cost chart based on the unit consumption. Let us say that the average household is consuming around the 30 units, then electricity board could set that if anything goes above 30 unit then that would be commercial. While mining can eat up even more electricity then they could keep different rates for let us say anything that goes above 100 units. The real question is whether they are going to pay that much money. Simply no, because it won't be profitable at all.

Not even for something so ridiculed as cryptocurrency. It's one of the tenants of their political philosophy.Quite funny, Democrat voters own more coins but want more regulations also, Republicans have a lower percentage of coin owners but want fewer regulations and laws. Just went again over the text, quite interesting:QuoteFirms engaged in digital asset mining would be required to report the amount and type of electricity used as well as the value of that electricity, if purchased externally. Firms that lease computational capacity would be required to report the value of the electricity used by the lessorfirm attributable to the leased capacity, which would serve as the tax base. Firms that produce or acquire power off-grid, for example by using the output of a particular electricity generating plant, would be subject to an excise tax equal to 30 percent of estimated electricity costs. There is no mention of renewables, so if it goes like this if you have a solar panel farm that you use to feed your miners you're still going to have to pay a tax even if it's for personal use and you're not tied to the grid and never have been.Not going to pass! Never!",
