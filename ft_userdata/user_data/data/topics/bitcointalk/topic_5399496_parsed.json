When you want to buy a new miner, what do you care about most? Some miners seem have higher hushrate, well the price is too much higher, is it worthy trying?I see very expensive ASIC prices and a very long payback.https://www.asicminervalue.com/I would risk buying a modern ASIC if you have very cheap electricity and you have the opportunity not to sell the received bitcoin until the next price increase.",

      "body": "For me the most important thing is how long it can take for one to make and ROI and possibly start profiting afterwards as soon as possible. Of course calculating an estimated interval of ROI is very difficult because of varying factors such as network hash rate, operating cost and coin price fluctuations, but one can get a rough Idea. You can then decide from their which kind of miner you could buyThe miner could be very expensive but have a quicker ROI as compared to the cheaper one or vise versa. You have a lot of things to consider, but think about it in terms of long term investment as well.",

      "body": "It's also going to depend to the cost of mining aside from the cost of buying those miners. There's an alternative on it, although it's not as easy as mining.But if you think that it's quite hard for you and you can't bear the risk to mine for some reasons, you could have just use the budget for mining into buying bitcoin or any coin that you prefer and wait until it pumps a little bit or more then sell. It's less of the hassle and confusion.",

      "body": "Actually, the hash rate is not so very important if you have units that have a 1-month lifespan, and buying miners in unknown brands will lead to no support so only buy a miner with lots of support. Sample Antminer or Avalon these miners have lots of support on their website even here on the forum you can find lots of threads and guide about these units. If you care about efficiency then Antminer s19 pro or their new miner called s19 pro+ hyd running at immersion(water) cooling.If you still want to get more suggestions from an expert then try to contact this offordscott he will also help you to choose what is the best option to buy.

      "body": "As @BitMaxz has already given out you some suggestions like of support from the miner is essential to further running up the setup properly and getting help from them in case of need.But what are your budget allocation as they are significantly high in prices and you need to import them like if you go with Antminer but specifically you will have to use ASIC machines to have yourself in this mining race so will need to give your budget and which coin you are planning on to mine specify that also.",
