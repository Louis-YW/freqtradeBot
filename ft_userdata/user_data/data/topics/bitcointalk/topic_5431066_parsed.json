      "body": "Kazuto needs to fight more aggressively and fair because after what happened to the fight of Casimero in Japan against his countrymen, people are now considering fighting in their country is not a good choice at all because of how poor they actually managed the last one when their boxer cheated in the middle of the day and with the camera zoomed to his face. Also, the referee has something to do with it when he stops the fight because of clear drama. Anyway, that's just how they are when they really wanted to help their countrymen and hopefully Joshua will do his very best because if he doesn't give Kazuto a hard time, and take the chance to knock him down, he will end up losing by unanimous decision.",

This year, the Joshua vs Estrada fight was supposed to take place, but after Estrada refused to fight and the title, Joshua became the only WBA champion in the first lightest weight, so he did not enter the ring for a year and a half. Whether such a simple one will benefit him will be seen very soon, but definitely the age difference is on his side.",

So, I think have a little interest in this fight, but judging by their records, I'm rooting for Kazuto Ioka to win as the is the most experienced boxer. Both are not a KO artist, so that does not excite me.",

Hmm, any official source or link that tells many people are now considering Japan as not a good choice for a fight? Anyways, never mind as Casimero and Akaho didn't fight on Japanese soil but on South Korea although the referee in charge was Japanese. And don't worry about the result of that fight as from NO CONTEST it was now changed to a TKO victory for Casimero. Akaho admits that he was clearly struggling against Casimero.Anyways, that should not be a topic here. Going back to the topic, the name Kazuto Ioka is quite still fresh for PH boxing fans after the Japanese defeated one of the PH greats Donnie Nietes way back in June this year. Can't say who has the better edge between Kazuto Ioka and Joshua Franco as both champions won't reach their respective status if they are not good. Although Franco is roughly 6 years younger than Ioka, we can't consider the age as a big factor here.",

What's more, Japan is a rich country which implies there is a high probability that they will be the one facilitating world title events very much like the USA and Europe. In a literal sense, you need not necessarily venture into the hometown of your opponents to be impressive. But I also agree that going to fights anywhere will make some good impressions. It is risky, robberies happen whether you are the champion, Manny Pacquiao was robbed in Australia. Possibly one of the reasons Floyd Mayweather Jr. never fought outside of the USA.",

This is because he's fight with a same boxer and the result is always same, when he fight with Andrew Moloney he win via unanimous decision, when he fight with Oscar Negrete the result is 2 draw and 1 win, but it's ended via split decision.I'm more interested to bet by winning method option, Joshua or Ioka via decision is high chance will happen, but I think Ioka has a chance to win via knock out.

Well, if that is the betting odds and you think it looks 50/50, then you should choose the fighter with 2.30 odds as that definitely could give you great value if ever you win.",

Defending his current title several times is not a joke.I'm sure Akaho will be the Favorite here by the bookies but not sure if the odds gap is that distant or not.",

Who's responsible for that? The smaller weight classes are often dominated by Asian fighters so there is not a lot of interest in these divisions in the United States and Europe. There is not really an incentive to fight outside of their country. Inoue has had a few fights in the United States but as good as he is he is not really that popular over there.",
