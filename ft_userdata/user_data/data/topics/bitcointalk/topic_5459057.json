As when I read your post I was also stunned to think that why would someone integrate GPT brain with Lightning network of BTC to make development and transactions. Because, as you said in the last paragraph that GPT is centralized and we all know whatever we search on GPT is being recorded even the results too. So, why would we trust this system with our money. I mean like can we even do that. Like integrate GPT in BTC block chain?We could make a bot using GPT and train that bot to perform transactions means we could make a auto trading bot. We could find bugs in the smart contract. We could make new smart contracts etc. Using the GPT knowledge and I have tried it too. And GPT is very good at it.What I found shocking is how we integrate GPT into blockchain and why we should do that. I chose were your concerns but in the source post, they were saying we could use gpt to make code to use in Developments",

Read the whole thread, https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/1677031256134152192I will not pretend that I understood all that, but it's obviously saying that developers could connect AI to Lightning and allow pricing for APIs and have the AI make transactions, receive and hold Bitcoins.Quote from the link,Quoteto fill this gap, we've also created a series of \"tools\" using the @OpenAI function call API and @LangChainAI that enables the agents to directly hold, manage, and spend BTC (on chain and via LN!)",
