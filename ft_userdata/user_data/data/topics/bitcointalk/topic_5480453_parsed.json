It can be Bitcoin on chain and it can be altcoins.",

I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether you believe the increase in Bitcoin fees has affected its adoption negatively or enhanced it rather.Based on what I am currently experiencing of course this problem makes sense and it cannot  be denied that the reality of Bitcoin payments is now starting to be pushed aside. Gradually investors and some service providers will migrate to other alternative methods as costs continue to increase. This impact on general adoption is a challenge amidst the rise of Layer2 which  provides many options that require developers to immediately take solutions so that investor attention returns to focus on the initial  goal of Bitcoin adoption.For me personally as a retailer the phenomenon of tariff increases is quite disturbing. Hopefully this is only temporary and we can return to the concept of friendly costs not only for large holders but also for retailers with  equal portions.",

This has been discussed for years. For major bitcoin adoption we will use an l2 solution similar to lightning. Doing transactions for coffee purchases on the main chain just won’t work, even if the mempool was empty it would not be worth it anyways due to the long block times. Hence we need better side chains pretty much for the job. Transactions on bitcoin blockchain can be for long term storage such as cold storage.",

It is going to be used, as it is already being used, as a store of value and to make payments of certain amounts. If fees, regardless of the recent spam problem, tend to go up over time, the average amount of payments on the blockchain will also tend to go up.",

I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether you believe the increase in Bitcoin fees has affected its adoption negatively or enhanced it rather.Honestly, this recent fee upsurge in the past few months is making it more expensive to use Bitcoin for day to day transaction. We all believe that it's just a temporal problem that will be resolved in a short while but it has taken longer than we all thought and the pessimists are already saying it's a sign of failure.It's not something to debate on, the high fee has already caused more harm than good as far as adoption is concerned. The low cost of transaction is one of the reason that led to wider usability of Bitcoin and since that advantage is eroding, we already know the consequences. We see how even some signature campaigns here attempted to switch to alternative payments and the story is not in anyway different outside the forum. People and organizations are switching payment methods too.Truth be told, this is a challenging period for Bitcoin adoption but let keep hope alive. The high fee will eventually be resolved no matter how long it will take and it's showing signs already.",

Unlike last month, where the fee really hurt my head and my bangs as a bitcoin holder, It even reached the point where his bitcoin fee was around 42 dollars last month, which is really not good.Now, the volatility that Bitcoin has has taken me a long time to accept that thing because that's where we really get profit as long as we have an understanding of trading. The difficult thing is that we don't know anything about understanding trading, right? And that's because Bitcoin is a volatile asset.",

I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether you believe the increase in Bitcoin fees has affected its adoption negatively or enhanced it rather.Indeed, the original concept by Satoshi has been improvised upon in recent times and I think one of the results of such is the hike in price of transaction fees. A time would come when individuals or should I say small investors would opt for other cryptos with lower transactions fee because at the current rate, the only viable advice given to a small investor is to HoDL or accumulate and this is not all the functions that BTC as a currency stands to represent. BTC is currency and many have had to choose it over fiat when they intend to invest long-term or complete transactions across border because of the ease and low fees as compared to the traditional fiat banks with high exchange rates and fees. I think the high fees has more than done well to create a margin or gap between small investors and whale investors wherein they now seek coins of less value to explore because whether we like to agree or not, the idea of cryptocurrency on the decentralized network is here to stay and individuals and corporate bodies are only left with the options of other pairs to transact with.",

No one wants to overpay high commissions that exceed the cost of the product itself or are close to it. Overpriced fii slow down all this. Not only scaring away new bitcoin users, but even old users who also don't want to pay such high commissions, which forces them to look for alternative solutions.

But there is something positive in this too. This event will encourage the BTC-community to try to improve bitcoin. Progress and evolution are impossible without complexity and difficulty.

Bitcoin was created as a payment processor but the problem is that it cannot compete with big payment processors like Visa. After 2017 ATH its image as a payment processor no longer existed and the sentence store value was used. Since it has a store value a failing economy like Argentina is now using it for legal contracts. I do not think the high transaction fee is affecting Bitcoin adoption. I agree that the fees are very high for someone who wants to make an onchain transaction of $50. I can only say that the developers need to look into this situation and then make a decision.",
