When it comes down to it, it's really hard for the Philippines to be in the top 5. What we as supporters think is that the opponents are not.Although it's not that easy for him to defeat his competitors, anyway, that's how we can choose to fight in this kind of battle. It's a good thing I didn't agree with my cousin to bet in case I lost a big amount.",

There are casino and bookmark games that many people are betting on that the bettors do not know what would likely be the outcome, example is roulette and dog racing and all others and people like having fun and betting on the games.",

I also felt the same way since I support the Philippines of course it's my own country, I even bet some money with my cousins that she would be part of the top 5. I think the results are quite right as he mentioned, she won a lot of awards so it seems like they put a lot of reason for them to eliminate PH in the top 5 by raining of awards. What you have seen on Instagram might be a fake account of the Miss Universe cause for sure they have learned a lesson from the previous Miss Universe where Steve announced the winner wrong, it has an impact on the audience as well as the country. To be honest, I would really like to bet on Ms. Nepal cause she's actually beauty and I love how confident she is despite being curvy. But yeah other candidates really have a good answer in Q and A, still congrats to Nicaragua for winning MU2023.",

Yeah. Live betting is available on most of the available bets especially on pageant like this which top 5 has different portion that will affect the current scoring like the Q&A. Sportsbook nowadays offers betting possibilities as much as possible as long as the event itself is still undetermined the winner.But some casino doesn’t offer live bet once the match is already halfway. It’s better to use big bookie since they are the one who keeps open the bet even on the final minutes of a game.",

This contest needs to establish criteria such as: being a woman, being X meters tall, having done X and Y things. Just like we see in boxing, MMA, football and other sports, they all have rules that anyone can know and are more transparent when deciding the winner",

So there has been another controversial that involved Ms. Philippines. Maybe because the country has been dominating this pageant for the last 5-6 years?In any case, I will agree though that there are also some gamblers who bet on this kind of beauty pageant.It's not the traditional betting that we have seen, but it's obvious that whether fiat or crypto based every year this kind of betting is open because it also has a huge followers from gamblers, maybe non gamblers but they simply bet on this specific pageant.",
