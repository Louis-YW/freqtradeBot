There are many countries planning the CBDC and are waiting for the implementation for the fear of it affecting businesses already in the payments sector.To me, there is nothing any CBDC would do to keep your privacy as it's a centralised approach in which the government would be able to seize your assets both legally and illegally. No government would want to be out of the control of their creation, so it's better we don't expect anything intriguing from them.",

I just don't know if other communities here know this.But the positive impact that it brings is that it will reduce volatility, and it will also increase transparency through the cryptocurrency concept. Last but not least, adoption will also increase, and when that happens, its liquidity and utility will also for sure rise.",

It must be taken into account that this is not a shift in the interest of cryptocurrencies, since the concept will be used to change the color of the currency from its current form to a new form. Also, this change is to impose more control on the financial activities of citizens. I think it would be better for this to be discussed in the Swiss financial economy because it does not provide any interest to the crypto market.",

Sweden does not have a CBDC, but it is a country where 98% of all payments are made digitally.yep CBDC are mis understood. thats why its best people do their research. firstly CBDC are not a single host server at central bank. but a ledger shared with commercial banks too. the central bank mint/pre-mine a currency and distribute it as reserves with commercial banks. (Pos/multisig ledger)the commercial banks then serve their customers 'a layer' beneath this where the commercial banks hoard customer data. not central bank.the commercial banks also have different 'account' ratings. where a base level account has a max saving/spend limit without KYC of small amount(like $300 per payment) but to do more value customers need to upgrade to a superier account offering more value facility but will require KYCthis base account, think of it like a virtual visa/giftcard account for small purchases. where as those wanting to pay actual larger amounts need a proper registered accountthere are different levels of account needing different levels of KYC requirement",

As for sure, it will be another CBDC, controlled by the government.But this means that the government is already acknowledging the blockchain technology, though I believe, they are one of the early ones which accept the existence of crypto.Government won't accept crypto or BTC because they are decentralized in nature, that's the main factor. They have no control about its circulation. CBDC may pave the way for its citizen to know more about blockchain, cryptocurrencies among other things. So won't be bad to crypto market, as people will educate themselves about the difference of CBDC vs decentralized cryptocurrencies.",
