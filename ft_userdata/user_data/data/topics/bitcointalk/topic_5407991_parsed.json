But if hydrogen energy comes to the human world, then the richest people will be the owners of hydrogen generators.It's like with bitcoin, the one who first saw the potential in cryptocurrency became the richest person.

There are no physical and mathematical models, technical solutions. Only the benefits are presented, without scientific justification. I don't hide my works, they are open.There are only a handful of ways anybody invents anything that is practical. Either it happened by accident, or somebody else showed it to him, or he worked to invent or discover it. This doesn't mean that he has to relate all the details in every publication that somebody writes about it.In this case, I haven't scoured the Internet to find if the info is detailed anywhere. And I haven't contacted the people to see if they would give it to me. And I certainly haven't gone through the work of trying to duplicate the effort on my own. Have you done any of this?Perhaps it's all a scam. Maybe they didn't do it at all. It might only be unsubstantiated talk, like hearsay. But we have a starting point that we can use to further our investigations... if we even think that the idea is worthwhile.But the points that a clean burning, gasoline engine only produces water and CO2 (and some tiny amounts of a few other materials) can be substantiated in all kinds of engineering manuals. And along with it the fact that CO2 is plant food... helps plants grow better.",
