  "content": "African countries have gained political independence from their former colonial powers, but the legacy of colonialism still shapes many aspects of their societies and economies. While many African countries have made progress in terms of economic development, poverty reduction, and political stability, they still face significant challenges in fully realizing their potential.One of the ongoing legacies of colonialism is economic dependence on former colonial powers and other developed nations. Many African countries continue to rely on exports of raw materials and commodities, which leaves them vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. In addition, many African countries still face significant debt burdens, which limit their ability to invest in infrastructure and social programs.Another legacy of colonialism is the persistence of political instability and conflict in many African countries. This frequently has something to do with the arbitrary lines drawn by colonial powers, which split ethnic groups and led to conflicts that still exist today. In addition, many African countries have struggled to establish democratic governance systems that are free from corruption and political repression.Finally, the legacy of colonialism has contributed to ongoing struggles for racial justice and equality, both within African countries and in the broader international community. Many African countries continue to face discrimination and marginalization on the global stage, and the ongoing legacy of colonialism has contributed to ongoing struggles for social and economic justice.",

Today, Vietnam has not a tenth of the problems of Mali, and is doing well.It's the lack of state structures and corruption that is eating away at some African countries day after day, not the colonies that ended 60 years ago.But it's right, any African countries are in the process of throwing off Western influence. But what we should mention is that it is simply being replaced by Chinese and Russian influence in many cases. A lot of African countries have tons of ressources, it could be great if the politician leaders could use them in the global interest of their countries, and not keeping everything for themselves.",

Africa leaders due to corruption and greed will collect loans and instead of using it to for business that will generate income and job opportunities for their citizens,they will distribute the money within themselves and after that these so call leaders will be removed from power and these loans will pile up and become a huge debt on the country. Since there is no good leader that takes over power,the new leader will not think of how to pay back these loans but instead they might want to collect another loan and use the countries means of survival for collateral to these loans. Trust China,they are smart and thinks only about themselves,they will give you the loans and hope that they will come and take over the country's property for a particular period of time for them to be able to get back their money. Africans fails have the insight of China's loan strategy.",

But what we should mention is that it is simply being replaced by Chinese and Russian influence in many cases.

Until African nations get to the level of exploring, exploiting, and refining their raw materials into finished products they will forever be a raw material market. African nations need to promote local industrialization that will make Africa a selling and not a buying continent. Africa is a dumping ground for expired and substandard products because it can't produce even simple products.  Africa should stop being a mineral deposit of the developed world.",

Countries like India that was colonized by Britain, Dutch, Portugal French, they are almost competing with these countries economies or is it China that was also colonized by some of the mentioned countries like Britain, Portugal etc, they have very robust economy because they have moved away from that mindset of dependency but Africa have not yet done that, until they find a niche for themselves they will still be subservient in the league of nations.",
