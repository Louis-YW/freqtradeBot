  "content": "Hello all!I started with Cloudbet on 24.08.2022, made a deposit in total for 266 Polkadot(Not so much, but anyway).On the next day I got some win and requested for withdrawal - about 338 Polkadot.After I made withdrawal request - they asked me for the document - passport, selfie with passport and document to proof the address. A sent the documents and no answer from the Cloudbet.Finally my account just banned(I can't login), my withdrawal is not accepted. The Live Char usually anwers like:Thank you for your reply.Kindly note that the verification is still underway at the moment, due to this access to the account cannot be granted.The account is still under review and there is no update yet.Please rest assured that we will be in touch with you as soon as once they get back to us.Not sure if somebody can help me there - but it would be great. Total amount is not so big, but why I can't get my deposit and win back...Is it normal thing for Cloudbet?",

They will say it's needed when their system detect your account already did suspicious thing or when they're going forced by the regulation. Have you asked on their email or customer services or social medias e.g. Discord about the reason why your account got blocked? They do have an account in this forum, but it's not active anymore since March 16, 2022.",

If verification is required and included in the ToS of a gambling site, better to first get verified before making use of the site. Make sure that you are not manipulating and be plained about yourself and the verification. I will advice you to wait for the customer care response, I hope your account would be verified, if you are not manipulating anything.",

I think casino is now fully utilizing there ToS in regards of application of KYC to all its user little by little. I think this is due to the regulators that pressuring them to mandatory KYC all its users for the sake of protecting there business interest. We can’t do anything about this but to comply or choose other casino that still not asking KYC.",

Lol Verification is verification, probably he could have been part of what every Cloudbet user will do, we talked about that on a thread which you also included the link in your above post. What just came my mind is that it would be impossible to open cloudbet account if I am temporary not in my country. Like I meant on the other thread, there are many other trustworthy sites I can go for rather than stressing myself on stringent KYC requirements, but I think tester11919 would also have to do it and would have done it already.

The case here is being blocked(cannot login), plus having no positive respond to the their customer support, it's been a whole week already afterall.KYC is the problem, a lot can be known from the KYC document a user submitted, but it may also be other things like having multiple accounts which can be tracked with IP address. In this case, it is KYC that would have resulted to this. Many gambling sites that require KYC makes it easy for people to register on their site, deposit and bet, but if the user win and want to withdraw, that is where the problem is, the gambling site will look for lapses of the user and look for other means to be a good reason not to be able to withdraw, like having multiple accounts or using fake KYC.",

Which users cannot login. If KYC is the main reason then tell the user that there is a problem to the documents he uploaded so he can upload again. Isn't asking KYC is to make users provide their details and identity? What's the chance of making a user as multiple accounting after submitting KYC? By just seeing the names? There are billions of people, having the same name is not impossible, but the address, face can be different. Casino nowadays will just hostage your account's balance, banned you after you provide what they ask without telling you the reasons for days, weeks worst for months or not at all. Or just making excuses since it's their forte. It is getting worst.",

It is getting worst.I have noticed this too, it is getting worse, but I wonder why people prefer to deposit first, bet before doing KYC. What a gambler should first do is to read the ToS of a gambling site before registering, or before making any deposit, if KYC is included, it is best to first do KYC verification before sending money to the gambling site, that is how I use to do it. I prefer a gambling site to give me problem when my funds are not yet on it than when my funds are there already.You are not wrong, I would have liked it if gambling sites make it mandatory for KYC verification before new customers can be able to deposit instead of during withdrawal, but if it is not like that, some gamblers would have deposited money first and later want to withdraw if they make some profit which might lead to this discussion again and again.Quote from: tester11919 on August 31, 2022, 08:52:20 AMSo, now they said that my documents that verify address is not correct and asked for new one.I prepared doc from the bank and sent it. Waiting for the response 10 days more....Just be patient about this, I hope your account would be verified, but I wonder why you are restricted from your account, only withdrawal is soposed to be disabled, but maybe because of a good reason, but I could not think of one.

You are telling us to believe your story when you have nothing to support your accusation.Well, the selfie thing may surprise you about casinos, but some fintechs ask you to take a video of you holding your ID card or passport with your mobile phone in order to sign up. If I remember correctly, some CEXs do too. So it seems to me that this is not going to be exceptional in the future. In the old days you went to the bank with your documents and the bank manager saw your face, or to the casino and they asked you for ID to enter, and something similar is going to happen online, adapted to this medium.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on September 09, 2022, 11:49:25 PMQuote from: tester11919 on September 08, 2022, 10:09:35 AMStill no update, guys.
