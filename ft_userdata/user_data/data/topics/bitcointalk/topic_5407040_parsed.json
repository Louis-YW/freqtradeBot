Perhaps the time market context continues to mislead many people into believing that the market easily offers the opportunity to upgrade assets strongly and quickly. From what I understand, everything that is easily called an opportunity by everyone is a scam. Better protect yourself from greedy invitations to big and quick profits.

Just like a shit or meme coin.This is why its too impossible to reach the 100x profit, probably just a hype and with this, its too risky to trust the project. If they really believe on their own project they should start making plans and have a good updates because no investor will trust if there’s no roadmap and whitepaper. Well, a project who are claiming to be 100x profit or more, most of them failed and turns out to be a scam project so be careful with this.",

Even huge potential coins can't reach that for now. It's too important to do our research and to be honest, I can't see any potential in this coin but if they won't just shill it but will be clear about their road map, there's still a chance that people would trust it as long as they will show transparency.",

Well, DYOR, don’t invest right a way especially if they are claiming to be a good project but in reality they are not.
