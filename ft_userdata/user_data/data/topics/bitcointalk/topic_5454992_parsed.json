Like a wound that needs stitches we throw oxy cottens at as we bleed out more.Your post doesn't makes sense to me. You haven't explained that how the central banks have stolen the work of our ancestors who worked for 2000 years? Are you trying to bring some mythological story into this or you're talking about the metals they used for the purpose of trading goods?If you are talking about the metals than in that case you're absolutely wrong by saying that Bitcoin can't fix the wounds. The Bitcoin is truly innovative and works best as a digital currency, and in this technological age it's far better than the times when you had to carry burden of huge metals for trading goods. It's a total solution for our problems, but few people still doesn't understand the real power of it.If you are talking about the economic system and even in that case Bitcoin is the savior. It has given the control over money to the user rather than the banks or governments. Anyone can trade it without any discriminations and restrictions, and even people from different cultures can trade with each other using Bitcoin. In ancient times people would consider something like Bitcoin a magical system, but in this age and time it's a reality. We are lucky enough that we are born in a time with such great technologies and still people have negative views towards such great technological achievements.",

Homo sapies has a history of 70,000 years. The Agrarian Revolution began about 10,000 years ago when man began to settle down and raise animals and congregations.

Couldn't there have been inequality/elites/decadence before? Under the gold standard and gold currency, there was also inflation and governments also found ways to devaluate people svaings. Murray Newton Rothbard in \"What Has Government Done to Our Money?\" describes exactly how over hundreds (hundreds!) of years governments have steadily increased their power over money.Quote from: hsdjkahskjdh on June 03, 2023, 04:33:43 PMBitcoin does not fix this it mask it more.

Bitcoin is the first grassroots money operating on this scale since gold.",

Op are you exaggerating the statement? You thread is full with imaginative. Even your father house build in the village is not up to 100 years. And here you are talking about 2000 years. Is it that you are talking the natural resources which have been talking away by the Europeans? And if you are coming from that angle, I will tell you that, they had been taken away by the white men but it has not been taking away them again but the leaders are the cause of the everything that is happening on the earth.",

Doesn't make any sense. And haven't you heard that bitcoin is not the means of everything? It's not a magic bean that will solved the world's problem, i.e poverty, hunger etc.I think your mindset is totally wrong or your argument is flaw in the beginning.If there will be someone that has stolen from our ancestors is that it is the capitalist, big corporations and banks.",

Your first statement may simply be seen as an expression of unhappiness with a central bank action, but you have not articulated it in detail. In your second statement, bitcoin has nothing to do with negativity, unless you don't understand what bitcoin is all about and are just throwing shade at it.",

Like a wound that needs stitches we throw oxy cottens at as we bleed out more.Dude we are not mind readers, two short sentences are nowhere near enough to tell us what you mean by this, especially when the claims are so out there, it is true that as long as banks retain their ability to print money without any backing then they can regain their power once again given enough time, but bitcoin is precisely the fix that we need, as it is the hardest currency in existence as we know the upper limit of bitcoins that will ever exist, does this means banks cannot ever pervert and distort what bitcoin wants to achieve? No, but at least it is the best attempt we have seen during the last centuries.",

Take what you got, Bitcoin’s currently the only way to get access to money that you truly own..You say it took 50 years for banks to steal all the wealth? Do you think we can fix this in a minute? A fix for this probably requires a few full, hard resets of society as we know it. It’s not as easy as it seems, but Bitcoin’s definitely helped and heping people set free of the chains & burdens of fiat restrictions, finally setting free of the chains we’ve all been tightly tied to..",
