Anyone who tries to sell you a roll with a nice ender on it is most likely a bad deal. To anyone thinking of selling, know your mint marks (such as CC, O, S). They can carry a substantial numismatic premium.",

      "body": "Hi, I buy and or sell Morgans/Peace regularly on ebay still (as Gatorelf) after 25 years. I haven't found a better place considering so many reputable dealers have accounts there as well as individuals will from time to time sell off a portion of their long time unsearched old collection. The goin price lately is $30 to 32 for Morgan cull bullion coins and or just some low grade coins. Just five or so years ago you could buy them anywhere at $17 and in VF condition. There has been a nice five year upward trend ( following silver price) across the board on Morgans/Peace especially for higher grade numismatic values. Nothing like 1990 when most coins were peaking from demand but still a really nice rebound from the lows of 5/6 years ago. For silver stacking and or .999 hoarding 1 ounce rounds you still get more bang for the buck with generic silvers rather than the premium Eagles.  Here is a good video on why, good luck !https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC3UuxE23Lw&ab_channel=SilverSeeker",
