Therefore, the security of your account is crucial.However, you have a security question in place, what often means lower entropy than a secure password and maybe being easier to guess. Simplest thing I have seen in DefaultTrust was \"1+1\" with answer \"2\" was correct - I have frozen it for security. Easy questions ask for an age (try 0-99) or a birth year (try 1940-2022) or lower case initials (try aa-zz). Many questions ask for a city or a make of first car - brute force can help. And there are loads of questions for names of wife, birth names, pet names and so on. These are things that may be shared even in a post or require only your real name! The better people know the account owner, the better they know the answer!Recommended action to take is to remove security question at all. Please get back to me stating how you improved account security. If I do not get a reply, I need to inform board administration for our all safety.I started with whole DefaultTrust as I think the base of community should be secured first. Later, I will go for more users. Captcha is useless as I use some trick I will only discuss with theymos.Thank you!I will quote this with my alt as I am concerned this is a hack attempt .",

They've already claimed that they've frozen accounts, which isn't really possible, unless they had some kind of database access, which would mean they'd be able to remove the security questions themselves if they really wanted too. In other words, this user isn't to be trusted, and no reply is warranted. If they have information about security, they can contact theymos. Other than that, them finding out who has a security question, and who doesn't is fairly simple as LoyceV alluded to above. I suspect, a further attack would've been launched if you replied to them. Smells of social engineering, where they attempt to gain your trust by offering you some semi valid advice, and then looking to exploit that further down the line.",
