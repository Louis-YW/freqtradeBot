One of my exchanges got hacked, lost my 2FA code - my phone broke down etc. etc...I want to write down some of the security stuff I use for my cryptos!If any of you have corrections, additions or other suggestions to my safety actions, would love to hear them.https://www.internations.org/guidelines/safety1- Never ever use an exchange without 2FA: Even the hardest passwords can get hacked easily. If you don't use 2FA you can get hacked... Yep I got hacked - my Bibox account, took hours to block the account, half of my earnings were lost. (it wasn't more than 50$, thank god...)2- Never ever use the same password for different accounts. Yep, I got hacked! Why? I was applying for several airdrops, you guys know that nowadays some of them require signing up to their websites. And what have I done?

If your phone breaks down, you will loose all your 2FAs... It can take 2-3 weeks to activate your exchange accounts. 5- MEW, IDEX login: I never copy and paste my private keys to login these wallets. I prefer Metamask login, not 100% secure but much better.6- My browser preference: I don't like chrome very much. I prefer to use Brave browser to access my accounts. *It doesn't support Binance. Brave also has Metamask extension.AND A GREAT UPDATE: Brave has it's own BAT wallet which ables you to earn while you surf. Firefox is my second choice. 7- Phising sites: I always bookmark my exchanges. Also before clicking the email links, I always check the url, I never click if it is not a \"HTTPS\". I also use WOT extension on Chrome to check if the link is safe or not...8- KYC issue: I prefer not to do KYC for airdrops or bounties. If their database gets hacked, your passport can end up in Dark web. For exchanges, I always try to use my Driving License instead of my passport for KYC (some of them only accepts passport :/ )9- For airdrops I use another email.

      "body": "We all make mistakes in our early time in crypto but with time most of the people learn by there mistakes. IMHO you did not lose that much but still money is money and losing them still hurts. And that must be enough for one to learn and find the causes of such hacks or spams. I really liked and agreed with all of your points but TBH I do not know much about Brave Browser but I think it might not be a best option among others. Why? Learn more about it here:New stupid/greedy move from Brave BrowserWell, after reading some replies there I concluded that Firefox might be a good option but still IMHO as a user of Google Chrome I did not faced any issues till now. Why did I not faced any?1. I never opened my main Exchange account on my laptop.2. I never downloaded Pirated Software after knowing the risk involved.3. I also never copied Private keys because in Metamask to recover the same account without deleting it we need recovery key and if I will not make a private key then nobody actually could access it. But still there are many other way around to get hold on that. 4. Most of the scams occurred in airdrops and bounties so the best practice is to use alternative accounts for those even the wallet address and emails. Never connect your main wallets just to claim few dollars from some unknown website. I hope you would not be scammed or hacked more, but still I personally think if you would leave your dependency on third party extension or browsers or any other ways then you would be safe enough.",

I have a small notebook which I keep my passwords.I also have a word document which I save some of my private keys, it is a locked document - not so safe I know...This is still a very bad method to be honest because once the document file that has your private key has been bypassed your coins will be vulnerable to the hacker. It’s best not to associate your private key or secret phrase with your computer or online and that includes saving them in a notepad or Microsoft Word.Quote KYC issue: I prefer not to do KYC for airdrops or bounties. If their database gets hacked, your passport can end up in Dark web. For exchanges, I always try to use my Driving License instead of my passport for KYC (some of them only accepts passport :/ )Even for reputable services it’s still difficult for some users to complete kyc due to the fear of their privacy being compromised and you’re telling me that there are bounties out there that are actually requesting users to complete KYC that’s pretty stupid if anyone performs such a thing except they are willing to risk their privacy for the little money that comes with the airdrop and with the way airdrops are being done nowadays it takes time to come across an airdrop that pays good amount. As for the license or passport I don’t really see any difference there, as long as they can be used maliciously to affect the owner and that’s what the hacker is after.",

If you don't use 2FA you can get hacked...  Using exchanges that have 2FA enabled on them is an added security advantage, but the security advantage can also be bridge by you in some point, one if you happen to use a same email link to your exchange and it's also part of your primarily email on your device, their is a possibility of you also getting compromise, as one of the first thing hackers target when they want to hack your account is your email as it will give them the necessary details they need in other to be successful in their mission. So getting into that your primary email, can also give them access to that of your security especially when you make use of Google authenticator which now synchronizes your backed up 2FA to your email and anyone with your email access can easily import them in a new device. So the safest thing is to not leave your money on centralized exchanges. If you must use them once you are done, always withdraw them back to your private wallet.Quote 2- Never ever use the same password for different accounts. Yep, I got hacked! Why?

I used the same password and email I used for the Bibox exchange.  Sometimes using the same password for everything you do makes it easier to guess and be hacked. But also look at it this way: saving your password and logs on your browser also reduces your security, as if the email linked to your browser is compromised, all your saved logs will be in the wrong hands. And these days browsers are also being penetrated for  data theft without the user's knowledge, so the best thing to do is always login as you go and don't use the save password option; it helps with easy remembering but is also a security risk.",

I also use WOT extension on Chrome to check if the link is safe or not...I like to reiterate this one. Many newbies fell for such phishing sites especially those that are into airdrops and giveaways. When they've been provided a link by the developer or whoever runs those campaigns, they don't check it with due diligence and in the end they're ended being phished and all funds are gone. Scammers are wise so everyone needs to be wiser than them. And no one will be phished if you're not going to give your entire details that's being asked especially the critical ones like your seeds, private keys and other details that connects you to your wallet and other vital information. That's how these phishing sites are made for, to get those important information for them to gain access whatever they can that they think we're accessing also for our funds.Aside from bookmarking, when you're searching website as you use the search engines. When you search keywords there of the websites you're searching, make sure that you're reading the short description that are on top of the search results and read the URL as well. If they're sponsored/advertised by that search engine and if there is a mispelling of the URL then that's a sign of a red flag and fake website.",

Bounty hunters can do airdrop tasks but if KYC requirement is enforced later, they should give up and forget about that airdrop. Because it does not worth to sacrifice their privacy and anonymity for airdrops which as said mostly have no value.Quote from: letteredhub on August 21, 2023, 11:19:43 PMThe request for KYC was part of the discouragement I had with chasing airdrops, giving out my data to some unsure projects.

They can sell your documents to get money and you in return even don't receive token or receive token that does not worth anything at all.",

I have a small notebook which I keep my passwords.I also have a word document which I save some of my private keys, it is a locked document - not so safe I know...This is still a very bad method to be honest because once the document file that has your private key has been bypassed your coins will be vulnerable to the hacker. It’s best not to associate your private key or secret phrase with your computer or online and that includes saving them in a notepad or Microsoft Word.Yep, anything that is written in a software isn't really that better of a way. It's still another program written by another dev.  What's better would be doing that engraving of private keys in a steel of metal then just hiding it in a safe locker or somewhere else where it wouldn't be exposed to external elements.I had written some of my private keys to a paper but not all of them really contains something worth stealing anyway.",
