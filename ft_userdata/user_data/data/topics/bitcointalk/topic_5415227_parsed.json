      "body": "It depends. The seed phrase can be revealed (through low cost physical attack) on those hardware wallets that have only microcontroller unit, like Trezor. But on hardware wallets that has secure element, the seed phrase would be hard to know. If you want to use hardware wallet like Trezor, just use passphrase with the seed phrase. Passphrase make it possible for different keys and addresses to be generated. If the person that get hold of your hardware wallet still know the seed phrases, he can not spend from the wallet because he did not know the passphrase. But backup your passphrase too, because if lost, your coins are lost, just like you lost your seed phrase. If your hardware is lost, better to create a paper wallet or another cold wallet and transfer your coins there. After, you can get a new hardware wallet. But using a strong passphrase would help also.",

I believe you mean the person who bought the hardware and owns the keys, the founder of the hardware company should ideally not know what your keys or phrases are.Also, if one does not have backups in safe locations, your bitcoins are not securely stored.",

It depends on the hardware wallet. In some cases, it is possible to hack a hardware wallet if there is physical access to it. There are also hardware wallets that cannot be hacked easily, even with physical access.If you lost your hardware wallet and do not know where it ended up, you should consider it compromised. If this happens, use your backup seed phrase to immediately move all funds to the new wallet.",

Lost the key and lost your coin forever even nothing is happening about the coin bit you're inaccessible to get hold of the coins, the founder has no access tobit either untill he got the passphrase to accessing the wallet onbthe blockchain because the coins aren't stored on the physical wallet materials we see, the hardware is just a means to connect us to the access needed to the blockchain through the keys in it.",

Yes it would be safe on the hardware but it would be very dangerous for you if someone found it and probably the founder is a crypto expert mostly on bitcoin. then your bitcoin is gone. A found a wallet on beach and the solution to deal the bitcoin found in the wallet was given by different bitcoiners. I found a paper wallet on a beach ... seriouslyBut if the founder is illiterate about bitcoin and know nothing about the found wallet. As for me that is were the main problem lie in, he might decide to erase it and use to write another things or giving it to children to play but if the founder knows about bitcoin and he is a good person you might get back your wallet with the coin inside intact. Advice, do not move with your wallet, keep your wallet in the house and in safe hidden place that nobody can see in the house. Moving around with wallet is very much dangerous.",

Do you know how Hardware works? Having a Hardware wallet is because you want to keep your coins offline, you want them to remain that way until you are ready to spend them and at the very launch of anyone you bought, a unique seed phrase will be provided for you which you must keep safe for the future purpose just the way you are asking now if it ever gets lost or stolen by anyone. You should also add an extension of the passphrase so that no one will have access to your coins should incase your seed phrase or recovery phrase becomes compromised.As long as you follow tips and instructions, you will remain safe with your hardware wallet, you should be also careful of the type of hardware you want to use, don't buy from merchants, order directly from the company and make sure that it is well sealed.",

Instead of wanting safe assets, they become targets for used hardware wallet scams.",

Trezor, on the other hand, has a vulnerability that cannot be repaired with a firmware upgrade, and the seed can be extracted relatively easily and cheaply if someone comes into possession of your hardware wallet, and you have not protected it with a passphrase.Quote from: suzanne5223 on September 29, 2022, 03:38:59 PMMeanwhile to prevent a physical attack is better to encrypt the wallet The only additional security that the user can additionally set is the passphrase mentioned above, and there is no other way (that I know of) to encrypt the hardware wallet. The only thing you can do is store it safely away from the reach of anyone with bad intentions.",
