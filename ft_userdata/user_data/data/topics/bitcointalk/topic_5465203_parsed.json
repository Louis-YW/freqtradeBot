  "content": "I have come to the realization that what's stopping me from running lightning projects, as the one I'd proposed last year, is custody of the coins. I don't want to leave custody to some server I don't have physical access, and even if services like DigitalOcean have quite the best reviews when it comes to security, I don't want to buy their expensive services for just starting my project; if it's working towards success, I may migrate to them, but not at start.As far as I've seen, there is no other way to establish a lightning service if you don't do one of the following:Run a lightning node in that VPS.Give your home-running node's macaroon access file.Both of which give the VPS provider the authority to sign payments. (Reminder that to have a properly running node, you need some good financial capacity)Is there a way to have the VPS communicating over my home node via Tor, at least without forfeiting custody nor payment authority?",

They need to dump RAM, make copy of your VPS storage and find cryptography key from RAM dump.Actually since you don't know how many layers deep you are that is just about impossible. If your VM is running under another VM then anything you do on your VM is much easier to dig though.Unless you are getting remote KVM access to the bare metal hardware you can only ASSUME that they they are legit and not recording everything you do. Even then there is a layer of trust. BUT, unless you are talking about millions of dollars, it's probably not a worry. Since, if it was ever found out that they were deep monitoring clients their business would implode.

I don't believe they're doing port forward from home on port 80/443. Good question, i also curious how commercial company do that. Although i expect some of them simply use 3rd party.If done properly through multiple discrete private networks and limited communications though firewalls. i.e. my node on 192.168.1.100 / 24 can only talk to the node on 192.168.2.100 /24 using gateway 192.168.1.50.192.168.2.100 since it is a LN / BTC node and has to communicate with the outside world has a 2nd network card with a 10.0.0.100 / 24 address and it's own gateway.Obviously this is very simplified, but it's all through things like that.Keep in mind, you can also setup virtual NICs in VM servers that only allow internal communication so you can also do some things that way.-Dave",

Since I won't have full control, and there will be employees who can authorize my payments without my permission, then how's dedicated server any different from a regular VPS?In Bitcoin, this problem isn't so big, because in the worst case, you can just leave an address and have an instance of a VPS monitoring its funding. In lightning, you need to give permission to, at least, execute some command which will check if an invoice is paid. Technically, it's possible to limit what it can execute, and do the \"important stuff\" (like the pay command) manually, at the end of the day from your home node. But I see no one doing that.",

This is why I'm being really skeptic about handing over that kind of authority to a server provider. No you can't. This is why if you want to do it you have to spend the $ on co-locating your own hardware and making sure you have full OOB management running and available through your own hardware VPN.But once again, it really comes down to the amount of money involved. If you are taking about $1000 you have a different plan then with $10000 which is a different plan then with $100000Goes back to what I say about having a closed source multicoin wallet on my cellphone. The phone is worth more then the coins in it. And I buy cheaper phones.The stuff that needs to be secured is secured.So long as you go in with a plan, then you should be good. Using any numbers you want, but lets say $5000 / $400If you can take a $5000 hit then getting a platform up and running that is not fully secure is fine if it can generate $400 in profit a month. So long as you have a plan for when you need to bump that to $15000 to generate $1200 a month in profit and so on. Starting at $5000 and then seeing that you now have $100000 in there and have no strategy to make it more secure is not a good thing even if you are clearing $8000 a month in profit.-Dave",

It returns the admin.macaroon to the API response when you initiate your node.

Also this one will be listening for traffic using a Tor port and sending the traffic back similarly.A second script that runs inside your home will be in charge of receiving the traffic from the lightning services you want to run, via a different host/port that you configure, but it just passes the HTTP request via a Tor port to the server script.Fortunately, this is something that ChatGPT can do with a little assistance.Quote from: Cricktor on September 03, 2023, 09:27:31 AMHetzner's ToS and above cited comment on Reddit are a bit vague and I read it that they disallow anything related to mining and maybe Ethereum in particular because of the Tornado Cash turmoil.

Storage of a VPS is usually virtualized, I (as an admin) can take a snapshot, mount the snapshot on a completely independend from the VPS running system and inspect the snapshot's filesystem easily. This is not detectable by the VPS whatsoever. It's another thing that VPS management environment should have some decent logging, too, which the management users shouldn't be able to modify. As a VPS user you can hope for this, but you don't know how well the infrastructure is setup.Then you have the issues like Downfall which can leak data over VPS boundaries if not remedied properly and this is particularly a problem on VPS systems where as a VPS user you don't have any control what's running on other VPS instances on your VPS' host machine.Sure, by rule VPS admins are likely not allowed to sneak into your VPS, but technically there are no limits and you have no control over what kind of people work at your VPS provider as admin or technical staff.Be careful with your bold claims, we don't live in an ideal world.",
