Do you think there's a possibility to freeze hackers okx account or something ?It is possible, depending on the situation at hand it may be even likely to have them frozen.  However, this does not mean they can do much about it particularly because this is a situation that Authorities have to work on and not the Exchange itself.  Do not lose hope, but be realistic about the situation.  This is a theft that may or may have not been well planned.  If they did not Withdraw your brothers Cryptocurrencies to their Bank Account or if they did not complete Know Your Customer procedures, chances are dimnished.I am mind blown how some people do not have at least a Hardware Wallet and prefer to rather hold this much Money on a Computer they do not even properly secure.  I do not want to carve the knife even more against his skin but why?  This was a constantly open invitation for any bad actor to his Wallet!Whether he gets Authorities to retrieve his Money or not, from this extremely expensive lesson he must learn a thing or two.  Do NOT Trust your Computer and NEVER should you consider it is a safe idea to browse dubious websites or to open Email attachments on the same Computer you have very sensitive information on!  An old Computer can be purchased from about 20 Dollars and above and you can turn it into an Airgapped Device just perfect for storing Cryptocurrencies safely.  Or, just purchase a Hardware Wallet instead.  For 100 THOUSAND Dollars this should be a must!-----Quote from: tread93 on September 28, 2024, 03:57:19 AMThis is all too common these days these hackers are getting smarter with social engineering and AI, What does Artificial Intelligence have to do with what happened to OP?  They simply opened an infected attachment.  This is one type of Hacking that has been around for many years.  Long before AI was at the tip of our tongue.Quote from: tread93 on September 28, 2024, 03:57:19 AMI like to use browserling which is like a browser VM that allows you to check in a safe environment before compromising your own. OP, do NOT follow this idea.  NO!  A 'Browser VM' does about NOTHING to protect you from an infection if the Virus is intelligent enough.  If you really feel the need to open unknown Files, DO NOT OPEN THEM ON THE COMPUTER YOU STORE BITCOIN ON.I have never been infected from Email attachments.  Not even once because I simply do not click what I know is not legitimate or something I should of received!  Is it this difficult?",

I like to use browserling which is like a browser VM that allows you to check in a safe environment before compromising your own. Actually the morale is not necessarily to install more software, the morale is to keep his money safe.There are hardware wallets of all kinds, there is cold storage if one has good technical knowledge, there is even paper wallet that can be easily created and stored (on paper or steel, for example). I find nowadays bigger mistake to keep your coins unprotected than clicking a bad attachment.Of course, as a secondary step, indeed, making sure next time the brother cannot get into the position to mistakenly infect the computer is something worthy to think on.But that can usually be done by being much more careful.PS. Good luck, OP, in getting back your money. I don't think the chances are big, but I tend to think negative. As PrivacyG already said, you should get authorities' help; I don't expect the bigger businesses freeze money only because you ask them nicely (even with the proper proof).Quote from: PrivacyG on September 28, 2024, 04:05:10 AMI have never been infected from Email attachments.  Not even once because I simply do not click what I know is not legitimate or something I should of received!  Is it this difficult?Actually, in some cases it is, especially as many email clients hide the sender address and show only the name, because \"let's not be too technical\".",

There will be a lot of process for that and verification. Thats why its always advise to take care of your security cause it might compromise you.

Fortunately, I was lucky that time and had minor losses, it took a while till Malwarebytes detected it as a virus, I had to find the file and delete them myself, and of course, I didn't manage to find all the files myself, other browsers were still infected and it took months till I cleaned out the whole infection. Common sense should be exercised, no torrents or downloading random files is a must.I'm sorry for your loss OP, the chances of recovering your money are quite minimal, you could try contacting the exchange in hopes of freezing the funds, unless he has already withdrew, still though, they have all his personal details and possibly a police report like others mentioned.",

In the crypto world it is very important to continue to be careful in doing anything on the internet. You must know how to protect yourself from hackers who are very dangerous, they can steal your assets without you realizing it. Please note that in the crypto world which is growing rapidly every day, the threat of fraud and hackers is also increasing. However, if you take the right steps in protecting your assets, you can avoid traps made by hackers like this.It is very important to always be aware of fraud carried out by hackers in every way to steal your assets, especially those that often occur via email, Wallet connections or messages from Telegram which are very vulnerable to hacking. So the hope in the future if there is something strange or a link that feels strange and you never follow it, never open it carelessly, you must immediately delete it, it is better to block it immediately because fraudsters will try to get personal information through psychological manipulation. They can also disguise themselves as trusted entities, so you have to be observant every time you receive an email.",

A good AV will always scan everything you download and warn you of possible danger, and if it detects something dangerous, it will quarantine that file. The \"problem\" is that most people don't want to pay for a good AV/firewall - and let's say that the victim in this story had something like that on his computer, maybe a hacker wouldn't be able to take over that computer so easily.All in all, keeping $100k on a computer in a hot wallet while not knowing basic security protocols is a perfect recipe for disaster.",

In short, they have no responsibility to us and have nothing to do with our assets. If OP lives in a country where bitcoin is legal and he complies with government regulations. What he should do is report to the police and provide them with full evidence of the stolen property. The police are the ones who can help OP and only they have the authority to contact OKX or tether. On the contrary, if he lives in a country where bitcoin is illegal , I think he should accept the reality and consider it the most expensive lesson .By the way , OP, my condolences to your brother because this loss is a huge amount of money .",

If the hacker is fast and immediately withdrawn the money they hack from your brother I guess there's slim chance that he can do something with it. But by the time he notice that he compromised then immediately contact the support of Okx maybe they can do something on those hack amount and you seek help from authority so that they can ask Okx to freeze that funds. But looking at the situation its like the hacker outsmart your brother and for sure that the criminal is already happy to cashout the money of your brother.Another hard lesson to learn. Hopefully next time your brother will not click any unknown links since he already experience the worst scenario that might happen to curious people. Although its hard to move on if we loss such huge amount of money, but I guess he don't have a choice but to do it.",
