While the concept of a decentralized, blockchain-based court of justice is an interesting one, it would likely be difficult to implement in practice. There are several challenges that would need to be addressed, such as ensuring the security and integrity of the voting process, protecting the privacy of those involved in the case, and ensuring that the outcome of the trial is legally binding. Additionally, it would be important to ensure that the individuals serving as jurors are qualified and unbiased. While it is possible that blockchain technology could be used to facilitate a decentralized court system in the future, it is currently a topic of ongoing research and development.",

I like this idea but the problem is that this idea have to do with a lot of consultation because I have no see any necessary that we make a critical currency or a blockchain technology to have a court of justice. I'll tell you that in normal Court procedures when there is issue of block chain comes up the court will normally use already can also handle the differences so there is not any need for to have a Court of Justice for a block chain",

Indeed, also, it would go in contrast with decentralisation. Given that this blockchain protects anonymity, how come would it be proven every transaction if a user can transfer it from one wallet to another? Tracing indeed is possible but as long as there are no IDs tagged with that wallet, it would be impossible to determine who's the owner. Let us stick with being vigilant with our funds and to others. Stealing and hacking on the other hand is a also something. All of these would lead to one's negligence as an investor. It is money we are talking about in the first place and that should be enough for us to put extra caution with every action and held ourselves liable for whatever outcome.",

Sounds like it will be chaos and manipulation will be a big factor to that system. Even a person accused without enough evidence is already judged in socmed where keyboard warriors and misinformation exists how much more on such system. Also, this is legal talk and not everyone understand the law, so if the vote casts are from lawyers it might work for legal purposes, but it can't be called decentralized and anonymity is not a thing on that system.",
