  "content": "Hi to everyone who's reading this, i hate asking help for money, but i really need those 600 USDT so i discovered this forum, and created an account. I saw that newbies have no trust here (legit), but i'm in a dire need to loan 600 USDT, so if someone could help me, that will really be so awesome, if someone can trust me. You can reply under or message me, to discuss the interest and the other matter. Thanks you for reading this, and i hope you have a nice day",
