Or both?  Both are top 2 altcoins in the market, i think you shouldn't hesitate to choose one of the two but should choose both. both have great potential and are worth the long term investment.You are a newbie and I think you made a wise choice to invest in 2 market-leading projects instead of looking for shitcoins. Invest in ETH and BNB, trust them, they won't let you down.",

Right now, it's more essential to me to have more ETH since the price got lower. But what I'm currently doing is collecting more BNB.So to balance it and if my budget is limited, I'll go first with Ethereum this time because the drop is quite high. And if you can own both at decent numbers, why not have them?",

      "body": "Any reason to choose them is appropriate, but in my view, each of them offers distinct value or utility. Despite holding more ETH than BNB, I still regularly used BNB during the last period because of some easy features, although the difference is not clear between the two, speed and transaction fee issues. It is also one of the reasons that we see so many people talking about them. This period can be said to be difficult for the entire market when the motivation for it to go up quickly is not much, so if you intend to invest in them, do thorough research and also balance between the different markets' profits and risks.",

But if we had to talk back about Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH), I would definitely prefer Ethereum (ETH). this choice is not an unfounded choice, I chose Ethereum (ETH) because Ethereum is a completely decentralized blockchain. In contrast to $BNB which in my opinion is less decentralized because the network is only controlled by approximately 21 Validators.",

Or both?  It is now a little late to invest in ETH, as the capitalization of this cryptocurrency is already quite high. If we evaluate from the position of obtaining maximum profit, it seems to me that BNB is more promising for this. The price is lower compared to ETH, which means that the yield may be higher. It is difficult to say for sure here, and therefore one can only try to predict possible events. I would prefer to choose both options as an investment in a rough ratio of 2 to 1. That is, I would allocate ~ 65% to ETH, and the remaining ~35% to BNB. Where 100% is not all free funds, but only those allocated for these 2 coins. Because there is a cryptocurrency of a completely different level and quality - BTC.",

ETH on the other hand is just a king of Altcoin that many still believe on this project, though there's no big updates but still I choose to hold since I know good prices will still come with ETH.",

There is a high possibility of bnb to reach more than 1k$ in the next few years. Same goes to eth, there is still a lot of potential and growth for eth as well. I still believe that eth can reach a trillion marketcap one day. So it is much better to invest on both because they are both good coins that we can take advantage of now on this bear market.",

When viewed from a usability point of view, BNB is a cheaper network to use, but for the quality itself, ethereum is much better. Both have their respective advantages, but if you look at the potential of the two, I don't think they are much different.",
