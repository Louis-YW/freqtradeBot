  "content": "The increase in the unemployment rate which is affecting the cryptocurrency market is self-inflicted, not that they're no job opportunities, it has been recorded that the easiest things are the most difficult to do. Most fresh graduates find it difficult to submit their CV or resume for a job search, which prolongs their unemployment lifespan. While those who send their Resume forget that in most cases considering the number of applicants that their application may not get read. Hiring managers when asked about how they read hundreds of CVs or Resume; some confirmed that they fling the whole resumes in a bin the ones that didn't fall into the waste bin gets read. Currently, it doesn't matter how well-structured you've made the CV, the goal is to keep hunting for a job opening that suits your skills. It could be Crypto or what you read in school. I'm as well unemployed and offering this service to myself, friends, siblings, and bitcointalk members who wish to work with a cooperate body.  However if you are employed but in a slow working environment; in terms of growth or you don't get those things you seek in a company like good pay, the ability to learn new skills, or making the best use of your existing skills, etc. Instead of withdrawing or resigning from the company without having a concrete backup or staying in the company because they are no other companies available to employ you immediately. You need this service to secure a new job before resigning. What I doIt's simple; I disseminate CV and cover letters to job openings listed on online job sites that suit your skills and accomplishments, not only that, I take time to tailor the CV or Resume to the language your reader understands; the company jargon. To increase the rate of job interviews. As this is a long-term process, prospects are expected to make an order between 5 - 10 applications in a month for better visibility. PRICEMy goal is to provide the best, and the cost per job submission of both CV and cover letter is $15, which beats the risk of spending more than $120 writing a CV and cover letter that won't get read. Note After building from scratch the first CV and cover letter the second and the rest of the Resume will have slight changes on the PROFILE  and OBJECTIVE Sections to suit the job opening. But, the accomplishment section or Experience Section may be the same. If you provide more experience or accomplishment then I'll add it to the CV.Contact me on Telegram for more details and samples. @Accardo_jobs  This thread will be updated with my job submissions for quality assurance purposes.",

      "body": "Good move. You have a nice idea and this will really do you good as well. Your services are most needed by unemployed young school graduates who are searching for job desperately without having any clues on how to arrange or coordinate their CV. Every year higher institutions Chun out graduates from various Schools leaving  them with no option than going into the workforce.or Better known as labour market in search of greener pastures. Which is very vital to human living and survival.Your price is moderate and a kind of affordable  and looks like you are perfect in line with the job CV modifications. Modification of CV to suit the employers taste is where applicants really have a whole lot if concentration and work to do. Some really lack that skills in writing their CV and resume which is the most vital point in employer schedule. Hey do not waste much time reading CV and resume so it's better you pin point your major areas which are the catching point to by the interest of the employer.",
