If you would read this news, according to which, in a competition 69 algorithms were submitted by scientists and 26 got listed that cannot be broken against Quantum Computers. (QC is not so common, but if they don't exist in a stable form then how they test these encryption algorithms while the computer itself is in a developing state) so yeah, this raises concerns about the validity of the news of RSA cracking.Hypothetically speaking, if they really cracked the RSA then it might affect cryptocurrencies but indirectly, because BTC and other cryptocurrencies are not depend on RSA only there is the SHA 256 algorithm also used but RSA is also used in BTC and that will definitely affect it but let's just wait to see what comes next because these are all just theories and the paper that Greck has published is also full of theories. We need practical proof.",

RSA-2048 is supposed to be really secure.  I know crypto stuff keeps improving, but extraordinary claims need solid proof that stands up to review by other experts and  the field is complicated, so any new breakthroughs have to go through careful examination and peer review first before people will believe them.  I need to see some credible evidence before I'll buy that you can crack advanced encryption just using a mobile device.",

He wants RSA to be replaced with his own security solution, which he says can be used by anyone as it's patent-free. I see that he wants to do a positive contribution in the security field however If his claims are wrong, that will be solely for the promotion of his product which is considered to be a bad PR in this case.",

Like seriously, bro? With a mobile device? I don't know what is possible and what is not, but why are people not allowed to see how he did it? For privacy reasons? What could be the other reasons? Maybe it's because it's just a claim and nothing else. I don't think it's true. You all know CSW says he is Satoshi. I see this cracking claim as the same as CSW claims until the person brings some evidence or shows that he could do it. That's my personal opinion, though.",

Thoughtful investors won't dare to sink their money into what they are not seeing a manifesting prove or fact that should drive them to take such risk except they are not really investors as may think they are. Nobody invests in the blind except they have money they can afford to lose therefore decides to give it a try by risking it. Nevertheless, no researcher will crack RSA-2048 and hide the proof to himself without wanting to take credit for it it's unheard of making it a usual claim as others before it.",
