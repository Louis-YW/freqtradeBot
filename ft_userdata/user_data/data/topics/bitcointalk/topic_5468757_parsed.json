It should be easy to recover the wrong phrase.There are two tools that I know you can use to recover the wrong phrase one is the BTCrecovery which is already mentioned above and the 2nd one is the FinderOuter recovery tool this one has a GUI and is easier to use than BTCrecover.

You 're right, in fact someone could have implemented a fake page that looks identical and being connected to their own server they could watch for user input. Once you enter the words, they are stored on their server and money is gone.But, as Charles-Tim said above, it can be used offline, if the user wants to.",

It's what I got from searching.Mnemonic Phrase (Seed Phrase/Recovery Backup)Reading it, you will get a list of words for BIP39 like Charles-Tim gave you above.QuoteWhat is a mnemonic phrase?A Mnemonic Phrase is also called Seed Phrase or Recovery Backup for a decentralized wallet. It is a list of words and proof of ownership of your crypto assets. Once someone gets hold of your mnemonic phrase, they can practically take full control of your assets. The Mnemonic Phrase can be generated under different standards. BIP39/44 is the most widely adopted standard in the crypto space. All BIP39 seed words can be found in this list. SafePal fully supports BIP39/44 standard.Metamask also uses BIP39 for their seed phrase and you can import your seed phrase to that wallet as well.",

I don't think you would find much difficulty brute-forcing the wallet using it.As for your code, I'm guessing it has been generated by AI? because I don't see where you get the URL from, and the idea that you could pass \"phrases\" to their site to recover your wallet. That's not something you can do.Maybe you can try some library like this one[1. I went through it quickly, and it looks like it would help you but there might be some better alternatives out there.I would imagine something like this (simplified) would work:- Check if the seed is valid by replacing that word like you're already doing- Generate an address(es) from that seed, and compare it to the address you previously had on SafePal.
