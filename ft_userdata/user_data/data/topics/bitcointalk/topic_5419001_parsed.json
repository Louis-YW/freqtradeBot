  "content": "I set my coin's total supply as, [2,100,000,000] but at version 0.15 (clone of litecoin), was hacked and hacker got extra coins, after that, I updated to 0.16.3 , so then was it fixed? I recently updated coin explorer and coin supply says over 2,200,000,000. Then, this means coin daemon (or blockchain) not fixed yet? or what?I don't know what happens now and how to fix this. Please help. This coin. https://github.com/BitcoinEssence/bitcoinessenceCoin explorer http://167.86.113.8:3001/",

      "body": "It's nearly improbable to analyze and fix the problem where you did not know the reason why something does work as it intended to be and tried to fix it by just merely updating the forked version of a coin. But don't forget to make sure that the oversupply is true because of code exploitation, just to remind you that it is also possible a wrong change of code is the reason why the supply has gotten over 2263039078.811458 based on the block explorer.A relevant discussion about the coin supply can be seen on https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/69492/btc-source-code-amount-h-file and https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/92619/is-there-a-command-to-get-the-max-supply-of-bitcoin-that-will-ever-exist-using.",

      "body": "Ok, so then now what is best solution? 1. From this state, just mine coin again and run the blockchain again? -> [Setgenerate true] commands disappears, then now how to mine from server's core daemon? 2. or update core version from 0.16.3 to newest bitcoin version 23 firstly? -> How to? Even Possible?3. other solution?Thanks.",
