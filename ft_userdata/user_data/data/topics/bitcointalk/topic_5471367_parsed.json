      "body": "From what I understood from the post you shared, Kevin did not have access to all those BTC259684.77 he was able to withdraw only 643 btc, Because, of the limits that MT Gox had at that time, In my thought, Kevin made mistake for talking to the CEO of the MT Gox and telling him about the situation and how he able to buy that much BTC at that low rates. I mean, this is all so crazy at first hand, I did not realize, things were that faulty back then. Well, overall, the story is really fascinating and really a good one too, I hope Kevin will have access to those 643 BTC that he was able to withdraw from it. Quote from: bitrebel on June 20, 2011, 09:22:31 PMYou are correct Kevin to take this approach. I believe Mt Gox tried to fuck everyone, especially you. Â I believe they may have stolen bitcoins from accounts, then tried to sell them to buy them back up, thus laundering them into their own hands. That's just my opinion, based on everything I have read and heard so far. This might be a possible reason behind that sell order, well, overall, this is so messed up.",

Though he denied/isolated himself at a point from the hacker and claimed he was merely into trading and only profited from a failed system. If he wasn't into something fishy, why did he write MT Gox? I believe his conscience pricked him to text MT Fox on that to appease himself. From the comments on that thread, we could even read some of the users throwing shades at him.Quote from: Faisal2202 on October 23, 2023, 05:35:06 PMWell, overall, the story is really fascinating and really a good one too, I hope Kevin will have access to those 643 BTC that he was able to withdraw from it.

And if you are saying, that's the headache of the Kevin, Toasty, then yeah, I agree with you. After withdrawing the BTC into his own wallet, it becomes his responsibility now, to secure it. And use it in a mannered way. whatever the decision will be, it will be of toasty now. He was not able to withdraw the remaining amount due to the limitations set by the Mt Gox exchange, the limitations were not lifted even after Kevin did extra KYC. As I said before, it was a mistake of Kevin to tell about the situation to CEO of Mt Gox.",

That's really a huge amount; if I think about it, 10,000 bitcoins just paid for the pizza. It's good that in those days there was someone who accepted Bitcoin as payment in a business establishment. I'm sure the person who did that will feel guilty if it's true that it really happened, which is why he paid 10,000 bitcoins at that time.Now, on the subject we are talking about, based on the story, at least he was able to release something that was more than 600 bitcoins, although it is very far from the balance that he actually has on the platform of Mt. Gox and nothing has happened. This is just a lesson to our communities that still remain in the field of crypto space.",

Thanks for sharing; this was a fascinating story that I hadn't heard before. However, I'm going to disagree with you. First of all, I'd like to state that I've got zero knowledge regarding the crash of Mt.Gox, how it occurred, and what mistakes the exchange made. Although, from my understanding, the user named \"toasty\" took advantage of a loophole in the system to acquire Bitcoin far cheaper than the market price. From how I'm seeing things, setting other factors aside that this user mentioned regarding the exchange's safety, it looks like it's intentionally exploiting something that wasn't supposed to function that way.In fact, he got away with more than 600 bitcoins, for which he could have been sued by the exchange. Thus, I don't see how the exchange acted shady and blocked the withdrawal of the remaining coins. Correct me if I'm wrong, because I might have misunderstood.",

Others continue to invest and they are some of the most well known proponents of bitcoin of today.

I cannot agree more with you, because, that thread was made around 2011 and it was full of red flags, and warnings, so we should avoid its usage, but I think there was no other option available for trading purposes, at that time. So, all would accept their destiny that it is what it is. Maybe those who knew that MT gox is a shady one, might have dropped the idea of using it and might have been saved by the hack of Mt Gox in 2014. I mean, if one has so much BTC, then why risk all the BTC to hold and trade on Mt gox, Why did people keep a huge amount of BTC on that exchange? Well, one logical answer is, that back then, BTC was not considered that much. But, they still have to take extra measures, because, back then, people who got into it, knew the potential, and did knew that it would make some great change in the future. But still, those people failed to control on there emotions and thought they had only one option and would be provided with one option of an exchange (mt gox).",
