I have seen many hacked Gmail, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, ChatGPT, and so other platforms accounts getting hacked and those sites are considered as secure by the users. If the database of the site gets hacked then that's a weakness in the security of the site but if a user's account gets hacked then that's not a weakness of the site but of the user who doesn't took care of his/her account and used a weak password or somehow his/her system got compromised.",

Well, it would have made more sense to me if Bitcointalk was the place where you keep your money or other valuable assets, but unfortunately, it's not, so 2FA should be the least of your worries on this forum. Personally, I don't care about it, this is a forum and I don't use 2FA in any of the forums I participate in, that's if they exist there at all. The reason why this looks like a must is what I don't know yet.If you like, you can continue to change your password and make it stronger and if you think you are being hacked regularly unlike others, you might want to look within your circle and be more protective of your gadgets. This is a community and everything we write is not even hidden, so I don't know where the too much concern about the 2FA is coming from.",

First of all, what's with the yelling? Take it easy. No need to shout. Second, you are completely wrong. I'm no cyber expert, but from what I've read seems all researchers consider humans (that is, users) to be the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain. According to many studies, 9 out of 10 data breach incidents are caused by human mistakes. So I'd say how vulnerable a system is depends a lot on the person using it.¬† This forum is no exception.Third, let's cut out the baseless FUD!

He can't expect other forum members to fight his battles if he isn't here himself anymore. I don't think the forum has an existential problem with account hacking and people left and right losing access to their accounts due to no mistakes of their own. If that was the case, we would see dozens of complaints weekly. We get a few complaints every now and then and it's unfortunate. Although we never understand what exactly happened, it's usually a mistake of the user. Some don't want to admit it, others don't know what they did wrong.
