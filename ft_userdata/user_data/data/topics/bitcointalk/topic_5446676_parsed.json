But I think it was about 100k in total and maybe more. But I sold most of long time ago when value of it was joke. Maybe I got few hundreds $ in total. Never tried to hold it and keep big amounts of DOGE. Now I found my old address and there is still over 8000 DOGE remaining, or $600. Now I only have to find way how to access this wallet, somehwere I had details of it.",

I have a similar experience, so I can understand your regret. That being said, we don't know the future so it's a matter of luck IMO. Who will believe you if you tell that Bitcoin will be priced at $10k in 2013 or even earlier? On the contrary, some coins that are priced at $100 or $1000 turn to dust in the last bear market, so yeah it involves a lot of luck that you don't hold the wrong coins. If you want to avoid something like this, you can probably try to save some coins/tokens instead of selling all of them. I don't think there is no other option unless you're filthy rich and you can spend $1000 to buy every single coin/token that exists in the market right now.",

I lost several dogecoins, regretting this fact right at the time when they valued more and more.Since then, I hate this coin.",

It was rather a unsatisfactory experience because something similar happened to me, I had about a handful of USD in Doge and I decided to sell days before the huge price increase it made until reaching its ATH. I would have easily gotten a good profit and bought a new phone or something. Since then, I avoid all kind of dog coins and tokens as the plague. Still salty from that experience.",

I think it looks like you are not the only one who has experienced that, because I was also one of those who used it in 2017, I even got into a platform with a type of doge faucets that was able to cash out at that time when I had already saved up I got 10k doge, at that time the price value of doge was around 28 satoshi.     There is nothing we can do but move on, face and prepare for the future, after all, it is not too late for us.

Since you got 30.000 Doge from a faucet I am sure you will like Faucetpay as they list a big list of the most trusted faucets and if you are patient enough you can still make a good amount of Doge,of course you cannot make anymore 30.000 Doge from such faucets as they have decremented drastically the payout because of Doge increase in price.I had also 2800 Doge but that at least I got about 1200 dollars from them as I had them lying in a multidoge wallet which luckily left me to import the key in a dogechain wallet.Nothing you can do,life goes on and I hope you find your next opportunity.",

This is crypto, when something is gone, it's gone. I know a person in real life who had somewhere like 90k doge long ago. He never saved the wallet key or he thought he saved it somewhere, did not care about it at all. But last year or before that when the price of doge went super high then we was looking for the wallet file/key everything. He did not find any clue. In the mean time he also changed his laptop several times LOLI always suggest everyone to keep wallet files/seed phase in a place where you can find it easily even after few decades. You never know something you have worth nothing today, someday it can make you a lot of money. But I don't suggest people to be in shitcoin.",

But you shouldn't think it's too late to hold potential coins because the market hasn't experienced a full reversal yet, so you can still buy potential coins that are expected to go up in the future.",

I once took part in mining this free Dogecoin and Shiba inu when they got launched on several faucet websites, but I later stopped because It wasn't worth my time back, as for you to reach minimum withdrawal one needed to be active for at least 3 to 4 months of active participation. However, lucky are the people who kept on mining and never gave up in the process, because today these coins now have significant value, of which only if you didn't sell your 30k Dogecoin for 35 or 40 dollars, by today that 30k Doge would have amounted to $2252 by the current price of dogecoin to be $0.0754. And the price still has more tendency to rise with the increase in the adoption of Dogecoin.",

I so much like your confidence to explain how you were able to accumulate a lot of dogcoin for a certain period of time and selling them then due to market pressure or fear that the market would fall and you are going to make loses on coin that you never paid a dime to get. That is how the market works and we should be very careful how to do things or we might end up selling the coin that may give us a huge amount of money if only we can hold for a little while. This is why it's very important for us to hold and keep holding not minding the market pressure and what many influencers do write about projects trying to describe when we should sell and when we should buy. We need to keep holding as long as we want to make a bigger profits.",
