  "content": "Up for sale today are Fully Functioning Block Erupters!!First a little history about the Block Erupters for those unfamiliar with these items.  Originally 12 \"Emerald\" Block Erupters were put out as a proof of concept.  These are the absolute rarest of the rare when it comes to these little pieces of Bitcoin history.  Unfortunately there are none of those available here today.... however there are some RARE ones to offer up!After the \"Emeralds\" proved the concept the Sapphire Collection was released.  They were released in 2 batches.  Batch 1 had 4 different faceplates.  Batch 2 had 7 different faceplates.  The original sale price was 1.99BTC per unit and a minimum order of 300 units!  ....and yes that's 597BTC for the minimum order!      During my research I found that the early calculations for ROI on these were about 163 days and seemed to hold under 200 days until Batch 2 FLOODED the market.  A rarity statement about the batches:\"Batch 1 - Block Erupters USBs were all flat colors:- Silver with an orange bitcoin logo (First ones to be shipped out) (RARE!)- Black (COMMON)- Yellowish-Orange (RARE!)- Red (COMMON)Batch 2 - Block Erupter USBs had regulatory markings on the aluminum heat sinks and had slightly better surface processing done on them. While they were the same hash rate, they did have a few minor hardware improvements. These came in 7 different variations:- Black (COMMON)- Blue (COMMON)- Red (COMMON)- Silver (COMMON)- Gold (SEMI-RARE)- Blue with surface concentric circle effect (SEMI-RARE)- Red with surface concentric circle effect (SEMI-RARE)\"With that being said.... today the following ones available for sale:From Batch 1Black (COMMON) - 10 5Red (COMMON) - 2From Batch 2Black (COMMON) - 22 16Blue (COMMON) - 3 1Silver (COMMON) - 16 12Gold (SEMI-RARE) - 3 1Random pic from testingRandom pic from testingProof they are not just lighting up, but actually hashing0.001BTC per erupterOR0.5 LTC per erupterPAYMENT: BTC -   bc1qlylhtyh3q0chdf6e4qa87u9647ddxmxcge0f0vPAYMENT: LTC -   LhwrYCvbEVX6vWHddhXvz5DFmK2YL8T85WSHIPPING: Based on location and preference or free shipping to minerjonesOWNER: Anonymous** Please only pay one of the payment addresses above.  I will not contact you away from this site for any reason. **First come first served via forum time stamp.",
