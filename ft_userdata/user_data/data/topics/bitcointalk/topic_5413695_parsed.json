      "body": "I'm sure its not profitable with current price equals 23$ - https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-powIts 1.5% of ETH price so 98.5% of old ETH miners will have to quit to make it profitable. I'm sure its not that low today. I'm sure that there are more than 1.5% of miners that left their machines running after merge.After ETH merge there is no good POW gpU minable coins that \"will still be lucrative in the future\", pick the best short term apy and dump as soon as you mined it. But I gess POW mining will enter a long term winter as 95% all GPU miners are without job now looking for alternatives.https://whattomine.com/",

I would do what Tytanowy Janusz suggested when you mine crypto as I noticed this month, crypto price is decreasing but I think it will increase again later.",

You need a decent atminer (most recent one) and cheap electricity. In my country even the best hardwere is not profitable in bitcoin mining. Break even point for BITMAIN AntMiner S19 XP is 0.16$/kWh at current BTC price (not including equipment depreciation). Its much more in most countries.",

Most are unsure, but they have some options, and the common projects between them are ETC and Raven. I have no idea, but what they told me just matches the information. Though I am not a miner, I hope you might get a little bit of an idea about what's next. Thank you.",

In difficult times like during this bear season all mining costs remain the same, even more you have to spend due to the ongoing energy crisis, while the bitcoin price has dropped more than 70%. This will make it difficult for miners, especially small miners, you will have to spend more money to compensate for the drop in the price of bitcoin. If you are not a person with a large amount of capital then mining will be harmful, not beneficial, it will be very difficult to make a profit as we imagine.",
