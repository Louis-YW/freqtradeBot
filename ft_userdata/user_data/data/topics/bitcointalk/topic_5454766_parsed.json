Is this company backed by the government or just another company like Binance/Tether? I'm not really sure how it will work out if every company is launching its own stablecoin. Won't be surprised if most of them got shut down and only a few remain (those who allow the government or other regulatory bodies to control it). Not sure exchanges in other regions have the incentive to include specific USD tokens controlled by one or two countries unless it is big enough like Tether.",

I believe it will happen eventually, government wants easier control at the end of the day. Not sure how other countries would apply it but I doubt cash will go anytime soon, so that is still an option. But yeah, it is hard to not feel that banks/governments will freeze your money anytime they wanted to, especially if you have limited options to store your wealth.Quote from: bittraffic on June 05, 2023, 01:14:31 PMSEC wouldn't look at this different from paxful releasing that BUSD for binance don't you think?Binance also have those USD on paxful which binance does have real USD on them.I believe so. They just started suing more changes and claiming more tokens are securities, so I doubt they will let anyone issue digital USD without their approval at all. Would be interesting if they tried to fight other countries to make sure they can control everything.",

Also, on these new measures to protect retail investors, it has also been speculated in this forum that these measure will impose that only people from a certain income bracket would be allowed to trade cryptocoins. Another one might be if your account balance does not reach a certain level then the number of trades allowed to the customer would be limited.",
