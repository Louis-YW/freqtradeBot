Absolutely not, I am just guessing, maybe he is a bad person, which wouldn't shock me considering he lost billions, and just pure lying to get out of jail.

What is fairness on Earth when the owner of Tornado Cash has to spend time in jail but SBF after making one of biggest fraud in history that affected lives of many people globally, can stay at his parent's home and play games? It's a myth around SBF and the USA. government.From $100k to $50M, it is a big lie and I agree that no way to convince me and others to believe in or feel sympathetic for SBF.Quote from: el kaka22 on February 20, 2023, 09:39:15 PMI am guessing that him having just 100k is both true and wrong at the same time because of these news.

I was very doubtful that he was seriously bankrupted and had only $100k left in his bank accounts (all accounts, not one account I mean).The media around SBF case is strange too. They seem to write and spread stories to reduce seriousness of SBF case and tells us stories that fiasco is not because of SBF and it is not his responsibility. Weird media but maybe it is a massive plan to protect SBF.",

It seems that the puzzle is being solved slowly, that's great. Maybe in the coming months, we will still hear another good news about this case. He use a small bank thinking that he won't get caught but I salute those banks for choosing their dignity or reputation and they choose to report SBF to the authorities than taking bribe money because I think SBF have also offered it with them.FTX made crypto bad because their collapse have affected the cryptos value and maybe there are some newbs who will think negatively again with cryptos after that incident. It kinda sucks so FTX should be punished badly for this.",
