  "content": "I think one really big advantage of trading Crypto is not only the volatility but also the available data. When analyzing Bitcoin, for example, you have soo much more data to watch than with forex. Think about:On-chain data (long-term)Derivative exchange data (short-term) This is a completely new dimension of data sets that you can use for price predictions that are not available for forex. You can find a lot of data on the following websites:https://lookintobitcoin.com (On-chain, macro charts)https://whaleportal.com/ (Derivative exchange data, short-term charts) There are many more out there like CryptoQuant, Coinglass etc. If you take the time to understand these metrics, your profitability rate will significantly increase, in my experience.",

Forex intermediaries usually show traders the tick volume. This is not a real or even approximate volume, but a quantity of price changes within a specific period (i.e. oscillation counter).",

But I didnt do forex, he said that crypto is much flexible and has more room for gains and profits with very interesting stuff to try on. Sincr he did compare when doing forex. Now he is focus on degen trading, a risky type on crypto almost same with forex according to him but more enjoyable.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on April 24, 2023, 11:54:18 PMThe Biggest advantage is volatility IMO.I agreed.

And with my experience, the preference of people makes them choose between Forex and Crypto trading, while many people are dealing with the two together. More opportunities are in cryptocurrencies as they are also used for payments against regular fiat, and many that are not even trading/investing it still deal with it, hence the reason for their high popularity these days.Mind you, the number of Forex traders and the market size are far beyond that of cryptocurrency. The FX market has an average daily trading volume of almost 7 trillion and it keeps growing yearly (Investopedia attests to that: Why trade forex). While the cryptocurrency market has far less trading volume. Just choose what suits your investment and trading plans and you will be okay.Besides, almost all factors that affect the forex market affect the crypto market because they can't stand in isolation and they are actually paired with fiats in most cases.",

The forex calendar is there to see and analyse by every trader. There are other measures like the charts but this is not the same with cryptocurrency. In crypto, data analyse is not readily available for everyone one, you have to belong to a certain community to understand the bump and dump psychology.

In forex, you have to be good at technical and fundamental analysis.I don't think I can disagree more. Yea every noob can buy PEPE and dump after pump but there is the top? At +50%, at+100%? Or maybe at +100 000%? you know its +1000% because it already happend. Just like coinmarketcap list 20 000 coins. The ods for spotting x10- is super low, especially witch tokens like PEPE (which are made several dozen a day, of which 99% end with a rugpull on the second day). You might as well say that any forex noob can open a position with x500 leverage, hit the bottom perfectly and sell when the price is up 2%, thus earning 1000%. But both your example and mine are unlikely.\"According to Gopluslabs the contract owner may contain the authority to modify the transaction tax and contain Blacklist function.

I have experience in both and I can say cryptocurrency trading is very easier.Forex market don't have a season but cryptocurency market do, in the bull season, if you do your research properly and make good coin selection for trading, any coin you pick to trade can make you big profits while you stay low profile during the bear market because even the good projects get hit by the fear in the market.",

There are many people who do not depend on data or analysis, but rather rely on volatility only and then take the risk.Also, data without fluctuations is worth nothing, for example, if there are no large fluctuations that help you profit, what is the use of data? You will not gain anything from all the data if these fluctuations that give you profits do not occur.",

The forex market is the world's largest market because the big players putting money on there and the liquidity is really big. For me there is no problem trading forex or crypto because the system that I'm using is applicable to all types of financial market. If I will compare the both, I'll say that volatility is a big difference because crypto can move 1%-100% in just a day unlike in forex you can only see small movement and the time frame that you should use is intraday for you to have a good trading performance. If you will trade, just pick one for you to master a niche. I'm against with trading a lot of assets simultaneously because it cannot give you the focus that you need to make profit in trading. Just pick one market, understand the nature of the market, research information that can help you and be consistent in order for you to become confident that will give you huge return in the future.",

Volatility is the number one reason why people trade cryptocurrencies instead in forex. It is much worth it in my opinion as well in the long run rather than sticking to digital fiat which is too boring to watch and takes a very long time before it could actually \"pump\". Also, fiat could be easily manipulated by the government which makes it not good for trading. Don't get me wrong, cryptocurrency could be easily manipulated as well but at least not because of the government totally controlling its whole system.",
