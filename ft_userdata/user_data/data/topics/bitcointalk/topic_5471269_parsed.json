Nobody is going to give you money without any assurance they are going to be paid back in return, doesn't matter how good your idea may look. It's too easy to make wonderful promises on this digital world where people don't have faces, IDs or addresses, because if something goes wrong, they simply vanish on the unknown to never come back again.",

If you want to have partners, even in the conventional world, you have to give an introduction of the solution and how its business for your partner.",

To look for partners, one must be presenting the idea and concept well and make sure that its viability and profitability as well as sustainability are not questionable. And for sure, a newbie here still lacks some level of credibility. However, am still wishing OP the success he is looking for.",

The thing here is that, you're at their favor whether you should be trusted or not since they're the ones that will invest on you, into your project if there will ever be.I am not that partner to say so that let's just be clear with that. But if you can provide all of those details and you're not going to put that on public since you're looking on serious partners, you might have hard time in finding the right one through the forum.Because it's easy to say all of those qualities that you're good, expert, honest, etc in words through the internet. But to prove that is another thing.",

I am ready to provide full details, discuss strategy and partnership. I want to create a mutually beneficial partnership and a successful project that can have a significant impact on the world.Let's assume that I am this partner. How will I trust you when your account was created three days ago with a Newbie membership, and you have only posted three posts so far? In addition to that you did not mention your role in the project or the budget you have, and you did not provide any proof of your experiences and skills that would qualify you to create a project that will change the world. I don't want to be disappointing to you, but your request for a partner means that he will invest his funds with you, and it could be thousands of dollars, and you will be in control of it if I am not mistaken.So, What guarantees and assurances will you provide him to ensure that his funds are placed in the right hands, that you are a truly honest person, and that your project will ultimately succeed? I have seen many projects launched that failed to achieve their goals due to market conditions, budget constraints, and a lack of investor interest, leading to their currencies becoming shitcoins in investors' wallets in the end.",

At least put something that will make the invitation more appealing to an investor's eyes. You want them to just PM you because you have an idea. I don't think you can make someone do that with just that. It's not like this is 2008 anymore where people would try to risk it by messaging anyone just so they could get a partner for their bright idea. People nowadays are wiser, they know about cryptocurrencies, they know about technology, so if you have an idea give some clues of how genuine it is, and maybe you will find a partner. You do not have to give all the information and I doubt anyone could just steal it from you while giving out clues. You could always edit the opening post to make it better.",
