  "content": "Thought this might make for an interesting thread...If you've lost bitcoins (i.e. they're gone forever, completely unrecoverable), post how much you lost, and add it to the running tally.  Right now, the running tally is 0BTC, since I haven't lost any bitcoins.I recently read a thread about someone losing 0.000001 BTC, and someone else losing 20 BTC.So person one would write:+ 0.00001 BTC= 0.00001 BTCPerson two would write:+ 20 BTC= 20.0001 BTCEtc, etc.  That way we don't have to run through pages and pages of thread to figure out what the running tally of lost bitcoins is.Make sense?  Good.  Do it.Starting lost BTC balance:  0.0000000 BTC",
