  "content": "If a telegram bot notifies you about changes on the forum according to your preference, for example: new topics on a board, your username mentions, new campaigns & bounties, replies on your post, and a few more similar options.Would you be interested in such a bot?if yes, then do you think it will be worth paying for? A small fee (like 2 USD for each month of usage) with a range of customizable options.I am planning to provide this project as a service. Not sure if it will be worth the time  Your opinion on this will be appreciated",

      "body": "I think these are already done for bots other users have made or by the forum's own features (eg notify) so you'd just be adding to that. Selling forum data as well as this might be something more people look at soon though (eg for new projects to see the things new coins are offering and what seems to be a basic requirement to attract larger communities - eg by similarities). The campaigns and bounties thing hasn't really been done though and might be one to look at but I don't think there's a huge demand for it as a lot of campaigns/bounties can be found by watching other people's signatures change.",

This idea is very nice and I am quite glad you suggested it.",

Maybe some, but I don't really see it as a platform where Bitcoin advocates go. Can someone recommend at least 3 Telegram groups/channels with professional and non-retard like style of communication where people are discussing Bitcoin? Maybe I am missing something.With retard-like I mean \"when moon\", \"when lambo\", \"when new exchange\", memes, lols, hodl, and similar type of crap.What I am trying to say is, does it have to be Telegram?

Their bots are perfect at fulfilling their intended purposes. As for the trust list tracker, I will look more into it later on and maybe I can contribute somethig new.Thank you, everyone.
