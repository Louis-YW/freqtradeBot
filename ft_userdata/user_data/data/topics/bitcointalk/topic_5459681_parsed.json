The companies also agreed to a judgment of $4.7 billion, which will be suspended to permit Celsius to return its remaining assets to consumers in bankruptcy proceedings. The former executives—ex-CEO and co-founder Alexander Mashinsky along with Celsius’s other co-founders Shlomi Daniel Leon and Hanoch “Nuke” Goldstein—have not agreed to a settlement and the FTC’s case against them will proceed in federal court.Full doc here:https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2223137celsiusnetworkorder.pdfI assume this is in order to freeze any possible assets Celsius might have?

Wild guess here!A company like Celsius with multiple assets like mining, lending, network etc is vulnerable and difficult to control, I think that's one of the reasons they had to go bankrupt. How will they control all the assets mentioned on the doc, it's numerous, if they focused on two; lending and mining it could have been better and easier for them to withstand and trace any pipelined problem. Normally a business will grow, and sooner it'll begin to drop in value, that way Celsius would have been introducing other assets gradually other than managing all of them at a go. It's wild that, while cryptocurrency based businesses are getting penalized, the market keeps going, a sign that only a few of this businesses should be in existence. Because if SEC can't harm cryptocurrency they'll focus mainly on crypto based businesses.",

Yes, users prefer centralized exchanges because of liquidity, 'convenience' and faster tx process, that's why they don't mind passing kyc on anti-privacy cex platforms, but it does not guarantee that funds are safu because they can be confiscated by the exchange because they have the keys. A good decentralized exchange like Bisq may not give users the advantages i just mentioned, but it gives them control, security and privacy.",

If you're referring to Binance P2P and something similar, I guess they do offer some convenience but it is not a deal breaker if a user is looking for a P2P transaction. There are other ways to make sure you don't get scammed such as using a multi-sig wallet as an escrow and so on.

The unfortunate news is that they have to 'wait' for the company to go bankrupt before giving any charge. Do they have no data before? It would be cool if any abuse is prevented for the users imo.",

They are enjoying their lives even after destroying the lives of many innocent users which invested their money into those shady businesses.

The system is known to punish poor people only and the ones with huge sums of black money will never be punished.",

I agree with your statements, the CZ is not yet been proven guilty for his wrongdoings and all those allegations are useless if they can't show the true evidence that could prove that CZ has really done those fishy activities. The platform basically the Binance exchange has been helping a lot of crypto users, and even newbies can use that exchange whiteout any difficulty.  I will not say that Binance is behind the growth of Bitcoin, but we still can't underestimate the role it has played for the crypto world. I'm not really sure that all those allegations against CZ are right or not, but I also believe that the guy is a Bitcoin enthusiast and a very sharp minded business man. I'm not going to favor him in anyway, but I can surely say that the Binance is a pretty useful platform for many users as of now.",

This is different from submitting kyc on Binance where you may be required to provide so many info about yourself including your ID card, passport, selfie photo, etc, and they can request for additional data at anytime, and the worst part is this data can be leaked to the dark web anytime or be shipped to blockchain analysis companies or the government, that's how to lose privacy.",

Every true Bitcoin believer should be glad that justice has been served. Although I doubt if the victims will get their money back , they will be happy that the person who caused them so much pain and suffering is not walking free and will face the full wrath of the law. I think that Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky shouldn't be the only arrested because he didn't work alone. His other executives should also be arrested so that they can all face the music And I say this with all boldness that  the long arm of the law will catch up with other Celsius like organizations very soon.",
