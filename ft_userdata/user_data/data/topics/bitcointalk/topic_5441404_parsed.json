Employees don't need private keys and neither do the servers checking payments (they can all work with from just public keys). If you're discussing crypto in this, having people well trained to deal with even tiny things like rbf flags is also very important.",

And these owners know how to protect their business and if they're not willing to invest in security starting from availing those anti-virus software then they know where they're going. But starting from there, there's a direction that they have to take through availing such service and when these businesses are scaling up, that's one big factor that they need to consider with the cost effective that they need to allocate budget for it. Cyber warfare is happening daily and these hackers and other cyber criminals aren't choosing any business but as long as they can penetrate and steal anything from any business, they'll do it.",

This could include anything from fund cutting to arranging funds for new projects or companies upgrades. This is important aspect because that way every employee understand the health of their company and it could affect the performance directly. If business is having high volume then definitely every employee knows company is going in the right direction. If not then it could demotivate employees for sure. This is important aspect in Crypto based companies such as an exchanger, crypto bank or brokerage firm and these days crypto lending companies are also rising. So lot of employment in that sector and it needs to be carefully implemented for the company and employees too. So most of the points does apply to that sector.",
