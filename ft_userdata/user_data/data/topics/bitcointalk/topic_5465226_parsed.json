  "content": "In a short video clip of Sadio Mane in his new club colours greeting other team members recently, surfaced on LinkedIn. I tried sourcing for the link but it was rather too late as the post had disappeared in the abyss of refreshed post. The player moved to Saudi Pro league club Al Nassr. He was rather kinda stunned when he immediately noticed a player bore same semblance to his teammate Ali Lajami. Am guessing his first thought at the moment was that his teammate has changed teams and was playing against them. Funny isn't it?In reality, it was Qassem Lajami, the twin brother of his Al Nassr teammate, Ali Lajami that he saw which startled him for a sec. Still haven't gotten the point?The beautiful game of football has over time seen players who share same bloodline or relatives play in same club, same league or in different clubs and leagues and even nationality. My talking point happen to focus more on the inclusion or presence of twins in same team, same league, same country team or different teams entirely.I can't say that one is better than the other, but in many cases, one twin gets fame and accolades much more than the other.Here's a list I compiled on some twins to have played top pro football till date. 1. Florentin and Mathias Pogba2. Rafael and Fabio Pereira da Silva3. Halil Altintop and Hamit4. Frank and Ronald De Boer5. Sven and Lars Bender6. Aleksei and Vasili Berezutsky7. Ali Lajami and Qassem LajamiPlease feel free to include any you remember and their impact or contribution to the game of football.Links:https://www.besoccer.com/https://cheapgoals.com/",

      "body": "I looked at the internet trying to find some additions to your list and I find some from this article: https://backpagefootball.com/top-10-football-twins/32407/It stated top 10 football twins but I just list the one that is not yet listed by @OP namely:Rene & Willy van de KerkhofQuoteStaying in Holland, with more double Dutch, it’s the van de Kerkhof’s. A generation before, and PSV’s answer to the de Boer’s, the VDK’s were a major part of both PSV and Holland’s success during the 70s. Rene appeared in the 1974 World Cup, which included being a substitute in the final (though Willy was also in the squad for the tournament) and is the more celebrated of the two. However, it was arguably Willy who enjoyed the better career – with 63 caps for Holland compared to his brother’s 47; and over 500 games played for PSV. Together at PSV the pair won three Eredivisie titles. One of these arrived in 1978, when they also won the Dutch Cup, the Uefa Cup, and both played in the 1978 World Cup final – which they were to lose to Argentina.Ebbe & Peter SandQuoteIt’s said that fans used to chant ‘you look like Ebbe Sand’ to his twin brother Peter. Sadly for Peter, while he may have shared Ebbe’s looks, he did not match him in terms of talent or success. Ebbe would go on to play in World Cup’s; win the Danish Superliga on three occasions with Brondby; German Cups with Schalke; be top scorer of both the Superliga and Bundesliga (in different seasons, obviously); be twice crowned Danish Player of the Year and so on. Peter, erm, ‘notably’, played a few games for Barnsley in the 2001/2 season, in between journeying around Denmark’s clubs.  I’d say at least he got the looks, but…Archil & Shota ArveladzeQuotenother tale of one twin having considerably more success than the other syndrome (you could say he was twinning…but you probably won’t, sorry), this originates in Georgia. Shota is something of a legend in his home country, being the national side all time leading goalscorer, while enjoying great success in his club career with the likes of Ajax and Rangers. His brother, meanwhile, had a decent career that included 32 caps for Georgia, and relatively successful spells with hometown club Dinamo Tbilisi, Trabzonspor and NAC Breda. Unfortunately for him, he is probably best remembered for being Shota’s twin.David & Philipp DegenQuoteDavid and Philipp are arguably equal in terms of their careers. Philipp has played for the bigger clubs, and will obviously be remembered fondly by Liverpool fans for his glorious spell there. David, meanwhile, spent that time with Young Boys, where, if nothing else, he was playing regularly. Both have won three league titles with FC Basel, two of them together, while David has two Swiss Cups to Philipp’s one. Philipp has 32 caps for Switzerland to David’s 14; and both were selected in the Swiss squad for the 2006 World Cup – although only Philipp played.",

      "body": "The Guinean Pogba twins have played for many national teams. Anthony plays for the French national team, but Mathias has represented Guinea. Particularly because of his tenure at Manchester United, Anthony Pogba is well-known.certainly, there are many twins currently playing in different clubs or the same club.but the strange thing for me is representing different national teams; one plays for the motherland's national team and the other for a foreign national team!!!",

      "body": "Well... it's not something unique to any sport, it happens in so many that... although it's not something common, it's not as strange as it might seem, on the other hand, perhaps the former I see with this board-gambling is knowing that twins could play in a certain professional team together, and this is a good strategy for any team, since the number on the jersey would be relevant in the decision of a few seconds in a corner kick to know if it is your assigned player to take care of it (o them)",
