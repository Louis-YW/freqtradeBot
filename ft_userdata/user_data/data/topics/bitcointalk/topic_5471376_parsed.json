      "body": "Dear,Thank you for your message. First and foremost, I deeply regret to hear that your experience with BrightFunded did not meet your expectations.I have come across your comments on multiple platforms (Reddit, TrustPilot, here, etc.). Please review our communications thoroughly. We have always been truthful and will never deceive about any matter. From our very first communication up until now (be it Community Calls, Twitter Spaces, or Ecosystem Updates), we've consistently mentioned our collaboration with an established company for our Trading Platform. This has been our stance since our initial Twitter Space to our most recent Ecosystem Update from last weekend. I kindly request that you revisit these and form an opinion afterward.Our message has always been clear: we have our own Web Trading Platform and App, all under our brand, BrightFunded.I've noticed on various platforms that you've accused us of otherwise. Until now, I've chosen not to respond, but I must urge you to cease spreading these false allegations.Our Trustpilot reviews have seen a surge recently since we launched just over a month ago (on September 12th). We encourage traders who have been with us for a month and members of our community to leave a review. This has led to a flurry of positive reviews on TrustPilot in a short span.To address your concerns:1- We've looked into your issue, and the reason the Trading Platform did not run smoothly on your end appears to be due to an unstable internet connection.2- Similarly, the occasional slowness of the Trading Platform can be attributed to your internet connectivity.3- Currently, every instrument has a spread between 0 and 0.5, which is among the best spreads in the industry.4- Once again, we have never denied that our Trading Platform was developed by a renowned company that creates platforms for the world's largest trading-related businesses.Should you have further questions or concerns, you can always reach out to me directly at jelle@brightfunded.com. I would be happy to schedule a call to discuss your feedback. While your experience seems to be an outlier, we always welcome and appreciate feedback.Warm regards,Jelle DijkstraCEO - BrightFunded",

You are just saying out a name here we don't get to see anything regarding what you are saying... So please do well to elaborate this post.",

      "body": "It’s not out of the ordinary that users jump into conclusion but, when you weren’t scammed or directly misguided, it’s hardly something you should directly asked that people abscond from there services. Perhaps you might advise against it but, clearly stating that “DON’T”, it’s a bold move.I could agree with you that, no matter what the CEO or support has to say, your at liberty to express your frustration with the platform, besides, that’s your experience on usage at the time you tried.Good thing is, they’ve got a rep to come clear a few things on the claims in the OP but then, hope that was it and the bugs are fixed yo ensure customer satisfaction.Meanwhile, paid reviews aren’t always the best form to encourage truth but, in the event that they pop up suddenly and in great numbers, it raises suspicion. Perhaps, users still have to make a whole lot of considerations even with the reviews.",

Even those who do reviews are mostly paid just to make a platform look legitimate or good; they want to make a business smell good or sound good.It's really just a matter of money, because the battle in this era is true. Maybe there's a lesson in the part you experienced there. At least, in that situation, you know what to do. Just always be careful every time you go into business.",
