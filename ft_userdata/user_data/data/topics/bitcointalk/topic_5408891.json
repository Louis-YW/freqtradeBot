The forum administration isn't directly involved with them, so it is up to the members to look up such information, just like they should use the search button for any other query that has been asked before.If we are going to include every frequently asked question in the welcome message, then it would be a mess. Imagine questions like “When NTF board?” appearing there because someone it too lazy to use the search button.",

They are third parties. Nothing even like bitcointalk notifying new users, like through the forum email notification. People that are passionately posting or actively posting on this forum will know about them, not knowing about it is like they do not need it.",

Maybe no one asked to have their site advertised. I am sure that if you PMed theymos, he would tall you straight if he would be interested in giving it such promotion, and if not, why not. Do it and let us know what he says.",
