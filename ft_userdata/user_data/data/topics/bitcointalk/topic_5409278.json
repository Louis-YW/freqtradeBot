  "content": "I came across a post on Twitter that suggests that ethereum would be going through some sort of Halvening just like bitcoin by next month. It has something to do with the finalization of movement to proof of stake as ethereum is said to be operating on the proof of work which is quite expensive. The proof of stake would bring about much reduced cost and as such less ethereum would be paid to miners daily which would reduce the selling pressure.The bottom line is that the value of ethereum may increase substantially after the completion of this exercise. You can go through the tweets to read up for yourself. It's a nice read. https://twitter.com/Montana_Wong/status/1556706440726716416?s=19",
