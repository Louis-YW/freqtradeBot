  "content": "One billion people is a lot of users, especially when it comes to digital assets and cryptocurrencies. That's why the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Bitget, and Foresight Ventures conducted a study to research the current status of cryptocurrency adoption. They discovered that while crypto adoption is still in its early days, the trend is pointing toward one billion users by 2030.According to the research, currently, only 0.3% of the total individual wealth is distributed in the form of digital assets.In comparison, 25% of people’s funds are allocated to equities such as shares of private companies. This stat highlights how undervalued cryptocurrencies still are. With more awareness and education, we believe that the number of cryptocurrency users will only continue to grow in the coming years.If the current trend of cryptocurrency adoption continues, it is not unreasonable to think that the number of users will indeed reach one billion in the next 10 to 20 years. After all, the total number of users has more than doubled in the first six months of 2021 alone. This is a testament to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and the increasing awareness of their potential.There are many factors that will contribute to the growth of the cryptocurrency user base in the coming years. For one, more and more businesses are beginning to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. This is making it easier for people to use cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. In addition, as awareness of cryptocurrencies increases, more people are likely to invest in them.Check out our newsletter at https://ambire-newsletter.beehiiv.com/",

It says it gets better which i agree and gives a good figure to estimate it, but by my own predictions are that before 2030 a lot of events must have occurred that will promote massive adoptions and change in policy for countries that have strict regulations against it.

The future of finance is crypto and as people will realize its benefits more will adopt it. The naysayers will themselves start accepting the crypto in time to come, and they will be the ones who will laugh on themselves.I think latest evolution of proof of stake has further strengthened crypto and now it will become a parallel decentralized banking system in time to come.",

Now looking at the rate of adoption, it can be said that gradually, Crypto and Bitcoin to be precise is gaining adoption globally. People are beginning to by the idea of Crypto. My opinion I that why there is delay in the Crypto adoption is the fact that most nations are anti Bitcoin so therefore most individuals see it as a big risk getting involved in it and if been caught up by their government, they would be made to face the law while some are skeptical of the Bitcoin development and still speculating around and waiting for the time of their assumption to be properly met so as to adopt it. But in all, it strongly believe with the gradual unfolding events going on within and around the blockchain, 2 billion Crypto holders would be achieved before 2030.",

I guess they just multiply the total upcoming population of people in that year that's why they get that possible numbers, but it doesn't mean that we believe that since there are so many thing that might happen and we need to prepare if government will ban it or totally regulate the cryptocurrency industry. But looking at what's happening on crypto this past years for sure we can see some great adoption came at that year.",
