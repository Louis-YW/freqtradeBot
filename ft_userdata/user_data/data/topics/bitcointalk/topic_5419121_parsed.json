  "content": "QuoteBritons would now vote to rejoin the EU in a second referendum by a record 14-point margin, a new poll has found.A tracker poll found support for reversing Brexit is now at 57 per cent, compared to just 43 per cent who want to keep it.Support for rejoining has steadily ticked up since the start of this year – with 'out' still ahead as recently as May this year.But the survey by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank shows the picture has changed quickly amid economic and international turmoil.Professor Sir John Curtice, a respected political scientist at the University of Strathclyde, said that the shift may be down to changes in the economic situation – and suggested the trend may continue.\"In reporting on the poll in February we noted that evaluations of the economic consequences of Brexit were particularly strongly related to changes of mind about being inside or outside the EU. This pattern is replicated in the latest poll,\" he wrote in an analysis of the findings.The professor said it seemed \"highly likely that a darkening of the public mood on the economic consequences of Brexit helps explain the increase in support for joining the EU\" and added that it should not be ruled out \"that the financial turbulence of recent weeks may at least have helped to reinforce that mood\".\"What happens to the economy and the country’s fiscal finances in the coming weeks and months may not only be crucial to the Conservatives’ future electoral prospects, but also for the continuing level of support for Brexit,\" he said.Sir John noted that 2016 Remain voters who would now vote to stay out of the EU were much less likely (40 per cent) than those who would vote to join again (85 per cent) to say that the economy was weaker as a result of Brexit.\"A similar difference exists between those 2016 Leave voters who would vote to stay out and those who would now back joining,\" he noted.But despite the strong public opinion shift towards wanting to rejoin the EU, no major political party is actively campaigning to do so.Labour leader Keir Starmer said again this week there was no chance of his party taking Britain back into the EU.\"It's straight no from me. We’re not going back into the EU,\" he told LBC radio, adding that he wanted to \"make Brexit work\".Even the Liberal Democrats, who in 2019 said they wanted to rejoin the EU without even putting it to a referendum, have only set out a tentative roadmap for rejoining the bloc's economic single market.https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/brexit-rejoining-eu-takes-record-14-point-lead-in-latest-poll/ar-AA13tS0F....This appears to be emerging as a controversial hot topic. With many europeans vocally calling for the UK to face punishment before being allowed to rejoin the EU. Given recent conflict between russia and ukraine, I've wondered if the UK would feel safer outside the EU not having to devote manpower, resources or budget towards ukraine's support. As they would be expected to if they rejoined the EU as a full fledged member. If the UK did rejoin the EU perhaps they would wait until after the situation in ukraine is resolved. As an american who doesn't interact much with brits or europeans I wonder what the underlying current of public opinion resembles. For #brexit to succeed I would guess many brits were unhappy with the direction of the EU or discontent with circumstances in general. Has this changed leading into 2022? Has some type of massive shift occurred?",

It will not stay as such, if Rishi Sunak is able to get the British economy to a growth phase. And so far, his policies look promising to me. And BTW, Brexit was a permanent decision. I don't think that they will consider going back to the EU, just because a couple of polls showed majority support for doing so. The Brexit referendum was a result of almost a decade of lobbying and campaigning.",

They are playing friend / foe games with both US and Russia as it suits them best. Keep in mind that Turkiye would like to become part of EU, which may not leave them so much room for being friendly with Russia like other actual members (like Hungary). On the other hand, they need some sort of acceptance for their actions against the Kurds, which EU/US won't give, but Russia has no problems.

Actually the only ones happy about Russia and showing it are North Korea, unsurprisingly.Some more are \"friendly\" because they're desperate for gas or have other political games to play, where the reality may be much more complicated than meets the eye and it's very easy to be deceived.Maybe I'm wrong. But from what I know, even China (and Turkiye too) advised Putin calm down and stop the madness.

In less than 2 years a referendum is held.The basically saw the situation we've seen in EU over the past 6 months (ever since Russia invaded Ukraine) and thought they could exit the union to reduce the effects that UK experiences.

To join russia. Iran's doctrine is always bilateral relations with every country. There is no \"anti\" any country defined there. There is also no joining any side defined either. I dare say in the current world Iran is the most independent country that doesn't play in other countries games, instead it defines its own hegemony. Which is exactly why the budget of United States's one week of cold war with Iran is $180 million Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 03, 2022, 09:08:03 AMNo. I don't expect them ever been in the \"anti russian front\"; at least not for real.If you knew a little bit of history you wouldn't say that.As an Iranian let me tell you that there is no pro Russian stance in Iran. Neither among people nor in the administration. Nobody has forgotten than in the 80's when US and Soviets were at war, when it came to the full scale invasion of Iran they became allies (with 80 other countries) a war they lost I should add. The last 2 years of the war in Persian Gulf Iranians were fighting against both US and Russian navy at the same time. In the 90's when it came to more sanctions against Iran, US and Russia became allies again. In early 2000 when US Gen. Clark is ordered to Destroy 7 Countries in 5 Years Russia and US were allies again. In 2010+ when the strategy is medical and economical terrorism against Iran, US and Russia were allies again.",

The last 2 years of the war in Persian Gulf Iranians were fighting against both US and Russian navy at the same time. In the 90's when it came to more sanctions against Iran, US and Russia became allies again. In early 2000 when US Gen. Clark is ordered to Destroy 7 Countries in 5 Years Russia and US were allies again. In 2010+ when the strategy is medical and economical terrorism against Iran, US and Russia were allies again.Woah. I stand corrected (although Russia allied with US sounds odd, I think that I understand what you mean).Still, if not pro-Russia, they still try, especially lately, to enrage US, at least that's my feeling.Plus, also lately, they seem to help out Russia sell some resources under the radar. It may be \"business, as usual\", or may be more, I don't know.",

Specifically the $7 trillion they wasted in West Asia and US got practically nothing out of it while Iran got everything.QuotePlus, also lately, they seem to help out Russia sell some resources under the radar. It may be \"business, as usual\", or may be more, I don't know.Well Iran and Russia and at least two dozen other countries have had relationships in different fields including economy and energy for many years. For example SCO and BRICS are two of the biggest ones. So obviously there are a lot of trades/swaps/etc happening amongst these countries.It is not entirely \"under the radar\" either, it is mainly not-using the Western payment methods like SWIFT and US dollar for that matter so they can't monitor or prevent it from happening.",
