  "content": "Hello mates i tried doing some fun stuffs with python BeautifulSoup library to scrap some information and possibly save them in a variable maybe to get to see the anchor tags and also scrap to see users with the highest activity in the last 20 days, play around with some informations scrapped from bitcointalk url  but unfortunately i got an error message. I tried the code on a few other sited and it worked well but that of the forum gave me this errori tried the same code on a few other sites like analytics I was able to get all the href and anchor tags from the sites i did similar for facebook and it worked so i kept wondering why it didn't work for Bitcointalk url. I will be glad if some one can educate me why i can't scrap information from the forum.",
