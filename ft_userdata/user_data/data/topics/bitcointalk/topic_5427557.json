  "content": "Bitcointalk had been an eye opening for me even though I don't come here that frequent. I had read through many post here and learnt new things about Bitcoin and how the system works which had ameliorate my interest to educate people around me about what Bitcoin  entails. I had been thinking of how to present Bitcoin and it technology to people around me in a different comprehendible manner but I was still not convinced until I took the courage to bring it to them in a simple way using PowerPoint. Since I have some of my friends and people who will love to learn new things especially about monetary technology, then I told the boldness to prepare a PowerPoint presentation from random sources online to explain to them on what Bitcoin really entails. I was able to explain in details on what Bitcoin is and how it could affect us positively if we pick interest in it. WHAT INSPIRED ME I see it as a burden to me when people keep investing and holding fiat even when inflation keep rising without having a better alternative to invest their funds. Fiat keeps losing value with more threts to employees. We all know that Bitcoin is very volatile and this had been keeping the price to fluctuating creating the overbought and oversold gap. I see a great fortune investing in Bitcoin which was one of the reasons that complelled me to keep advocating about Bitcoin so that people could see the light. MY OBJECTIVESBTC To promote Bitcoin awareness.BTC To educate people on what Bitcoin really entails.BTC To increase the adoption of Bitcoin.      POSITIVE RESULT BTC I saw the curiosity of my audiences to learn more about Bitcoin.BTC I was able to impact a lifetime opportunity. BTC I was able to disclose some materials that would help them learn more about Bitcoin and how it works.BTC The turnout was massive.  CONCLUSION I will like to appreciate everyone who had been posting quality posts that had affected my thinking faculty to this day.  It took me some days to come up with ideas on how I was going to bring the presentation to success, and I have very glad about the turnout and the interest of my audiences which in every way inspired me to continue advocating about Bitcoin BTC",

I’m curious on the content of the materials that given to the attendees. I hope it really focus focus on the technology and utility rather than the price talks which usually the common intention of the participants.",

From what I have seen it might be possible that you rented the space for the seminar and brought it all necessary technological tools that is needed to make this seminar a reality. I am always happy when I see persons that are eager to publicize and attract people to the bitcoin ecosystem by creating awareness about this priceless currency. Most of them might not understand the concept of bitcoin at that first meeting, that is why I am suggesting that you create a platform where the participants can still contact you and ask questions. This platform would serve as a medium for exchange of ideas and information. This will at least give them more foundational knowledge about bitcoin and would also assist them to take the decision of joining the bitcoin ecosystem.  Congratulations Mate.",

Bitcoin should never be forced onto people. That's what the government is for - to force you to adapt to what suits them or what they call a greater cause. People are supposed to make the switch voluntarily and naturally after learning the difference between bitcoin and traditional finance. Understanding that you need nobody else but yourself to move money to any place in the world is a powerful message. All we can do is to educate and share information about the advantages of this alternative financial system. But like satoshi himself said in a post, \"if you don't understand it, I have no time to explain it to you\". I am sure I got the quote wrong, but it's something like that.",

This little work you have done would definitely yield results positively. Looking at the background,  I saw curious gestures from participants in the seminar. I believe they have been fully imparted with the knowledge of Bitcoin. If I may ask did you put them through the setting up of their various wallets and another these people you gather what's categories of Field do they belong to. When I mean field, I mean their works, businesses etc and how can they be able to comprehend the trends of Bitcoin if incorporated into their various businesses as I see the  the seminar is not a just normal or random type.",

It is a great thing that some people took it upon them selves to spread it adoption. But the information handed out during the awareness sections by some need to be questioned. My first introducer to the bitcoin world only spread its profit part something like me gaining in every raise of it. And this has seriously drive people to put in there entire savings to maximise profits.Things like store of value and its ability to hedge a little against inflation than fiat are the first lesson. Its risk lesson could be thought after the learner gets more knowledge why he needs to move away from fiat then subsequently security and other protective guides. Nonetheless kudos to the advocators",

Your timely seminar has to extent assisted in reducing the misconceptions and the number of persons with some half-baked knowledge.

Many of them thinking it’s not needed but I believe it’s indeed needed in the region where bitcoin outreach is not that strong and peeps really need to hear about it from someone trusted. For this, definitely we need local hero’s like you who can keep spreading the good lessons about it. You had courage to arrange sponsored seminar like this, go in front of those peeps and teach about it. You can create your own lessons from trusted sources, have modules for step by step teaching. :-)Good luck mate. Congratulations.",
