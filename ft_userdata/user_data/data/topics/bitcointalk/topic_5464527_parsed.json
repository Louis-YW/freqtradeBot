  "content": "This is my alt of Gulttam2a2Yesterday I made a post on our local board claiming that the last two lines of the post were collected and translated from another place and used in my post. I am sharing here the link of the post where it is mentioned that I have stolen two lines of my post,Post Link Basically I made the post from my actual experience but I used the last two lines of the post to match the post where it is said that I am I stole the last two lines. I read the article with which the last two lines of my post were combined and based on that idea I created the last two lines of my own where I was told I directly copied and pasted that article into my post. If you take a good look at my profile you will understand that I have never posted any copy or I have not used any AI in my posts so why would I copy words from other places to post on my local board and use them in my posts?  I was not given any opportunity or enough time to speak after my post was plagiarized. My account has been permanently banned without verifying the allegations.  Out of 15 lines of posts, only two lines of posts are being accused of plagiarism, even if the allegations are proved to be true, I would request everyone to give me one more chance. Since I didn't copy the entire post only the last two lines I made my own with the idea so hopefully I'll get a chance.",

Therefore, do not deviate from the rules; publish your posts only on this topic, but first transfer them.",

Bitcointalk is the forum to discuss own idea and if you are using others idea then you should add source link. plagiarism is strictly prohibited here and I am not seeing any unbanned chance for you. One of our local board users is trying from one year but still not unbanned. Have you ever bothered to read forum rules one time only? it is clear mentioned in rules no 33 that plagiarized is strictly prohibited. two lines or even one lines (same to same) are enough to prove that you are content stealer.

The reason is obvious why your account got banned and as you can see the translation of the post you made contains the lines from the original which is very much the same. I think the chance you have about getting unbanned is very low or almost to 0% and the reason is you didn't even admitted that you have plagiarized someone's work. It would be fine and not banned if you only quoted the original then you wouldn't need to start a ban appeal.",

It's rather strange, isn't it, to come to the forum, and the first post is about participation in the competition? Let's ask everyone else. Do such newcomers exist? After two forum postings, you have already listed all the members of your Bengali section.

I hope you will forgive my mistake and give me another chance to prove myself.Plagiarism has always been unacceptable in this forum and it will always be unacceptable. Willingly or unintentionally you have plagiarized someone else's content which isn't a good act at all. If you already knew that plagiarism could cause a ban on your account but still you did that act despite knowing everything then I don't think that you'll get another chance because I have seen that many members who were banned due to plagiarized content didn't got another chance from the admins and mods of the forum. I don't know if your apology will be accepted or not but I recommend you to stick with your words and avoid any kind of plagiarism on this forum or anywhere else because stealing of others work isn't a fair thing and anyone who does that should keep in mind that such kind of act won't give them any success in life. Try to create your own content rather than stealing someone else's work, and if you use someone else's work then properly quote the author and original source of the work to avoid plagiarism. Proper referencing is needed when you're copying and pasting someone else's work because without proper reference it will be plagiarizing of the content of someone else.",
