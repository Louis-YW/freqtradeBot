  "content": "Does anyone here know of a casino where your VIP progress matches your current VIP progress like being a platinum VIP in Stake? I know there's a casino like this but I can't find its website right now. I can't remember where I read about it, but I think it might here in Bitcointalk. I'm considering leaving Stake.com due to the recent changes in their VIP program.",

What I remember is that it is basically give no great benefits to do such account level transfer because we missed many thing especially the level up reward provided by the other site. Maybe it will only give jump progression in the new site for the VIP level but I dont think it is good enough. I agree that it is better to start from zero in a new site and enjoy the process and progress.",
