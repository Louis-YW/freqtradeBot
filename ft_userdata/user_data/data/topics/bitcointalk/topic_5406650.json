  "content": "Hello there,I wanted to share and get feedback on an iOS App I have made called Bitcoin Simulator. It's a trading simulator app.It's free to download and use.I first launched it in 2017 but recently I revamped the UI and added more features. I also added a $100 Trading Competition that runs monthly.Any feedback is helpful and appreciated.You can check it out here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-simulator/id1243328672",

      "body": "Maybe I would have checked out the app and helped with some feedback, but unfortunately, I don't use iOS and i believe most people here are in the same boat like me. Any plans of releasing the android version of the app?The app could also do well with a website where one can check for more details and updates about the project, if possible.",

And paid one is by removing the ads?Are these reviews from AppleStore are real? Sorry but for me, I can't trust this app and actually there are lots of online trading tools or apps that you can able to use for free.",

      "body": "Apple automatically makes it available for MacOS but it is not designed for MacOs and therefore will likely be a sub par experience.Interesting I did not realize we did not support iPhone 6 and below, though we do only support iOS 14+ because we built this on SwiftUI.As far as trusting the app, there isn't really anything to \"trust\". We don't ask for personal information, we don't have accounts, there is no risk associated with using the app.Yeah the reviews are real actually.Maybe this is the wrong place for us to post for feedback, as you are all relatively seasoned bitcoin investors or at least people with a good fundamental knowledge of Bitcoin. While our app mainly targets people who are brand new to trading Bitcoin. Nevertheless it is interesting to see the general feedback about a lack of \"trust\". This is interesting to me just given what is from my perspective the absolute no risk nature of our app, but I think in crypto in general people are skeptical of any project and rightfully so. I'll think about how to improve the messaging/branding to make it more clear.",
