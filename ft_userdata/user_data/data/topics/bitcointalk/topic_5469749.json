  "content": "I share wit una how I introduced BTC to my friend & a brother after my knowledges on the potentials of BTC.I previously learn in this forum from some creative BTC investors say saving money 4 bank way person no get plans to use am na waste or say na longtime saving system to achieve a hug amount of savings to take start up business na still waste of time cuz e suppose dey somewhere e dey yield more money as profits as at then.So that inspired me to talk to my brother way dey abroad and him plan to dey send specific amount of money com home on monthly or weekly basis 4 like 2yrs schedules as savings to take build house 4 we country here.But I brought to him about BTC savings account whereby the money supposed to be saved in the bank can be invested on Bitcoin just as a normal saving system but as BTC savings, e get the potentials to grow the money Â higher than expected & most especially, 2yrs without tempering is a long time period that has u the goal advantage to store ur BTC as to profer a pro-incomes since the trading strategies is depended on its traders patient as a cause of volatility of the coin.So I made him foresee the possibilities of reaching the goal to his expected amount to take build the house instead of 2yrs to take realize maybe $20,000 total deposit in the bank, e fit take am maybe $10,000 capital to take reach the $20,000 or if he can keep saving (investing) the funds by the weekly or monthly on BTC til that 2yrs, e go give am multiplication or more of the total savings invested (saved) on BTC.Another is my friend who dey Israel & the cause of the ongoing crisis there now don bridge him work whereby him dey home now dey chop the ones him don hustle.I don tell am to stake any amount him fit tolerate on BTC just as when person dey stake to gamble normally then make him just give am time & to see the potential wonders of BTC trading to enrichment pathing him a great lucrative flexible source of income.However... I no promise am heavens & earths of BTC oh.I just talked to him like friends without convincing him and I hope he would be a benefitial of the potential financial enrichment of BTC and so he can testify by himself.Meanwhile... These 2 guys has forex trading trust issues after learning about Ponzi's schemes.So I just thought them about the guidelines on securing their BTC wallets about the wallets encryptions & backing up the entire wallet's including online & offline private keys saving system and all that on how to keep passwords safe and private.I hope to hear them say to me somedays that... Na waoh. So this kind flexible lucrative and legitimate source of wealth na real na him me dey left behind since ? ðŸ˜‚Meanwhile... I have also talked to them about inflation and deflation as fluctuation of the digital marketing so their faith go strong when them dey notice increase & decrease in values in the market. But the long time aim to Invest on the coin BTC is an advantage to explore profitably.",

My admitting to the volatility with the possibilities of fluctuation in Bitcoin, I no sure say inflation go fit hold the market for a whole long time of 2yrs.This na 1 main reason why BTC investors need to keep eyes on how the market dey go. So with the range of time planned to used the money, \"Conciousness\" would be our \"watchword \" where by, na to aim to secure the capital 1st while trading the income but depending on the range of time.",

To introduce person for bitcoin no be problem but the risk also involved na another thing person need to consider. Bitcoin dey volitile, yes no doubt but if the volatility come carry am enter Bear market, and na that time your brother want to use the money build the house, how you go take explain to am say $20k don reduce to $15k or even $10k? Because according to youe narration you tell am say 2 years interval and bullrun dey take 4 years to complete it's circle. So bitcoin na good investment but make we no come dey over excited to the extent wey we no go know the risk involved. If you wan explain bitcoin to anybody tell am the Risk imvoled in other not to get into problem when the Risk aspect don come, because no be every body go take am lightly with you. Some fit even jail you and acuse you of defruading them.",

Unnecessary alerts for payments of service charges that we don't have any idea on how they work. Banks keep finding means to rip their customers off their hard earned funds and they are not even feeling any bulge to stop it. It's so sad for the customers because they trust the banks to keep their assets safe but they're the ones turning back to cause them losses in bits.Â  Â  In my own opinion, it's far better for the customers to just find the littlest of business to invest part of this money and at least it'll be yielding more returns or they opt for alternative financial institutions like opay, palmpay and kuda. They seem more trustworthy than normal banks and it's better because customers money will be untouched there.",
