  "content": "Take a minute, try to understand what magic DEV did in Ronin smart contract! First ever 0% tax project with abbilty to grow, to have marketing, development and stake funds. On top of that liquidity tokens are burned forever and contract will be completly renounced once stake is out.First ever project that takes money from frontrun bots! Just think how many projects have problems with those!This is not your ordinary jump in/out project! Ronin has opportunity to become multi bilion marketcap project!The principle is simple, even kind of unique, TAX on buying and selling is 0%, so you always get exactly what you pay for - that’s great for day or long-term trading. But, here's the catch, since there’s 50% of all tokens locked inside the contract as soon as you sell, your transaction is automatically followed by a new transaction worth exactly 1% of your trade. It’s released form that locked part (initially 50%) and it then funds marketing 0.33%, stake 0.33% and 0.33% development.
