  "content": "Hey! Pardon our dust while we are under construction!While we nail up some last minute things we figured we would talk about who we are and how we started. My Liquidity Partner (MLP) is a grassroots project with vast but humble roots. We started our strategy on our initial pools with our own liquidity. ( insert subthread about what a liquidity pool is) We founded our strategy by investing our own liquidity into our initial pools.From the  beginning we didn’t plan to bring on many partners. It was just a closed platform for 50 people max. From the beginning, we planned to keep a closed, tight knit platform of 50 partners max. We had no idea we would soon be able to grow well beyond that.But as soon as that pool of people was filled up, we realized the algorithms were performing beyond expectations. Rather quickly, our initial pool filled up, and we realized the algorithms were performing beyond expectations.Then we realized the interest for a stable growth project was there, the people were there, and even more those people were beginning to trust the idea. It was then that we realized: the interest for a stable growth project was there, the people were there, and most importantly, the peoples’ trust was there.It’s constantly performing, there's no days where it’s not performing. It was very consistent. Soon enough we felt confident enough to bring on more partners. There are no bad days or days off – the system is constantly performing, consistently exceeding expectations, keeping your portfolio safe. Because of this, we felt confident to expand our network and bring on more partners, knowing we could provide them a reliable and rewarding  experience. But the main idea was to effect global good through this project. So we decided to sustain our charity foundation through the pools.Anyone coming into the pool as a partner gets a return and becomes an owner of the foundation through a unique smart contract. At the heart of this project is the aim of inspiring and affecting global good. We decided to sustain our charity foundation (insert small sub thread on initiatives) through our growing pools. Anyone entering the pool as a partner receives a return, becoming an owner of the Foundation through a unique smart contract, letting them effect global good through their commitment.We ran into a few issues as any project does. Mainly people not believing the rate of growth we were delivering. We overcame those doubts in a lot of people by continuing to perform despite market conditions, we have been delivering anywhere between .75 to 2.5 percent weekly since inception. As all successful projects must, we overcame struggles that helped us finetune our systems and create and maintain trust. Our main difficulty was that our performance was too consistent: people couldn’t believe we so quickly and easily delivered the growth rate our results showed. We overcame these doubts by continuing to perform at this heightened level, despite market conditions, delivering anywhere between .75% and 2.5% weekly since inception.You can look forward to a thread about what goes on behind the scenes here at MLP weekly. Remember: MLP is here to keep your portfolio safe.",
