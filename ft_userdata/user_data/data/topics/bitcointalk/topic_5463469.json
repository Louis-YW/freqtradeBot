  "content": "Hello, dear friends! My name is Daniyar, I used to be the Minister of Investment in Kyrgyzstan. I would like to tell you about my project, KELKEL, which I wrote in 2020. The main idea is to regain sovereignty through the implementation of a decentralized blockchain system. I managed to persuade a politician who was in prison to adopt my program. Thanks to my program, he became the President. Before the elections, he vigorously promoted the idea of implementing blockchain technology in government agencies, but after becoming President, he abandoned everything and reverted to the old ways, while monopolizing mining in the country with my innovations.I am seeking support from the community. I am sure that you want to see a quasi-state where all the ideas of the crypto community come to life. You can familiarize yourself with the program on my Facebook page, by using the translation feature from Russian to English. You will also be able to review a brief program from the President, which I wrote entirely. I need your support to implement Blockchain!Summary of program: \"Furthermore, it is crucial to emphasize that the integration of Blockchain technology must not come at the expense of fundamental human rights, personal freedoms, or individual privacy. The innovative potential of Blockchain lies in its ability to automate processes, minimizing human intervention – a computerized system remains impervious to bribes and immune to negotiation.The far-reaching implications of adopting these cutting-edge technologies are extensive and transformative. Blockchain's multifaceted benefits encompass a range of sectors: curbing and eliminating corruption, elevating the quality and accessibility of healthcare services provided to our citizens, ensuring unparalleled transparency across all facets of governance, safeguarding the integrity of primary statistical data, fostering unwavering trust in the democratic election process, and combating the pervasive issue of urban pollution.By harnessing the potential of Blockchain, we can aspire to elevate the overall quality of life for our fellow citizens. It is paramount to recognize that the successful integration of Blockchain into our national infrastructure requires a visionary leader who possesses the unwavering political will to implement these innovations and relinquish absolute power. Such a leader is poised to steer the country toward a future marked by technological advancement, transparency, and a renewed commitment to the well-being of our people.\"My program: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02fYqrb3df4p5A3BZJfw8zLbmc5NzWZ1X1pFt6QJSWw1fCfCrYzEwYsGhTbpqKq7FPl&id=100002510134047&mibextid=Nif5ozProgram of President: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02eSr2GHMj3HobzdkgHDYHbhkardKMXLX63LZ6ZrSNMBYv9HAxLLAYuoHqSNXcWM5Vl&id=100004948146129&mibextid=Nif5ozBTC wallet: bc1q5gfv85s8lvaal9fkprgvkp59wsj53eg4865clwPS We are under control of Empire: elections, stats, government - everything is centralized and even we can't choose our candidates, only faithful senators chosen by server. As a result, we lost our lands, we lost our huge water reservoir who went against are in prison. They sold it!",

If the US shut down the Federal government today, the States would figure out how to make things work, and better. But they won't shut down, because they are making too much money screwing the people.What is the first way that they are screwing the people? By convincing the people that they, the Federal government, is really needed by the people.",
