Dortmund was excellent in 1st half injury time after creating a 0-1 score by Emre Can. but in 2nd half, Bochum equalizes the score by penalty kick kevin after Gitlens handball on the penalty box. but no wait for a long time Dortmund back to win after Bellingham creates a score with Salih's assist. with this match, Dortmund goes to the next round.",

Depends too how Freiburg going to this match, because still fight in 4 position in Bundesliga, matches vs Juventus (think so they will promotion) also not be easy. But rest of the pairs look impressive too!",

But rest of the pairs look impressive too! the quarter finals of the DFB-Pokal are very competitive, dortmund also have the opportunity to enter the final but just like you, bayern will again win the DFB trophy this seasonfor the match between bayern vs freiburg, surely bayern will win, if play at allianz arena, it is very rare for bayern to lose",

And, I agree, it's not impossible, everything change can happen in football. but, even though both teams seem strong on Bundesliga. we can't still ignore Munchen and Dortmund. I don't dare yet to bet on Eintracht and Union if there is no schedule yet on who meets who in the next round. but if you still want to play, bet in under $1 is good for union.",
