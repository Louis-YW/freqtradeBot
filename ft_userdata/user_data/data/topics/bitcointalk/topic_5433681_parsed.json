  "content": "QuoteKevin McCarthy reportedly agreed to spending caps that would limit future aid to Ukraine as part of the deal with ultraconservatives that enabled him to finally be elected as House speaker on Saturday.Mr McCarthy, a Republican, secured the position in the early hours, following a historic five-day 15-vote fight that brought Washington to a standstill.His Right-wing opponents from the chamber's Freedom Caucus, dubbed the “Taliban 20”, wielded their opposition to US aid for Kyiv as part of their justification for voting against him in the first 14 votes.Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of the most hardline aid sceptics, led the charge against Mr McCarthy’s candidacy for speaker before eventually yielding after an extraordinary confrontation in the chamber.In scenes shown on live television, Mr McCarthy walked over to Mr Gaetz after the failed 13th vote to beg him to change his mind. Rebuffed, he walked away only for a scuffle to break out behind him as another Republican Congressman, Mike Rogers, lunged at Mr Gaetz.As he accepted the gavel in the early hours of Saturday, Mr McCarthy, who was backed by former president Donald Trump, outlined the Republicans' aggressive lines of attack ahead of the 2024 presidential race.He vowed to \"pass bills to fix the nation's challenges, from the wide open southern border to 'America last' energy policies, to woke indoctrination in our schools.\"The election bid by Mr McCarthy, 57, who has served as Minority House Leader since 2019, marked the first time in a century that voting for a speaker has gone beyond one round.Finally able to take the oath of office, Mr McCarthy swore in newly elected lawmakers who had been waiting all week for the chamber to formally open and the 2023-24 session to begin.But his protracted fight foreshadowed how difficult it would be for him to govern with an exceedingly narrow majority and an unruly hard-Right faction bent on slashing spending and disrupting business in Washington.According to reports, to end the impasse, Mr McCarthy agreed a deal that the House would commit to passing bills that would cap all discretionary defence spending at 2022 financial year levels, meaning roughly $1.47 trillion. Congress has passed four emergency supplementals totalling more than $100 billion since Russia’s invasion in February.President Joe Biden will require Congress to approve any additional military aid later this year. Should one of the rebel lawmakers - who have vowed to oppose any further aid packages - be given leadership roles in the House Rules Committee it could create immense hurdles to passing additional assistance legislation.The most recent $45 billion package agreed by Congress will not be affected by the new House leadership.“Haemorrhaging billions in taxpayer dollars for Ukraine while our country is in crisis is the definition of America last,” Mr Gaetz said last month as to why he had stood against Mr McCarthy.Matt Rosendale of Montana, another holdout, recently voted against US support for Ukraine, citing what he said were more pressing security needs along the southern border with Mexico.“This is a harbinger for a protracted legislative paralysis,” one diplomat warned, telling CNN that “the Freedom Caucus – which is not particularly pro-Ukrainian – has just demonstrated its clout.”Another expressed concern about “the policy concessions McCarthy has to make, and if they are going to affect the US role in the world.”Mr McCarthy shrugged off suggestions that the concessions could weaken his power.\"That gives me no problem or concern whatsoever,\" he told reporters, describing his deal with critics as a \"very good\" agreement that \"empowers the members\".https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/kevin-mccarthy-agreed-to-cut-aid-to-ukraine-to-secure-us-speaker-role/ar-AA1644R8....I don't pay enough attention to US politics, to know if ukraine funding was a bargaining chip in Kevin McCarthy being voted in after 15 separate voting rounds. (The most voting rounds required to confirm a speaker, in more than a century) I'm not even certain if negotiations behind the scenes are accurately disclosed and reported by the media. I would assume at least some of the claims are rumor mill content. The economic and financial implications if this turns out to be accurate, however. Could carry a few long term repercussions for europe. It is known that the united states provided the vast majority of funding and resources to support ukraine during the russian invasion. If that support is lost, europe would have to significantly increase ukraine support as a function of core GDP. Which could have some negative consequences.Of course, there is also a chance that these rumors will be unfounded and US support of ukraine will continue onwards the same as always.",

Instead of that, they worked with spies, agents, high spending on space and many other things which all failed.

I don't know if any politician in this modern era would risk treason prosecution by being a Russian asset.It could be just about the narrative of sending mountains of money abroad while the USA economy (and people) is struggling, it is something Republican have questioned before and they may keep loyal to that point of view. Also, I doubt Europe will be able to provide the same level of support USA has been able to provide.",

How would someone ever consider reducing the US defense budget (support for Ukraine)to the tune of $75 billion because you want to be the Speaker? They don't care about the effect this policy would have on the war in Ukraine and how many lives will be lost due to this policy. I don't know where the Taliban 20 rebels are getting their motivation from but they should consider what would happen to Ukraine without unconditional support from the US. Kevin McCarthy should have stepped down instead of accepting many of these fearful conditions. It is possible that there are still other secret conditions that would be unveiled to the world with time.",

And this was at a time when large number of Americans were struggling with double digit inflation. The fringe GOP lawmakers are perfectly justified, as they want these funds to be utilized within the United States. The European Union has a population that is 1.5 times the size of the United States. Yet, they have sent far less aid to Ukraine. Let the EU share the burden and contribute in equal terms. What prevents France, UK and Germany from sending in $10 billion or $20 billion to Ukraine?",

But we are talking of war which leads to the loss of lives and properties massively. How would the US after encouraging Ukraine to go to war and promising them all the support now suddenly withdraw their support? The United States, NATO, and its allies should ensure that the war ends before they withdraw their support. They should seek peace with Putin before their fight about who has contributed the most. The other European nations cannot contribute the same quota because the US is richer and stronger. Kevin McCarthy should consider that reducing the US budget on defense would cause disunity and disagreement among the friends of Ukraine. I pity Ukrainians because, without quality support from the US, this war might turn against them.",

I pity Ukrainians because, without quality support from the US, this war might turn against them.     I do not think that spending on Ukraine war would have that much bad impact on American economy at all. First of all it helps an ally to become even a better ally, and considering Russia is a natural enemy of USA, it is important that Ukraine wins this war, if Russia takes the lands they want to take, and even worse put a puppet like Belarus at the top of Ukraine? That's going to be pretty tough to recover from and USA would be hurt by it as well. This is why it's quite important that we end up with fighting towards helping Ukraine win this war, it would be definitely a much better result if they win for USA as well and money you spend now, would be investment for it.",

Some Member of Congress has to ask that he be removed, because...2. He broke a commitment that he made.All this does is give McCarthy time to find or build up Congress into the position that he wants it to be in two ways:1. Talk enough House members into doing things the way he wants;2. Find one or two popular members that agree with him and the war, who might win as Speaker if he were out;Then he could break his commitment to no-more-war-funding, and the war would get funded even if he were out.Remember. McCarthy barely made it. And he was just barely kept from making it to Speaker, mostly by Goetz alone. So, it might be easy for him to maintain the position even if he goes back on his commitments.But if he loses the Speaker position by breaking his no-more-war-funding, by the time he does it, he might have convinced one or two popular Members to do the war support thing. One of these members could be voted in because of popularity in other areas... if McCarthy was removed for breaking a commitment. In other words, McCarthy's position as Speaker unstable, but still could wind up being something that moves war funding ahead. It might be done through a different Speaker, however.",
