Besides having ICOs and having fundraising through VCs, most cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin has an allocated percentage of the total supply to the team; so they can fund development and pay the employees.",

But with so many altcoins out there, you really need to do your own research on each one in detail.",

They control the protocol behind the project and can make decisions like burning coins/tokens or changing how it operates.Bitcoin is different cause it is built on a consensus program, although there exists a core team which weighs in on improvement proposals.Quote from: Sunrise360 on August 15, 2022, 10:38:09 AM2.  After development, how do the developers make their own returns?• Run an ICO and investors exchange their coins for BTC, ETH, USD etc,• They could allocate certain amount of coins to the team, which they can sell later,• They could run an outright scam,• The could also buy their coins early with the confidence that it would be more valuable if they worked hard at it.",

See coins like ethereum, BUSD and others that are centrally controlled to many extent by the developers, just similar to central authority. Only bitcoin is different.Quote from: Sunrise360 on August 15, 2022, 10:38:09 AM2.  After development, how do the developers make their own returns?They pre-mine some of the coins they want to create, they have most of it, they use some to pay some people involved in the progress of the project, they sell some at low price to early investors, increase the price when the coin start to trade on exchanges which is the listing price. If people buy more of the coin, the price continue to increase. Do not forget that the developers have some pre-mined coins which its value continue to increase as the coin adoption increases.Never fall for ICO or IDO scam, they are risky, new crypto projects are risky.",

If you are referring to the price then the devs can’t control unless they have buy back program to recover the price.2.]The funds that they get on IDO is there profit already since the investors get only tokens with limited liquidity on exchange that is not equals to the investors total investment. Later on they will get profit once the product finish. Actually they will get all the profit for the product while investors benefit only with speculation to pump the price of tokens.",

I think developers dont have any control especially if they are using tokenize platform or smart contract.  But if you are talking about the price,  definitely dont have any control,  its the market decide about it.  But of course they can do manipulations on it but not advisable.Developers usually have returns on token share or salary from the owner of the project.  Its case to case basis what kind of compensation they will choose or negotiated.  If they are the owner then usually they will cut on fees on platform or token share (vested).",

All cryptocurrency controlled by developers except Bitcoin. If you see the Terra luna than you will understand.2.
