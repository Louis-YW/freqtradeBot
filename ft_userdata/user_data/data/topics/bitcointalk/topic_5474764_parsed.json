If you gamble with a bigger amount, either you win or loss just quit for the day. But to prolong your gambling time, use small amount and enjoy but there is nothing like jackpot unless you just have the luck.",

Maybe they should know what is the intention of the people giving that advices since they are giving that advices so they can influence those people think about quitting to continue to gamble. But there's nothing near with that since winning a jackpot is base on luck and that will not matter on how long or how much money you spent. A responsible gambler should know on when to quit since winning a jackpot is hard so if they are in losing side better if they quit since deciding to continue will result to worse situation on their side.Much better if they consider gambling as a for of entertainment so that they will not compete with anyone but instead they should enjoy their own games without worrying anything or anyone. Its good to quit while we still have money on hand rather than deciding to do that when we lose everything since with that its hard to recover.",

In the event that you've got a lot of time on your hands, you're going to want to make sure that you've got a good idea of what you're getting yourself into.Winning in gambling is always a difficult thing to get, but not completely, I would say it's easy to get if you sacrifice dozens of tries with some of your money just to get the occasional jackpot, and if you have got it I suggest you  to calculate the amount of money you have deposited with the amount of winnings is it balanced? I'm sure usually the number of losses will not be able to be covered just by getting one jackpot, just think about it, it's not a win but the casino returns your money that has previously lost several times, and it's hard to even break even, that's obvious.",

But because of our incapacity and we're not having that much bankroll, when we're interested to someone who's gambling and we want to be a spectator. We tell that person that he/she is too close and that's the advice that those gamblers have that intention to see someone either keep going as they're fun to watch or usually someone that they just want to lose a lot of money. And very seldom someone who wants to see a gambler succeed and win with his bets.And to those gamblers that have always received a tip whether they will proceed or not. You know yourselves, you know your capacity and how much you can afford to lose. Don't be too dependent to those people that you need to hear them out with anything they say. Because at the end of it, it's going to be your money that will be put into risk and whether it win or lose, the risk you're going to take from it is together with your money and not by the other gamblers that are telling you to do this or that.",

If you can afford it then there is no problem, those who are advising other gamblers to keep gambling because their luck might be around the corner are doing it wrong, all gamblers are build differently, they should have completed the sentence with if you can afford to lose the money. The reason why I gamble only when I have spare money is because of how much I am making per week, some times I don't have spare money for gambling and if my mind is all set on gambling there will be a problem, I won't be able to do some things that I normally do when I gamble less in a week. If I start making more money per week then it will be easier for me to increase the rounds of my gambling in a week, because I am making more money, what you can afford to lose is what should do the talking, I hope those who took such advice know what they are doing.It's not entirely a bad advice but honestly, this isn't an advice for every gamblers, they can easily take this advice in a wrong way, thinking they need to start throwing every penny they have at gambling because they don't know when their luck is closer.",

If it doesn't sit right with you, no need adhering to such an instruction. Though it's rare, I've experienced it myself. Also have read a thread on this section about a player that used this method to gain back all his lost that day in gambling. The disadvantage remains that the losses may continue until you lose all your funds. I think you should stop gambling when, within, you're done. Playing more out of the idea of others is at your own risk. Quote from: stadus on November 20, 2023, 12:22:31 PMWe have different approaches to gambling.

The concept is to reach our goal, why we are participating in games. Those chasing profits, still doesn't have a certain strategy to hit the jackpot. If not we all would have been playing more than we should to hit jackpot. Players still limit their gambling duration everyday and still achieve more wins. Therefore, no advice in gambling is irrelevant, anything works in gambling. It's now left for players to stick to the plan they think is best for them. Because whatever outcome the follows, the player would suffer it alone. Nobody would be there to help him on that. So, it's like a duty to be careful on the decisions we take. Other player's technique should be exclusively left for them to use, while we devise ours and play with it. Nothing is more painful like blaming some other person for our misfortune. It's better we blame our self.",

That is merely a fallacy base on what they think is working for certain people but it is not a general agreement by gamblers. Maybe they have stayed longer and have won couple of times but no, it is not about constantly playing or consistently playing but how lucky you be in your bet. There are people whose first time bet has brought to them winning that they never expected while there are also people that have played all through their lives without winning. This has happened in soccer bet where I know certain people who are talking of stopping gambling because they are not really making profit despite how much they bet.

Is this true? I have heard gamblers make such statements but I believe that it is just a motivation not to quit gambling because your lucky day might be close. There are cases where gamblers quit gambling out of frustration due to constant losses. This saying is like an encouragement to keep gaming because quiting early is not an option.QuoteThis advice is actually making gamblers believe that they can win when they spend a lot of more time in the casino, they strongly believe that not stopping or taking break will bring them closer to their jackpot. Maybe this advice was misinterpreted because spending more time or money on casinos doesn't guarantee winning. Taking a break helps to improve concentration and also gives bettors the privilege to evaluate their gambling activity or experience.QuoteOne of em told me that this is why I don't win, that I only gamble when I feel like, he said constantly gambling is a must if you want to win, but I disagree, because I have seen too many people not knowing when to quit until it was too late. Everybody is entitled to his own opinion. This might be his own experience but this is not the correct position. Constant gambling might also lead to ceaseless losses. Gambling might not be favourable every time so there is always a need to follow a budget. QuoteTo me, gambling is a theater, a form of entertainment that I pay for, not a way to get rich quick, for them it's a must to win by force, one question seem to change his mood though. I asked him why he isn't rich yet if he is actively gambling every time for all this while, this changed his mood and I took a turn. Your gambling view is correct. It shouldn't be seen as a source of income because it is unpredictable. It is possible to be rich gambling but we shouldn't rely on it to get rich because big wins come once in a while. I liked the question you asked him, at least it showed that his beliefs are invalid assumptions.",
