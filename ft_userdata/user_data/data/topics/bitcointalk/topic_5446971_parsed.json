This practice maybe can provide profits to gamblers, but the problem is that our accounts can be threatened with being frozen or our bets being canceled unilaterally due to fraudulent practices. I have never tried this kind of arbitrage technique because I think it is a laborious practice because we have to monitor more than one bookmarkers and I think it is not efficient.",

I know from my previous topic On which Sports do you like to bet apart from the listed one here? that soccer is the most sort after sport or go for another game.   I do not know much about other sport, but in football, I do not know how arbitrage betting can be helpful because there are three outcomes which are win, draw or loss. If choosing arbitrage, it would result to loss in football, also because the odds are low. But in sport bets that the outcome is win or loss, possibly arbitrage betting may be helpful, just like in tennis. I can see it helpful more in casinos games like Roulette and others where the outcome can be three but with a very high odds, just like my favorite Roulettes.If a casino notice that you are doing arbitrage betting, one of the bets that favours you may be cancelled while losing the other, you account may be banned from using their betting platform again. Arbitrage betting is not illegal, but gambling sites do not like it. You account may be banned because people that go for arbitrage betting can go to the extent of having multiple accounts on the same betting platform, while most gambling sites frown against arbitrage betting and having multiple betting accounts on their betting platform.",

It isn’t uncommon to have the ability to live bet when the odds change so that you are a winner no matter what the outcome is.

If you are caught in this action, you will be banned by the casino and your account will be frozen. This is why using this strategy will lead you to more loss because you will have good amount to stake on the games and it will lead to your ban by the casino.It is better that we see gambling as fun and not a medium to make profit or to see it as a life changer,so that you don't run into great loss. If you win big along the line of having fun,then enjoy your win and see it as a lucky day for you.",

From humble games of sheer luck to intricate tactics like arbitrage wagering, we humans have been perpetually mesmerized by the prospect of raking in the dough via gambling! Yet, with formidable power comes colossal responsibility.The genuine riddle, ladies and gents, doesn't solely revolve around fattening our wallets; rather, it's about harmonizing the precarious dance between the hazards and spoils of betting. Is it genuinely worth the relentless grind to probe and examine each and every tantalizing betting prospect? Or, perchance, should we direct our energies toward crafting a multifaceted assortment of bets, designed to soften the blow of losses and propel our gains into the stratosphere?As for the burning question of which sports to gamble on, well, that's purely subjective. However, I contend that the true goldmines for betting aren't necessarily the fan favorites. On the contrary, it's the oft-overlooked underdogs of the sports realm that present the most delectable profit possibilities!",

Most of the successful arbs bettor use huge bankroll and they are the one you always see on scam accusation board that has a balance of 1000$ or more that frozen due to their so called unknown reason.Arbitrage betting is really profitable if you can spot them but the problem is casino doesn’t allow this since you are just betting on their error and it’s not gambling anymore.
