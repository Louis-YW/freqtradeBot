Probably you aren't using a flat betting method, like a fixed amount of bet per game and it's strictly for spreads with odds 1.90 (the basis of my computation).So there's the summary of my computation, assuming I have a total bankroll of $5000 USD and I'm using 2% of that bankroll per wager which is $100.With flat betting ($100 per bet), I would be gathering a profit of $  4,010.00 with a win rate of 60%, that's on 300 bets. So here's the computation on my net profit ratio. $ 4,010.00 / $5,000 = 80% profit... That's a huge profit ratio, especially if our bankroll is also huge.",

      "body": "Actually 60% is already high, you're a genius if you were able to achieve that win rate percentage. As per research, this percentage is the minimum you need to be profitable. Why 52.4% is the most important percentage in sports gambling.QuoteAlbert Einstein putatively claimed that compound interest was the most powerful force in the universe, declaring that: “He who understands it, earns it…He who doesn’t…pays for it.”The simple mathematical logic supporting compound interest’s power to exponentially grow capital over time is irrefutable. Anyone in finance, or with a cursory understanding of bean-counting, knows that time is money. In a similar vain, the fact that sports gamblers must win or cover bets over at least 52.4% of the time is an inevitable hurdle all sports gamblers must clear to be profitable.Quote from: swogerino on December 10, 2023, 12:58:52 PMmy win rate is good well over 60% .....You should be in good profit with the right bankroll management.",

Are you currently in profit, or not yet?I do not have the past calculation of my net profit from gambling. Probably it might be a negative net profit, or it might be positive. I do not anymore focus on making money from gambling. If I lost this week budget, I fund the gambling account again next week. But there are sometimes that I won and use the money on something fun like to drink beer, eating meat and other foods. Because I do not have past calculations, I do not know if it is positive for me, but I know that I have fun while gambling. I can not also go to each gambling sites that I am using to see my total loss and total profit, that is a waste of time for me.Quote from: Ziskinberg on December 10, 2023, 12:04:18 PMLet's consider a scenario where you have a total bankroll of $2,000 dedicated to a specific league.If you are in profit and your win rate is 60%, how much have you made (net profit) so far?I have given you the answer you need above, but I have to also comment to this. $2000 bankroll?

Many the time,  why most sports bettors lose out of bankroll so quickly due to low bankroll,  and as long as they maintain such low bankroll, their chances to make runtime profits from the bets becomes very hard at some point,  and that is why we have recorded a lot of those loses from that pattern of betting using the low bankroll.",

Besides, being right 60% of the time can mean very little when the odds are often providing profits that are very miniscule. So all in all, I think the subject is approached with a wrong mindset here to begin with. Just bet with what you are comfortable to lose based on your current income and savings. Don't start with any amount you can't live comfortably with if you lose it. For some 2k will be peanuts, but I doubt there's many people like that actually.",

Gamblers who are serious to make money off of it should consider creating one for themselves to ensure that they are not spending more than they can really stomach. I agree with tracking your bankroll 'coz it would help you imposing self discipline and control over your funds. I think many of us have the same story to begin with; a good bankroll because we have huge expectations in gambling. Then eventually having a smaller one once you encounter loss. Personally, I believe that bigger bankroll could yield to good profit for the reason of more chances to pull it up but not guaranteed. There is basically more bets with $1k than $100, right? But once you are already with the realization of how things work in gambling, that is where you would be settling with bigger or smaller amount depending on your comfortability afterwards.",

So I don't know if I was just lucky or if the sportsbook just rises its margin and lowers its odds now but I'm a little bit disappointed because I was thinking to have found a safe and juicy sportsbook. If it was just luck I should lose my winnings in the coming months, and it will get even harder for me, if it was just a kind of boost of the odds from the bookmaker, I should keep my bankroll safe but it will be difficult to make profits now.",
