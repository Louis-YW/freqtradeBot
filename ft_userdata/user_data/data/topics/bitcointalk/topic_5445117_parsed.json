Use this patch and compile Bitcoin Core from source code, https://gist.github.com/luke-jr/4c022839584020444915c84bdd825831. You just need to follow compilation guide from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc#building. But if you don't want to store any Ordinal data on blocks, you should run Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 or other client which doesn't support SegWit which means your node doesn't store any witness data.",

Assuming of course this is a kind of consensus (eg. enough nodes agree)On my own I would choose a transaction size based approach like charing 10-100x fee for the top 1x of the transactions?Quote from: equintana on March 16, 2023, 07:20:22 AMOrdinals discussions have been on the table now for some time.

Theoretically it's possible, but who knows how reliable is it. You can initiate connection with any full node, then send \"mempool\" message[1] which ask list of unconfirmed transaction. After you obtain the list, you just need to check whether it contains any Ordinals TX. Or just ask Ordinal TX data using \"getdata\" message[2].[1] https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/p2p_networking.html#mempool[2] https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/p2p_networking.html#getdata",
