I started a new exchange because the old one was completed for me but the new exchange from BTC to XMR is still not processing since 24-06-2022.I was not familiar with the TLD until I checked whois database. The site is two years old and I do not think this should be a factor to trust them either. How reputed they are in their targeted audience? Quote from: logfiles on July 08, 2022, 09:20:37 PMOP, you might wanna create a much better scam accusations with more details. Follow this guide https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=260073.0I think OP does not want to post his addresses in public domain. XMR users are sometimes paranoid about their privacy or OP would go with better options like reputed crypto exchanges. Interestingly in the partner section for BitSwap, I see Binance which gives me a tick that they use Binance to exchange coins.",

But good to see that you guys created an account in this forum and want to help users with issues. I am glad that you want to address an old issue which is positive. Unfortunately, the last time OP logged in was May 28th. So he is pretty much inactive. I would suggest you create an announcement thread for your service on the Exchange board. Here is the link to that board https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=223.0Consider taking a Copper membership so you can images and links. You can buy copper membership here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote",

By the time OP opted to complain here, it means he tried to contact you through several means, of which you didn't even bother to help him.Now here you are pretending you care.Any serious trader shouldn't trust your exchange. Your customer support is completely incompetent",
