It would show a great sign to the markets if bitcoin held decently throughout the duration; and on the other hand it would be catastrophic bad news if bitcoin ended up having a couple of long lightsaber-ish red candles, ending up having the BTC to be liquidated.",

So you get better interest rates since they have a hard asset to sell if you default.Probably good for both companies. GS gets to make a low-ish risk loan and CB gets financing with better rates then the open market / bond sale type thing.-Dave",

If a bank as large as Goldman Sachs lends away millions in USD with Bitcoin as collateral, it means only one thing: that Bitcoin is valuable. You cannot use it as a collateral if the bank doesn't find it valuable. So this is really good. And since Goldman Sachs is now doing it, smaller banks will definitely be watching with focus and eventually do the same.",

It's nice to see that there are wall street giants who are coming in and understanding what a money making machine this sort of exchange can be. Like it or not, for widespread adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to happen it is going to require a few big exchanges where the average person can feel safe storing their \"virtual tokens\" over a long time period. Many have no interest in learning all the intricate details or holding their own private wallets like some here might advocate. On that note Coinbase rakes in a lot of fees and maybe need to reduce those, that is why they are looking like such an attractive investment target right now.",

What's the big deal here? Coinbase is a market listed company and if Goldman Sachs thinks that Coinbase will do great in future, they don't have any issue in investing there. It's all fine as both of this Goldman Sachs and Coinbase belong to the same league. One deals in fiat and another one deals in cryptos, but both are centralized in nature, like brothers! I frankly don't see any impact on the defi projects. neither good nor bad!",
