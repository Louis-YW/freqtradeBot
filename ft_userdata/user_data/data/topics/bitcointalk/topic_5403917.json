  "content": "Greetings everyone, I hope you're all doing well! Today I have up for auction something very special!This is the first CoolStorage.org canvas ever offered, a design concept I came up with in 2019.I plan on releasing a small numbered run of 16x20 canvas prints, this auction is to help fund that.The concept of the piece: \"THE TIMES TRAVELER\"In the future the secret of time travel is discovered. A time traveler goes back in time and convincesThe Times to run an alternate front page article on Jan. 3rd 2009 after revealing to them the bitcoin whitepaper,source code and genesis block code that embeds the famous \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout\" headlinethat had yet to be printed! Replacing the Israel sends troops into Gaza headline with the message from averified time traveler that bitcoin would become the future world currency, right above the bank bailout headline!This changes history forever, as on the same day Satoshi launched the bitcoin blockchain, the entire civilizedworld would now learn of bitcoin's existence and destiny as the future world currency.Pretty elaborate setup eh, heheh maybe I can sell the movie rights?!?!  \"THE TIMES TRAVELER\"PROTOTYPE 1.5\" Gallery wrapped 16\"x20\" CanvasCaption below photo: \"Today will go down in history as the day a verified time travelerrevealed that bitcoin will in the near future become the #1 trusted worldwide currency.\"Starting bid: 0.001BTCBid Increments: 0.0001BTCEnd date and time:  Thursday, June 30th. 2022 at 4pm EST.
