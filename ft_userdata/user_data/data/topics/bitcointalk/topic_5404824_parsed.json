  "content": "Current look at Bitcoin 3 Month chart. Worst Quarter since Q3 2011 with -56%. Price closed just above the 20 MA @ $18,840 (60 Month MA or 5 Year MA). No wonder so many people are bearish right now...However based on this moving average Bitcoin remains in a long-term uptrend. It was the closest % close to this MA in Bitcoin's history, but otherwise closed above it and just under $20K. Many will think this is pure hopium I imagine, but until this MA is broken, then currently price is in no worse situation than it was in March 2020 when it was previously at a 5 Year average.Many are still waiting for $10K to $14K prices, which I can understand based on how bearish the market and economic environment currently is. I also think it'll happen if $17.5K is broken.But what happens if those prices never arrive?",

The S&P has also had it's worst spring (it might be overall) quarter close in 50 years according to the ft so I think there might be a comparison there too - I got the notification yesterday on that.I could see crypto falling after a long stagnation too (or gradual movements either up or down) which could present a bull trap - I think we'll decline in August when eth staking gets unlocked and drives inflation.",

Most likely, people will go into saving mode and beware of spending money on bitcoin, which cost ~$69k, and now only ~$20k (the price may have been different at that time). This is what will repel new investors. It's no news to anyone that people only start looking at the bitcoin when it grows. Reverse processes and bear markets don't attract them. Therefore, if a global recession starts, then in my opinion, we will see a very protracted bear market.During crises and recessions, most people are concerned about how to earn something, not how to save their money. Theoretically, it would be interesting to see how the global recession will affect bitcoin. In practice, this will be very little pleasant.",

Too many people were anticipant it will go to $10k or around that. But unless some really bad news happens or FED stupid enough to crash the stock market, it will be hard to meet that price mark cause strong amount of buy orders there.

I'm not sure, usually you see people trying to cut down. Super market branded food sells more, people look to share cars to work, and people basically look to cut down on celebrations, and treats. So, I do think it's a combination of both. However, most people aren't thinking about investments during this time, due to the risky nature. I mean, investing in Bitcoin is a risky investment during times where you might not have a steady income. Since, as we know recessions usually mean mass redundancies, and job losses. I already know people who have been told they're being made redundant at the end of the year. So, it's already happening. I think we'll see those with a bit of a buffer investing in Bitcoin during the recession, but those strapped for cash will be looking to stretch their penny further than before. This basically doesn't help Bitcoin much from a supply, and demand viewpoint, and I do think this will effect the price, and hence we won't be seeing any major uptrend in the next year.I don't even know how long this recession is going to last, we'll likely be feeling the effects of it for years. There's an argument that recessions are never not felt, and they compound on one another.",

It won't just stop at 14k or 10k, there will be no brakes this timeIt will go down imo, but if you really want to invest somewhere then I would suggest high-quality stocks as mentioned above^",

And now $20K seems low and we want $30K. And even if we get $30K it will most likely be strong resistance and head back down. I have a feeling that Q3 will most likely be flat or slightly negative.

      "body": "All scenarios tested is most likely and the most obvious is just sideways in conclusion after spikes up and down.   People dont like sideways but add time and ultimately it means we do go upwards, its just a bit boring and wears out some especially those relying on leverage.   Anyone who trades on sugar highs and hype will find they lose more then they gain in this situation I guess because nobody is especially correct when we can move either direction but in no direction reliably.  Its maybe ironic but overreaction means the low prices become unreliable and in effect cheap, when that idea becomes clear I dont but I think this whole year is enough space to work it out.   2018 was probably the year where people got really increasingly negative and it was with rising Dollar index so kinda like now.   I do have my doubts on Dollar keeping its gains, anyway I wanted to say summer at the very least being slow and bare is on schedule and then sept/oct autumn there is turbulence and thats the earliest possible solid positive that sticks but my guess for 2022 was always consolidation after gains.  Its been a bit more negative but basically thats what we are doing imo",

I'm otherwise remaining neutral, slightly bearish since $20K has been turned into resistance, but otherwise neutral. Mainly that if $19K support breaks I'd expect to see price slide down to $16K, otherwise likely to the $10K to $14K area as I explained in the post. Otherwise if $23K / 200WMA would be reclaimed, then a rally to $25K to $30K, then see if the 200 WMA can become support or not and re-evaluate.Quote from: adaseb on July 02, 2022, 04:53:49 AMThis was not only the worse quarter it was the worst month ever for Bitcoin.It was the worst quarter since Q3 2011 (-68%) and worst month since August 2011 (-38.45%), but none the less the worst in over a decade.Quote from: buwaytress on July 02, 2022, 09:02:19 AMCouldn't find the piece of news, but it's supposed to be the worst half in history (short one of course)...

Hence I also agree, below this level could see another red quarter, or at least much lower prices.Quote from: rhomelmabini on July 02, 2022, 02:40:30 PMIf those prices never came, it's always a bad thing for those that are anxious and good thing for those who are sniping to buy at a lower price. The DCA is the way.This is also what I'm acknowledging. Price hasn't yet gone beyond it's previous capitulation levels (at least based on long-term MAs), even if it hasn't capitulated as far by % wise or based on other metrics such as net unrealised profit & loss (NUPL). There are enough arguments that price has already capitulated far enough, while there are other metrics to suggest the capitulation hasn't fully occurred yet.If price were to reverse from current prices and close above the 200 WMA, it could generate a lot of buying pressure between $25K from $30K from investors who were waiting on the sidelines for $10 to $15K. Personally, while I'm a fan of DCA, for any lump sum buying, I'd prefer to be a buyer with confirmation of the 200 WMA as support around $24K, or buying capitulation around $12K, as opposed to buying $19K.",
