  "content": "Hi, friends. Does anyone know who wants to try using ELECTRUM WALLET on Android. I will try to offer 2 types of address models, the Android version of the Standard Wallet and the Wallet with 2FA.Wallet Standard (Android Version)1. Download the ELECTRUM Application on Android. After the application is installed, open the application press next and select Standard Wallet2. On the next screen, press Create new seed and you will be directed to the Phrase display. Save Phrase then retype it.3. Continue with the password4. Press Receive and select New Request5. FinishELECTRUM WALLET 2FA (Android Version)To create a wallet using 2FA, it is almost the same as the process for the Standard Wallet starting from numbers 1 to 8.At this stage, open the Authenticator application and enter the secret key or you can use a QR Code scan.Thanks.May be useful.Suggestions are very much welcome for my development.*Note:1. I do not recommend using the Android version and regarding security please consider it because the responsibility lies entirely with the respective users.2. I've shared this post in the local Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3664755.msg60866056#msg60866056https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3664755.msg60875242#msg60875242",

      "body": "If you're putting together a tutorial for 2fa Electrum wallet, it might be prudent to mention the associated fees.  Also, it seems pointless to have 2fa if you're going to have both, the wallet and the 2fa secret on the same device.Furthermore, if you were to set up 2fa as it should be set up; i.e. the wallet on one device and the 2fa secret on another; you might as well make a 2 of 2 multi-sig wallet, instead.  You are left in total control, no third key held by some other entity/person, you don't pay 2fa fees, and since you're the only one with any signing keys, your privacy is enhanced.",

Press Receive and select New RequestTake note that you don't have to make a request for receiving bitcoin.You can simply pick an address and give it to anyone who wants to send you bitcoin. To see you addresses, tap on \"3-dot\" button at top right corner of the screen and select \"Addresses\".Quote from: aylabadia05 on September 05, 2022, 11:30:47 AMSuggestions are very much welcome for my development.I recommend creating the wallet on an air-gapped device. You can create your wallet using this guide successfully, but it wouldn't be completely secure, if it's created on an online device.   You also have the option to extend your seed phrase with a passphrase. In this way, you can increase you can security.",

I should have included the fee amount, but I think it's because this is just a way to create an electrum wallet on Android so I don't mention it.Again, @DireWolfM14, @hosseinimr93, @Husna QA Thanks for everything. You guys are great people",

I'd like you to add a note under this \"Save Phrase then retype it\" to inform other users that saving or backup seed phrases are very important in the future if you don't have them you can't able to recover your wallet.",

I think OP should get rid of the save your backup phrase altogether and only mention that the seed should be backed up physically on paper or metal. When you say save it, it sounds like you are making a digital copy of it on your computer or mobile phone. Recovery phrases should not be backed up in that way ever.",

Recovery phrases should not be backed up in that way ever.   Agree but you can save it digitally just make sure you generated the seed phrase offline and never expose your backup to any devices that connected to the internet.Actually, there is no 100% safe both of them have a risk it always depends on us on how we protect our backup.",
