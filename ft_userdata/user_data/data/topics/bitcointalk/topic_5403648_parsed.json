  "content": "Hello Guys! Hope you are doing well.Just wanted to share this with you people in case someone gets interested or likes this idea.So currently there's an ICO presales running for this new cryptocurrency called 'Chronoly'.What I find interesting about it is that it is backed up by real world rare luxury watches.I read and researched a bit about them and listened to their interactive session and have found the idea really having some good potential.I have also personally invested some in it and personally believe it might turn out to be the next big thing.Here's a brief overview description :\"Chronoly is the world’s first 24/7 watch investment platform that is making it possible for anyone to fractionally invest in rare and exclusive timepieces from renowned brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, Richard Mille, Audemars Piguet and many more.Each NFT watch that we mint is backed by the physical version of the watch, which is fully insured and stored in one of our secure depositary vaults. The watch NFT is then broken down into fractions making it easy for anyone to invest in the watch from as little as $10.\"Presales is currently on for its tokens if you are interested on below link:https://chronoly.io/Let me know what are your thoughts about it.Thanks.",

Doxxing will be done by the end of month (30th June) as intimated by their team and Dev/Management names and linked-in profiles will be publicly shared. Company has already been registered.2. Smart contract security audit has been done for the project by Solidproof.3. In presales, there's no tax on buying. Right now they are giving 15% bonus on coins.Team seems quite helpful and they are happy to discuss any queries on their telegram channel.",
