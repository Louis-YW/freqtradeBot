I'll try to explain it with a simple example:Coin XXX has a Circulating Supply equal to 1000.The price of XXX is 1 dollar.In this case, the Market Cap will be equal to $1,000.In order for the Market Cap of this coin to increase to $10,000, it is necessary that the price of the XXX coin increase to $10. At the same time, it is not necessary to invest 9 thousand dollars for this. It will be enough, for example, for 1 coin to be bought at such a price, and this price will be recalculated for the entire Circulating Supply.",

If their money isn't invested in crypto market, it must be in stocks. Since last year we are living a moment of raised interest rates in USA and Europe. In times like this, investment's expertises advise to purchase banks and financial institutions in general's bonds, as they are highly favoured due to the economical policy adopted by the FED and european regulators.I believe that is a potential destiny for institutional investors' funds. Moreover, they must use centralized exchanges. Institutional investors have whole dedicated teams to the accountability area. These professionals do the KYC process and make sure all the assets are declared to the authorities every year. It's not too different from the process which must be followed by small investors.",
