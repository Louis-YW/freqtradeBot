  "content": "A revolutionary project for the entertainment industry combining the powers of art and blockchain technology.Art in its various expressions is how we see the world. We see it in paintings, in music, in dance, in poetry and in all forms. Most recently, we have seen art in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with art expressions able to exist on the blockchain admist a plethora of use-cases. One major form of art is music with a lot of budding artists lacking platforms to establish them on the path to a successful career. An industry report by Next Big Sound says that “90.7% of music artists will remain unknown with just 9.3% making it to the big leagues.” That is about to change!AtEM is a revolutionary entertainment servicing platform built in an interactive Metaverse with the aim of integrating art, music and gaming into one big universe. Leveraging the best of legacy artist management and innovative blockchain technology in the Metaverse, AtEM is poised to give artists the ability to take control of their art/content in ways that haven’t been fully utilized yet.A quick chat with the AtEM core team, Lucas Joyner, Quinn Anthony and Ian Hill reveals a lot of the amazing plans they have for the industry, artistes and Metaverse/NFTs space.Metaverse and NFTs are the new buzzwords in the crypto space. What is AtEM all about?AtEM is the first entertainment servicing platform in a fully interactive Metaverse style environment. “AtEM” stands for Arts + Entertainment Metaverse.  AtEM is not only about the metaverse, the graphics and development that go into it. It is a whole new way of merchandising the NFT and entertainment industry. We aim to change the ease with which an artist can maintain a career and be self-sufficient through blockchain technology as well as traditional routes.AtEM is playing in a space that is getting a lot of attention in recent times, even from technology giants. How does AtEM stand out?A key distinction for AtEM is that we bring the infrastructure to artists that need to navigate a post-pandemic market. Let’s be honest, there aren’t a ton of options for budding stars in the local rural areas. With mass venue shut-downs, social distancing, and safety concerns in the wake of things like Travis Scott’s festival and multiple years of protests, AtEM brings everything a performing artist needs into an easily accessible package in the Metaverse. From recording and producing content, booking and tour planning, marketing and PR, to distributing content on Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and the blockchain, AtEM provides a highly interactive one-stop shop for every serious or aspiring artist.AtEM stands out from the multitude of emerging Metaverse projects due to a clear direction for the project, an attainable roadmap and the utilities being provided. The AtEM Metaverse is second to none in how it holds the potential to change the performing arts space for the better, while bringing liberation to the mundane aspects of being an artist in today’s industry. Labels will have to do a lot of catching up once we are unleashed. (Hearty laughter)The world is just about to get better for performing artists. With AtEM Metaverse being an open virtual space for your community, how can users maximize and ultimately benefit from it?The scope of what we aim to implement in the AtEM Metaverse under the AtEM coin is vast. We will be one of the only providers in the Metaverse space that gives artists the ability to take control of their art/content in ways that haven’t been fully utilized yet. We will have dynamic NFTs linked to lots of game features. These features aren’t only minigames and collectibles (which we will have tons of). But, they will hold actual utility aside from being cool digital items. Perhaps, one of the most unique, of the many we hope to implement, is the booking agency service. Artists will have access to a live database of venues in different states that have openings, with the venue contact info/pricing/restrictions/etc. This will allow users to bypass the monotony of contacting individual venue owners and promoters to find a show that aligns with their brand. It also allows venue owners and promoters a buffer of vetting, as this is typically something only serious artists will utilize effectively.The Metaverse Platform is a very unique feature. How does it work and how are users rewarded?We have a play-to-earn system in place for many of the minigames and activities, as well as the content interaction through AtEM music distribution services. The benefits of a play-to-earn system is that we provide value not just to artists, but to gamers as well who wish to make a living playing games, and crypto investors who want to see a great project flourish. To benefit the most, users are encouraged to participate in all events and promotions that earn them AtEM coin as well as purchase special land plot NFTs and digital assets to sell. AtEM Metaverse users also have an opportunity to buy one of the customizable NFTs we’re currently developing. The AtEM Metaverse will soon have its own NFT marketplace for customizing NFTs, which will also bring investors’ investment up for that particular NFT. Along with the AtEM NFT platform, we are bringing our own staking platform for both ATEM coin and AtEM NFTs.Wow! These are huge and exciting plans for the AtEM Metaverse. I know that AtEM is quite big on partnerships and how it ties into your ecosystem. Can you give us a peek into some of the existing partnerships and any new partnerships coming soon?Without giving away too much, we aim to bring some of the most well known artists and performers into the Metaverse space utilizing the AtEM pipeline we’re developing. From Hollywood actor interactions, branded games and exclusive content, to virtual meet and greets with the entertainment industry’s most prolific figures, there won’t be any shortage of unique experiences in the AtEM Metaverse.This is literally mindblowing and I am sure everyone can’t wait to get their hands on the AtEM Metaverse. What other exciting features are in development by the AtEM team? One of the more unique aspects of our dynamic NFTs is that the AtEM NFT Marketplace will allow you to buy upgrades for your character giving you access to certain parts and certain activities/roles inside the AtEM Metaverse. The fact that you can earn and make gains on your AtEM crypto just by playing the game and having fun with world renown artists and friends alike, while utilizing the plethora of  utility benefits AtEM has to offer, will be a game changer (pun intended).This is such an interesting and innovative project in the Metaverse space. How can everyone be part of ATEM?The first step to becoming an AtEM Metaverse citizen (so you can utilize all of the features at launch) is to buy an AtEM Land Plot NFT. Holding AtEM Land Plot NFT will cement your claim to access one of the largest artist hubs in the Metaverse space, or any space for that matter. With the amount of care and thought we’ve put into this project, there is definitely something unique and appealing for everyone. Holding and trading AtEM coins would be the second way to become involved in the AtEM Metaverse. Our presale is in a few days time and it is a big opportunity to grab some AtEM coins way ahead of everyone else. Coin holders and stakers will receive special drops and giveaways during AMAs, exclusive in-game events and more. We want to make this a special project for all the investors, the gamers, and the artists that wish to get into crypto and the Metaverse space. And, that means we know it’s a large undertaking (being artists ourselves). But, with the support of the artist, crypto and gaming communities, we are positive we can make The AtEM Metaverse something that will change the entertainment industry forever.About AtEM“AtEM” stands for Arts + Entertainment Metaverse.

Sure, they have a project callen AtEM, as well as NFT, but all of them are directly offered on their website,  with zero mention of this project.The only thing that ties you to them is this picture from one of your team, which can be easily stolen from their page.",
