  "content": "Hello all! Just starting out in the crypto space, I'm currently studying Blockchain Development at Uni. I'm very interested in learning anything I can about the subject and I eventually found my way here.I know the basics of blockchain and writing code for it but I am at a loss for any real litterature on the subject.So my question is, can anybody recommend a good book on the subject, YouTube vids and online bootcamps only go so farand all my courses are using webpages as source material. I love a good read and would love if there are some book worms out there who have found out what's good. My recommendation is Blockchain Development Philosophy by Kalle Rosenbaum.",
