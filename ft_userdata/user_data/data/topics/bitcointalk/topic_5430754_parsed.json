  "content": "Hey people.Just noticed how different pages list different prices for any particular token. For example, Quant 5 minutes ago was listed at:$156.44               at Coin Gecko$160                    at My local centralized exchange$163.44               at Coin Market capWhat gives ? These are huge differences if you've got large number of tokens !?NOTE: I am using the Australian Dollar for currency in this example ( something I can not figure out how to display on Coin Market Cap ! )Also: My local centralized exchange has a different \"sell\" and \"buy\" price for a token. For instance, if a token is listed at $160 per token, the buy price usually would be $162 and the sell price would be $158. So that adds to the confusion, although my exchange tells me the listed price ( in this case $160 ) is the \"average\" price of any given token.",

The difference is only around few doillars, just think it as a fee. Even you're doing arbitrage trading, I doubt you can make profit when the price of the token is only $7 difference. The trading fee and withdrawal fee of each exchange is high.",

      "body": "There is no \"real\" or \"actual\" token price. So if you ask which one is correct, the answer would be all of them.The reason why coinmarketcap or coingecko have different prices is that both platforms have different sources for their data, and perhaps, their calculator also has a different methodology for calculating the prices between exchanges.If you are trading, what matters the most is the token price on the exchange you will use unless otherwise you are doing some arbitrage trading wherein you need to take advantage of price discrepancies between two or more trading platforms.",

The price difference on exchange varies most of the time because they have different liquidity volume which is important for the price impact whenever the trader on that particular exchange make a huge purchase or sell.I suggest that you should use exchange with huge volume and liquidity on orderbook so that it will have small price spread when you trade.",

They may or may not care of your exchange. They may even care about the reported volumes to make certain exchanges' price be more meaningful (weighted average).Of course, the average between sell and buy price is the basis in all cases.Then, as I said, depending on what they use for converting to CAD, the differences can get even bigger.Quote from: Len Saldua on December 21, 2022, 08:50:51 AMWhat gives ? These are huge differences if you've got large number of tokens !?Nothing spectacular. It simply means that with some luck and by looking up the right moment and the right exchange, you may buy cheaper or sell more expensive than you do at your local exchange.This is what arbitrage is made for - some traders try to even earn money from such differences. But you're at the middle, and if the spread is not too big at your exchange then you're fine.However, I'd warn that arbitrage is risky - from getting onto unknown exchanges with issues at deposits or withdrawals to slow blocks making the difference disappear by the time your money arrive to the right exchange - so be careful if you go on that path.",

You may find that the price of the token in a platform is cheap/good, but there is not enough liquidity, which ends with your purchase or sale order without execution and for a very long period.Also, the \"real\" price is the price of executing the buy/sell order, and other than that, they are averages that tell you the fair price, and you determine the appropriate price for you.",

For example sometimes the coin you are looking at is dead (has no blockchain) so nobody can transfer that coin between exchanges and the price difference can not be used as Arbitrage so it remains different. Sometimes one exchange's wallet is dead (maintenance, etc.) that prevents deposits of that shitcoin and nobody has it to dump so the price could go higher or remain higher while it dumps elsewhere hence creating a difference.",
