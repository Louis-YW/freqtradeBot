  "content": "As a gambler considering a country to visit as a tourist, this interesting article talks about the casino life and legal gambling age in some various popular travel destinations.QuoteGambling Age In The USGambling in the US is not restricted to just Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Most places allow gambling in casinos and the ages range from 18 to 21 years old, depending on the state. The US also has some states where particular forms of gambling are legal but others are not.Here are some specific examples of gambling in the US:-A player that goes betting with a minor in Alabama is considered committing a misdemeanor, regardless if the minor is playing or not. -In Arizona, it’s legal for charities to operate as a casino at night.-In Arkansas, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to “be a patron of the pari-mutuel or certificate system of wagering conducted or supervised by it.” However, these laws do not suggest that it’s forbidden to attend horse races.-Delaware has the strongest regulations around gambling. Players must be at least 18 years old to play the State Lottery. However, an 18-year old may purchase a lottery ticket and give it to a younger person as a gift. An interesting question is, If the younger person wins the lottery from the gifted ticket, will the state agree too pay them or wait till they come of legal age??QuoteGambling Age In The UKThe UK is very accepting of gambling. There are lots of adverts during sporting events that encourage players to get involved and bet on their favorite teams. The minimum legal gambling age in the UK is 18 years old.This applies to most gambling activities including casinos, racetracks, betting shops, bingo halls, and online gambling.  One of the exceptions to the rule is for the National Lottery, other lotteries and football pools. It’s legal for players to take part in these from the age of 16, as well as opportunities to play for low stakes.  QuoteGambling In Monte CarloMonte Carlo is one of the best places to gamble in the world. Along with Las Vegas, it’s world-famous for its casino and high roller lifestyle. You can’t go anywhere without seeing a fancy car drive past or a superyacht parked in the harbor.The Casino de Monte Carlo is perhaps the most famous casino on Earth. To enter, you must be at least 18 years old and pay an admission fee of €10 per person. To enter a private room, it costs an additional €10. While there is no specific dress code, the casino does recommend “proper attire”. Avoid shorts, sports shows and flop flips at all costs so make sure you bring smart clothing if you want to play here. After 8pm, the casino recommends players to wear smart jackets.The minimum bets in Casino de Monte Carlo are €5 and the maximum is €2,000. If you wish to exceed this amount, you can take your game to a private room where there is no cap on maximum bets.In the main casino hall, the minimum you can bet is. If you take your gaming to a private room, the minimum increases to €10 and, unsurprisingly, there is no cap on maximum bets.QuoteGambling Age In JapanGambling in a casino in Japan is illegal. If you are caught gambling, you can land yourself in a lot of trouble. Yakuza, an organized crime syndicate, runs quite a few casinos in Japan, as well as other illegal mobile casinos. If you come across any of these establishments, just walk away.However, other aspects of gambling are legal in Japan, such as horse racing, motorcycle racing, bicycle racing, and powerboat racing. Japan also allows pachinko, a Japanese pinball-style game that lasts for hours and provides entertainment for many locals and travelers.In order to gamble in Japan, you must be at least 20 years of age. If you are under this limit, you cannot take part in any of the above events, with the exception of pachinko. You can be 18 and play but it’s seen in a negative light by the general public. QuoteGambling Age In MacauMacau is another world-renowned hotspot for gambling. There are lots of casinos that attract some of the best (and richest) players in the world, with the casinos providing the foundation for the tourism economy. Anyone can access all of the casinos in Macau but like Monte Carlo, you must dress for the occasion. Men are required to wear smart clothes like a suit and women are required to wear formal dresses.Residents of Macau must be at least 21 years old before they can visit a casino. However, tourists can gamble from the age of 18.QuoteGambling Age In SingaporeIf you want to gamble in Singapore, there are two casinos you can visit: Marina Bay Sands and Resort World Santosa (RWS). There you will enjoy a luxurious gambling experience unlike anything else. Marina Bay Sands is a huge gambling complex with more than 500 table games to enjoy, while RWS is the complete resort, with plenty of other attractions to keep you entertained during your stay.The gambling age in Singapore is 21 years old. This applies to both locals and tourists. Anyone under the age of 21 cannot enter the gambling area. However, you don’t have to be 21 to use the casinos’ facilities as they offer so much more than just gambling. QuoteGambling Age  in South KoreaThere are 30 casinos in South Korea and 3 horse racing tracks to enjoy. And with online gambling available too, there are plenty of options to enjoy the gambling experience… for tourists.Residents are almost fully prohibited from any form of gambling, with exceptions being activities that have been specially legislated for. These include horse racing, bicycle racing and a selection of sports betting options. Koreans may also participate in some lotteries too.To add further restrictions, Korean locals are not allowed to break these rules no matter if they are in the country or abroad.The legal gambling age in South Korea is 18 and this covers the great gambling areas of Jeju and Seoul. Jeju, in particular, is home to some of the biggest poker games in the world, so if you fancy your chances against rich business people and the best professionals, this is a great place to gamble.I wonder if there are any South Koreans here? Really, can they keep to the rule of gambling to only some specific games even when they are abroad?QuoteGambling Age In The BahamasThe Bahamas is known for its sandy white beaches, pristine oceans and glorious views everywhere you look. It’s also amazing for gambling, with the Atlantis Paradise Bahamas hotel and casino being at the center of it all. To gamble in the Bahamas, you must be at least 18 years old (although by law you must be 21 years old).Quote Gambling Age In EgyptEgypt is rich in history and gambling has been a big part of it, going back thousands of years. But it’s important to note that Egypt is a Muslim country, meaning that the Qur’an prohibits any form of gambling. However, even though Muslim locals cannot gamble, the Egyptian government has legalized gambling for tourists. The only way locals can get involved is through the lottery that includes sports betting.For tourists, there are 30 fully-licensed casinos in Egypt. You are required to show your passport upon entry to prove you are not a resident, while the main currency used is the US dollar. Even though the main currency is the pound, the Egyptian casinos will not accept it.The gambling age of Egypt is 18 years of age, although a few of the casinos require players to be at least 21 years old.QuoteGambling Age In AustraliaThe Australian gambling scene is one of the most diverse in the world. No matter what game you love the most, there is something for everyone, from betting on horses at the track to playing a game of blackjack in a casino. More than 80% of Australian adults gamble in the country so it is certainly a popular market.No matter where you are from, you must be 18 years old to gamble in Australia. Each state has its own responsibility for gambling laws but the legal gambling age is the same across the country. If your country is not included but is a travel destination, you can provide a review of the gambling activities in your country for the benefit of gamblers who may want to choose your country as a travel destinationReference: https://gamblersdailydigest.com/gambling-age-around-the-world/",

And I guess it is still a tourist destination for us. Macau is different though, if you are going to that place, then you are going to gamble, Lol.Regarding the questions of age, if the law says that they are in legal age and if they won the lottery then, obviously the government will have to honor that and pay the player.",

I'm surprised about the other countries because they are really taking care of their people because they are actually minimizing the risk of addiction when they limit the participant's ages. they are raging from age 18-21, I guess if you pass that age in those countries, life will get more challenging. Next time I really want to see a list of countries that totally prohibit gambling in any way or shape you perform whether Casino, Lottery, Race, or others.",

I'm confuse, anyhow, 18-21 is what the age limit for most countries. And here, if the casino's suspect that you are not in the age limit, then they will ask for id.Or the morals for young people is not really dig into gambling at a young age, specially in casinos because it can really ruin their lives and that is why this laws are put into place.",

The law separates two activities: gambling and income generation. Since the ticket was gifted, there was no violation of the law. So the lucky person is left to receive his prize and pay taxes (if any - I heard in different states this is regulated in different ways).A more confusing case would be if a minor illegally purchased lottery tickets and won the top prize. Here, most likely, we would see an interesting struggle of lawyers.",
