In my honest opinion, stick to only Bitcoin and ETH. These are the two cryptos which are widely adopted by the people and have great community support. Rest all have issues and may take a downturn anytime under any circumstances. These cryptos are usually aimed to make the creators rich within a short period of time and nothing else. They serve no purpose to the crypto market or to the community at all.",

I understand your frustration but even legitimate altcoins suffer the same price drops so that shouldn't be enough to call them as fake. BTC also fell more than 80% few years ago.

And I also think that you were too hasty with the rug pull, imagine that the price used to be around 300$ when you bought it but now the price is only 10$ if I'm not mistaken based on what you said, this should be a lesson to you.",

That leads people easily create it to scam people. Their motive is simply outright to deceive people for their own benefit, for example, either outright stealing or slowly scamming their users. Altcoins and tokens markets are almost 99,9% worthless. There is no practical benefit and usage, but an empty promise or an exaggeration of an idea. It is like separating the wheat from the chaff. And those scammers are simply doing their job because of how easy to make them and due to the nature of cryptocurrency pseudonymity.",

It seems that African projects are indeed very difficult to be sustainable in market trends. Until now I'm confused about how they developed their project because what I know is that there has never been a project from Africa that has been successful and has lasted until now. it's a good idea to do more research on it so as not to be disappointed with the Wakanda project.",

There was Dalecoin even before I embraced crypto in 2017. There was also Zugacoin created by Sam Zuga, an African, in 2019 or 2020.Quotemany people wasted their hard earn money to buy enough, I personally use $300 to buy wakanda which accumulate 2billion plus, but since then, wakanda never rise for once, only going down, my money is less than $10 remaining.I saw through the smokescreen when the hype for it hit the media but I avoided it as my sixth sense told me something wasn't right. My guts were right. It was the same way I avoided the shitcoin, Zugacoin. It's not as if it's an African thing to have bad projects. It transverses all continents. There are scammers everywhere. BTW, don't sell off what is left.

Wakanda inu founders made alot of money but didn't care about the community.They abandoned the project and that's what made many investors lose money for investing into the project.

You should bare up on your mind;1. Scammers would really be creating something that goes in line with the hype2. Dont believe that Devs/Owners are really that mindful about their investors3. As long its anonymous or even being doxxed, doesnt assure that they wouldnt run off with the money4. 95% coins in the market are shit and 5% of them are really having that usecaseAlways DYOR, dont make yourself that get impulsive when it comes to investment decisions and dont make yourself get easilyfomo'ed out because this is where mistakes do usually happens.",

My question for you is why did you buy that while you have bunch of trusted tokens in the market? Im sorry but it's also your mistake to easily believe with the scam token. The scammers are always repeating the same method over and over again. They were making shit scam token which consumes only a few dollars and then they will attract people to buy their tokens.The scammers have premined coin that would be used to dump in your ass.
