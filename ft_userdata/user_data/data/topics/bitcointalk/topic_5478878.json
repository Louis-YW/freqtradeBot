  "content": "Today I will share a real incident. An elder brother of my area who has been working in Bangladesh Army for 8 years. We have walked with him enough since childhood and played many sports together but we never saw any such habit in him. He used to serve in the army and used to come home when he got leave and we used to hang out with him but recently we heard some bad news about his affairs through his younger brother. There are various online casinos in which he gambled and ended up in debt of around $18,000. Already his father is a middle-class family member and his father works hard enough to get him a job and manage his money by borrowing heavily but by this time he is 18 thousand dollars in debt due to gambling. Not only did he lose $18,000 by gambling, but he ended up with eighteen thousand dollars in debt, and he also lost money by gambling out of his salary.  If the person I am referring to had not gambled in online casinos and invested this amount of money in bitcoins, he would have made a substantial half profit today, even after paying off his debts.  If he had bought 1 BTC and sold it now when the price of Bitcoin was twenty thousand dollars, he would have made a profit of about 25K dollars even though he had paid a loan of 18K dollars. The reason for sharing this incident of my local elder brother is to warn users about the dangers of gambling.  I don't owe you $18K so we may not understand it but the one I shared with understands how heavy the burden of debt is.",

      "body": "Gambling, while tempting, can be dangerous, as your experience shows. Contrast gambling with investment. As seen by your elder brother's financial crisis, gambling is risky and unexpected. Though volatile, Bitcoin investing offers more control and educated decision-making. Knowledge of risk is crucial.Imagine his investment in Bitcoin or another currency. Research and strategy could have changed the outcome. His tale emphasizes financial literacy and responsible decision-making. We should consider risks and rewards and balance gambling, as this story warns.",

He is also having $18000 debt to pay because he gambled and lost the borrowed money. This is just another example of someone that is an addict and that needs to just quit gambling. It will start from I can double my money, I can use gambling to earn, but leading to losses. After several losses, I do not know why some gamblers will still continue to think that they can earn using gambling.Quote from: bitterguy28 on December 22, 2023, 07:35:24 AMand what this will end , he will lose his job because of such action and to become a family burden , sorry to hear this but he must decide sooner or will be a loser forever.Is it path of the law in military not to gamble?

It's not just about profit/loss, because that can happen in any field, but in the case that the OP mentioned, I think it's like a challenge for that individual in life. There is no guarantee that the beginning and the end will have good results. I am also involved in both the gambling and crypto fields, so I know fairness in each field, the level of ability of everyone in the general field will reflect the results.But anyway, I feel sorry for them, but honestly, no one can help them but he himself must change to fix what has been done. At a responsible age, I think he needs a lot of encouragement to get through this stage, and don't blame him because everything happened.",

Balancing these pursuits with a thoughtful and informed approach can contribute to a more secure financial situation for anyone. I mean too much of anything can be dangerous right?

I do feel bad too but what could've he had expected to happen when he used that loan to gamble?Gambling should be for entertainment purposes only especially if you're not a billionaire that won't mind losing millions in slot machines, even if there are people that have their lives changed because of gambling, that doesn't mean that it's going to be the same for you.",

This is a practical example of a gambling addict who will not stop until he has lost everything to fuel is gambling obsession. The problem with this person would be the same as all other gambling addicts face, chasing the loss and ending up in a pile of debt. I can only sympathize with his father and his family for going into debt because of his son's addiction. I do not think he would have every thought about Bitcoin or even investing that kind of money into something. An addict won't look into those aspects of life as they are chasing a dream which only a handful have ever achieved.",

What you elder brother makes it on gambling and win millions racks, would we still have the same idea about investing on bitcoin where the return is far from millions possible earning on gambling.  Maybe your elder brother don't know about bitcoin and only knows about making big money on gambling.What I am saying is the different point of views from each of us individual. Majority of us like/want to invest on bitcoin because we believe that it is profitable. The risks evaluation is also different from person to person, personally I think that investing on bitcoin has a less risks than playing gambling for profits. It's the point of view and understanding of what we are doing.At the end of the day, we can't turn back time and make your elder brother understand that it's much more possible for him to profit by investing on bitcoin. The only thing he can do now is to move forward and pay the gambling debt he have.",

So you just need to ask your brother if  he has heard of Bitcoin before? If not, it means it is normal for him to gamble without having other options to gain profit. But on the other hand, if he already knows about  Bitcoin in general but still continues to spend $18K on gambling, it means that your brother has agreed to the risks of gambling and doesn't  care about Bitcoin investments.We cannot dictate to those closest to us to invest, but providing them with the knowledge and goals of Bitcoin is something  that needs to be done, the final choice is in the hands of each individual.  Because the passion for gambling is greater than investing.",

Discipline on the battle field is different from gambling discipline, don't you know? All discipline are not the same, as a soldier man who have no single experience about gambling he will still become a victim to everything that makes people get addicted to gambling. Two soldiers fell victim to ATM card over here some days ago, there was a illegal camera installed in this ATM machine that's taking videos of people's code and passwords and this cost them heavily, their accounts were both drained, tell me where discipline should have played out here? Stop trying to prove anything mate, you should be the one that think about it very well, been discipline doesn't mean you will fit in every situations.",
