  "content": "Hey everyone,Stake.com scammed me for close to $10,000.Here is my story and all the proof which is attached.Bet slips https://ibb.co/VgsPBmBhttps://ibb.co/ncRFNfPProof of score and live streamhttps://ibb.co/BcBbVSqhttps://ibb.co/pQW5k5Fhttps://ibb.co/FBNs1hfLIVE VIDEO STREAMHere is the match https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4c0i8zyFBHkStart at 27 seconds and it ends at 4 minute mark. As you can see, after the first half (around 2 minute mark of the video) the score was 2-1So I bet this match before it started. Stake.com lost connection and in the 14th minute, the odds were all off the board. I was watching the live stream and after the first half, the score was 2-1. This means that both of my bets were winning bets.In about the 77th minute, they got disconnected and stake.com decided to cancel the game. As my wagers were on the first half, I should have been paid on BOTH bets as the first half was completed and the result of the full game had no impact on my bets.I have tried to contact stake support but they continue to ignore me.",

The problem here is if they really flagged the game as voided already before the 1st half is over because you said already that there’s a problem on Stake connection which means there’s really a technical issue. I’m not sure either if they will respond you on thread but I think your case needs intermediaries to review all the evidence especially on the Stake side. Use Askgambler to seek help because Stake reps rarely answer accusation here unless it’s really serious matter unlike your which is debatable due to the possible error on their side during the game which you acknowledge on your post.",

It's for general e-sport, which FIFA is one of it.Now, do you mind providing reference that explains it's a new match and completely different than the first one that didn't finish due to technical issue? That they just happen to have exact same players playing the exact same team and exact same match with the previous one instead of a re-play?

Stake are simply just scamming and this will be reported to everyone I can report it to.Ahh yes, it's not specifically for FIFA, pardon the small difference. It's for general e-sport, which FIFA is one of it.Now, do you mind providing reference that explains it's a new match and completely different than the first one that didn't finish due to technical issue? That they just happen to have exact same players playing the exact same team and exact same match with the previous one instead of a re-play? Or was that just your assumption, that it's not a re-play?That’s how the league works dude, they play many matches It’s 100% not a re-play, they played at least 10 times I’ve attached a bet that I lost on the match you posted earlier.https://ibb.co/k4z4xDMsport:110114755Technical issues had no affect on my bets at all. The first half was completed without issue.",

The first half was completed without issue. Umm... here's the thing, a match was ended abruptly at minutes 66, less than an hour later, the exact same match with the exact same people playing the exact same team [different result, though] are being played, and the explanation that it's not a re-play for the previously unfinished match is: \"that's how it works\"? To put it roughly, you were asked for a backing reference, and your answer is basically, \"source: trust me dude\"?You will really go with this? Ok, let's assume you're right, let's try to turn this as your basis. Do you mind to provide several other matches with this scenario [exact same people play exact same team in a very short time]? Let's leave the part where the previous match was not finished for now. I figure if it's how it works, and it's 100% not a replay, there will be other instances. It can be a good backing evidence to support your claim if you can provide it.",
