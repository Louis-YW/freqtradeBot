  "content": "Recently I took a shallow review on most of the posts concerning mining/miners relating to profit making based on low fee electricity charges and location. And for most, no body is talking about \"good management/maintenance\" as another hidden means to keep ROI flowing for as long as possible. Not that I don't agree that electricity charges consumes much of the supposed profits miners expects to make from mining based on the expenses that they have ran into in getting every equipments needed for mining.But I observed there's a way also miners can make profit but on a longer time, that's progressive to cover up on all expenses made and more through good management of the available resources/equipments. A better management of your equipments ensures a longer time frame usage and the more the years goes by the same the profit follows. I have heard people say \"wow I can't believe this machine has given me so much profit over the years than I could have ever imagined\", such statement as expressed is connected to good management and maintenance over the years and nothing more or less.In conclusion what am saying is that there's a key role good management/maintenance plays in terms of profit making for miners as it is with cheap electricity fees, only that the former is time bond while the latter is straightaway.",

If you have bad management you will have downtimes etc. which will decrease your profit. What the OP describes really does sound a lot like advertising, because obviously your machines will only run at the adverstised hashrate. He is still right that they can only remain at that hashrate if they are take care of. Would be interesting to see some calculations if some kind of management will really give you a quicker ROI.",

Exactly how it works, which is how some illegal farms in some countries where they steal power in some remote place, drop a container, and never revisit-it again, leave it there till the police find it, still making some good profit, on other hand, some perfect management that runs a legal farm in EU where the power rate is 20 cents per kWh will not be making any profit.",

So if you buy the S9 for 50 USD from China (current price for bulk) you could make a profit is you can have the miner sit for 2-3 month. Its illegal and obviously such illegal stuff hurts bitcoin, but actually could work.",

When 4-5 months have passed anything that was not captured by the police will be running at 100% profit.The funny thing is the government would sell those confiscated gears on auction and guess who would buy gears that don't make any profit if the power bill is paid? Of course, this illegal probably everywhere, and you will be facing two types of risks, one is the police, and two is theft since those locations are remote and hard to secure, so in a nutshell, nobody should do it, but many people have been doing it for years, just goes out to show that if your power rate is that low (in their case is zero) little no management is needed.",

Seems like it really brings out a lot of new flaws in the systems. Best would probably to go find those remote mining locations and set up your own pool details.",

But to steal electricity in some remote location where you are not present yourself is a new level. You can basically steal electricity at one point of the world and mine bitcoin with it. Your location is however in an totally different country and with the mining profits you can then buy legally energy. It is basically like an infinite energy storage and transfer setup.Same could also be used legally however. You have solar power during the day, that you use to mine bitcoin. During the night you buy electricity from the city with the mining profits.",
