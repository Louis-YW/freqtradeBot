      "body": "So far it looks like $20k was the bottom and the market doesn't show any interest in going any lower. For example over the past 48 hours they have been trying so hard to manipulate the market for a bigger crash but they failed and price went back up again.Quote from: romeareo on July 28, 2022, 04:13:14 AMUsually, BTC bottom is a drop down to 84% Usually there is a >10k% rise then there is a >80% drop. We didn't have that kind of rise this time to be followed by this big a crash. So what we see is new and can not be speculated based on past market behavior.",

      "body": "While we cannot be 100% sure, I would say that the $17k we saw recently was the bottom of this cycle, barring catastrophic news. I didn't quite understand that after the rate hike both Bitcoin and the stock market went up. In theory less liquidity is going to make them go up less, but I guess that is because with these rate hikes inflation is going to be curbed.What I don't see is great joy until the next cycle. I don't think we will beat the ATH until then.",

But I can not be hundred percent sure because the market is unpredictable in nature. If anyone wants to invest in bitcoin, don't look at the bear market but having strong heart and determination.",

Go with your gutWell we have seen the price going to $17k and others say that this could be the bottom already, but there are still who thinks that it can go lower.But so far, we have stayed in the $20k'ish price range since that last all time high. So who knows, we are in the -70% drop from $69k. So if we go by your 84% then we are still very far from the bottom price. But then again, market is very volatile, so it's hard to predict if the bottom is in or not.",

Go with your gutYou should know that the price of bitcoin can drop sharply again and take us by surprise, especially if we are not prepared for anything that could happen to bitcoin.Only by being patient and calm can you continue to analyze the market situation to find something that might be useful to you.If you ask if this is the most basic price for bitcoin, the answer is only possible because we don't have a definite answer.But, if you want to buy bitcoin, buy it when the price is decreasing and if the decline is sharp, that is the best time to buy bitcoin.But it all depends on how your analysis results because never do anything based on other people's analyses that you don't know.",

BTC has fell upto 17k usd. I guess that was the lowest point for the bear market.And now BTC will struggle in the 20-25k usd range for few more weeks, then we can see a price jump maybe.Let’s hope for the best and wait.",

Closing back above the 200 WMA this week or next, currently at $22.8K, would increase this to 80% for me.Quote from: dragonvslinux on July 23, 2022, 03:32:43 PMHere's my own personal bucket list for confirming a Bitcoin low that I'll keep updated.1. Pi Cycle bottom signalled: 11/07 @ $20.8K ✅2. NUPL leaving capitulation levels: 18/07 @ $22.4K ✅3. Weekly RSI leaving oversold conditions: 24/07 @ $22.6K ✅4. Price closing back above 200 WMA: ❔❔❔5. Hash Ribbons indicator buy signal: ❔❔❔While the 200 WMA looks like it can be reclaimed relatively easily now, my main concern is that hash rate has not fully recovered yet, which has always been the requirement for a recovery in the past. This is simply due to strength of the network being an important fundamental aspect of price increase. That said, this could simply happen at a later late around similar prices, after a pump and rejection from $30K for example.",

Go with your gutIt's impossible for anyone to predict what will happen, if the last run was any indication. Having a plan for anything is the best advice. Be realistic.There is very strong support at 19K, so the worst may be over. I do not think Bitcoin has any better chances of going lower, but it is still a gamble. As far as I'm concerned, there is a great deal of manipulation going on. Bitcoin bought under 20k is now being sold to us for 23k by those who purchased it before.",

This current price we are in now may not be the true bottom but I think I still can consider this low so you are always welcome to buy it if you are planning. Don't wait for a more dip as it may not occur anymore. You once said that btc is now becoming more popular. In no time, many people are going to pour more money on here.",

So that is still very cheap and there is still a good opportunity to 'steal' some bitcoin and then simply hold on it.",

Usually, BTC bottom is a drop down to 84% but again we have more awareness and adoption. From now on the drops might be smaller. For the sake of speculation, we can assume that the $20,000-$22,000 range is the current bottom. The price is swinging at that range for weeks now and seems that there's strong support to hold that price range where there is notable more demand.After all, we don't know what will happen next. Regardless if that's the bottom or not, if the plan is to hold for long, then just do the buy at that price level.We should always try to avoid the question to ourselves, \"if only I bought before\" when an uptrend is now slowly happening.",
