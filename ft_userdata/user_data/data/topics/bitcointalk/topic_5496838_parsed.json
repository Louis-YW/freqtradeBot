Cause it looks to still be the old title. I think you updated it in your reply instead of the topic itself. Anyway, if this is what you mean, then that means you should be talking about decentralized cellphone. When you said it, what came to mind was like a cellphone that can’t be tracked maybe because you aren’t connected by the usual service provider. For what you speak of, there are many platforms that lets you create phone numbers of different countries. I don’t know any because I haven’t used it before but then, they definitely exist.",

It is not the phone exactly that provides you with services for texting and calling so a “international phone” is not gonna help you achieve what you want to.VPN is the closest thing I can think of that best suits your needs.",

If you just need a phone number for registering then stealths.net will let you rent a Ukranian virtual phone number for 1 year. Keep in mind that any website or app that offers virtual phone numbers can probably read the messages you are receiving so I would suggest activating a different 2FA method that isn’t SMS.",

Best if it's related to bitcoin, or bitcoin themed of course.Is there a specific country you would like access to? Because as far as I know there are different regulations in different regions even if you are in the same continent. I personally am not aware of any phones that could lead you to having phone international numbers directly. It would have to be a software that you download on your phone. There is also no bitcoin themed phone unless you turn it into one. Buy a whole different phone and download the needed apps for what you want to do.",

For example, I cannot use YouHodler because I live in U.S.Just google for buy european did number with crypto and you will find a bunch of companies providing phone numbers. You also probably want to get a number with SMS, because not all companies provide authentication codes via voice calls, some insist on sending you an SMS.I cannot recommend a specific company, because I don't use a European VOIP number, but you can probably try a few until you find a suitable one. Also keep in mind that some websites recognize VOIP numbers and refuse to create accounts with such numbers.",
