We all know that most bounty hunters would probably just drop those coins in the market after it has been live in exchanges, and that adds up to the volume that has been offloaded. While the amount might be negligible compared to the total volume of the coin, it still will be offloaded nonetheless. But then again, those creators paying bounty hunters in the same token just means that they have huge trust on the coin to do well since they have already calculated the amount that they need to pay to the bounty hunters with dollar equivalents.",

On the other hand, project developers doesn't want to use their own money to pay these bounty hunters. Yes bounty hunters doesn't care about the tokens of these project developers, but look on the other side. If you're the owner of the project for example, are you willing to use your own money just to pay these bounty hunters? Launching a bounty campaign isn't a guaranteed success for the project, and they can't afford to lose huge amounts of money if they know that the chances of the project becoming successful is low. I know how you're feeling because I already taught of that many years ago back when I'm still participating in these bounty campaigns.Quote from: Woodie on March 02, 2023, 11:32:34 PMGoing forward in the best interest of investors and the project itself, hope to see \"more\" bounties being paid with established coins in this industry.What do you guys think? Some might do it, but most will not do it. The uncertainty of a new project is the reason why they can't afford to pay bounty hunters with established coins like BTC, ETH, USDT etc. If project developers will do, it will favor the bounty hunters, and what if the project fails? The project owners will lose money, and they don't like that. Instead of the owners risking their money, they will pass that risk to the hunters giving them some worthless tokens.",

      "body": "After considering different perspectives, it is clear that there are pros and cons to paying bounty hunters using native tokens. While it is cost-effective for the project to pay with tokens, bounty hunters may not have the same long-term vision for the project and may be more inclined to sell their tokens for a quick profit. On the other hand, giving tokens as rewards can also serve as a distribution strategy, allowing bounty hunters to experience the benefits of the tokens firsthand.In the end, the decision on whether to pay with tokens or established coins should depend on the project's overall goals and vision. If the project is focused on long-term growth and aims to signal strength to investors, paying with non-tokens may be a better choice. However, if the project wants to build a strong community and distribute their tokens more widely, paying with tokens may be a better option. Ultimately, it is important for projects to consider the trade-offs and make informed decisions on how to reward bounty hunters.",

      "body": "well, that is the view of the bounty hunter. If we give our personal opinion, then many people want to use stable coins or use popular altcoins as a means of payment for bounty hunters. It brings a lot of positive things. however, once again that is in the bounty hunter's view.We know that new projects pay using the coins that they have not only paid, but they are also looking for users, and in that way, there will be lots of people holding the coins or tokens that they created even though most of them will sell them. plus, it saves them any advertising dollars they could spend. even though the potential for their coin price after being listed on the market can fall, personally I think that they can easily increase the price of their coin if they want, because the token allocation for bounty hunters is usually very small. besides that, the fall in price will also make bounty hunters and other coin holders hold the coins they have temporarily, and it will create a natural barrier.Well, actually there are still very many reasons for that. however, I think each project will have a different strategy.",

Or, they just follow the usual standards, which should've been rather noticeable and isn't really that effective anymore. And to be fair, project teams/devs would much rather pay their own token instead of real money since it opens up the idea that they aren't really giving up anything in exchange for the service people provide until further time, and in most cases members are just people who spam create accounts with a few people actually just being behind those accounts instead of the intended goal of having multiple people spread it out. At this point, both managers and participants just try to outwit each other where managers don't want to pay more if they can, and participants trying to hog the rewards for themselves.",

They did bounty campaign for a reason to let their project known or be spread to community. They paid in tokens to make it more valuable. The problem with different hunters are they are demanding of the tokens that either become worthless. Expect some to dump their tokens cause you cant forxe someone to hold especially when they think they deserve to sell the money from it.

But I won't say things would be the same as with the present. Most of the projects before are succeeding with their token sales which results to bigger profit for the investors. At this moment, most of the projects being promoted are failing on its start which somehow changed the market. So for now, I guess it is just a good thing to pay on other chain such as Bitcoin than to be patient of the rewards and eventually earning less than expected.

Another reason may also be that paying with coins like BTC and ETH will cost a lot of funds and it is quite certain to spend on payments. If you only pay using tokens, then when unwanted events such as projects not running, developers will not lose valuable coins like BTC or stablecoins, they will only leave tokens that are no longer valuable. new projects almost all implement payment by token. and the strategy so that there are no crash dumps when tokens are distributed is by scheduling the token bounty distribution when the main investor receives all of their tokens.",

Well i personally am part of a bounty for many weeks now that is paying every week in BTC, which is of course a nice thing for the participants because BTC is probably the most stable currency in the crypto space, except stable coins of course. You are right that most bounty hunters don't really care about the long term vision of the project bounty that they are part of. So as soon as the tokens are paid they will dump them which can really threaten a new project.I still think though that a bounty that pays in native tokens can definitely work. First of all the amount of tokens that is paid for the bounty should not be to high. If a bounty is offering 1 Million $ worth of tokens for bounty participants, then you should stay away from that project and from that bounty.",

In the beginning, the teams promise a large number of tokens to attract hunters, but if the project does not have good investors, it becomes difficult to pay without the price crashing, leaving the teams with no choice but to distribute the agreed-upon tokens, and the price does crash or even die in the end.",
