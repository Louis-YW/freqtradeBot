They were cryptonight original(yes asic mined on the X3) for like 1.5 months. people made bank and left. I still have a nice bag if it ever scam pumps on some binance listing for \"ItS AbOuT TeH Ai BrO\" as that seems to be the direction POW will (have to)  take.Can someone please make another cryptonight coin? There were bankrupt miners in Porto Ricco selling them for 20$ with shipping last year. If you were lucky you scooped up an entire X3 mining farm for next to nothing. The speculation paid off.the first day of mining one x3 made me 6.4k coins per day. For a while my paltry 4.5- 5 MH was one of the highest hashrates. it quickly got jumped on with some of the huge X3 mining farms in Vietnam. After they changed to \"dynex solve\" they had FGPA attacks for 1 week.....honestly I don't think they ever fixed the problem and the FPGAs are mining on the pools.here is the way I look at Dynex and both are losses1) You GPU miners are competing (once again age old story in crypto) with secret FPGAs and don't stand a change unless you sell into pumps.2) dynex solve is real but being used by the CCP and PLA to circumvent wester sanctions on semis now that they cant buy good chips.make what you will from this. know if 2 is true there's your exit liquidity. Take it a donate it to western arms production haha.",
