But they argued me to a fault but I knew bitcoin will not gets to $40k this year. The price will definitely rise but not at the moment. Do you predict the price to any level year? You have really made a nice prediction here but as we all know prediction with less knowledge always  brings 50 50 opportunities from which most of the people lost. So, AFAIK, btc might hit $40k because it has already tried its best to reach $35k and due to banking problems which you might have not predicted in January, that has downed the btc prices alot and after that, there were sec's crack down, plus now there is ordinal problem and orc-20 tokens problems. Despite all of these btc has hold it position at $25k and made it a hard support level. So i think, keeping this support level in mind btc has the potential to hit $40k in almost last quarter of 2023. Its my spectulation so please dyor too before following mine.  As there is one more factor there which ensures BTC to reach $40k which is mext year halving. I have already talked about halving many times and will talk about it here too. Which is --> halving might come in april 2024 and after that bullish cycle will start and btc will make its new ATH, which is a good sign for BTC to hit atleast once $40k this year.",

I'm not an expert and I don't have much of a problem with how much the price should reach year after year, because as I have speculated in this market experience, they are for reference only initiate or take profit according to the volatility of this market. I find it very funny when someone keeps making arguments about how prices are going, as if they are talking about going both wrong and right.

It's too early to tell about the price we are just halfway through the year, and so many things are going to happen all I know is I'm very positive about the outlook this year, 2022 is a very hard year for us and 2023 a year before the halving is a good time to accumulate, the next halving will probably very different now because we have massive adoption and we will have a deduction of the output, the demand will be greater than the supply.",

Bitcoin already reached the 30K level in less than half a year but this price wall is the previous price when LUNA&FTX crashed the crypto market. This only means that the crypto market already recovered on FUD which cause this downtrend to the ATL for this cycle. There's a high chance that 40K will be reached this year since next year is halving and we all know that the Bitcoin price always pumps pre-halving. The chance of a strong rally is very high now that we already reached the psychological barrier that end this crypto winter. Best indicator that Bitcoin is on bull market already is it didn't affected by any bad news regarding global economy which it should give a price impact on normal crypto winter.",

You can't simply create your prediction. One must have a concrete analysis whether it is fundamental or technical. Depends on what works for you. on my own analysis at the time being using technicals, price is still at consolidation in which lower price at 23K could get retested or can break above 37K then higher. Two side there is because the price is just trading inside the range. Aside from that there still other factors such as seasonal tendencies, probable epidemics, news, and wars. All constitute not only bitcoin but also other risk assets.",

But they argued me to a fault but I knew bitcoin will not gets to $40k this year. The price will definitely rise but not at the moment. Do you predict the price to any level year? Without thinking about government policy and the implementation of some kind of hatch decision on Bitcoin, I still strongly believe that the price struggle that Bitcoin is facing is temporary, and it is not 100% because of the government being so hard on it; there are also some other issues contributing to it that I actually can't identify. Saying that Bitcoin can't reach $40k on or before the end of the year is just like saying you control the price; no matter how hard Bitcoin tries to fight back positively in price, it might not be able to hit $40k, but to me, I believe those predictions are wrong.Even if Bitcoin price can't sustain $40k, I still believe it can hit it even if it drops back below it again. Just as what happened on the 26th of April, when Bitcoin moved from 26k and hit 30k within 24 hours, the same thing can still happen, and Bitcoin price can just move from 27k to 30k+, and so on. I don't really see anything that is still holding Bitcoin down from hitting 40,000. Unless there are other things that you use in making your chart prediction that I can't actually grab my hands on,",

At the time there was a lot of fear on the market, so it is natural everyone was kind of bearish as at the time the price was close to 16k, it was not until January 9 in which things began to change and the price of bitcoin went up, so do not put too much emphasis on that mistake because it is a mistake everyone would have made at the time, as I was not expecting this fast recovery neither, so as you can see everyone makes mistakes when interpreting the markets, what matters is those mistakes produce small losses while your correct predictions produce on average more money than what you lose.",

I don't really care about anyone's prediction, I don't even like seeing people making prediction about bitcoin, when Bitcoin was around $16k, lots of people claimed that bitcoin will dump more to around $10k zone, nobody believe that bitcoin will start pumping from that zone, but bitcoin started pumping till it gets to $30k zone before it dropped to the current price, how sure are you that bitcoin will not pump to $40k this year, you should know that nobody is controlling bitcoin and nobody knows the price that bitcoin will get to. Don't be suprise that bull run might even start this year that you think Bitcoin won't get to $40k, I think you shouldn’t discourage people that are planning to invest.",

If you are justifying Bitcoin base on people predictions concerning increment and decrement of Bitcoin precisely, you will be discouraged because it's very obvious that bitcoin have to do with the level or gravity of demands before it will accelerate in price, one thing I understand in the price of bitcoins is that it doesn't have to be stable in price, what it does, is that the demand will determine the skyrocket of the price,  bitcoin is a technology which we know that it might increase now and fall back tommorow, and concentrating on bitcoin price through speculation and prediction from individuals is what makes some people do be discouraged concerning bitcoin investment, so the aspect of bitcoins reaching forty thousand (40k) this year is under probability indecencies that a news can change the bearish market of bitcoins within some days and it turns positive to bullish market, so the features of bitcoin can't not be officially predicted.",
