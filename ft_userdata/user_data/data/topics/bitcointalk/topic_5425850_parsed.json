  "content": "It could be useful for holders of TRC20 tokens regardless of used wallet. Since December 4, 2022, some customers, who are using Zebrascript to make payments and send money, began to receive an error message for some outgoing transactions on the Tron network. Various wallet users have also been affected by this problem. The cause, details and solution method will be examined below.The reason is simple and trivial – the Tron network raised the cost of resources required to operate smart contracts, while the amount of resources themselves remained the same.Details: required energy for one transaction in Tron network to send any crypto token, for example USDT, USDC and etc.:– 29650 energy if the receiving address is empty;– 14650 energy if the receiving address is not empty.Previously, the price of 1 energy unit was 280 SUN, but as of December 4, 2022 6:00 am UTC the price has increased and has become 420 SUN (1 TRX = 1,000,000 SUN). So the cost of energy for a transaction to an empty receiving address grew 50%, from 8.302 TRX to 12.453 TRX.And since many wallets (e.g., Atomic), as well as various Tron blockchain software (e.g., Zebrascript payment system aggregator script) set the transaction fee limit at 10 TRX, transactions to empty addresses began to end with a “FAILED -OUT OF ENERGY” error due to exceeding the TRX limit allowed for burning.At the same time, tokens continue to go properly to non-empty addresses, because the transaction fee does not exceed the established limit of 10 TRX, although it became higher.How to fix: just raise your transaction fee limit from 10 TRX to 15 TRX – this will be enough to keep your transactions moving.That said, if your wallet or software does not support changing the maximum commission size, this might be just the reason to change your wallet/software. For example, you can import a private key from your address with money into another wallet, say, in tronlink. Or wait for changes from developers in the new version. Or if you have a ledger purse, you can send transactions via tronscan.Zebrascript was originally designed to give maximum freedom and number of settings available to users. For them it’s enough to change the fee – just open settings of the corresponding payment gateway, select “technical” level of settings display, and set the desired value of “Fee limit (in TRX)”.",

And by current exchange rate for USD/TRX the maximum transaction cost on TRON network now approximate $1.8.Therefore you need to increase transaction fee limit again, now up to 30 trx, in your software.",

It is noteworthy that when you send transactions in the wallet and if the status \"FAILED -OUT OF ENERGY\" appears, the TRX, which are charged by the wallet, are not returned. I thus once wasted 50 TRX, before I understood what the matter. That's why it's better to choose purses with dynamic commission, many purses like Atomic have fixed commission and it always stands on minimum values, so the risk of wasting your TRX is quite high.",

If you got “FAILED OUT OF ENERGY” error then your TRX was not return to your wallet. For example, if transaction costs 27 TRX, but you have limit 20 TRX, it will be burned around 20 TRX and transaction will not performed.In the purses you do setup not commission, but maximum LIMIT of commission. And you can setup it in 100 TRX, for example, this should be enough for some time. But as soon as commissions on Tron will be raised again in future and, for example, became greater than 100 TRX, your TRX will be burned up to this limit, but money will not be sent.",

      "body": "The error \"FAILED -OUT OF ENERGY\" isn't necessarily due to the limits set in your wallet. It might occur because your account lacks sufficient energy or TRX to cover the transaction. For instance, with 20 TRX, you can pay for the 31,895 TRON energy needed for a basic USDT transaction. However, if the target address doesn't hold any USDT, the transaction cost increases to 64,895 energy, and your 20 TRX won't be enough. Consequently, your transaction will fail with an \"OUT OF ENERGY\" error, and unfortunately, your 20 TRX will still be burned, leaving you with 0 TRX.To resolve the \"FAILED OUT OF ENERGY\" issue with TRON USDT transfers, you can purchase energy from third parties. When you buy energy for your transaction, the transaction will succeed regardless of the fee limit set in your wallet. Just ensure you have enough bandwidth (typically 345 bandwidth for a USDT transfer) or TRX to pay for the bandwidth (0.345 TRX).You can use this TRON energy calculator to determine the energy required for your specific transaction:https://energyfather.com/energy-calculatorAdditionally, you can purchase the necessary energy directly on the same page. Buying energy can save you up to 80% of the transaction fee, which is quite significant.",
