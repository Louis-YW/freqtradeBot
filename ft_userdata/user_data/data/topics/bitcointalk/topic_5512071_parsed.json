Of course, some different mania may have to start for that.On the other hand, I find the block times, the big price fluctuation and the incentive of hoarding bigger impediments to day to day shopping than the fees.Well, sometimes the fees too, but imho they are the 3rd or 4th impediment in the list (or lower, if I've missed something).",

But right now, the last block fee carries $2,648 in tx, so with roughly $5000 you could strike a deal with a mining pool and itch a full block by yourself and that will be there for eternity! It takes fewer spectators than the Superbowl to claim all blocks of the year at these prices and it's cheaper too!",

People are more easily mad when they are enjoying a big bull run but when bull run stops, bear market appears, they will start to be uncertain, fearful and their portfolios become less green or even start with light red. When the market comes to time when fear is dominating, and greed is less existing, these hyped madness like Ordinals, Runes will die with time.Bitcoin Cash, a shit coin is an example. 7 years after a hard fork year in 2017, in 2024 and 2025, it's really hard for Bitcoin Cash team to create a new greed trend on their blockchain and that shit coin.",

It's their hope but reality is different. $ORDI from ATH about $100 to $33 now, it gives many people big loss and it won't stop here, when bear market comes in 2026 and 2027, I won't surprise if $ORDI lose its price and fall to like $5 or lower like $3. $3 is its bottom now but if in a bear market, it is broken, $ORDI will he divided 2 or 3 times to prices like $2 or $1. It will cause massive losses for people with entries around $100 or even $30 now.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ordi/",
