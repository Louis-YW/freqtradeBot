At some point it was around 31k which we thought it could break out to 34k I think that was still this year if that op did could have made exactly 50 percentage by now.",

Total value today would be $38,083.69 (1.4609493 BTC) ROI would be 13.68 %If one was to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin weekly, the Total purchase amount would be $4,800.

The timing of when you begin investing is very important, which is why we don't just jump into the market because we see that they're profitable with this technique. To maximize the success of your investment strategy, you must also understand how to analyze the market technically and fundamentally. Traders are adept at forecasting, thus the DCA technique will work.",

Instead of making purchases at regular intervals, I'm adapting my strategy based on market volatility. This allows me to seek profitability opportunities in both bullish and bearish markets. Essentially, I'm looking to capitalize on market fluctuations in a more dynamic and adaptable way, leveraging changing conditions to make more timely and flexible investment decisions.For instance, in my backtest, during the bearish market conditions of 2022 for Bitcoin, my newly devised strategy proved to be profitable, achieving a remarkable 32% return on investment.https://es.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/qtnVf3E5/",

Yes, it's passive and for sure if you have understood how it works, it's certainly a good fit for you.My approach isn't strictly DCA since DCA involves making regular purchases at set intervals. Instead, my strategy involves making multiple purchases based on market volatility, coupled with a fixed take-profit target. In my case, after conducting a successful backtest, I have implemented this strategy in a live trading account. For instance, you can observe the performance in 2022, which was a bearish year.https://es.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/qtnVf3E5/",

However, my strategy combines specific elements of both DCA and grid methods, along with other mathematical calculations that have demonstrated the ability to generate these results in the short term, as evidenced by a backtest.For instance, consider the performance of the year 2022, a period marked by a bearish trend in Bitcoin as illustrated here: https://es.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/qtnVf3E5/The primary objective of this strategy is to maintain liquidity consistently, ensuring that funds remain readily accessible for future use without concerns about them becoming stagnant.",

If, for example, a busy person simply starts buying on ATH because he did not have time to analyze the market, and he starts buying at 60k, then his average purchase price will not be very good and he is unlikely to receive much profit from such an investment.Everything related to money will require certain knowledge and to some extent will require your time, at least in the initial stages.

What i know is DCA is for those who want to hold a coin for a very long time and the market is moving sideways. Like if you have been doing DCA for over the past 2 years your average must be lower than those who are investing now.If you are a busy person and want to trade to make a profit when the market is moving sideways and you don't have any intention to hold for a long time then Grid trading is best for you. Just set the support and resistance parameters and create the bot with the amount of grid you want to put there. Now it will run on its own and you can be busy where ever you want.",
