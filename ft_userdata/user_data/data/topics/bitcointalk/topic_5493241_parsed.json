But in this competitive market whenever there is a gap, a new company would jump in to cover that. If there is no alternative today, I am sure tomorrow you will find multiple alternatives. In the meantime, Nigerian people can use Paxful or Noones.",

Therefore I suggest you kindly move it to Niaja board since the Nigerian users there can best spot out the effects.However, Nigeria has always had crypto currency ban issues and exchange relating issues for some time now. Ban of binance in Nigeria had many effects mainly because binance was the most popular exchange in Nigeria. Owing to that fact, a majority of short term traders in Nigeria made use of binance and ever since the ban these users have to move their coins to probably another exchange where the could continue their trading. Another problem was that some local traders even had accounts their for crypto repurchase as well as sale.",

Yeah I agree with you, the Nigerian Local Board is the best place to post this thread because the general forum might not be aware or have idea about the Nigerian P2P ban by Binance, well Binance was the leading exchange used by most Nigerians due to claim that it's P2P is easier to understand than other exchanges and that's why there's been lots of complains by several users after the ban. But then, they should understand that Binance is not the only Exchange with a suitable P2P, there are exchanges like OKX, ByBit, Kucoin amongst others. Well It might be difficult for those who are only used to patronising only the Binance exchange but then people who are aware of other exchanges are not even bothered about the ban since they could still serve the purpose of what Binance was doing.",

This question has already been answered in our LB of only you took your time to go through previous threads though you joined around April 5th but there were also thread about this after that day like :Reminiscing over Binance",

When there weren't Binance P2P, people also used something to sell their crypto. We should always have alternative options. Anything could happen in crypto, and we may lose anything. However, I believe Nigerians will find alternatives for P2P sales. A lot of exchanges are now offering p2p. Also, they could build local communities to sell P2P. It shouldn't just depend on Binance.",

In the meantime, Nigerian people can use Paxful or Noones. I will say Nigerians didn’t even feel the impact of the ban that much not like it was the only exchange used for that. Right before the ban, many top exchanges already had many Nigerian customers using the P2P feature and immediately Binance announced the removal of the naira pair people just completely shift to the exchanges like KuCoin, Bybit and OKX. This exchanges have almost same functionality and features like the binance. And so the impact of binance ban wasn’t that much as People portray it to be.

The P2P is only a problem because it was removed by the exchange itself.",

So, when the platform is out of the country due to the ban. There are for sure some alternatives that will work for them for P2P trades. They can do the deal in specific places and just trade with actual and real money while they send the crypto to the buyer and how they find each other? Social media. If they're on social media and on specific groups, I think someone who can be trusted might play as their escrow to secure the deal. However, there are cons on it so if they decide to meet and deal personally, that's one way. There's still a way for traders to find a way for all of their deals to happen for P2P. This is what the government don't realize because as much as possible, when most of these people have already done deals for so long and have understood the concept of P2P with or without a platform, they'd find a way to continue their p2p trading activities. It might be hard from the start but I am sure that they'll able to discover a secured way of continuing it.",

From the sidelines, it looks like they're just looking a scapegoat 🤔I know binance removed naira but what about other markets such as spot, etc.? do they still work fine for the locals? because technically, there are ways to circumvent the ban if it's not coming from binance's end. Asking because there will always be people who will circumvent this. I'd say it's not worth the risk unless you're just getting your money out. Last I heard, Nigeria was demanding user information of their locals particularly the top volume traders in binance. Plus their approach has been nothing but aggressive so far so idk what happens next. Better err on the side of caution.",

I see nothing related with Nigeria crypto reputation and the ban, at first a lot of Nigerians felt disappointed cause almost all crypto enthusiast make use of Binance but this cannot stop us from trading p2p as there's always an alternative in every situation",
