They know email used on that company and we can recover them. Any information will be helpfull.Thanks in advance.",

      "body": "As you saying you have lost info related to bitcoin account that means you don't have info related to wallet like its seed. A seed is the compulsory thing you need to recover your wallet in case you lost your device. Can you provide some detail like what type of app you user to access your bitcoin.",

Any information will be helpfull.Thanks in advance.I'm not sure if any of these platforms were based in Austria, but... they were around 2011:- Mtgox (hacked). It used to offer SEPA transfers.- Tradehill (closed) also offered sepa.- Virwox.com (also closed recently). It had SOFORT BANKING (which I believe is used a lot in Germany and Austria).- MyBitcoin.it was also around that year, but I'm not sure if they offered bitcoin trading or just acted as an eWallet.I would start by searching for the above services on google image, maybe it'll refresh your friend's memory.",

      "body": "There's a good chance it's now defunct, the oldest austria-based exchange I could find that is still in business was founded in 2014 (supposing no one moved). If it's some local exchange, looking up using their language is something to try.Since the friend still has access to the email account, try reviewing all verification emails during 2011. You could also use possible keywords such as exchange, bitcoin, BTC etc.. when searching for emails.",

      "body": "I don't know if the bank where your friend bought the Bitcoins from could help because if they made a transaction and they have successfully finished it, it would've been in the personal wallet of your friend already. Which means they would have finished their transaction and they have separated ways already.Bitcoin can be stored in a wallet so that's what your friend needs to figure out next. Maybe these questions could help.How was the transaction conducted? Purely online? Or physical meetup with the representative of the company?How did the deal conclude?What were the necessary requirements in order to conduct business with the company? To buy BTC?",

I booked a withdrawal order on 6 nov, and still no funds. I have to wait till the 22nd November by my calculations.I'm not sure if the CryptoXChange company, also did the same to the OP, for clarity try contacting: @augustocroppo, and ask him for help, who knows he can help your case.Quote from: Potato Chips on June 02, 2022, 07:17:35 PMOP was actually talking about Austria not Australia.Yes, you are right, I read it wrong.",

Even how the coin was bought has been forgotten not to talk of knowing the login details of the site used, some sites that were exchanges that time had been hacked and cease to exist. If she can get the statement of account at that time from his bankand check, possibly useful information can be gotten there.",

So the only clue is the company email sending you the latest bitcoin price notifications(if you keep it).",

They aren't an autrian company either but I see they had sofort banking during that time.You can find how their wallet ID/Identifier looks like back then at: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40264.0",

There's honestly too little info to guess. Whatever happened to checking emails?I was looking into bitcoin communities in austria and found an NPO founded in the same year (https://bitcoin-austria.at), they might be able to tell what was available for the locals during that time. Found them in bitcoin wiki in case you're curious.",
