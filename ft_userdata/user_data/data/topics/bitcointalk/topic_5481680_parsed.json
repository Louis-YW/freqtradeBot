Anyways Your choice is nice too but I seem to like the first one more.If you could be very resourceful in creating that frame I would say you go for it.I would love to see your finished job.Cheers",

Wait till you see the price of the actual newspaper!  It wouldn't surprise me if it isn't a scam site (even though I hold my doubts). The Times newspaper is probably the rarest Bitcoin collectible, probably rarer than cacascius coins.",

The quality of the image is good, at least some one can clearly read out the text written in small ink. Most of the \"The Times newspaper\" pictures I see online are usually blurry, and you will hardly be able to read anything. I could show you how bad it is if you want.If you think of making the frame yourself with the image, I think it will still look as good as the one that's sold on Etsy.com",
