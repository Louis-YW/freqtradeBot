  "content": "A crypto phishing campaign is underway right now, and they target mostly, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and KuCoin.Mode of attack is the usual phishing email campaign, as the cyber criminals will impersonate Coinbase like saying that your account has been suspended.And once you click the link, you will go to the fake website, and when you enter your credentials, the criminals will steal it at run-time login to the real Coinbase. Of course, you won't suspect anything at the beginning, because the fake website will also asked for your 2FA and then again once you enter it, they will automatically enter that to the real Coinbase website and then steal your crypto.But this scammers will take to the next level and will asked for more info like in a live chat support.QuoteFor good measure, after successfully harvesting their target’s login information and 2-Factor pin, the attacker will now collect more information from them manually. The phishing pages will display a message that you are locked out of this account, and need to resolve it with Customer Support. Once that has displayed, a chat box appears in the bottom right corner, where the attacker will engage the target in a conversation to “recover” additional personal information related to your account, including phone number, address, email, estimated account balance, etc.This will help them should they have difficulty, or require additional validation, while they are accessing the targets account on their system. This also enabled the attacker to be live chatting with the victim to keep them engaged and distracted while draining their funds.https://pixmsecurity.com/blog/phish/coinbase-attacks-bypass-2fa/Again, first rule of thumb is that we shouldn't click any link that we don't know where it came from. \"Think before you click\".Common sense, used it, one of our best weapon against this impersonations.",

Hence why I started having separate emails for specific purposes using custom email domain aliases. It can be really handy with organizing emails, and for potentially determining where specific scammers manage to find your email address.",

Even if I have, I learned a long time ago that I save legitimate links exclusively in browser bookmarks, and even then I check them before logging in to any website.If you receive such an e-mail, the best thing you can do is to report such a post as spam, so the filters will recognize it and automatically redirect it to spam folders where most users will not even notice it.",

Its easy to verify things if legit platform ask us to do something since we can just contact the support and ask about those situation for verification. This schemes will never stop since everyday there are newbies come on industry and doesn't know what to do so I guess having this kind of discussion what OP written about phising is really helpful since somehow this will came out on google search and they could read what people discuss about this issue.",

That's why we won't just loosely use our personal emails in some random giveaways or else this kind of bad thing happened. Well always separate your valuable information from your social media activities, especially bounty hunting or airdrops. But I personally don't click any of what I have received in my mail inbox especially if it is in the spam box which we always suspect of possibly phishing a link. I think no need to change your email address as long as you don't click any message that has unknown links. Just ignore it and nothing will happen to you, because for me --changing email even if it is disclosed is not easy to make another one. Thank you, OP for the heads up.",

I believe what's important is people not using CEX as crypto storage.",
