  "content": "Bitcoin Client Software and Version Number: Bitcoin Core v25.0.0Operating System: Windows 11System Hardware Specs: Processor - 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz   2.80 GHzRAM - 16.0 GBToshiba 1 TB external hard driveDescription of Problem: I am running a full node.I changed the network settings (based off of what I found on the internet in order to use it over Tor. I was trying to do the \"private\" thing...) to \"Connect through SOCKS5 proxy (default proxy): Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1 Port: 9050with IPv4 IPv6 and Tor all checkedI set the bitcoin.conf on my external hard drive to:server=1rpuser=abc123(not actual)rpcpassword=******rpcbind=127.0.0.1rpcbind=192.168.0.10rpcallowip=127.0.0.1rpcallowip=192.168.0.0/16After fully downloading the entire bitcoin blockchain to my external hard drive I connected to Sparrow wallet (V. 1.7.6) and changed the settings as stated above. I have not made any transactions. I was connected to the network for several days. I turned off Bitcoin Core for possibly ~8 hours and disconnected (safely) by external hard drive. I reconnected my external hard drive and turned Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core started, what I presumed, to resync. The message I was provided (attached image):(all info here is from after error message so might not be the same as started)Number of blocks left: Unknown. Syncing Headers ((numbers),(percent)...Last block time: Sat Jan 3 13:15:05 2009Progress: 0.00%Estimated time left until synced: UnknownWhat was odd was that the progress never changed and everything continued to say unknown. I figured this was normal (never having run a node before), and I left it over night to \"sync.\"When I woke this morning and checked the progress, I was met with a \"Bitcoin Core - Error\" message. \"Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details\".I have the debug.log in the link below. I have no idea what it is saying to me.I would greatly appreciate someone enlightening me.I really want to contribute to the Bitcoin Network.Any Related Addresses:n/aAny Related Transaction IDs:n/aScreenshot of the problem:https://imgur.com/a/hWJRlQeLog Files from the Bitcoin Client:(I am unsure what is relevant.

Is there another way to know if Bitcoin Core is really shut down? Should I be inspecting my task manager to make sure?Maybe I should connect the hard drive directly into my computer instead of through the bus. Or just never disconnect it lol.Thanks for looking over my logs.",

I think this is what used to be a bad sector, except for now the drive remaps it to another location so it still passes the S.M.A.R.T. criteria. But I don't like it. And since that disk was terrible anyway (it's one of those that gets very slow when writing a lot), it's now on my list for replacement. That disk has another problem: it draws slightly more power than my DVD-bay can handle, so half the time my laptop doesn't boot.

I deleted the command and the wallet problem went away. However, I'm guessing, since it never fully reindexed, it was still fucked, so I restarted the reindexing.... another fatal error popped up after maybe 8 hrs or so.... in the bug log it said something about the error possibly being the reason of an \"I/O\" and there wasn't anything else. Bitcoin Core terminated itself after I clicked ok to the fatal error message.I do not have a bug log to show everyone bc out of frustration I formatted the external and packed it up to return it.

That is why I switch to HDD(Internal) and directly installed it as another drive on my PC it is way more better than using the HDD as an external drive.
