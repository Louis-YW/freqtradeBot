In fact, many governments are exploring ways to regulate and incorporate digital currencies and blockchain technology into their existing financial systems. And to be honest, even if they found out who Satoshi really is, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. Why would they even sue him? After all, Bitcoin is simply a software protocol, and there is no evidence to suggest that Satoshi had any malicious intent or acted illegally.",

This implies that my safety is now compromised as anyone could actually break into my location and I would definitely receive countless of death threats which could harm my situation.Maybe this is also the reason on why Satoshi never disclosed himself to the public. Sure, there may be clues gathered by forum users here on how he wrote or composed his messages but we should probably just leave him alone and thank him for giving us this godsent of a technology that made some of us millionaires or even billionaires at some point.",

This. So of course the government will also really appreciate the discovery and knowledge, although for sure, not all governments in all countries will agree and support it, but I'm sure the majority of countries will support it. So in my opinion, if Satoshi Nakamoto is found, it won't have too serious an impact let alone be labeled a criminal by the government.but in my opinion, what is more feared and must be watched out for is not from the government, but from certain parties who intend to rob or force satoshis for their personal gain. So indeed Satoshi's decision to remain anonymous is the right decision, because if Satoshi had revealed his identity from the beginning, I'm sure the path to bitcoin would have been a little different.",

At this point, bitcoin has become big - so big that it no longer concerns Satoshi anymore, nor his current involvement to this project still that relevant that could potentially stop everything. He's made the right decision to leave everything behind to the community a decade ago, and it grew bigger and bigger until there are a lot of different players doing things independent of one another. Even if they get Satoshi right now, it will not affect bitcoin negatively in a huge way that makes the whole thing crumble. There will be a lot of negative price movements, but not to the point that it breaks things.",

Bitcoin network is very decentralized and its hash rate comes from many countries globally. So no single law enforcement (even it is right or wrong) at a single local area can pose a threat to shut down the entire Bitcoin network. It will never happen.Bitcoin network can not be shut down if Satoshi Nakamoto is arrested as Satoshi does not have a nuke button to nuke the Bitcoin network.",

As far as the identify of Satoshi, I'm not sure if government are willing to pursue it, might take some huge budget on their side that is not going to be worth in the end. Besides, Satoshi chooses to be hidden, he did a lot of misdirection that even today, we don't know if he is still exist, dead or a group of individuals creating Bitcoin. So let's put that argument to rest, Satoshi can't be identified.",
