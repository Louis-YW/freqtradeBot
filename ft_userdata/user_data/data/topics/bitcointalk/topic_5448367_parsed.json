From the word decentralized and open-source code which are open to everyone and allow anyone to participate in the network, it must be a public blockchain. So a great example here is bitcoin because of its transparency and decentralized nature.In private blockchain is a centralized project --which are designed to be more restricted in terms of access and participation.The best example is Ripple or the XRP.I encourage you to make some research on your own. It could be Google is your friend to ask regarding this matter.",
