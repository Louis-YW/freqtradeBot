Then when it goes down you close the trade and pay back those bitcoins and you keep the difference as profit.You can also trade futures which are essentially contracts which let you short Bitcoin with leverage. However be careful with this as it’s easy to get liquidated due to leverage on volatile crypto assets.",

Depending on what the exchange's UI is(it can vary), just use the \"short\" button. Maybe you're on the \"spot trading\" category hence you don't see a \"short\" button.",

I understand how to BUY and wait for the price to go up.Buy and wait for price to go up is good but if you are in trading, you must know when is a maximum time you can wait before you must exit your trading position. Because if you wait too long, market will come to a point which has very big change that can be up or down in a blast off or a weak down.QuoteBut I don't understand how you make money on SELL.Buy low, sell higher, it is how you make money with buying and selling, in spot trading.QuoteFor example, let's say I believe BTC will go down. So I BUY BTC. And then I wait for it to go down and then SELL.Don't I lose money?If you do this with Spot trading, you will lose money because you buy high and sell lower.If you do this with leverage trading (Margin), you will have profit because you use your bitcoin as collateral for your leverage trading, when you sell, you sell that position with leverage, not directly sell your collateral bitcoin.However with Leverage trading, risk is much bigger than with spot trading. I don't recommend you to do Leverage trading.",

      "body": "Well, few members has already answered your query but here is my explanation but with example. Definition says, You borrow BTC or any coin on which you are shorting (taking short trade which mostly a future trade). From someone like let's say from a broker. It maybe a exchange too you are using. Let's say you are doing short trade on Binance and borrowed 1 BTC and sold it at the current market price of around $29800 and let's say market wis going down to around $25000 maybe. And at that price you bought the 1 BTC again and gave it back to your lender and now you have left with 4,800$ profit.I hope this example might make sense to you. I know you might think i am not buying it again at the price of $25,000 but it's what happened when you close the trade. The smart contract is buying that 1 BTC with the amount of $25k and leaving $4,800 dollars in your account as profit. Dear op, if you could share your experience with this VIP signal selling group then it will be highly appreciated as i am interesting in knowing what results these groups could bring on your table. Because obviously they will charge you for joining them but what's their winning ratio.",

And then I wait for it to go down and then SELL.Don't I lose money?First, I will say you should be careful about signal groups, they can be as inaccurate as humans too. The best that you can do is to learn how to trade even if you will use crypto signals. Know what they you are doing. Another thing is that you should avoid paid signals, they are scam. You have only been buying bitcoin using the spot market and sell to buy a stable coin like USDT or USDC or fiat after you make profit or loss. If you want to be able to learn how to use sell/short to gain, you will learn about future trading.Future trading are derivative trading and very different from spot trading. It makes use of different market and you will be able to leverage which makes it riskier unless you are very determined not to go more than 1x to make it be like spot market. If you use it to trade altcoins, going short can still lead to liquidation as you know altcoins are very volatile and they can increase 2x very fast. Go to exchange like Bybit or Binance after you read about future trading. The exchange have trading guides for future trading too. I have forgotten of Bybit, but I know Binance also has videos that you can watch about it.",

You can't do it in spot because if you do you will lose your money only if you sell it below your buying price. However, if you're going to trade with futures, have enough knowledge but still a newbie, I recommend to use a small leverage only. And please bear in mind to use Isolated mode instead of cross margin mode to safeguard your remaining funds if ever the price drastically going down and forgot to put a stop loss.",

It's definitely not for everyone because of it high risk. It looks good in theory but a very dangerous strategy because once you short your trade and the market price start appreciating, is your money that is gradually liquidating as the price increases.I think you should first of all learn about the basics of trading before even thinking of joining a signal group. I'm afraid you're likely to loose your money since you can not even tell or understand how buy and sell works in trading. Don't forget to switch your account to future trading before you begin else you might lose your money if you are on spot trading. It's important to be aware of the risks involved in trading before you attempt to get into it. Knowledge first, then practice follows.",

You're selling on a loss since you sell when bitcoin goes down. I think the short you are pertaining is on futures trading where you borrow some money and short some cryptocurrency that has a potential to go down and that's the time where you can earn some profit. Spot trading and futures trading is different. Also be careful on trusting these kind of groups since some of them are just trying to manipulate their members into buying and selling so that they can earn in their own gain. They particularly try to pump and dump small altcoins but if it's bitcoin that has a large market capitalization, maybe they are legit in providing help to newbies. Try to back check their past predictions.",

In the case of futures trading, you can make profit by trading in two ways, one is you have to do long trading and the other is you have to do shot trading. Long threading means if you buy a coin and if the price of that coin increases, you will get profit according to the increase and short trading is if you buy a coin and if the price of that coin is decreasing then you will get profit from it according to the decrease of certain amount.

In spot trading, he will lose if he buys during a correction. But he is talking about future trading where he starts to enter or press the SELL button during the correction period, like in the image below. After that, he had to wait until the price touched his desired bottom.It is just an example.Those who join the signal group expect to get profit without having to analyze market conditions. They wait for the signals to be shared in telegram groups they know and then execute them. But as for the truth of those signals, they just don't know because they just follow the signals.This is very risky, especially if it is a futures trade. No one can guarantee that the market can move according to that signal. That is why we must learn more about analyzing the market to trade to the best of our ability.",

If you have assumed that the price of Bitcoin or whatevercoins that we do have in the market would be going down and then you do position yourself SHORT and on the time it dumps then you are making money with thator profits and on the time that you do find yourself that contented with those profits then you could anytime close that position but take note, futurestrading is very that risky and better stay away or not mind on engaging if you are still noob in this industry.",
