Bitcoin was built on open source, which allows the network to stay decentralised, making it difficult for a single body to control the network. There is no exception to this, even Bitcoin's inventor does not have the authority to regulate or change anything without the participation of other users on the network (the miners). The open source model allows everyone to contribute to the network, which improves its adaptability and functionality.  On the network (blockchain), anyone may view, analyse, and audit. Bitcoin is based on the technologies of blockchain, which evolved from public blockchains. The use of public blockchains helps to address some of the issues associated with security weaknesses, third parties, and centralization. With or without the inventor, it will continue to function the way it is now.",

Yes, its open source and we know that updates and changes could really be done but it is really that necessary? The only problemi do see with Bitcoin is on scability issue and the rest is really just working perfectly fine and doesnt really need any changes or updates in regards. Yes, its true that having that founder or creator to be known alivedoes really give out that confidence into its investors but we have seen the different thing on here in Bitcoin on which even on Satoshis absence then it is really that still able to sit on the top of the rankings on which it is really that something shows that on how good this project is.Everything will really matter when it comes to demand and recognition because even if Satoshi is dead(hopefully not) it could really still be able to sit on #1 in the entire marketconsidering that this is the origin of crypto then it is something a title or reputation that no coins or projects that would be able to replace into its place.This is why its really not that shocking for this thing to happen even up to now.",

It is not a wish but it is a known fact that all humans will taste the sad and irreplaceable part of this life – death. As far as I know that the only founder of this technology is a person or a group of people named Satoshi Nakamoto and he has left this forum since December 13, 2010 and has never visited the forum via his/her/their original id. Another thing that I know is that after December 13, 2010 no one has heard of Satoshi Nakamoto and even till this day no one really know who he/she/they was or were. At that time when he/she/they disappeared the price of Bitcoin was less than $1 a Bitcoin and anyone could purchase more than 100 Bitcoin for a $100 USD. So that's why I can say that Satoshi's presence has no impact on Bitcoin's price.Quote from: Iamgoat on October 11, 2023, 09:31:53 PMI don't have an in depth knowledge on how the open source software works, which has perhaps led me to more curiosity hence my question, yet I feel like Bitcoin still undergo some security guard and monitoring to safeguard it against the black-hats.You can learn about open-source software from YouTube and any other online platform. There are thousands of videos about open-source software available on YouTube for free. And when it comes to security then you don't really have to worry about the security of Bitcoin because as long as good miners are controlling 50% of the hash rate then none of the black-hat hackers will be able to do anything against Bitcoin.You can learn further about 51% attack via this URL: 51% attack",

It was a fucked up time that made us really think about why we're even saving money if it could just be devalued by mistakes that we didn't even commit. Satoshi Nakamoto is a real one for taking the initiative to launch bitcoin himself but as I said, someone with enough tech and coding prowess is pretty much expected to release a bitcoin if Satoshi wasn't able to in the past. I get that it's a little optimistic, but a lot of reasons made me think that this is the only way things would really go no matter what happened. If the 2008 financial crisis wouldn't have happened, we wouldn't have bitcoin, but we did, so here we are.",

No, but instead, people are steadily investing in Bitcoin regularly. Everywhere around the world, someone is either buying Bitcoin for the first time or buying more to add to their already-exceeding balance. There is no accurate information to confirm if Satoshi is dead or still living, but Bitcoin is still doing well, and I don't believe that there can be any effect with or without Satoshi. If the Bitcoin network faces any serious issues, there are still some programmers who know the best way to follow up on the issue. The situation that I am even thinking will cause an unfavorable situation in the future for investors in Bitcoin is if the government begins to fight seriously against Bitcoin. For example, let's say that any day in the future, 1 bitcoin will become $900 million, and perhaps the government knows individuals who own 1000 bitcoins or more.",

Anybody can do anything... or I should say developers are doing their job, and that's to maintain. Any changes around Bitcoin isn't been approved that easily because I think there's at least 5 groups that needs to agree in order for that development to be implemented. What I remember is that, miners are one of them.Bitcoin creator die? We don't even know who Satoshi is, and TBH, there's a chance that Satoshi is dead already. Like I said, nobody knows about Satoshi, so these are just assumptions. Like you, I don't also have any in-depth knowledge about the software itself, but at least I know the basics of it. The good thing is that, we have developers who maintain Bitcoin, so I guess we can safely say that Bitcoin's in good hands already... or not.",
