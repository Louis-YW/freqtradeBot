      "body": "I have had a few people ask, so I figured I would post and help others in their decision if they are going ahead to grade their AlpenCoin gold or silver bars.Currently it is approximately $100 to grade each bar and takes about 3 months. This may be more or less depending on if other items are being sent in to negate the shipping cost to and from.Also remember, PCGS charges a handling fee and also a standard return shipping fee based on the amount and value of items being returnedAdd another $20 for an \"oversized slab\"PCGS also charges a yearly \"membership\" fee that does give vouchers for \"regular\" grading. I think currently that equates to about $40 for their standard grading fee (without being an oversized coin.... more than a usual 1oz/43mm coin)I try to take this fee into account over the year that the membership spans to charge a fair fee, as I do not grade any coins with PCGS.Currently the \"Silver\" level is $69 per year with no grading vouchersThe \"Gold\" level give 4 vouchers is and $149 per yearand The \"Platinum\" level is $249 wiht 8 vouchersSo for what it's worth, if you grade couple coins per year with PCGS, the membership level pays for itself.I am not trying to detract from me helping out and submitting coins for other collectors, but wanted to be transparent as to the fees and information about PCGSBelow are infographics with the service level fees and then the yearly membership fees:",

Received back October 24, 2023Total cost with shipping there and back was $107.This timing and cost was under PCGS \"Regular\" service tier of gradingBreakdown is:$40 grading fee$20 oversized holder$10 handling fee (from PCGS)$27 return shipping (from PCGS)$10 shipping to PCGS (from me)For this order, there was no fee taken by me as it was a test to see if PCGS would grade it.. and indeed they did.Also, I am happy to consign orders to PCGS for collectors and can have it shipped back directly to you.. negating the cost/time of a second shipping from me to you.Noted, that PCGS uses Fedex to return graded items, so PO Boxes would not be valid unless you have a street address available for them. Here is the graded bar in all it's glory!!",
