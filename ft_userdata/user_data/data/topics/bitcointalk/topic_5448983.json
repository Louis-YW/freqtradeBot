Don't download and install random software into your device and you will be OKThe best course of action for your Bitcoin is buying an open source hardware wallet like trezor and keep it and the seeds very safely.Using an air gapped computer to manage your wallet can also come in handy.",

Also get yourself with ad blocker like ublock origin. Learn more about how to avoid malware than the unnecessary anti-malware.For additional security, you can get yourself a hardware wallet or a cold storage wallet.",

A first-layered protection is you and your habit when using your devices, surf on the Internet and so on.If your habit is bad, unhealthy, I am sure no Antivirus software or Internet security software can guarantee that your devices won't be infected.Security checklist",

Do not think they are safe and can protect you against all threats. If possible, you should have a separate computer, used exclusively for cryptocurrency transactions and not used for any other work. Do not access strange links, and do not use crack software...And better yet, instead of using a software wallet, own a hardware wallet, and that's the safest solution.",

The Microsoft OEM security is more than enough if you know what you are doing, always update your PC to the latest patch and updates, and Antivirus can be troublesome because I have use d many if them in the past and they caused more problems than they fixed, my PC start running more slower than before, this one is a major common problem with antivirus software. If you want the best antivirus don't go for the free versions, go premium, but the most important thing is staying vigilant.",
