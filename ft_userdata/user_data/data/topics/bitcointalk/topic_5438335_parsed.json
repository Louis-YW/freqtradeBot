Just like I did few days ago. i came across WOOF on MEXC I did some few research on it and bagged some and i was able to see 2x within 24hrs. i never believed it. it was like a magic to me but I was really amazed with what i saw. I must acknowledge MEXC for spotting potential gems",

So I know you did your research and understand the project, but please bear in mind that you need to learn how to manage the risk, don't put all your investment in one basket, that's just one of the examples to do.",

Doing thorough research on the team, their background, and their ability to execute the project plan is essential before investing. It is crucial to approach investment opportunities with caution and not get swayed by hype, always thinking critically and carefully about your investment decisions.",

However, it was not right to say it was a scam already but likely becoming one. In this case, investing this project is too risky, unless they team will work on this project to look better and have a positive output.

In addition, bitcoin is more promising to bring you big profits than new projects. Perhaps a new project can increase the price in the short term, making you think about investing in the new project. But you should think again and not rush to choose the project as your investment. I would prefer you to invest in bitcoins instead of new projects because there is a bigger risk factor in these new projects.",

I will advise you to invest little capital to test the new project, if it will be good for long term trading or not before increasing your capital on it.",

It's better to hold bitcoin no matter how small the profits movement will be due to bitcoin price it is still better than altcoins which have no track record of persistence. Altcoin projects are just based on promises which may never materialise into anything significant thereby putting all your investment at risk.",

Don’t want to look at that project because I know its just a waste of time, if you are in doubt about the new projects then you can just simply ignore it and go choose the best coin in this market, better to be careful with this.",

You already know that there are too many scams and failed projects, so it is too risky to put money into new projects. Since there are many good projects, why you should invest in new projects?Remember that it is still the bearish season, it is not a good time for new projects to be launched. There are many projects that failed to survive during this bearish season. Some of the failed projects just trying to get funds in their promotion phase, then they announced to stop the projects when they get enough money from investors. The worse thing is that the teams disappear then.",
