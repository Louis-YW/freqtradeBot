This is the bitter reality of life that we will all die one day, no matter an ordinary person or ruler of the country but we should continue doing welfare work as long as we live, for the people who are suffering from serious illness and natural disasters as queen used to do. The passing of of Queen Elizabeth is a moment of sadness for all of us. My deepest condolences for family and people of U.K.",

But for honest, for me, era ended like a few years ago, when some important (not relatives) people from 20th century have died. And maybe because of war in my country I may not have a proper mood to comprehend this event in my mind. God save the Queen! In the afterlife  R.I.P",

The death of the queen shoke the entire world because of her influence not just on her nation but also on the world as she has affected so many nations through her position. Just yesterday when the news of her death was announced the mourning began also and so many nations and institutions have declared public holidays in respect of her sudden death.May her gentle soul rest in peace.",

No wonder she is so loved by all, she will continue to be _moaned for long period of time.Why is Queen being _moaned even by those she colonised or even enslaved? Is it because of the sympathy of death or for national honor. Besides, Queen is well aged and should be celebrated instead of being _moaned.",
