The only thing that does is risk losing the BTC if the coin is lost.If it is \"Funded\" then it should be verified funded from the maker and not from the buyer - otherwise the buyer should not have to fund it prior to shipment.  Hell, the maker should not fund it until the buyer confirms receipt.",

It's part of the journey just like getting injured when I am at sparring tournaments...you get knocked out but you get up and move on.    And likewise I highly treasure my MTGOX....Alitin and Microsoft as well as coinographic coins.    So scamkey will be part of that collection. I will probably order a custom made frame and place them all in it someday.Good conversation piece next to my bitbills frame.",

It has always been in the back of my mindthat I would not necessarily be the only one with the private keys no disrespect to any of the activemakers here intended. This outlook has held me back from expanding my collection.But.....with all the discussion around key generation and work flow by other makers it does shedsome light as to what a conscientious procedure should be.And I applaud everyone who will carry on and support the loaded projects. Personally I will probably continue holding off on loaded/funded collectibles instead I wouldopt for a DIY collectible.",

Thanks for the mention.  It's still weird to think that I'm considered an \"OG\" of the community.  When I started I just wanted to make a cool coin someone might want to own.  2013 was literally a dream come true for me and I'll forever be thankful of those who helped me live it.  I couldn't imagine ever breaking the trust I've been given.  I'd honestly rather go bankrupt.Quote from: cygan on January 17, 2023, 12:06:51 PMQuote from: Cryptogreatdane on January 17, 2023, 04:39:32 AM✂ I envision newbies in 2026 paying huge premiums to get their hands on a swept cold key card.

There is 0 chance that Coldkeys are remembered as a piece of Bitcoin's history anywhere near the lines of MtGox.  I don't mean to add insult to injury, but someone needs to say it.",
