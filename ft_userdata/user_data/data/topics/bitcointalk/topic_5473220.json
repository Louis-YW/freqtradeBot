Plenty people dey wey no get clean mind like you wey just dey wait for small opportunity to bring you down. Some people no even know who you be but because of their retrogressive minds, dem dey always look for the best way to bring you down, economically for their own happiness.It is therefore imperative that we always maintain a low life as against a high life. Nobody wey dey this world wey you fit impress pass your family and even them too get limit. Some of these things I got to learn while growing up that it doesn't matter at the end of the day as people will continue to live their lives with or without you. So I learnt to be calming down because it is self-rewarding.Na so hackers and spammers began, when dey started seeing loopholes and extravagance lifestyle od some extremely reach people or companies, they became tempted to penetrate and loot from those people.

In life not because you are making progress means that everybody is happy with you, some people are envious of your success and when you expose how much your crypto investment worth, it means that you are inviting such player haters to you and you are also attracting arm robber to you because they will all know that your are rich and you are a good target for them. This is why it is important that we act as if we don't have any amount invested in bitcoin, so that you can safe your investment from robbers, your life and that of your family from danger. The person that you are showing your bitcoin investment size might be the one to set you up. The world is a dangerous place so stick to a private life.",

When it comes to monetary investment it needs to be something that must be secrete because information fllies, you may decide to tell someone who is good and honest but the question is that if this  information can stay just with the person who knows about it with getting to someone else. For safety it is just better to keep investment,  expecially bitcoin secrete, their is no need letting people know about it. Telling people about the investment will never add any value to investment.  Investment should be personal to avoid problems .",

Trust remain trust until it remain like that but how many people do that. Not everybody you trust today will return it with good gesture. People you even trust today are the people that fail you the most when you need them badly, never trust a man that with money when they don't have the money you have. For instance, you have $10,000 today and your guy has $100,000 as well, it's very easy for him to trust him and tell him you have crypto than for you to tell another that has nothing at all.I love Ben quiet about anything related to crypto. Not that I don't like to make awareness of it but these days you find it hard to differentiate between people that loves you and the ones who don't love you. If I don't tell you that I do crypto, there is no way of you know in my activity and that improves my privacy, what people don't know is better than what people should know about you.",
