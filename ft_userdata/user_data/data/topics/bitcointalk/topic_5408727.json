  "content": "Bitcoin talk is the most popular Bitcoin online memory and data bank, it serves as a blockchain-first digital hub for both analysts and researchers. Some members here came to the know about this forum through Google search and other knowledge base quests, but the most important thing is that we are all here and history have made this forum unique with a large number of members here that have first-hand knowledge since its inception of Bitcoin and bitcointalk even Satoshi Nakamoto is a member of this Noble forum after creating the forum. This thread is created as a reminder to everyone that, this forum is noble enough and every legitimate member needs to take the best shot. In the future you will witness that you started on a good note and you are privileged to add to the general understanding of Bitcoin, blockchain and the forum and I most say bitcointalk is the best cryptocurrency social media with first-hand information guided by rules and regulation that help shape the general perspective and actions of every member.",

      "body": "Apart from being the oldest and arguably the most popular bitcoin or cryptocurrency forum, bitcointalk has passed the test of continuity. The legacies of the heroes pass are being passed on and sustained in this forum.  That is why I am always careful of the contributions I make today, because posterity will look back at today in as much as bitcoin will remain alive. I derive so much joy reading posts from Satoshi and the old developers. I look at their contributions and try to imagine how smart they were. Tbh, they were very smart. But some were smarter. Then, I give it to them all, and some of them are still with us here.",

I, having a good regard for Bitcointalk, don't share your optimistic view. It's a very good forum with very good information, but look at what the average user does in the bounties section, for example. Or the shitposters. Although there was a bigger problem with the latter years ago, which I think the merit system has helped to alleviate. If we are talking about someone who visits technical boards a lot, I might share your view, but they are in the minority.

In Spanish there are a couple, forobits and the cryptocurrency section of forocoches. The former is more serious than the latter. And I think they are mostly made up of people from Spain, I suppose that in Latin American countries there will be other forums.",

I understand your enthusiasm for the forum, but I doubt your statements, people are not obligated to like what you or someone likes. The forum is good, there is a lot of information here, but you should not go crazy and write such flattering posts that are completely understandable to users for what.OP, thanks for the reminder that everyone here has to do something. It's very patriotic.",

There are some other forums also like Bitcoingarden,cryptotalks where similar sort of discussion are being carried out but they have far less user base compared to bitcointalk and most of them are filled with only spam posting although it's the case here also but not too much compared to these forums.This forum is prevailing from a long time and developed by Satoshi having some financial benefits included with it so we see many users turning here only.Moreover the amount of knowledge you can gain here is abundant only if you wish to learn it.",

Haven't read through the forum and seen how spam have been fought in the forum, and that have helped to filter away spam posts with the reporting feature, moderators job have become easy and actions are taken asap, this feature is what most online forum fine so hard to handle, and bitcointalk due to it decentralized system appear to become the best information hubs for those who are not too lazy to read. I visited altcointalk a number of time and I discovered that the forum is just a copy cat of what Bitcointalk is but still altcointalk doesn't have what it take to man up with Bitcointalk standard.",
