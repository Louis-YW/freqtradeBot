  "content": "The Greyhound Cannabis Club, the first NFT community building for Assets on Raptoreum would like to announce Greyhound Raptoreum, an SPL token that is redeemable 1:1 for Raptoreum every Sunday via Discord. Currently the only way to gain $GRTM is by purchasing The Greyhound Cannabis Club: Legendary Hounds on Magic Eden and staking them on our FloppyLabs site. If the community requests it, and we continue to grow, we will expand ways you can gain access to Greyhound Raptoreum, which is 1:1 with Raptoreum. As we continue to grow, the days that this is exchangeable will grow as well, possibly being exchangeable every day for Raptoreum as a direct swap on Discord. We invite you to our Discord, to learn more about Raptoreum Assets, and how The Greyhound Cannabis Club is paving the way for NFT's on chain.https://discord.gg/AzpwvJDTgR",
