  "content": "The bears made bitcoin to be unable to surpassed $22800 in September. Today is 28th, just two days remain from today before we enter new months. Anything can happen, but likely that bitcoin can not go beyond that price. September has been full of fun, bitcoin favour both bull and bear traders as its price never go below $18000 which was a strong support and yet still increased above $20000 many times. Who traded in both directions in patience and using good trading strategies all gained. The best time to buy bitcoin is now. Traders should prefer to go long or buy instead of going short, but going short is also good if the signal really suggest bear market. But all I am thinking that would happen next month is that bitcoin would increased, get to $20000 and increase above it. Bitcoin increased to over $25000 in August, while it only increased to $22800 in September. Is this suggesting bear market in October? What could be its highest price of bitcoin in October? Would it be bulloctober or bearoctober? I am speculating that bitcoin price lowest price may not be below $18000, but can increase above $20000 again.",

Everyone should long at the long term prospect and invest right now or throughout this bear market.I think it won't be worse than the past when bitcoin dropped to $17600, which may probably be the bottom. Know one truly knows what the price would be, but I think bitcoin can not drop much further than $17500. Although, the possibility for the worse is true as you said, but holding now would be profitable in the later time. Let us see what October would be, but according to what I have analysed based on previous price, bitcoin will not fall more than expected.Quote from: ethereumhunter on September 28, 2022, 10:43:04 AMAnd although there will be a lot of news like this month, I hope it will not affect the price of bitcoin too much and can still stay in the above price range or even give bitcoin a chance to start rising in the last 3 months of the year.I do not believe in some news that will only lead to slight price fall and almost immediate correction, like what happened recently about the US increase in interest rate.

But there could still be speculators who think otherwise, maybe because they want to buy at a cheaper price or they are just those perma bears who just hope that bitcoin will fail dramatically.And I do agree with the thoughts that a sideway pattern again until we have a break out run that will push the price to our highest at $22k or the next biggest barrier of $25k. So still exciting to see how not just for this month, but for the rest of this bear year. At least we all survived.",

One thing is for sure that the price will sure revisit again near the 17k area for a possible retest before we can see the trend for Bitcoin since the current price is just a side ways and no clear path on where it will go.I’m optimistic that we will have a semi bull run season before the year ends but I’m not expecting the price going above 30K.",

I mean we are in a spot where there are many uncertainties and there are many negative events that are happening right now globally that's affecting not only the US market but all of the markets around the world. War, interest rates, what's happening to China etc. etc.I want to be optimistic this month but I don't see any reason to be but I will not be surprised if Bitcoin will surpass and stay above $22,000 next month.",

With the movement of bitcoin still the same as before, I think we can still buy low and sell high and do it many times so that, at this moment, we can also make a profit. It is like collecting more bitcoins and benefiting from the movement of bitcoins.",

It has similar dynamics and behavior. Even if bitcoin rises slightly and closes October in the green, many may perceive this as bottoming and turning the market towards bulls. But this may turn out to be a banal trap before a further decline. $18,000 is not yet such an extreme price at which one can hope for total capitulation. Bitcoin still has room to fall.Good presentation to follow Bitcoin's price trend in all October from the past years.  And yeah, 2022 might be similar with 2014 and 2018 price actions then eventually turn out to make another ATH, and we should also remember in the next 2 years, Bitcoin halving will occur again thus creating another hype trend like the usual. IMO, this year's October will not going to make any difference from the past month's Btc price. It would either stay in the same region from September or would slightly fall at $15k level.",

Any ATH news is basically dreaming since we're still quite far off from the next halving, heck an increase to $30k isn't even foreseeable so far imo. Even in the scenario where it temporarily goes back up, I'd reckon we'd still be moving downward immediately later on to balance it out as a steady line.",
