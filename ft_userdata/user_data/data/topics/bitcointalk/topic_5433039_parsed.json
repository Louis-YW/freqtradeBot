  "content": "QuoteIn New Orleans, you can drink alcohol openly in the streets. You can even throw your own parade. But to access porn on the internet, you now need to present proof of government-issued ID, as a new law goes into effect.Louisiana state House Bill 142 requires adult sites to screen visitors via “reasonable age verification,” or face possible legal consequences. And the law, signed all the way back in June and effective as of January 1, 2023, defines “reasonable age verification” rather narrowly. Gone are the days of the “agree that you’re 18+ box,” or the “input your birth year” drop down menu in the Bayou State.Instead, under the law, porn publishing websites can either demand that users present a digitized ID card based on a form of government ID, or simply show their government-issued ID. A vague, third option also allows companies to use “any commercially reasonable method that relies on public or private transactional data to verify the age of the person.” So, in theory, porn sites (or third-party services) could mine users’ credit card, insurance, employment, bank, or other financial information to find verifiable proof of age— which some already do. But for the most part, adult sites will probably stick to driver’s licenses.Louisiana allows digital driver’s licenses through the state’s LA Wallet initiative and app. It’s via that LA Wallet system that popular porn sites like Pornhub, Youporn, and Redtube appear to be newly verifying user ages. At Allpasstrust.com, users can connect their LA Wallet to accounts on all three platforms. And a link on the adult sites directs to that same page, as demonstrated in this tweet from a Louisiana-based lawyer.Gizmodo reached out to Pornhub, Youporn, and Redtube with questions about the new policy, and did not immediately receive a response. It’s currently unclear if or how those without Louisiana drivers licenses can readily access online pornography in the state.A platform is considered a porn publisher and subject to the new restrictions if at least one-third of the content on its website meets the bill’s extensive definition of “material harmful to minors,” which lists specific types of sexual or vulgar acts, including “fondling of...anuses,” and “excretory functions.” If sites fail to comply with the new ID-requirements, the company could be held liable for distributing harmful material to minors and face fines.The logic behind the legislation is that porn is corrupting the youth. “Pornography is creating a public health crisis and having a corroding influence on minors,” the bill text reads. And, though some research suggests that early exposure to pornography can have negative mental health impacts on children and teens, past attempts to censor minors’ access to adult content online have notably failed. Internet savvy young people have a multitude of ways to get around content filters and parental blocks. Louisiana’s latest effort will likely be no different. After all, a simple VPN can bypass the new age verification restrictions.However, officially identifying oneself to view pornography could have serious consequences for adults, should there be a security breach. HB142 decrees that the companies or third-parties performing the age verification “shall not retain any identifying information...after access has been granted.” Pornhub states on its website that it doesn’t collect any data during the process, and “your proof of age does not allow anyone to trace your online activity.” Yet it’s hard to imagine a foolproof system that both verifies someone’s exact age and somehow doesn’t lead to increased privacy risk.State-run systems are frequently vulnerable to digital attacks. And third-party systems like password managers and login verification services have recently been targets of some major hacks.Nonetheless, Louisiana isn’t the only place to introduce official age verification requirements for adult content on the internet. France’s parliament passed similar legislation in 2020. And back in 2019, another age verification law was proposed in the United Kingdom (but ultimately scrapped amid privacy concerns.)In the U.S., Utah’s Republican Senator Mike Lee introduced the federally-focused SCREEN Act last month, which would require age verification for online adult content nationwide if passed, along with another bill intended to diminish porn’s First Amendment protections.https://news.yahoo.com/louisiana-begins-requiring-government-id-201000430.html....Major porn crackdowns otw in the USA. While this applies to sites like pornhub, youporn and redtube. Not certain if their definition of porn will apply to sites like onlyfans which mix adult content with platonic and non nude media:QuoteA platform is considered a porn publisher and subject to the new restrictions if at least one-third of the content on its website meets the bill’s extensive definition of “material harmful to minors,” which lists specific types of sexual or vulgar actsIf porn is eventually regulated out of existence. What would be the secondary fallback option for adult entertainers who rely on income from US markets? Many already have alternate revenue streams tied to platforms like youtube and twitchtv. Perhaps more of them would leave porn and become involved in crypto. My personal preference is seeing people receive a greater number of options and opportunities over time. Rather than being denied options and opportunities. Doors being opened for people. Rather than doors being shut. Could there eventually be more of a backlash in response to these heavy handed, authoritarian, measures? While there have been many who made solid cases for issues like the deficit being worthy of concern, many years ago. It seems no one took those warning signs seriously. Until after they were hit with heavy handed measures, which forced them to make a closer inspection of current events.",

Although the government ask KYC to able control an account that search for a prohibited porn video (e.g. underage porn), but as I stated previously it's so easy to abuse it.",

Not everybody paying for a premium membership. It will be too much work and too much privacy focused that they will just block IP addresses from that state.I think there are many other ways to go about this. One way is just by using your credit card and paying $0.01 to prove you are an adult since kids can't hold credit cards. If a kid can borrows dads credit card, they can also borrow their drivers license and doesn't really accomplish anything.",

But hard to prevent them when there are playboy and hustler magazines still but at least this will not require them to submit government IDs. A lawmaker's ID landed in the database of a porn site, it will be a lot worse for the lawmaker lol. But then anyway, regardless of this law, kids will always find a way.

This will enable the owners of porn sites to blackmail individuals who would not want information about it to become known to their wives or entourage. Therefore, it is in order to increase the level of anonymity and privacy that some porn sites take money from their regular customers in cryptocurrency, and even in some cases in anonymity coins such as Monero.",

That's the goal, if you didn't know. I don't know about the US, but in the EU you pay more tax for your car the more cubic capacity it has, so they need to know that. The also ask you for the same thing if you're trying to import a car. Apart from the brand and year they need capacity to know how to tax you on the import because for some reason it doesn't matter how big the car is, but how big the inside of a cylinder is. If they're asking you for your data to watch porn you can bet your dick (or vag) they're gathering data on what you watch and how often. Next thing, 10 years from now, you don't get allowed to work with children because your employer can access that data and people who watch porn more than x times a month are considered unfit. At the same time the porn site gets shut down because some state voted not to allow its citizens to watch porn at all and their citizens were found registered on the site, so the site should've filtered them and broke the law.What a clown world we're living in.",
