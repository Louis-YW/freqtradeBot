Their are already lots of threads regarding this Binance change of address, using the forum search button would have been nicer and saved you repeated topic Creation..I will advice you lock up this thread in other not to take the discussion any more further.

So when they see the address is \"expiring\", it is not actually expiring but they are discouraging you from using it in the futureKucoin did such a thing in the past when they got hacked so it's no surprise.If you notice, Ethereum and tron addresses on Binance are the ones being retired. I think the new addresses that are being implemented are an upgrade from the ones that were prone to the zero value transaction scam that has been going on for a while.",

What are your takes on this.As a user, you must follow announcement from the exchange. Wallet expiration, address changes are only two of many changes on one exchange when it operates many years.I don't see effect from this for careful people as it only changes your receiving address. Like when you create your account, receiving addresses won't be created instantly for your account. You must click on Create to get one receiving address so the same for change address. You don't lose your cryptocurrency in your account even you don't touch your new receiving address.But it is different if you want to make deposits to your account by yourself or in a trade with other partners. You must get your receiving address, a new one, with this wallet upgrade from Binance.",

I was astonished to see that my address will soon expire and I also questioned whether one could access coins sent to an expired address. I believe Binance will automatically offer a new address when the current one expires, and the notification will only serve to inform customers of the address change. I have no doubt that Binance would have thought of ways to prevent any potential outcomes that would have caused their consumers to lose money while an upgrade is ongoing and would not have wanted to harm customers in any way.

What are your takes on this.Similar topics have been discussed before, and if you review past discussions, you may find some valuable insights. It seems that someone has already provided you with a link to a previous discussion. I think there's no need to worry because Binance is a reliable exchange and would not want its clients to experience any financial loss.",

      "body": "As Binance has explained, this is supposed to be for the enhancement of their technology infrastructure. So if that's what it is, then there's no problem. It is for the improvement of the platform's services and security. And it's also good that even with an expired address you can still receive your deposits, although with additional clicks. But it's not really a hassle. What concerns me, however, is when Binance disables this \"click to credit\" function. It's not a matter of if; it's a matter of when. It will eventually happen. I hope Binance will issue an announcement long before they will finally remove this function. Surely, there will still be stuck funds though. Will they be Binance's already?",

That doesn't define it as best security or coordinated.Â Perhaps the expiration of those deposit wallet addresses is nothing strange, or would you have suggested if they didn't tell any of their users if there were any changes in their exchange? I might not be aware of the real reason why they renewed those deposit addresses, but for about two years that I have used Binance, I have not received any wallet expiration messages, so I believe there was a valid reason why they made those changes.",
