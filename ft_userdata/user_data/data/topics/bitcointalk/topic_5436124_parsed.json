      "body": "When it comes to giving, not everyone understands the principles that lies in giving to others particularly those in need, some do give but want to receive somethings in return either directly from the beneficiary or from others, we must not give in other to get us noticed by people for what we have done, because in so doing we have already received the reward, some also give little to get noticed with public attention in other for them to make their own personal achievements, giving must be unconditional and what we find easy to do willingly without be persuaded for.",

      "body": "Well -said friend,  giving is part of human nature. No one would say he has never received help before nor needed help in one way or the other. But helping people without expecting anything in return in our society these days are rare. Everyone wants to ahow the social Media what they did for a particular person. It's wrong and uncharitable character.if you want to help ,do it with without a camera. Once you appeal on camera then you're feeding your ego. We must change our attitude towards giving.",

      "body": "Giving should be part of human nature but nobody wants to admit this. The fact is that when you give out to someone without expectations from what we did, automatically we shall receive back in hundred folds. Assisting someone in need is the best way to show love and care to that person, but some persons think that they are to give to only people who can give back to them. That is,it is like they give you to take back from you later,which is not the meaning of giving. Anybody that publicise his generosity is a hypocrite, he has already received his reward from men on earth.I have a friend that,it is only when you can give him back or help him out when he is in need,that is when he will love to give to you whatever you ask him. If you can't, forget it,he will never give anything to you which is a poor understanding of giving. Our society is gradually losing the virtue and soon there might be few people with good heart to give out",

People have lost their sense of reasoning all because they want to create content. Accidents or violent victims are now viable content that is highly sought after. Instead of giving first aid or assisting people that are groaning, bleeding, and dying, people video them and upload these horrible scenes on social media. The most annoying part of this is that people would view them and even click the like button. There was an incident in Italy where a violent man attacked and beat a disabled man to death. Instead of people stopping the man, they were busy filming this heartless incident.The student that acted the way the OP narrated should face severe punishment. The student that was also recording it should also be disciplined. The case of not making provision for non-alcohol drinkers in an event might be because of the type of event, the people involved, or the fault of the event planner.",
