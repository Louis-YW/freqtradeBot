You are very easy to play with market prices and I tried it for a long time until I decided not to like it anymore.Good luck for such trading.",

Low risk reward ratio? poor win rate?What results were you basing on when you said it had unbelievable results?QuoteI have found another one or two which also have good results but dont know if it is possible to actually trade the strategies.They consist of a lot of trades with low profit or loss eg 0.2-0.8%It's very possible, but you are most likely going to trade 1- minute charts. I have one of my futures trading strategies focusing on 0.6% take profit and 0.4% stop loss, but I don't use it all the timeQuote from: forestx on July 08, 2022, 09:03:46 PMI would if successful use leverage with these trades but is it even possible to trade such small fluctuations and be profitable It's possible, but very hard.

You can't lose too much if your strategy goes bad for a bit and people get nervous when they start to increase their risk (and sometimes rightfully so).The issue with a lot of strategies is they're good until they're not, and you have to work out when that'll be. Also if you want to be more successful, look at how these strategies have been built and try to rationalise them to see if there's a cause for how they're able to be successful.Trading \"by eye\" or without proper automation might also be a bit tedious and boring too - it's not the timeframe you can set and forget with (or set and come back in a few hours).",

I do not recommend leverage. Some people are using scalping to make profit on a daily basis and it is working for them, but know that trading is very risky as some people are using it to make losses. As you are a beginner, use just the amount of money that you can afford to lose to trade, it will even be better to use lesser amount.",

No need to sell too high, the important thing is that we can get profits many times. But this scalping technique has the risk of getting a high price because the price can drop immediately or get a dump at a low price. But as long as there are large ups and downs, the dumped price can immediately return to the high price to help us sell it and make a profit. I don't know if it would be profitable to use leverage because it's different to spot trading.",

Like you said scalping is a very fast and vigilant trading strategy that makes easier by stable network so that your order don't run beyond time expected or profit taking. Exchanges set fees for the orders, it depends on you on how many times you want to approach the market if you don't want your order to run long time.",
