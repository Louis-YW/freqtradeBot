I'm interested to know the complete mechanics of your poker since the website mention that we need to wear some sort of NFT wearable before we can play on a certain table. Maybe providing a brief video description on the game mechanics will help players to understand well this poker game.What's exchange available to purchase this ICE token?",

You have to apply the same theme to FAQ page as well.3. Many links on the site are opening in new tab and that's annoying. You can change it to open in the same tab.",

I checked to see if I could enteract with the customer care support but I could not see any. I had to leave the site as I could no longer stay on it for more seconds.I think you should tell us your position or role you play for opening an account for this poker here. Atleast that would ease some stress of members here wanting to be sure who you are.",

If anyone wants to play poler for free tokens ($5-$30/per day) you can do it. If you want to play with higher stakes you can too. You will need to look into wearables and such to be able to do so though.",

This will help you understand how to moderate topics like this and gives you more credibility. I think that's how it works across all faces of life. As for Decentral Games (DG), I bit informed about it. It's a web3 gaming ecosystem company and I think the ICE poker is good enough. I also commend the User Interface and responsiveness.",

The developers are really good at their works. Like the sayings goes \"first impression matters alot\" I had to visit OP profile and discovered that OP has not been online since this account and thread was created to give response to questions and inquiries about the site which is not a clear signs though. I had to visit the website again to see if I could see any customer support services but non I could see for myself. I became curious as OP is not active here. This could be a challenge for them in the nearest future if they should continue this way.",

You have to be able to compete with the new casinos on this forum.Perhaps after everything is ready, you can continue promoting on this forum like other new casinos. By doing this, you can see the development of your site every day and month so you can assess its progress.",
