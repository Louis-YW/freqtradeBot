Also, there are lots of experts here on the forum you would want to learn from. I would have love to recommend some names but it won't be nice to do that.

The crypto journey is fill with lot of amazing experience and also negative ones. So long you are ready to be exposed and open minded, you will be good in no time.

Use the forum, learn, and when you learn things, you will have doubts about what you have learned. Then you can ask questions in the threads or open threads yourself. In that sense you can have several mentors or if you see that one is the one who gives you the most clarifications, consider him as your mentor.",

I have this question to ask.  ''Is it advisable to to have a mentor who I can always go to as a newbie in the crypto space or I should rely all my knowledge on things I read online for my growth.A mentor is can be referred to an adviser. I don't think it is a bad idea to admire someone who you think is knowledgeable about Bitcoin and gain some vital information from them. I have contacted some persons personally to seek clarification on several issues relating to Bitcoin and it has been very helpful. Following people on social media that you think are sound can be also helpful. But it is important to always verify the information you get from your mentor this is why you need other sources of information. There is no information that you need about bitcoin that cannot be accessed through books and the internet. I prefer not to have close ties with any individual because people can change their ideology and mentees can be easily influenced by mentors. Some Bitcoin early adopters lost faith in the coin and began to promote FUD and altcoins. People that saw these derailed early adopters as their mentors can be easily deceived that is why it is important to do your own research in most cases.",

There is no better teacher than your own experience, so whenever you wish to learn a thing and you’re finding it difficult you can just use the forum search engine to find out or create a thread when you can’t find answers, there are experts on bitcoin matters here. Also just one last piece of advise do not rely totally on any financial advice here without carrying out your own research",

You should be responsible on all the decision making because mentor will just confuse you when he give an advice that doesn’t fit to your preference. It’s better to read previous discussion here and learned from the reputable users advice instead of just asking someone about something you want to know because no one here will be interested to dedicate their time on answering your questions.

I mean people are not really going to perform that role on a dedicated individual basis, but rather, more collectively through Q&As on threads on the forum. You’ll then have to learn to distinguish the wheat from the chaff, which will take some time, and even so, mistakes are bound to be made on some sort or another.I’m with _act_ on this one: the more context and content you can absorb through reading (or viewing) material, the better, thus narrowing down the uncertainty to levels you can probably get to resolve through Q&As here out in the open (and not through PMs for the most).",

You're in the best forum where mentors are just lowkey here and willing to give you piece of advice on what you should do. But not everyone that will give you a tip could do good for you. You make yourself a plan, DYOR and if there's something that you don't undestand then start being vocal and post those questions here and everyone is gonna welcome you with different opinions that could be good for your decision making.",

And you are in doubt, that whether you should have a mentor or not. I mean, in all fields of the universe, a mentor (a loyal and good one) is like a BTC to early adopters. You should find one and when you will find a good one try to refer it to other newbies too. It is not like, that hard to find a good mentor, but in the BTC sphere, you will come to face many fake mentors who will pretend like they are better than anyone else and you only need them. And in the end, they will be the first to scam you with your money in the form of huge fees. It is better to not rely on mentors fully, try to educate yourself by making your own efforts. Because spoon feeding is not going to work in the BTC era. You have to make efforts on your own. And you do have to leave your comfort zone.",

The threat is when the person or probably scammer guiding you set u up to give them things like seed phrases or keys which automatically make them co-owner of your wallet. Someone without knowledge would gladly do that even though it seems a trick that can be dictated by a pro. Better do not underestimate anything about scamming even the most knowledgeable ended getting In involved in one or two. Because as the technology advances so do they. Just like the advice at top, do your research and ask questions but stay away from people willing to help you in your PM. A genuine help would come publicly except other wise",

So to overcome them you do need a mentorBut mentors are not free, you might get answers to your 1 or 2 queries on YT or any Fb Channel in the comments but if you have more than 1 or 2 queries then you do have to buy a paid membership of some good mentor. But be careful in cryptocurrency, not every mentor is the one who they are telling you they are. You have to be smart enough to judge a good one, try to do some research on google on how to find a good mentor, and then try to search differently on Social media.",
