  "content": "It's a common story, but the story behind this \"using bitcoin for bribery\" by Chinese intelligence officers who exert schemes to get information from the US law enforcement agency may not be relevant to what I have to say. If you wish to read the complete details of the story the link is below. Moving on, I disagree with what a coindesk correspondence had to say, in this Video, about the bribery with bitcoin. One correspondence pointed out that the bribery was traced because it was issued with bitcoin and the FED should be happy that bitcoin transactions are traceable; including that those PRC intelligent officers would have gone Scot-free if the bribe was given via fiat. It's quite interesting to have such a view, but in this unsuccessful criminal occurrence, it's not relevant to take sides of which currency would have been used to avoid traces. Because I was pondering about what happened with the bribed officer. Read further and discovered that he worked as a double agent for the FBI. So he divulges every business he had with the PRC intelligence officers. Imagine that the bribery was issued surreptitiously; the GE-1, as he's referred to in the article, if he was a bad cop or kept the bribery a secret from the FBI. Would they still be any possible trace of the business behind this particular bitcoin transaction? Considering that 60k is not too large a transaction to grasp the suspicion of the FBI. Indeed, there is a ledger for every peer-to-peer transaction, but the reason behind the transaction remains the decentralization if nothing is disclosed to a third party. I know of two possible ways the FBI can trace a bitcoin transaction1. Hacking into an exchange2. If one part of the transaction reports to the FBI as the GE-1 did. Please, I'm I By any means not getting this right? is it possible to suspect a bitcoin transaction like the one above without being told or given details of what led to the transaction? https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/two-chinese-intelligence-officers-charged-obstruction-justice-scheme-bribe-us",

Chain analysis companies use all kinds of metrics to identify an address that is sent and received from several times, and they ascribe real-world names to these addresses (for example: \"Binance\" or \"Primedice\"). So they use these named addresses to see if any addresses have sent transactions to them.This data is then given to the chain analysis company customers and, in the case of law enforcement, they pour through their own secret data dumps to narrow down the possible people who have used such a service and sent the transaction there at a particular time. The more named addresses present the easier it is for law enforcement to identify you [contrary to popular belief, chain analysis companies do NOT have access to KYC dumps unless the customer specifically gives it to them, so they cannot identify you].",

      "body": "Regulations on blockchain or Bitcoin has made it easier to identify a transaction, knowing where it is coming from, where it is going and possibly who the senders and receivers are. It is possible the government agencies could track who did the transaction. Come to talk of it, this was the major reason why the government insist on kyc. So they could know and get information on transaction via third parties and otherwise. If you are talking about the FBI, we all know they are highly sophisticated with equipment and ICT gadgets under their watch. So they knowing who transacts is kit am issues. I think most third party organization on Crypto breach privacy of their customers thereby possibly allowing for details to leak to government agencies with a possible resolution to operate.  I think Third parties should try protect the identity of their clients as agreed upon. It is very dissapointing seeing people's information being leaked online as a result of negligence from Third party organization vested and trusted with clients details.",

If one part of the transaction reports to the FBI as the GE-1 did. OR 3. They could also take a look at the public ledger which Bitcoin literally operates on. How is this a regulatory achievement? I really do not understand. Anyone can trace where the Bitcoin goes and where it comes from. The only job the FBI has is waiting for the person to cash out on an exchange or do something in connection with the suspicious Bitcoin on a third party website which logs IP addresses and maybe even demands KYC and demand the host to hand over details on the suspicious account. Its really not that hard to catch the bad guys when it comes to Bitcoin. Bitcoin was never meant to be anonymous.Quote from: CryptSafe on November 02, 2022, 06:20:45 PMRegulations on blockchain or Bitcoin has made it easier to identify a transaction, knowing where it is coming from, where it is going and possibly who the senders and receivers are. Bitcoin is and always was transparent. Its based on transactions which are on a public ledger, so there really is no \"surprise\" here nor does this show any kind of evidence of effectiveness from \"regulations\". But if they want to pretend like its their achievement, then that would be a lie.",

Blockchain is open to view any transaction going there and that's why it called an open distributed ledger, but tracking the user couldn't be that easy or let say possible if he uses a decentralized exchange, but the question here is that should we be more concern that someone uses bitcoin for accepting a bribe? Have you considered how many times fiat currency had been engaged in all manners of attrocities?",

The agencies seeing this start investigating into his affairs and find the fiat transaction liked to a cryptocurrency exchange and to funds received in a certain date. The rest is just connecting the dots.In other words bitcoin is the last link they find despite the fact that in the news they mention it first.",

It does use known ports so it's not that tough.-Dave",

Coming from a country that after the fall of communism was corrupted as hell, I wouldn't really care about things 10 years after the event.The first thing that can send you to prison is to actually receive the bribe and if you don't spend it because of a guilty conscience with BTC at least you can be safe, with any other method you're in danger, bank accounts, gold, a suitcase of money, with everyone is the danger of either being traced or having been filmed when you pick it up.With the coins in your wallet, you can wait 10 years, become a grandpa trader,  buy a 5 BTC sell 7 BTC, declare all profits, and be totally legit.Oh, and since you're mentioning yachts, there is no way in hell and no bribery method that would cover something of that size, at that point you have to be the law, much like in Russia for example.",
