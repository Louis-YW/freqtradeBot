Yes, Gofundme on the blockchain, lets people raise money and take a cut, why do they need to hold the token to use this platform, I don't get it",

If i want to fund someone, first thing i am checking out would be that i am not going to be funding some token pyramid scam that's riding on the sob stories, monetizing good will and lack of technical knowledge. Without any token this would make sense. Now it just doesn't and gives signals of greedy devs trying to sell an idea for a pointless token.",
