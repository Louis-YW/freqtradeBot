Yesterday btc hit 44k which is quite bullish pattern. The biggest resistance was 38500 which was hit with strong buying pressure. Now btc is stable above 43k and I hope If it doesn't dump sharply then next target will be 48k.Quote from: Questat on December 06, 2023, 01:48:20 AMI said \"bad news' because with this recent development involving CZ and Binance, this usually bring some negative sentiment but look what's happening, the market is going on the opposite side and it kees getting bullish.

Tell me about your opinion about this....As far as I know , CZ case doesn't affected market seriously. The reason may be the ETF rumors and other good news. Indeed this news strong btc lover more because they found that Binance shutting down or any bad news about centralized exchange will not affect btc badly. Now investors are putting money without any fear which is positive sign.",

I think people get used to it already, besides, if Binance will fall, other exchange will certainly benefit, so overall there's not much effect to the market. It's just time for a bullish market, we have waited for years before it happen, so what's due is due. Just enjoy the bullish mode!",

Tell me about your opinion about this....In my personal view, the news circulating recently regarding CZ does not seem to have a big impact on bitcoin investors. Because it seems that today's bitcoin investors are smarter in making choices and stronger mentally. That's why big news doesn't have a big impact on bitcoin investors. On the contrary, the market price of bitcoin actually increased.So it can be concluded that currently the news about bitcoin does not really affect the price of Bitcoin, let alone cause the price of bitcoin to fall. However, bitcoin investors are currently more focused on the upcoming halving cycle and also on the bull market.For this reason, whatever negative news comes to the bitcoin realm, bitcoin investors will definitely be increasingly confident that the halving cycle and bull market will not be disturbed by any news.",

      "body": "There was a question raised recently as to what happens to the Bitcoin market if Binance crumbles. The billions in fine imposed on the exchange, CZ's admission of guilt, his resignation as a CEO, his temporary freedom thanks to millions in bail bond, the sudden withdrawal, and so on are probably the closest to Binance's collapse. Contrary to common view, however, it didn't cause a serious dip in the price of Bitcoin. As a matter of fact, shortly thereafter Bitcoin even reached an annual ATH. This is telling. Binance collapsing might not actually send shock waves to the market. It's not as influential as it may seem.",

That's why Bitcoin is called a volatile asset, right?It's just simple logic: a light can't have light without electricity, right? Now the question is: how does electricity work? Shouldn't it, of course, have positives and negatives? It's the same in our lives; obviously, if there is bad news, there is really good news.",

Really ready for a new start with the market.

Regardless of the news surrounding this market, I still remember to be patient with Bitcoin because I understand one thing and we will talk about big targets (new ATH) soon.",

I don't think CZ of binance is the reason the price of Bitcoin moved to this stage it is right now, because the formal CEO of binance was found guilty on some money laundering that made him to resigned from the job so that it will not affect their investors negatively.  The good news is that many bitcoiners has started selling their Bitcoin to get some money to celebrate the new year that is coming in few weeks time, and to do other things that will make them not to experience shortage of finances in their family.",

That bad news is counterbalanced by the approaching halving, the loosening of rate policies or the ever closer approval of a spot ETF in the USA, as rat03gopoh has commented. So that causal relationship that the OP makes of saying bad news (CZ and Binance) bring good news (the price rise) does not hold.",

Apart from that, soon there will be a halving phase which historically always makes Bitcoin touch a new ATH. In my opinion, blackrock and halving news is stronger in the market so the price of bitcoin continues to rise consistentlyHowever, I suspect that there will be a price correction soon, hopefully the current correction will not cause the price of bitcoin to fall below 40k, if so then the price of 50k or 60k will be reached soon. Maybe",

But the thing is that the Bitcoin investors have two visions now. First vision is the Bitcoin spot ETF and the second vision is Bitcoin halving. So they are waiting for that and therefore I think the bad news are not doing their jobs. And the holders never think about these news. They just hold hold and hold. Because they believe in Bitcoin and who believe in Bitcoin so Bitcoin gives more than their expectations.",

I mean as a bitcoin supporter we always want bad people to stay out of the network. I believe the current price increase of Bitcoin is happening due to the positivity around approval of ETFs. Blackrock is somewhat close to get the approval, they have got the seed funding. So it has created a FOMO in the market. Every such FOMO is enough to increase the buying volume in the market.",
