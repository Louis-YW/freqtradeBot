  "content": "1SPLiTKEY offers Vanity Wallet Split-key generation that's simplified for more casual users.We run on private source code that provides distributed style computing. Utilizing open-source tools like VanitySearch for key searching and bitaddress for key merging.We just laid things out in a way that's easier to navigate with less technical jargon.Learn more about how it works in depth here. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5397602We are in middle of a giant overhaul for advanced features such as multi-sig and bech32 vanity split key wallets, So its not running on a lot right now due to low demand and work being done*.With your input, we can possibly have a commercialized bulk solution. The only downfall we can think of is that this would have to be a preorder situation for vendors that use us.We will provide any new creator/vendor unpaid access to our platform. And collaborate with existing ones.Even new creators utilizing these techniques got them from this concept. As well as clearing out vanity pool on the same distributed model.      In an ironic twist ColdKey is 1SPLiTKEYS only follower on twitter since we signed up. Also, a special thanks to the members helping shape this service.",

Download the page, verify the download and run it locally*.Step 2: Click Vanity Wallet click the Generate button next to Generate your \"Step1 Key Pair\"Step 3: Reply to this thread with your public key and the prefix for your address. Save the private key somewhere safe. You will need it later when I generated your partial private key. Also, let me know if your preferred prefix is case sensitive, or any case is okay (the latter is much faster)Step 4: Once you received your partial private key, go back to bitaddress.org and click on Vanity Wallet.Step 5: Go to step 2 Calculate your vanity wallet. In the first field put the private key you saved and in the second field put the partial private key I gave you. Click Add and Calculate Vanity WalletStep 6: Copy the Vanity Private Key (WIF) and import it into your preferred wallet.Credits to shorena for most of these instructions!If something doesn't work as expected, have a look at this example.Let's say 2 highly trusted people want to make a collectible pre-funded coin. Person A does Steps 1-3, and (the red part) gives the public key to Person B.Person B creates a split-key vanity address, let's say starting with 1Safer. That creates a partial private key, which he doesn't share.Now back to the coin: Person A adds the private key, under a hologram. Person B adds the partial private key, also under a hologram. Person B also knows the address to fund/publish.The buyer, when he wants to redeem the coin, has to do Steps 5-6.The benefit: not a single person in the world knows the private key.I see 2 risks:1. Mistakes. Since nobody should access the private key, nobody knows if a mistake has been made. If so, it will be impossible to create the private key that belongs to the address.2. You can't check if Person B gave the correct address, unless you redeem the coin. Once in a while someone would have to peel a coin to verify they're not unfunded.Disclaimer: I typed this by heart, don't just trust it, verify everything!",

The main difference: this time the trust is shared by 2 creators.QuoteMy question is with regards to resales by the original buyer.  Can a second party verify that whatever information will be needed from the original buyer will work?No. Just like the first buyer can't verify it, the second buyer can't verify it either.

      "body": "@LoyceV I re-read your post. creator could have all data provided by the customer. pubkeycreator then generates wallet, now they have wallet address and the half the 1/2 privkey under holo.but that one key half that the client keeps is your chain of logistics. A COA if you will. If you want to auth, you have to destroy it the coin's holo.  There would be no point in keeping a key as it would be a stalemate like multi-sig escrow situations.The \"paper\" key half and the intact coin with the wallet visible and the other half the key under the holo from OEM. The only way bad acting can occur is if OEM/issuer got coin in hands again with a COA original purchaser issued and resold it. (They have seen the \"COA\" now and have the other half of the key or possibility of having them stashed away)Then an intercept scenario could occur so a situation such as this should just be treated as a zero day of the right off the rip, just like it should be now and isnt. So with that being said, this creates a new layer of security at least from OEM issuer fraud in bulk scenarios. This isn't a new or foreign concept at all, it's called the \"Idea Attribution Effect\" or \"Sender-Receiver Effect\". 40mm x 3mm 30g Bitcoin Coin (loadable and customizable coin)Truth is @Willi9974 is the only one that's done anything like it. When I saw Willi doing this, I immediately reached out to him to offer our services as we were already doing them since 2019.",

Keep in mind my service wasn't exactly designed with creators in mind, these where going to be offline batch jobs in the initial proposal.\"We are offering a maker vouch of batch splitkey wallets up to 7 digits(or less) & 100 wallets(or less)this vouch is contingent an endorsement of our service and an agreement of difficulty/prefix.We highly recommend maker submit 1 pub-key per wallet in this vouch offer.\"a casual user has no reason for concern, but I understand the viewpoints a creator would have. however, our tos states what our service really is a handler for vanitysearch and a modified bitaddress.org anyone can do this without using my service. As stated though with input we can make it happen.this won't prevent bad acting by any means.but it will prevent full rug sweeps at a much better success rate.if some creators utilize this on top of their already stellar reputation it shouldnt matter even if they got 20 of their original coins back in hand.the originator having something they issued and seeing the key isn't a bad thing if they've destroyed the keys all along. But should be viewed from the same current viewpoint as they possibly have the keys anyways.*edit maybe a chain of command and if it ends up back in creators hands its flagged as possibly exposed.keep in mind, my product isnt designed for a circulating system. its designed for one person and one person only. the endpoint user.air gapping custom jobs solves data concerns on distributed coin models.",
