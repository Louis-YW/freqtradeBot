This would be possible if BTC has been evenly distributed or held by people. Whales hold most of the BTC which makes it an ideal asset to manipulate the markets when most of retails investors failed to hold it for long because of their impatience nature.",

But what I do know is that USD and the currencies of oher big economies is concentrated in the hands of billionaires and billion-dolar companies (that's why we call them that), while the masses may have $100, $1000, $10K or perhaps $100K if they are lucky.These economies are run on credit which is basically implying spending money that you do not have in the bank. It creates conditions equivalent to the concentration of money into the hands of few, similar to the economy of cryptocurrencies.",

As long as users and price keep maintaining infection point at interval prices will never stabilize. Bitcoin is already a big shock to the society as such it is almost too late to start a gradual introduction because many who were misinformed has the mindset that bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme. If altcoins that fails to stabilize disappears the chances of recording more suicidal case might be on the increase.",

On the other hand, most of those who are interested in Bitcoin for speculative reasons want as much volatility as possible because that is how they can make a profit.There are opinions that this volatility will decrease in the future, but I believe that we can never completely eliminate it because there will always be those who can influence it. An open market will always allow someone to buy or sell large amounts of Bitcoins and thus affect the price.Quote from: NotATether on July 02, 2022, 11:49:50 AMThe rest of the altcoins that do not stabilize can disappear (e.g. xxx), I have no pity for them as they only serve to give larger cryptocurrencies (and crypto in general) a bad name in the news.That market will always be profitable for some (those who sell ideas about better cryptocurrencies) and for those few who know how to use it - but of course it will generally cause more harm than good, as you say. We cannot say how much the last scandal with stablecoins contributed to the current situation, but there is no doubt that it once again cast a negative light on Bitcoin.",

Also, it'll be hard to control the stability of BTC price as it is decentralized and the market has been held by various holders that tons of bitcoins or whales. Another aspect that we will need look into is the limit of bitcoin as we still haven't reached the limit of bitcoin to be mined. But yes, in case volatility will be erased or removed from Bitcoin, surely more people and association will incorporate bitcoin and crypto payment on their platform or company. By then, we can proudly say that bitcoin (without any doubt by other people) is a currency.",

One is that fiat has an authority that can manage it, whereas Bitcoin is and will most likely remain under nobody's control. So how can we make the price more stable, or do you believe it will get there on its own? The second point is about introducing Bitcoin in stages. Again, something like a big company getting involved with Bitcoin happens, the media spread the news, people find out about Bitcoin and some get interested. It's not a process which is under control. Nevertheless, it seems to me that in practice Bitcoin is sort of being introduced at stages this way, but it does nothing to help stabilize the price.",

People who want to try their luck and have enough courage to take risk comes to the BTC market. Though 90% failed to gain from BTC markets but the massive gain of the remaining 10% people attract more investor to this market. People only see the success story.If BTC wants to be the primary method of business transaction then it needs to be stabilized. Without stability, BTC will not be appropriate for mass adoption because it will be very risky and unsustainable for the economy. I really doubt that BTC will take the place of fiat though I believe fiat will be replaced in the future by some unknown assets. It could be something like BTC but not BTC itself. I think that way because the world will never see a decentralized powered community and as long as there is some sort of central authority they will try to control the economy by showing people how decentralization could lead us to a lawless society.",

You know, bitcoin have got a pot of work to do on itself and that I partly what the volatility part is helping it to archive at this day stage. It's It's a decade already and would seem like a long time but given the years ahead, it's only normal to think of it to have just begun.Waht we ought to realise is that, bitcoin was supposed to serve as a currency of the web and this purpose would be surely archived universally when the time is due. Its stability would be a very good place to start bit before that comes, it's got volatility to ensure users jump on the train and gets to understand I a lot more.I once came across a meme about the fiat dollar that carried the caption, where we've been and where we are now. From what was understood, $1 had it's equivalent value in gold stored away but now, the $ has become the world reserve currency and needs no gold backings. That's the point bitcoin would get to the the future. Lest just enjoy the carriage as it goes.",
