You are not alone mate. A lot of us are really struggling to cope up with this inflation. However, my only advice is that if you can get more job to support you, then do it now so you can also gain addition source of income. That way, you will never be affected that much because you still make your ends meet despite of the high prices of basic goods and necessities. Also, investing in bitcoin will do a lot of help in the future. So take some risk and put some minimal amount into bitcoin. Once your investment works, then inflation will never be that hard anymore.",

I see where you're coming from, good thing for you cause you have savings to use when times get rough compared to most people out there raw-dogging life without any form of safety net against this dangerously expensive world. But no point in pointing fingers about who's got it worse cause in my opinion, we all share the same problem, we just feel it differently. Getting off to a tangent here but what I'm trying to say is that, what I did to help save myself from the underlying dangers that inflation would cause to my savings is well, save in other forms of assets. For instance, a lot of us here had put up their savings into cryptocurrencies and precious metals like gold and silver. I myself did that to avoid impermanent loss. Some of us went all-in on investing and ditched the savings part to maximize profits (which I will not suggest unless you're a baller and you have enough money lying around to help you when times get rough). But all in all, it's more than enough sometimes that you're saving.",

I should say inflation is here to stay. We can somehow reduced or minimize it but we can’t totally make it vanish in the thin air. So if you won’t do nothing about it, then you will forever be living your life struggling with your finances. That’s why bitcoin is here, not to completely free us from inflation, but to somehow deal inflation like it can’t totally affect our lives. With bitcoin, the price is not controlled by the government or any third party, so expect that it’s price will only depend on its supply and demand, and not because it will also surge high since everything around have turned very costly and expensive.",

For the advanced countries the effect of the inflation could be mild on them when compared to those of the third world or developing countries of the south pole. Just like OP made mentioned of IMF and World bank coming to the aide of the world inflation crisis. But if I may ask, who almakes up this IMF? Where are they located? All answers leads to the West. If the American economy is doing great with prices of foodstuffs not rising anymore, different from what is currently in other parts of the world then for me it doesn't come as a surprise as the economic conditions ain't the same from what is obtained outside.All I can say to OP is to diversify into other means of income that's the only route to beating this inflation mess. Plan and curtail your expenses. Luckily for you, you have idea of bitcoin so invest more on bitcoin with your savings rather than it laying dormant in one bank account with no annual profit at the end of the year. Don't put your hopes on IMF or the world bank...... No one is coming to save you but you.",

In recent weeks the price of tomatoes have levelled the price of apple. How good is this, because tomatoes will be used regularly whereas very few prefer to take apple finding it to be expensive. This is how the inflation and surely the food inflation is at its peak and we can't just pass on limiting our spending for food.

Its true that there's really that consumers protection but we cant really tell that they are useless considering that control of market prices is really that their job and if ever the prices turns out to be higher then there's no stopping of it because it would really be basing up on the supply and demand things plus on other factors on which it would really be that resulting into those price increase. Better not to make yourself that mindful about those things and it would be better if you do focus yourself on having more incomesource so that despite of the worsening situation about inflation but since you could financially be able to sustain yourself because of other income source on which this is where you should really be focusing on into.",

If you rely on the World Bank and IMF to help you fight inflation, then you will be highly disappointed. These agencies want your country to keep going through financial problems so that your government can come and get oppressive loans with throat-cutting interests. If you want to overcome inflation, these are my suggestions.1. Don't save money in banks because it will gradually become worthless2. Invest your savings is a profitable venture3. Aquire a new skill and get a side job4. If you can, start a business5. Cut your expenses by avoiding wasteful expenses.",

Well, if it is said that the Ukrainian and Russian Crisis are the causes of global inflation with the crisis and gas supply shortages in Europe and other countries, of course it is not the dominant one. We need to know that inflation can be caused by factors such as demand growth that is faster than supply, rising production costs, currency devaluation and wage increases. That's in addition to the things I have mentioned above.Well, the impact of inflation certainly cannot be averaged on all income groups. For example, in some cases we often find in the market where the price of certain goods can increase faster than the price of services. What does it mean? It means the rate of inflation a person faces depends on what they buy, where they live, and where they shop.Yes. We are invited to think about getting through a period of high inflation. There are steps that can be taken to deal with inflation and can help reduce the negative effects of inflation Such as taking part time jobs to Increase Income, reduce unnecessary expenses, or whose prices are rising due to inflation, and most importantly make a realistic budget and follow disciplined financial plan. That's all if done well it will be easy to fight it.",

The whole story is not just clear, as to why inflation is biting so hard and IMF AND WORLD BANK are not doing anything about it and the people are just left to face their fate alone.The prices of goods and services are constantly going astronomical high and there is no hope insight of this ugly situation coming to a halt.The purchasing powers of citizens are getting weak and I don't understand if the consumer protection laws are even effective anymore this days.You buy something for a certain amount today, in the next one week, that same item you bought  has charged Prince without any reason.How are you guys pulling it through with this inflation?Very biting and felt, especially for people who are middle to lower income. Well, if it is said that the Ukrainian and Russian Crisis are the causes of global inflation with the crisis and gas supply shortages in Europe and other countries, of course it is not the dominant one. We need to know that inflation can be caused by factors such as demand growth that is faster than supply, rising production costs, currency devaluation and wage increases. That's in addition to the things I have mentioned above.Well, the impact of inflation certainly cannot be averaged on all income groups. For example, in some cases we often find in the market where the price of certain goods can increase faster than the price of services. What does it mean? It means the rate of inflation a person faces depends on what they buy, where they live, and where they shop.Yes. We are invited to think about getting through a period of high inflation. There are steps that can be taken to deal with inflation and can help reduce the negative effects of inflation Such as taking part time jobs to Increase Income, reduce unnecessary expenses, or whose prices are rising due to inflation, and most importantly make a realistic budget and follow disciplined financial plan. That's all if done well it will be easy to fight it.I agree with what you stated. Although inflation is truly present, the impact it holds on us are seen and felt in different levels depending on our unique situations and economic capacity. Moreover, we also view and face each situations differently and it affects the way we take each step against the negative effects of inflation in our lives.",
