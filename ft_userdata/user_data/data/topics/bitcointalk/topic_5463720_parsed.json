Let me start from there.The name \"Double your money\" It sounds like a Ponzi scheme to me, as they are the ones who usually use that language to lure in those who are in search of get rich quick means.Your casino happens to have a wallet connect option only, which means it's web3, and you expect people to just connect their wallet to a new website with no trust record, no public feedback, and all of that, so the money wager is not just going to be the only thing at stake, but the entire connected wallet balance is also at risk, as no one knows what details your dapp could be able to extract from my wallet if I eventually connect it.",

Is this for real? I cannot process this because I am unsure if we will end up revealing the seed when we connect web3 applications and our wallets. Just being curious I did search about the risks of connecting to the web3 application and I got shocking results too. But I am more or less disappointed that why such a nice casino has to go down because of the few bad examples. I am not supporting anything here but it's disgraceful to see how these new-generation applications are not strong at their security. QuoteRisks and Problems of Current Authentication SystemsUsernames, passwords, emails, and other sensitive personal information are usually stored on centralized systems that are often at risk of hackers attempting to steal user information all at once.Personal data is often controlled, collected, and shared with other parties without people’s knowledge.It’s difficult for people to manage and remember so many passwords, which creates a bad user experience.One of the main risks of logging in with social media accounts like Facebook and Google (single sign-on) is if a single charge is compromised, the attacker can then gain access to all of the applications and data associated with that account. In 2018, a Facebook security breach exposed the accounts of 50 million users. SourceHowever, if someone can vouch after playing it safe then it should be able to increase the awareness of your casino. Otherwise, this is cruel to let go of such a nice casino. I did check the website, it looks way simple game to play but as per the rule we should always look after safety first and that is why I am now one step back until a positive review comes.",

No, it's not possible for a malicious actor to get your seed or private key of your wallet simply by connecting the wallet to a Web3 Dapp. At least, as far as I know, that hasn't happened yet. If it did, that would be a mega screw-up in the whole smart contract world. There is a potential scenario where connecting your wallet to a Dapp could put your funds at risk if you're not cautious. If you approve a transaction that you shouldn't, there's a chance that the Dapp could steal your wallet's funds. I believe this is biggest security risk, but it mainly depends on folks not paying attention and being a bit clueless.By the way, your quote has nothing to do with Web3 or Dapps.",
