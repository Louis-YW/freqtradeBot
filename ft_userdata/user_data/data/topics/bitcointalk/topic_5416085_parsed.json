  "content": "Preamble:I decided to make this compilation of my important threads which were created to teach, educate, warn or guide newbies in the forum. The guides are also important for established members, but the tone and language of the threads were chosen with newbies and lower-ranked members in mind.I therefore decided to make this thread to enable easy bumping and update when necessary. All the threads and information therein are my personal observations and opinions which were gathered right in this forum. Wherever people's opinions were used, they were rightly cited or acknowledged. Learning is continuous and this forum is an embodiment of knowledge, that is my great conviction to continue producing threads of this nature.Thank you all.Thread TittleDate CreatedMotivation_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________1.What is a Quality Post.10th Nov, 2022Newbies who wants to succeed in the forum knows that the best way to do so is producing quality posts, but they don't know what a quality post is.2.Why some promising newbies fail in the forum.21st April, 2022When I could no longer see some newbies that started with me brilliantly.3.Identity Security: A Newbies' Priority.6th February, 2022After the forum taught me the disadvantages of KYC, but then I had already given my data to scammers4.Some avoidable forum mistakes of Newbies.4th January, 2022If Members are banned, they will return to appeal claiming ignorance of the Rules and Newbie Mistakes5.Why people plagiarise in the forum and how to avoid plagiarism.1st August, 2021During this period there was much cases of plagiarism which made so many accounts to be banned6.How to announce yourself as a Newbie!14th July, 2021After I was given a nasty welcome to the forum as a newbie.

It is -- infact, without any further hesitation -- very imperative to know that these great, structural software development was built on a certain VALUE ; which has been edified over the years to -- rather waiting for us to fit in -- have fit-in massively in our lives, the second generation and rest to follow suit.I expect everyone to atleast, understand that this value is possibly the reason why our great forum stand up to this day. Therefore, anyone who'd determine to make some progressions -- cognitively or otherwise -- Should bare in mind that the value to which the system was built needs to be MAINTAINED. Furthermore, I'd also encourage users to also try supporting the forum to grow, not just earning from it.Theymos is trying his best; I understand that this site ain't 100% safe as we are being attacked from time to time so I'm not minusing totally, it percentage of vulnerability. Some peeps don't even care --so long as they can log on to their account, they're justified. But ,is that JUSTIFIABLE?? These days,I understand that we don't even have alot of Noble thinkers, ones that could recreate things in favour of  our little world let alone brainstormers that can take upon themselves to educate, introduce, advertise or atleast creat a new sense of perception from their daily Post for all I care. That's why I'm happy for the op cus he just realized there's alot more to be done.Cheers,Sandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

The irony of it, is that you can meet such a post when your are not in the mood to spend enough time in the forum, maybe just to have a glance.Exactly! It's not the case for me but some Merit sources had some of their monthly allocation reduced when they didn't spend much because of vacations or other reasons. That's also why theymos once made a statement to allocate rather 50 Merit for a very good post in such cases: Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMQuote from: bones261 on October 20, 2018, 02:01:14 PMWell, it appears that your source merit either wasn't upped to 250 a month ago like me, or you are just letting it expire. Theymos gave me instructions to try and do my best to distribute all of it. I'm doing the best that I can; yet have already had complaints. I really despise this statistic. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=merit;stats=topsendban Now I am on the list that appears to point out merit abuse suspects. I was originally very honored to become a merit source. But now I feel that my reputation is at stake with every single merit that I am obligated to distribute. I know that I only have black trust at the moment. However, I keep checking my trust rating to make sure some DT member doesn't decide to red tag me because they feel that I am being \"abusive\" or derelict in my duty.If they complain about amounts, tell them to complain to me. It's best if sources try to exhaust their source allocations, even if it means giving posts higher amounts than is typical. If you have 150 source merit and you only see 3 merit-worthy posts in a month, then I'd rather you over-give each of them 50 merit than let the merit expire. That way there are more people capable of sending merit, and the \"merit economy\" is less top-down.If a DT member tags you for something stupid involving merit (ie. probably anything less than selling merit), then they're not going to be a DT member for much longer.Aside from that, if people complain about whether things deserve merit at all, then that's something to perhaps think about, but if you conclude that they're wrong, then that's that. You don't need to stress about it or defend yourself constantly. It's conceivable that someday you and I will end up disagreeing too much about this stuff and I'll remove your source status, but it's really not a big deal.The topsendban list is just a first indication of abuse, and many excellent people are on it. Your place on there acts as a sort of benchmark: eg. chandra12 has a similar score there, but whereas you are an extremely active merit-giver with a diverse selection of posts merited (most of which anyone would agree with), chandra12 only has two large merit sends. His behavior in comparison to yours while having a similar topsendban score is what creates a strong abuse impression.I appreciate the work of you and other sources who take it seriously! A very bold statement but it's understandable what's theymos said.",
