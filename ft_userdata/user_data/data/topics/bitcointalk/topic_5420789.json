Even if the source was verified, it should still be read with a high degree of skepticism.Furthermore, the bear is a part of the market cycle as much as the bull is. If an account only makes bullish prediction and posts, they have little substance to offer.- Jay -",

Heck it even had paid advertisement in the past.So what I'm saying is that don't take the account seriously.",

Even an account with a check mark that is an official account can't necessarily be trusted. So it's better to always check again regarding the news being spread, don't just look at it from one media, but compare it from all media so that the news can be more valid.",

There are no official Bitcoin twitter account. Doesn't matter who has accessed to the account2. It has been trolling ever since, from becoming a Bitcoin Cash proponent 3. Obviously, someone is trolling behind that account for many years now, not to be trusted",

Most of them short bitcoin when the drop ended. So in order to make any profit and not lose money they have to see bitcoin price drop more. But as we can see the drop stopped just as fast as it started so now these people are caught with their pants down...",

Does a serious investor close deals or invest in something through that platform or is it just one of the platforms that has become a haven for scammers and various political agendas that the new leader of that platform seems to support? As for the account that spreads fake news and leads people astray, it should have been removed a long time ago, but that doesn't seem too important to anyone. People who believe everything they see and read or hear are a much bigger problem - especially those who think that Bitcoin has its own Twitter account and its own bank",

The account isn't saying get ready because bitcoin is going down but rather asking what do you think about it, could it be that bad. I wouldn't take anything you see on twitter or youtube too seriously. I held my coins at the covid crash to 3k and I held them when we broke 60k. A few scammers like Do Kwon and SBF weeded out of the system is really a good thing for bitcoin. Would you rather it happened now or in 2 years when we're about to hit a new high and then everything crashes and we go from a bear market recovery back into a bear market for another year or so?",
