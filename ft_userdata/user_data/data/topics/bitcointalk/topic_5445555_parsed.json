There is a thread here on betting for the 2024 United States election, and another one for the Oscars. I have seen people bet on movie characters and all sorts of things. This is not to say that they are addicted to gambling. I think we do it for fun, as a form of socializing. While thinking about it today, I wondered what the strangest bet I had ever had was. I remembered having a bet with my brother that he would give me $80 if I could eat 5 packs of 200g of instant noodles in less than 5 minutes, and if I couldn't, I would give him $90.

What is the strangest bet you have ever had?Luckily I have not done any strange bets as I don't seem to remember having done such bet.I am a conservative in almost everything that I do and as such mostly I play sport bets or slot machines but luckily I don't feel anymore the urge to keep playing slot machines anymore as there is no point,you can't become rich with them while I think with sport betting if done consistently and not with obsession you can make a nice decent amount of extra money every month,this is only my theory though which in practice has not come true  .Some people have bet that they will eat sh*t of someone else if they lost what they called a sure bet,but that is clearly disgusting and I don't think I can call these species human beings,humanity has done a lot of stupid things unfortunately.",

In short, my friend and I are betting to get 1 woman, or competing to date the same 1 woman. Yes, at that time my friend and I made a bet on who could get it first, then the first date, all costs were borne by the loser. Maybe many people experience this kind of experience, but for me personally this kind of thing seems quite taboo and I consider it a strange bet that I make.Honestly I'm sorry, my regret is because I feel it played on the woman's feelings.",

She told me that if i can keep a 20€ in my fist and she can open it just by talking she could get the 20, if i managed to keep my fist closed she would give me 20. So that was a no brainer, i won't just open my hand and get free 20. And i guess i was drunk because immediately she told me that this won't count, i need to have my thumb outside the fist, and i opened my fist to take it out and she took the 20.I felt like a moron so i guess i deserved it.",

There are people who have put money on the European championship in 2004, that Greece would win it. Greece was then seen as one of the weakest teams in the European Championship, but in the end they won the tournament. Someone sold his house and bet everything on Greece winning. He probably bought the whole street with his money afterwards. But that was a success story, there are also people who have experienced the downside with betting on odds of 1.01 who went completely wrong and placed a bet of $100,000 or more. That's how it can go.",

I've got crazy experiences about it and I just realized that it was strange since the adults that has been with us have tolerated everything and it was a different norm way back then when we were younger. But now, as an adult, I wouldn't teach kids to gamble for physical fights even if it's for fun since kids shouldn't hurt each other whether it's made with prizes or giveaways.",

What is the strangest bet you have ever had?No doubt, the gambling industry is not static, and as such adapts to new threads & innovations that has great investment potential and a very good source of fun/entertainment.So in regards to the question you just ask about what is the strangest bet I have ever had? I will likely say that for now, I just can't remember any, but their was ones I manage to see few weeks ago about a content creator on the street asking people if only they can finish a full 75cl of bottle water in 6 seconds, he will give the person #10,000 naira (local currency) equivalent to $15, and until I left nobody was able to finish the water within that short period of time, just as shown in the picture below which I got from google.Photo credit: Google.com",

So it's a winner take all kind of betting, hehehehe. Just bring back my childhood memories. And another as what @blockman said, Do you have experience betting in a spider fight? or In my town there are ants that only appear once a year and it is common for children to capture one and start a fight against others ants. Or this kind of game maybe as the OP says it's a pre WWII game, Historical Street Gambling Game.",
