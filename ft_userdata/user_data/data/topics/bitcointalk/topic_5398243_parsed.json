  "content": "As the old MLB discussion thread is already dead now while the new season already start after the long delay due to lockout[INFO] issue. I just want to start a new topic to share and discuss on what's going on MLB and we can help each other to choose what's the best pick for all the upcoming match. I do regular bet on some of my favorite teams but I don't have enough knowledge on other teams that's why I started this thread.Current World Series Depending  Champion: Atlanta BravesStandings",

      "body": "On an observational level, I suspect games in the NFL and NBA are closer in the post COVID era than they were pre COVID.If this trend holds true for MLB I might take the under point spread. Another observation is games on holidays hit the total points over.But I will have to observe the progress of games and see which direction trends are headed before committing. I normally bet on MMA. But there have been so many controversial judging calls in 2022. That its nearly impossible to turn a profit.",

My interest is usually reserved for Spring Training as I live near quite a few stadiums. The Savanna Bananas are also gaining my attention…I was shocked to hear the Oakland A’s are moving to Vegas though. Another blow for the Bay Area in my opinion.",

The 50/50 club meaning he hit 50 home runs and stole 50 bases. Making it even more impressive, he is a pitcher that accomplished this feat while recovering from Tommy John surgery. Nobody on this forum is talking about it…",

The 50/50 club meaning he hit 50 home runs and stole 50 bases. Making it even more impressive, he is a pitcher that accomplished this feat while recovering from Tommy John surgery. Nobody on this forum is talking about it…I was hoping I could find a topic on this.  Isn't this shit crazy. Ohtani just had the single greatest baseball game ever (arguably) going 6-6, 10 RBI, 3 HR's and 2 SBs in route to becoming the first 50/50 player.  Did you see the attendance at LoanDepot (lol, I had to google what the name of the stadium was)..it seemed to be at best, 40-50% capacity, maybe? ESPN headline \"WNBA-record crowd sees Clark, Fever drop season finale to Mystics\" , Jets played the Pats, are relatively boring game..in NFL discord chats I didn't see any MLB talk.I remember how captivating the 90's HR Race was each night with Griff/Bonds/Sosa, then Sosa/Bonds.  Cal Ripken breaking the all time consecutive games played streak, etc etc. Seems like most could give a shit.  I grew up on baseball so I'll always care to an extent, but I didn't watch live.  Pretty sad.  Fred needs to go already.  This is just proof MLB needs an overhaul.  Move to a 100 game season and 100% electronic strike-zone for starters.  I use to be a purist but anymore, I just want the game to evolve.  I should have been placing bets on things like what game he'd break it, what inning he'd do it in, and all the countless fun props that were likely out there.  I wish I cared more. Anyways, some incredible stuff.  Too bad he had to take a year off pitching..though not sure this would have happened",
