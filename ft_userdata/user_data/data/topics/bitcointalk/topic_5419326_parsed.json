Those users will probably delete the requested data , but it is very hard to get privacy online and to \"unsend\" information is basically impossible. Other people maybe de scrapping, there are  web archives, etc...Even when you send a document to an email or an exchange that data could be leaked/hacked/sold etc.Be careful with everything you write or send online",

I don't care about IP addresses, but if you don't want me to know your IP address, by all means: use Tor browser. My site doesn't even ask to solve a Captcha.The different webhosts I use can probably no doubt access the data too.I've granted most removal requests, but rejected some too when I didn't think it's necessary. I like my data integrity, which I've posted about around this post. For full transparency, I post all censoring in my topic.If you mistakenly post private data, you should consider it compromised. Ninjastic.space and loyce.club are the most known scrapers here on Bitcointalk, but that's only because we're open about it. It's safe to assume there are other people (or organisations, or governments) that do the same, and you can't even ask them to remove data. You can probably test this by posting a funded private key (NO REALLY DON'T!), and delete the post as fast as you can. Chances are your funds get stolen.\"Generic\" archiving sites store pages too.I don't scrape Investigations (and other non-public boards, but I don't have access to those anyway).There's only one way to make sure data doesn't leak: keep it offline.",

They may (I assume though TryNinja said they don't) have the IP logs but that wouldn't do much harm if I'm correct since they wouldn't be able to know which IP is owned by who. Anyway, it's still safe to use TOR if you are concerned about your privacy regardless of what TryNinja and LoyceV said.Though it's beneficial for forum's investigators (I can't see any other use), I always have seen scraping addresses isn't a good idea.

But scraping addresses isn't a good idea as I said. It doesn't help a lot to the forum. I don't know if it's helpful to others or not as I don't see a lot of benefits there. It only helps forum polices lol. But in general, scraping isn't that bad.People must not post stuff on the internet but there's bad days. Some may mistakenly post their address or anything private.

They need to trust CloudFlare not to log and misuse their data.Lol. Good luck with that:Quote from: theymos on November 29, 2017, 11:35:34 PMCloudflare can see your unencrypted password when you log in. It's still encrypted from the real server to Cloudflare and from Cloudflare to you. So it's not blatantly insecure except in that Cloudflare is very probably an NSA honeypot, and it's not like the NSA is going to steal your password in order to scam people on bitcointalk.org or anything.Quote from: examplens on November 04, 2022, 04:34:50 PMan accident can always happen, especially confusion when copying/pasting an address vs. a private key. once in a thousand times, but it happens.What can I say, it happens:Quote from: LoyceV on April 18, 2019, 11:17:39 AMIn June, 2016, I accidentally copied the private key for 1foreverDArUNEX2gVD26vautcx3b8zTZ in my Google search bar. That's been bugging me ever since.~I've downloaded my data from Google, and it confirms Google still knows the private key.

Maybe you remember theymos' April Fool's joke from a few years ago when he created a thread to inform people they need to pass KYC to stay on the forum. There were some users who posted selfies and screenshots of their IDs in that thread. This is the thread I am talking about: KYC now required.
