If you compare that with Bisq for example, Bisq generates a seed that you need to make a backup of like an ordinary non-custodial wallet. Those coins are yours until they get deposited in an escrow address and become part of a trade between you and a different party.Â  Various scams take place on Binance with people unfamiliar with this way of trading. The most common one is tricking the BTC seller into believing that the fiat was deposited into their account with fake messages. You should always check this yourself by looking at the balance of your bank account and not rely on what the other party is saying. The crypto must only be released after you have checked and ensured the fiat was transferred properly and fully. It's recommended to trade only with users who have merchant marks and a decent history of successful trades and not with random newbies with no trading history.",

No.P2P is a feature on most exchanges which allows people to trade directly with another party, without having to put up a sell it buy order and wait for it be taken or buy at the market value, where the exchange would match them up with a seller or buyer.Decentralized and Centralized platforms alike can have a P2P system, the difference is that in a DEX, they do not hold your funds and you would be trading directly from your personal wallet to the buyers address. This is not the case in a CEX where you need to find an address which is owned by the exchange and then trade directly from their with another peer.",

They keep track record of your transactions and can always put restrictions on your funds as you are using their platform in P2P trade as well and your account will be credited/debited based on that but who has keys to that input?

Same thing happens in remitano; where they connect a buyer or seller upon already created ads to either buy or sell (that's invariably P2P right?)?

In addition to all the above users has said, centralized exchange in trying to keep their customers on their platforms had to introduce some decentralized feature that made people fall in love with decentralized exchange. This was around when there was hype for decentralized finance. Them introducing this feature like instant swapping, P2P etc doesn't make them decentralized in any way since they're still been ran on centralized serve and still needs the permission of the centralized exchange to function. Centralized service providers will always want to say in control so they'll do anything possible in achieving that even though it result to deceiving their customers so bewared. One way to distinguish between a centralized and decentralized platforms is when you're not in control of your private key which means you don't own those coins that you think you do and who ever owns the private key decide when you can carryout transactions with your coins.",
