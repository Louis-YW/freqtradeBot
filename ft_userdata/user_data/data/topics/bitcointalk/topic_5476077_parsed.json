You will be able to differentiate those boards from off-topic board when you also visit the threads on off-topic board. Off-topic board is just a single board among the boards on English boards.",

Op and if I may understand you, you are trying to say that, the topic owners should make things easy for you to understand because you are Newbie. You are welcome with another form. I am saying this because your topic e no dey like a newbie. Off Topics discussions should not confused you because they are talking about something that not inline with the core mandate of the forum, board and the thread. And in other words out of points discussions and just like this one. And all you have to do first is that you have to read more on the posts of others so from there you can learn more about the forum and others. Or you have to write purely in pidgin English and from there you can learn gradually.",

Because from the starting of the thread and the bottom, I did not see anything interesting.However, op you should learn how to make good post instead of posting trash, my last advise to you is just for you to learn from others of creating trashy posts.Quote from: Kelward on November 30, 2023, 04:58:43 PMI think say na only dis our board di OP de try talk about, and from my understanding of wetin im de try explain be say na of topic posts plenty pass for our board.

The topics you view as off-topic are actually not off-topic because, if you look closely, the forum has separate boards for politics, gambling, economics, and mining, etc. Our local board does not have anything similar, that is why different topics appear here every day. This board serves as a subboard of the main board, anything that occurs on the main board can also occur here. The local board's goal is to bring individuals from the same nation together through the use of their native tongue because not everyone understands English, which is why local boards allow people to communicate in their native tongue. There isn't a single Nigerian who doesn't understand pidgin, as it is our native tongue on this board.If you are familiar with forums as I do, you will notice that there are numerous local boards, such as those for Arabia, Russia, India, and other countries, and that when you visit those boards, people are communicating in their native tongue. Therefore, as a fellow novice, I will advise you to visit bitcoin discussion, beginners and help, gambling, and other sections if you're really ready to learn about bitcoin. You will even receive materials there that you can use to quickly learn about bitcoin.You can read and ask reasonable questions there.",
