  "content": "Hey guys.I have 4 ebang 9.2 miners with latest original firmware version ( v7.3.28 )All of them restart every 26 hours frequently I have checked any option in firmware but didn’t find anything about restart frequently every xxx hours .I also use latest version of Hive Asic hub ( v1.6 ) for monitoring them too. I have checked all things in Hive asic hub too and didn’t find anything about frequently restart every xxx hours too.I use ebit mini tool for managing machines too. I think something is wrong in firmware because all of 4 machines have same problem.Does anyone have any idea about my problem ?Regards.",

      "body": "Would you mind to try reset the miner by holding any of these button reset/IP report button I don't know what exactly ebang 9.2 looks like but try to check if there are two buttons IP/reset button and hold it for 15 or 20 seconds then release if the miner restarts automatically it a success but if not manually replug it from the power source.Then setup your pool again and test. Would you mind also tell us if what pool do you mine?Or I think contact Ebang support they have skype chat support here check theseQuoteskype: ivy@ebang.com.cnskype: lynnnesnayskype: tammyni03",
