If the application is that good, why don't you gamble yourself with it and earn money?2. Why you don't find some reputed members willing to test your app with their own money and review it?

You want to sell your strategy/script?I go for the second option, he wants to sell his strategy script that may lead to nothing but losses. Quote from: Wapfika on June 21, 2022, 05:05:39 AMTake a loan on the bank or used your salary as an initial bankroll then play for yourself. I don't understand the need of selling it while you can benefit from it for yourself if that script is really working? I will not recommend him to take a loan because it is against the rules of gambling, not even about taking loan alone, but also about not using the amount you can not afford to lose. But I will also say that he should benefit from it himself, if selling it, only a fool will buy it.",

It's just some likely scenario following some stipulated calculations that is likely not to agree with which ever casino you might be playing on or even did your simulation.Haven't seen that script, I supposedly you would want to get some attention and possible get to sell it as Apocollapse and Yahoo62278 have rightly stated. To those who might be willing to fall into such unrealistic speculation, I've got 2 questions for you to ponder on.1. What is your fall back strategy on your funds should the script go erong?2. Screenshot isn't of any real funds attempt and win bet but a simulation so, why go live on what OP haven't gone live on?Be cautious and save yourself some good, hard earned money!",

I do not know if your simulation takes the house edge into account, but even if it does, it is not a guarantee that the real bets will go the same way. Anyway, if you are confident in your \"strategy\", then what is the problem? Take 10,000 sats to start with and turn it into 0.18 BTC in one go. Then take your 0.18 BTC and turn it into ~320 BTC in the second go. You will be a millionaire in no time!",

I'm really, really curious as to why you didn't do that? it doesn't make any sense for you to come and show us results of a simulation.man we all know how this simulation data is not reliable data, you have already seen for example in the case of demo accounts for trading, right? try trading with demo account and then with real account, you will see that things are different",

Yes, what's the need of promoting the script. Op himself can make himself Super rich. No need of playing with huge bankroll. According to the script he can make a decent profit with few dollars. Slowly can multiply the profit made out of it. Maybe if he can prove himself the same through a casino, then it is perfect to promote his script. By then he won't do that???",
