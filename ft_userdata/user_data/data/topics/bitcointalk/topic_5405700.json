  "content": "Just few minutes ago I noticed this factoid.  I felt disappointed. It has not stop there, I see a link for a cloud hosting called crowncloud.net with other factoid. It looked odd to me.NastyFans - The UNOFFICIAL Nasty Mining Fan ClubVPN's and Cloud Backups made simple. crowncloud.netIn my opinion this is not a place to advertise any third party organization. But I understand, as admin theymos have full control over anything he wants.Maybe this is completely fine but I felt disappointed because I was thinking this place is only about bitcoin facts, quotes from legends about bitcoin and the legendary forum.PS: No bad intention for NastyFans and the Crowncloud. Also no hurt feeling personally to theymos. It's how I considered the fatoid space should be used.",

The ad info page states:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/adrotate.php?adinfoInteresting facts, funny quotes, hints, info, and ads given away to supporters.Do note, the latter part of the sentence. However, whether you disagree with that is another matter, but that's why you're seeing these types of factoids. There's also some that are funny ones or at least meant to be funny. They probably shouldn't be called factoids for this reason, but I don't think that's a massive problem. Most users know them as adverts rather than factoids I should imagine. I imagine it was a way of saying thanks to those that have contributed to the forum, whether monetarily or via helping out with forum related duties.",

      "body": "Quoteads given away to supportersIt's ads given away means one slot from out of 10 ads, not from factoid slots. I would look at it without asking any question if the subjects were in the ad slot sections. I hope you see the deference now.Quote from: Welsh on July 09, 2022, 10:40:38 AMThey probably shouldn't be called factoids for this reason, but I don't think that's a massive problem. Most users know them as adverts rather than factoids I should imagine. Of course it's not a massive problem or to say any problem at all, it's confusion. Ad slots and Factoid slots needs to be separated just to avoid confusion. Right now the two subjects sound like ads but they are placed as factoid. Â Update: Okay I see factoid explained as Quoteads given away to supporters.I don't think any argument needed anymore.",

      "body": "Yeah, theymos allowed donators, and staff to put anything (obviously with approval) they wanted into a factoid slot. theymos even deems it as a \"mini-ad\". theymos manually approved all of them that went into that slot. So, it shouldn't be seen as just facts, and quotes. Although, I do believe the vast majority of them are indeed facts, and quotes. Even, from donators, and staff users.",
