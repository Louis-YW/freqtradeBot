  "content": "Thesaurus.com is a public website that provides people with over 550,000 synonyms in English language. There are 2048 words in BIP39 wordlist, that is used to create normal bitcoin wallets. While I have to say that there is absolutely no way someone can hack your wallet that was randomly created from BIP39 wordlist and contains 12 seeds, still, there are super paranoid people who even think that  24 words seed phrase can be hacked because it uses publicly available BIP39 wordlist. So, there are people who don't know math, don't want to learn and are stubborn.So, I came up with an idea for these people. Let's scrape thesaurus.com and download its wordlist database. Since Electrum is an open-source and uses wordlist, I think it might be possible to generate a bitcoin randomly from your own wordlist. Let's put thesaurus 550,000 wordlist into your electrum and randomly generate 24 words seed phrase. I don't know if your computer crashes but I think you will feel relief.Maybe my post feel like sarcasm but my message is, please, relax!If you random generate 12 words seed phrase bitcoin address from BIP39 list, your wallet will never be hacked because it will take so much time that you, your bitcoins and probably universe won't exist by that time.If you random generate 24 words seed phrase bitcoin address from BIP39 list, even if you reveal all of your words in unordered way, still, no one will be able to hack it. Do you understand what I am saying? Even if you reveal all of your seed phrases in an unordered way (It doesn't apply to 12 words seed), your wallet still won't be hacked till this universe exist.So, please, just chill and relax, don't generate wordlist yourself, there is absolutely no necessity and you may do more harm than good. There is absolutely no case where someone's randomly generated wallet got hacked. In absolutely every case where bitcoins were lost, either the person didn't take security seriously and was infected with malware or just lost his/her keys, that's all.",

Just navigate to your Electrum installation folder, and go to \\electrum\\wordlist. First back up \"english.txt\", and then edit the original with your own wordlist. Job done.I just pulled the wordlist from here and gave it a shot: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words. It has 466k words, and it worked just fine. I generated the following seed phrase:Code:bacillogenous vowely Lafite nonsalably countermutiny untranquilness twice-jailed outrootingThanks to how Electrum works, you don't need to know my wordlist to recover that above seed phrase. You can import it in to any copy of Electrum just fine and recover the same wallet, which will give you the following address first:Code:bc1qkxsvxe4kl0ehz7ymy77ahy8jd4037ghvyzcwrcHowever, doing this completely misses the point. The above seed phrase has exactly the same entropy as a seed phrase using the default wordlist - 132 bits. Increasing the size of the wordlist does not change the underlying entropy used to generate the seed phrase.",

Some people think that the human brain is good at randomness, or for example, as long as the seed is long, I am safe. No one can guess a seed that is 12 words long, so I will generate it myself, but they are wrong. Randomness means a strong random number that represents a 128 bit key at least, that If the randomness is 32bit key, you are not safe, and so on. In short, if you do not understand how entropy works, then trying to rely on the human brain will cause you to lose your money. Use a good, open source wallet, and you can verify that the entropy is at least 128 bits long, then you are safe.You can verify electrum code entropy from here ---> https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/3.3.8/electrum/mnemonic.py#L163",

I suggest you to check this post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5395587.msg60219656#msg60219656Also, this quote from Radioactive decay wiki page sounds interesting:QuoteRadioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms. According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed.[2][3][4] However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life. The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe.Overall, in our real, simple life, I would say that if we can generate combination of word seed phrases from a wordlist and we don't know how that happened or happens and we can't calculate how it chooses words, what logic it does follow, then we can call it random.Quote from: hugeblack on October 21, 2023, 01:13:16 PMSome people think that the human brain is good at randomness, or for example, as long as the seed is long, I am safe.Those people don't know math and probably still believe in fairy tales. Human brain follows some logic, even if that logic sounds illogical for us  So, human brain likes to follow certain path and when human thinks to generate a random word seed phrase, he or she always follows certain logic. For example, from 2048 wordlist, one human may say that let's take 7th word as a first word, then let's 2048th word, then 2047th word, then 1st word, then middle word. You see, there is a logic here and it's not random, it can't be random because human has to think to create something, human thinks how to create it, human is not a machine that can generate something without thinking about it, that's just impossible.",

We know from Bell's theorem that radioactive decay is not governed by \"local hidden variables\". In other words, we know that there are not events or process happening which we cannot measure or don't even know exist which are determining when such atoms decay. The decay of such atoms is indeed truly random, with the likelihood of decay at any given time dictated only by the half life of the isotope in question. The decay of such isotopes follows a Poisson distribution, the same as bitcoin mining.Quote from: Synchronice on October 22, 2023, 08:03:27 AMOverall, in our real, simple life, I would say that if we can generate combination of word seed phrases from a wordlist and we don't know how that happened or happens and we can't calculate how it chooses words, what logic it does follow, then we can call it random.I would disagree with this.

And lastly i wonder whether different version of Electrum have same behavior when you supply custom words.Certainly it's been possible at least since Electrum moved away from using their own wordlist and moved to mirroring the BIP39 wordlist.The math is quite interesting, if you want to work it out. Given a word list of 466k, then each word can encode log2(466,000) = 18.83 bits of entropy. For a 132 bit seed phrase, this needs 132/18.83 = 7.01 words, which has to be rounded up to 8. If you used a wordlist of 474,861 words, then you could generate a 7 word seed phrase for 132 bits.Alternatively, you can go the other way and give Electrum a wordlist of two words, say 0 and 1, and it will generate a 132 \"word\" seed phrase. You can see where Electrum works it out here: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/6dfbdec73e97231c01b1a813ae293083a3dbd1cd/electrum/mnemonic.py#L208.

Unlike BIP39 which does require a fixed and known wordlist so it can convert your words back in to bits in order to verify the checksum, Electrum's version system simply hashes your words as they are and uses the first 8 or 12 bits of that hash.After this, in order to actually start generating private keys, the next step (for both BIP39 and Electrum) is to feed your words as they are in to HMAC-SHA512, alongside salt of the word \"mnemonic\" (for BIP39) or \"electrum\" (for Electrum) concatenated with any passphrase. So again, no need for Electrum to convert your words back in to bits. (This is also why you can import BIP39 seed phrases with unknown wordlists in to Electrum. Electrum will warn you it is an unknown wordlist and it cannot verify the checksum since it cannot convert your words back in to bits in order to verify the checksum as I've explained above, but it can still feed those words in to HMAC-SHA512 and generate master keys and subsequent child keys.)But yes, I'd highly recommend nobody does this. Understanding the principles of what is going on is all good, but you should always stick to the standardized methods.Quote from: DaveF on October 22, 2023, 12:50:16 PMIt's 10 years from now and one of your words was Brabble.And you go to recover your seed and it just does not work.Doesn't matter for Electrum seed phrases  - Electrum does not need to know the wordlist used. For BIP39, even if every copy of the BIP39 wordlist was lost forever, you could still recover BIP39 seed phrases, you just wouldn't be able to verify the checksum.",

Seriously, does it really matter if something takes 10^3*10^12+3 or 10^3*10^33+3 years to bruteforce?By the way, Electrum creates 132 bits of entrophy, 11 bits of entropy per word (12 words). If you increase the number of words in wordlist, like I offered and o_e_l_e_o demonstrated, the number of bits of entropy per word will increase and the number of words will decrease, like he generated 8 words instead of 12 words but his number of bits of entropy per word increased from traditional number 11 to 18.83.Just read this line:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on October 22, 2023, 11:44:27 AMThe math is quite interesting, if you want to work it out. Given a word list of 466k, then each word can encode log2(466,000) = 18.83 bits of entropy. For a 132 bit seed phrase, this needs 132/18.83 = 7.01 words, which has to be rounded up to 8. If you used a wordlist of 474,861 words, then you could generate a 7 word seed phrase for 132 bits.So, this is a little trick and that's why opened a topic. People think that 2048 words are not enough and their public availability makes them a victim of hackers. Now, what about all the words that exists in English language? Sounds cool, right? Only some words from half a million words to generate your bitcoin wallet seed phrase. But in reality, if entropy is 132 bits, you will get 8 words instead of 12 words. Instead of increasing number of words, one should increase number of entropies and move from 128 bits to 256 but reality is that simply there is no reason. People are paranoid and are looking for false sense of increased security when there is absolutely zero danger. It's like living in New Zealand and collecting weapons to protect yourself from Dinosaurs attack. There are no dinosaurs, you don't need a weapon.",
