I personally think we are not yet ready for Metaverse.There are not much usecases currently and apart from that we do not have the gadgets handy.I mean we don't get to see the VR headsets in everyone's house generally.So basically, the adoption is not at par with the technology which is the reason why there is not much buzz around this topic these days.",

They might still be growing (just under a different name) but I think they've stunted quite a bit and are waiting on new ideas to enter the space where people are actually able to do things that are different (VR isn't that impressive or immersive to a lot of people too in my opinion - especially without other things to make your space feel more realistic - like moving floors).",

I would say that they still have a portion in the future and that's making a lot of doubts these days because we're in a bear market. That factor really has decreased the belief in it and its full potential because it's not the same as last year when almost most people have been telling that Metaverse is the future. The bigger part of it was built during the ATHs and through hype but since we're in the reality now, it's being tested and we'll see if it will stand on the test of time and if it will survive.",

Maybe if they make it more crypto friendly and take it away from Mark's hands partially if not entirely, maybe they can probably salvage the project. They're also building it during the crypto winter so it's no surprise that they're not getting that much attraction.",

Metaverse is a new technology that still needs more time and focus to get better development of course. And so far I haven't read much news about this Metaverse so I can't say anything unique except the statement that was said by Michel at the Media Gathering where he said \"With Augmented Reality (AR) technology we can continue to move in the world. real but can be combined with the virtual world. In contrast to the metaverse currently used with Virtual Reality tools that focus on the digital world,\" Source.And after reading that statement, I think Metaverse will continue to grow if there are more benefits and better conveniences in the future, because every new technology or product that can give birth to its own convenience and uniqueness when used by many people, then it will easier to get better progress.",

It was a hype and the hype is slowing down for good reasons. I am not sure why Meta had invested billions of dollars into it, but this is a sheer wastage of money. Their stock is reflecting the same thought as well. Metaverse will never have a great future unless you can fool an entire generation to wear a VR glass and stay disconnected from the real world.",

Short answer, no!And anyone that disagrees with me can tell me why and what he plans to do in this metaverse!It is pretty obvious that it is not “good” enough to work.About 25 years ago Jude Law did an immersive gaming movie 🎥 metaverse would need to work as well as that to be a thing.I will look for the title of the movie.existenz is the title.it is not a great movie but it dates to 1997 and is pre “the matrix”i think when you see it you realize we are nowhere near that tech which is why the metaverse is a failhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existenzwatch it and realize we cant touch that.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrixand watch both movies back to backExistenz then The Matrix then check out the meta verse and you will say yeah the metaverse is not even a 1/100 of Existenz which is maybe a 1/10 of the matrix.So people at least know the Matrix they think oh maybe the metaverse is kind of like it it is not.",

I just watched a video about Zuck and the metaverse which was very critical but also very much on point in so far as it was convincing.  Apparently Meta is touting the metaverse as some kind of workplace solution, and if that's the case then I think it's so far into the overkill realm that it's ridiculous.  I don't think any businesses have been crying out for a VR solution to holding meetings or anything like that--and that's on top of the shitty quality of the graphics that have been shown so far.This whole development process seems like it's turning into a nightmare for Meta, which pleases me greatly as I twirl my evil moustache and clap my gnarled hands together, awaiting their demise.  They are an atrocious company that deserves to fail, and the quicker the better.",

It's a big thing when we are in the pandemic, I mean people doesn't want to interact \"physically\" and so this project was born out of that necessities. So I would agree that the hype has been going down in recent months specially when people can not go out and be big in the norm.And yes Meta have been losing billions already and yet they don't even have a prototype. But we don't know if they will continue with the project, it seems that they already taken the risk so they might as well continue to developed in the next couple of years and maybe we can see if it will be the future or not.",

There are affordable rigs which allow a person to insert their smartphone into a headset to run VR apps.Image link: https://i.ibb.co/YXFRCnj/vr-headset-smartphone.jpgThe problem with meta is it doesn't offer new advantages over the conventional internet. As many have noted it more closely resembles the game Second Life than it does anything new. Internet browsers generally being 2 dimensional applications. People have long theorized 3 dimensional would be the next natural progression. But no one has been able to implement the added 3d functionality in a way to achieve greater content density or an improved user experience. A better setup may be to combine video conferencing with internet browsing. The basis of facebook was needing to be invited to have an account. That exclusiveness could be extended to internet VR and video conferencing being combined. On an invitation only basis where people would be vetted to some degree to screen a user base where people might expect to find some competent and rational user interaction. There are always plenty of ideas. Ideas are easy. Its implementation, structuring and logistics where things become difficult.",

Meta verse will be very similar. Metaverses have been around longer than bitcoin, there have been multiple approaches and the main thing for it is that they lack a final purpose for it.Bitcoin had a purpose in the first place, it was a way to make payments without a third party getting involved from anywhere in the world, no such thing really existed at that point and there was actually nothing that would compete with it.In the case of the metaverse, what is the use? VR? We have VR right now, no need for an extra layer of things when you would simply need to either download the file on your smartphone or watch a direct stream and do the visiting. Interact with others? We have sky and WhatsApp and telegrams, why the f-word would I need to log in to the metaverse to call my wife and ask her to pick some extra groceries? Buy a plot of land? Why the hell would I do that when I could buy a plot of land in the real world!Do you know why Bitcoin flourished? Because it is quite simple to use it! Why do people use windows? Guess! Why do people use credit and debit cards? Because is convenient, and easy to do, it requires absolutely no effort. Why is TikTok popular? Because you open your camera and do a short movie, upload and that's it, you're an \"influencer\"! The metaverse...will be a pain in the ass where everything that can be done right now with a tap would require one more action.If you would need to put a VR set on my head every time you had to order a pizza or pay a bill or send a message to some friends, would you still do it?As I said, tell me what are you planning to do in this metauniverse?This! metauniverse:Nope, Horizon Worlds is not at Ghost in the Shell level of metaverses.",
