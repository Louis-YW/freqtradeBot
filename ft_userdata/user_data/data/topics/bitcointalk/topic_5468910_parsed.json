      "body": "Indeed, Arbitrage is one of the best way to earn but it's not as easy as we think because you need to constantly monitor the market and need to have funds in multiple exchanges and checkout on coins which has arbitrage but while doing it we need to consider the withdrawal fee, the buy order price on exchange where you want to sell because there are times when buy order price is much more lesser than market price. This can work occasionally but not on a long term because considerable price difference will bein low volume exchanges where you will not find buyers and even if you find buyers your withdrawal fee will be more. There are some arbitrage sites which are fooling people to buy their package which is waste of money and time. I will create a post in regards to this shortly.",

That would do all the basic work for you and it will also minimize human error too. Like when we are making transactions from one exchange to another we sometimes forget to copy the new address and paste the last address which is a result of human error. And sometimes, people select the wrong Network of the blockchain for sending and receiving the amount. These types of errors can be minimized by using the AI bot, but of course, we need open-source and trustworthy AI bots that, no one can tamper with them. But it is not that easy to find one. You must have to be good or at least have some knowledge of the API and IDE. Because the open source AI bots mostly exist on GitHub and people like me (just kidding) are not aware of it and how we should use it. The risks that you have mentioned are the basic one, but what are your intentions here to make this topic, because it has been discussed here so many times but I think keeping the old knowledge up to date is also necessary.",

You are right, even one of the members on this forum made a topic about Korean exchange and showed a bot to make a profit out of Arbitrage trading. And when I checked the difference between the price of BTC on Binance and on the Korean Exchange, there was a huge difference. But the transaction fees and the tax were also high that there remained lesser profit. Arbitrage trading is not so profitable if we are doing it in the same country's exchange, we should find the best exchange with better profits and also with better liquidity. Not to mention, you should have a huge amount of capital too. To start this trading. Because you can not make a profit with a lesser profit. I did not get your point of exchange also uses bots to sync on the market price. If that's the case then why there are price differences?",

You just write it easily and say that arbitrage strategy is easy but no it is not that much easy as you present. It's a very risky strategy because the crypto market is too volatile and the price can change very quickly what if you have not completed your trade yet and prices go down? obviously, you will take a loss and you are not coming to take a loss but instead want profits. This strategy requires very skills and technical knowledge and the beginners do not know those skills so how do you recommend this to the newbie? If they spend some time in crypto and gain some experience then maybe I will think to recommend this. Also, it takes time and monitory to look every time to the screen and note the movement of every currency. Instaed of these headaches I recommend simply investing your money in Bitcoin or alt and holding it for some time and I am sure that this will give more profits then arbitrage.",

But its not easy when trying with arbitrage beside have checked with how much buy order volume and enough with our fund for arbitrage or not. I have experienced with arbitrage and usually interested arbitrage with BSC Scan coin network with lower fees transaction have advantage with sending process faster than other network such as Polygon or Ethereum. Seems right now not easy to earn profit trough arbitrage, many time when listing on exchange have the same price and some new coins not open yet with deposit or withdrawing and make us difficult to sell on other exchange market who has higher price.",

      "body": "It looks easy but not as we imagine. I once got stuck during the coin transfer process, which made it late for the coins to enter another exchange and I suffered quite a loss. After several attempts at arbitrage trading, I decided not to continue with it anymore and stick with one or two exchanges and trade as usual.What is difficult is finding coins that have good movements because it only happens to one or a few coins. Meanwhile, we must also pay attention and calculate how long the transfer process takes to complete. And look for information about how long the confirmation takes to complete so we can execute it immediately after arriving at the exchange we want.But arbitrage trading can provide big profits if we find the right coin. Often prices on one exchange are higher than on another. And that makes greed try to tempt us to try it. So you should be careful if you want to try arbitrage trading.",

For example, you can hold a certain amount of USDT on several exchanges and use it to buy \"undervalued\" coins. As soon as their price level has adjusted to the overall market, you sell them again. But of course this is not a classic arbitrage which the OP addresses here. Classic Arbitrage is highly automated and the best and fastest bot wins.

It is hard to do this completely manually since the arbitrage situation can last only for 15-20 minutes.You need to have enough deposit to cover the exchange withdrawal fees. With 100$ deposit  these fees will kill the entire profit.And of course a decent arbitrage bot can easily cost over 1000$ for monthly subscription.",

But right now most difficult to find with some new coins have difference price between dapp and CEX exchange and more have the same price when listing on CEX exchange. Usually we can manage or consistent to earn profit with capital $100 but right now arbitrage needed above $1000 and possibility to earn profit under $20, not easy to find difference coins price right now in dapp and CEX exchange actually some coins when first time listing on CEX exchange not opening deposit yet.",
