  "content": "In 2012 I launched a project called UpTweet.com In short, it was a system that allowed people to “upvote” each others tweets…When users upvote a sponsored tweet they get paid crypto and we take a cut. Simple right?The platform achieved some serious noteriety back then and even got an article written by my friend Vitalik Buterin: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/uptweet-social-media-and-bitcoin-meet-again-1356483989The site ran for years and was able to onboard many users, but I was simply too early! Bitcoin’s price was too volatile, there was not enough people using it, and the dev tools at the time were awful.In light of recent events with Twitters new commitment to free speech and its new owner I have decided to relaunch UpTweet.com!You guys are hearing it first for 3 reasons: 1. This forum changed my life. 2. I am looking for investors who want to go on this relaunch journey with me.3. Free speech is important and I believe I have the solution to Twitters monetization problems.Key points /milestones: 1. I have all the original source code which is built in a modular, clean, MVC format. 2. Source code will need some refactoring to keep up with latest security requirements.3. Native coin for the platform will be switched from BTC to Doge for community marketing purposes.4. Once the website is active again we will activate Bitcoin and other top cryptos for sponsored advertisements.5. We will explore a compliant way to launch our own token to fuel WEB3 growth for the platform.6. Mobile apps will be released and UI “face lift” will follow.To see the site as it once was use the “Waybackmachine” or scroll through my Twitter history from 2013-2016 and you will see many campaigns that went viral. Here’s our biggest one: https://twitter.com/BrianSantoshi/status/265524962343919616Let me know what you guys think and if you want to see UpTweet come back!",

I do think a Twitter based project would do well right now or defiantly a few months from now.I DM'd you. Thanks alot for your interest!Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 11, 2022, 12:32:28 PMQuote from: FlipPro on November 11, 2022, 09:01:49 AMThe site ran for years and was able to onboard many users, but I was simply too early! Bitcoin’s price was too volatileAlthough Bitcoin price is less vollatile than a decade ago, i expect you'll face such problem again. For example recent FTX collapse also dragged Bitcoin price.Quote from: FlipPro on November 11, 2022, 09:01:49 AMIn light of recent events with Twitters new commitment to free speech and its new owner I have decided to relaunch UpTweet.com!I have few doubt about free speech commitment. For example, parody/joke about Elon Musk got punished[1] along with some censorship attempt[2].Quote from: FlipPro on November 11, 2022, 09:01:49 AM3.

If you decide to come back, i might try UpTweet assuming there aren't many low quality content.[1] https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-said-comedy-now-legal-twitter-jokes-getting-users-suspended-2022-11[2] https://www.businessinsider.com/free-speech-absolutist-elon-musk-censors-employees-critics-2022-3?op=1[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20160312144824/http://uptweet.com/viewStory?id=1257[4] https://web.archive.org/web/20130422203825/http://uptweet.com/viewStory?id=12131. The volatility problem will still be there yes, but still way more manageable than it was in 2013 lol. In the future we will create pricing algorithms on the site so that the global payout rate is always in line with dollar value. For now the rate is set manually by us. 2. I do believe Elon has a serious commitment to free speech. Otherwise, why would he pay $44 billion for a money losing company? I am following the money on this one... The free speech updates will take time, and have to be implemented in a controlled fashion. Many free thinkers are already being let back on the platform with many more to come.3. Yes, we do have plans to support the lightning network at some point in the future. We are not Bitcoin core maximalists, but we do believe Bitcoin is king. 4. Thank you so much for your support and interest![moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

It seems you haven't provided any documents to help us understand the financing and investing procedures. Could you please let us know when we can expect those documents?1. The entire platform technology runs off Twitter. When people started getting banned/shadow banned alot of people left. Theres one legendary member in another thread I made that lost an account with 50,000 followers and no explanation. We are an upvoting platform that literally runs on twitter. There are obviously advantages and disadvantages to this play. Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons in my mind. 2. We will build out a confidence score for every user. It's very easy to pick up a bot account from a real one. If an account has a confidence score of below 70 (failing) then those users are not eligible for a payout. All payouts at the moment are manually approved. At scale our algorithm will choose who's real and who isn't. Users who feel they have accidentally been flagged can contact support for manual review once this process is live.3. I am only showing documents and going over numbers with accredited investors. If you meet that requirement feel free to message me. Otherwise, thanks for your interest!",

      "body": "Quote from: TimtheYoutuber on November 14, 2022, 11:32:41 AMHow do you protect against bots upvoting? And how exactly does the monetization work for this? Bot operators will waste their valuable time trying to game the system at UpTweet.If we find accounts that are fake we ban them from the site. When a user goes to assign a payout address to their account we make them verify an email. And whenever a withdrawal request is made a captcha code is generated.All payouts are manually verified and go out weekly. UpTweet reserves the right to ban any account that may be violating our terms of services. In the future we will have an algorithm that assigns a confidence score to all accounts. With all this, along with the active war on bots currently happening on Twitter, we believe these risks will be mitigated.Quote from: examplens on November 14, 2022, 11:53:03 AMI remember this service, I know it was an interesting concept but poorly formulated. it seemed complicated to me to recognize what exactly I was doing there and the benefits of the whole thing.

You open up an account on uptweet and just retweet the sponsored post that’s all to make $1 in your pocket? Isn’t thats way above premium class tweet button we got here. I understand that it’s similar to micro job or something but I’m not sure how one is able to pay this much amount. Even if it is sponsored tweet, it’s paying the company to make visible growth not uptweet in particular. Apart from that after visiting your site I see there is no visible charge on other tweets why is that so? What’s exact strategy here in layman language.",
