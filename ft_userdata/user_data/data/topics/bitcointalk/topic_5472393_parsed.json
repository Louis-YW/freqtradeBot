Don't fall for it. Bitcoins go exactly to the address you send them to, so there's no need for insurance. And if you get scammed, you can't prove you didn't move the coins by yourself so insurance is useless. That leaves only one possibility: someone is trying to scam you if they offer \"insurance\".",

Before deciding on an exchange, you should make sure that your bank does not refuse deposits from this exchange. I honestly do not know the situation in Australia, whether there are banks where Bitcoin and co. are \"frowned upon\" and you may have problems with the withdrawal to your bank account. If you are unsure about this you could check with your bank before making the withdrawal.  Bitcoin ATMs could also be an alternative here. There are also according to this page some ATMs in Australia: https://coinatmradar.com/country/13/bitcoin-atm-australia/Atomic Wallet has also published a HowTo on how to use Bitcoin ATMs: https://atomicwallet.io/academy/articles/bitcoin-atm-guide",

First find a non-KYC P2P exchange, you can go through the list here: https://kycnot.me. Try the Agora desk or local Monero, and check whether the crypto you have in your Atomic wallet is being traded in the P2P market. If yes then transfer your crypto from Atomic wallet to the exchange you prefer and then use P2P service to convert them to AUD and transfer them to your ANZ bank account.",

There is nothing such as this and it is most likely that scammers are trying to take advantage of your lack of knowledge about the cryptocurrency industry. Mind you that you are your own bank when you use Bitcoin and you are responsible for your own funds, and if you lose it, it cannot be reversed. There is no insurace company in the crypto industry that covers users losses or helps them recover their funds, whoever is selling this idea to you is a scammer and any money you send to them is lost.",

Fiat currency is from central bank and commercial bank, it's impossible to interact between fiat currency in your bank account with cryptocurrency in your Atomic wallet.You have to sell your cryptocurrency in Atomic wallet to fiat currency. You can use non KYC cryptocurrency exchanges to do that or can use peer-to-peer trading platforms to do it directly to your bank account.kycnot.meNo-KYC Exchange Encylopedia",

You have to complete your KYC verification on these exchanges first before you can be allow to do P2P trades, I don't know any that's this straight forward and they are very fast and secured, if you don't care about your privacy then pass the KYC verification, the exchanges have some easy walk through available for new users so don't worry. I heard that Agoradesk is a complete dex platform but I have not do any trades on this platform for once, I don't know how safe it is but you can do your own research if you prefer a dex platform over centralised exchanges.",

I exchange money to fiat in Binance more than 50 times and I haven't faced any issue single time. I am using P2P because direct crypto buying and selling is not allowed. Australian have no big issue with that and I think he can also use direct credit card buying and selling  or bank transfer. The only issue in Binance is KYC.

      "body": "OP there' is no two ways about it. What I would advise you to do is this,  possibly register with any of the reliable exchanges for example binance undergo the KYC process and after verification success, you can transfer your coin from your atomic wallet to your new exchange wallet and when doing such, make sure you properly copy the wallet address and verify of it is the right wallet address because any coin that is transferred into the wrong address is gone. After confirming the address to be correct, then you can transfer to your new wallet address and conveet it to usdt or any stable of your choice of you choose p2p trade option otherwise you convert it to us dollar and withdraw to your local account if there is no law restricting crypto currency transaction in your country. I see some members already given you other possible remedy to your situation.Lastly I have not heard or seen anything relating to digital insurance before not even here. If truly such exist could you please share us more information on it possibly their website so we could see for ourselves otherwise  I would have no option to believe it to be a scam and I will advise you to be careful when dealing with them if you already do.",
