Nvidia video cards have a better payback and these video cards are easier to sell to gamers later.",

The local pool was the dwarfpool, which miners called \"dwarf\". Detailed instructions were on the pools to lure new miners to the pool. But a lot of people from these miners left for other business after making good money.",
