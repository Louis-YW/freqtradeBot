A soft fork is generally preferred because it is compatible with previous consensus rules, and that helps avoid an unintended chain split.The idea that the difference between the two somehow limits which rules can be changed is misguided because, as Peter Todd demonstrated, anything can be changed with a soft fork.Quote from: konfuzius5278 on September 13, 2023, 01:49:36 PMAs I said I am not talking of main Emmision, that would cause a hard fork.

In fact, there is no difference between a system with tail supply, and a system with fixed supply, where you can take someone's coins. Because that's what inflation is about: proportions. That's the only thing that matters. So, no hard forks are really needed to create a tail supply, you can instead force all users to pay a \"tail supply fee\", for example one satoshi per each 0.01 BTC. Then, miners could be forced by a soft-fork, to lock those \"tail supply fees\" to some future block number, just by using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, to increase future block rewards.And because it is something that can be solved by changing fee policy, no forks are needed to introduce that.QuoteHow would that even work technically? Coins whose keys have been lost cannot be moved...You can always create a timelocked transaction, that could be mined after block number N. And then, you can publish it, then there are two options:1) you will move your coins before block N, so the broadcasted version will be invalid2) you will lose your keys, so after block N, miners will pick it (miners, if it will require no keys, but you can of course decide, what conditions are needed to take it)",

It is no longer possible to do once the block reward is completely exhausted.But that's going to damage the economics of Bitcoin in the present, so I would not support such a fork.",

Whether there exist transactions with 0 coins sent, or just a coinbase transaction to old nodes, the result is the same. They cannot verify the post-softfork transactions.Quote from: tromp on September 13, 2023, 07:16:42 PMWhat the proposal shows is that the notion of soft-fork is not as clear cut as it seems at first, and is really more of a spectrum, based on how much of the new rules are being verified, or even visible, to old nodes.A softfork is change(s) so that the client is backwards-compatible. Maybe what's more of a spectrum is the definition of backwards compatibility. For instance, one might argue that being unable to verify a post-softfork transaction is not backwards-compatible, even if it technically is, because verifying all transactions is considered the normal state.",

It is no longer possible to do once the block reward is completely exhausted.There are many solutions to that:1. Forced Soft Forks: https://petertodd.org/2016/forced-soft-forksQuoteSo what is a valid Bitcoin 2.0 block? It could be anything at all! For example, the inflation schedule can be changed to make the coin supply unlimited.2. Changing coin ownership, without touching 21 million coin limit: from the economical point of view, it is equivalent:Quote from: garlonicon on July 10, 2022, 05:00:50 PMImagine there are 21 million coins, distributed to many different users, and the block reward is zero. Then, imagine that 21 million coins are produced, because of tail emission. Then, you can have two systems:1) with fixed supply, where everyone will lose half coins in explicit way, and they will be taken by miners, because of tail emission: 10.5 million coins will remain in users' hands, 10.5 million coins will be taken by miners, 21 million coin limit is untouched2) with infinite supply, users will have exactly the same amounts, but they will be worth 50% less than before, because miners will be always rewarded by new coins, because of tail emission3. Introducing zero satoshis, and treating them as non-zero amounts:Quote from: garlonicon on July 11, 2022, 01:29:14 PMSo, you know what is needed: zero satoshis. Then, it is possible to create some additional outputs, send zero satoshis there, and use \"<anyStandardScript> <newAmount> OP_DROP\" as an output script (or this \"<newAmount> OP_DROP\" could also be placed inside witness script, or as an input, many things are possible). It could be handled in the same way as Segwit vs NonSegwit: if it was possible to create a situation, where old nodes cannot see new signatures, then it is also possible to create a situation, where old nodes will not see new amounts (there could be many reasons, for example if hiding amounts will ever be introduced, then it is reasonable to put zero for backward compatibility, but the same solution can be used to introduce any coins to the system, because the size of the UTXO set is not limited). And then, it is all about human factor: if those zero satoshis will be really used to move real values, then they could be traded, bought, sold, and used in real life. If it is possible to create NFTs out of thin air and sell them for millions, then why producing coins out of thin air and selling them for real goods and services wouldn't work as well?4. Something else. There were many ideas, just read the whole topic about tail emission: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405755.0QuoteThey cannot verify the post-softfork transactions.If you make it explicit, by taking single satoshis from users, instead of producing new coins, you will reach identical economy, while preserving backward compatibility.",

If we would have Lightning Network, sidechains, and all other second layers inside Core client, then it would mean every LN transaction, every sidechain transaction, and every L2 transaction will be traced on-chain. It doesn't scale, so I hope it will never happen (if it will, the size of your mempool will be measured in gigabytes, if not terabytes).What is needed instead, is for example transaction joining on mempool level. In this way, the whole additional traffic will happen only on unconfirmed transactions level. Then, it will be batched, and stored inside blocks after batching. Currently, we have full-RBF. The next step is to use it to batch some transactions, that could be batched. For example, if you have any one-input-one-output transaction, and if it uses SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, then all of those transactions should be automatically collected by full nodes, and batched into a single transaction.",
