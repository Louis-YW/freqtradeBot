But if you’re looking for something safe then I will advise you go for something like a cold wallet either the hardware wallets or an airgapped wallet. An airgapped wallet can be set up with electrum but be sure that the device has never come online before and would not. It is also worth mentioning that window OS are not much advisable compared to Linux because of malware issues usually too frequent with Windows.another good PC wallet for bitcoin is the bitcoin core; which is suitable for privacy sake and sparrow wallet",

But you can also use wallet like Electrum or Sparrow to connect to your own server or node for privacy sake.Running your own node will take almost 500 gigabyte of data to download the full blockchain. Also it may take up to 10 gigabyte of data daily to keep updating the blockchain.",

Timelock, RBF, CPFP and much more.4. Brilliant documentation online. One of the easiest to read.5. Great support, especially on Telegram. 6. Great development, fully open-source.Finally, my favorite thing: connection to your own node without the need for an electrum server. Simply connects to Bitcoin Core with literally 2 clicks.I have no relation with Sparrow of course, but I really love it.Electrum is fantastic too!",

For maximum security the hardware should be the best option for OP because even airgap wallet set up needs it knowledge and if the OP isn’t that knowledgeable in that regards, the set up might have some flaws.",

Electrum is easy to use since you don't have to download the whole Bitcoin blockchain, but it's non-custodial. Just make sure you are downloading the original version from the official sources. Even when updates are necessary, just use the official source instead of notifications inside apps. A better option is to buy a hardware wallet, which is more secure if you can afford it.

Tx fees has nothing to do with the wallet you use to make the tx, all the wallet does is estimate what could be an appropriate fee, but since some wallets are 'bad' at estimating the fee, you should check mempool.space before making your tx. You pay tx fees to the miners and this fee is not set or fixed by any particular person or any wallet software, it is the 'network' that determines the fee, in the sense that if the mempool is congested fee rate will rise, but if it is less congested fee rate will drop.Quote from: Mate2237 on November 28, 2023, 10:16:57 PMMost people now are using Centralized exchange to receive pay and trade.Anyone using a custodial wallet to store their funds doesn't understand BTC and how it should be used, not to talk of the risks in using a custodial wallet to store funds, i guess people do not just learn.",
