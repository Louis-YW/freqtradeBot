  "content": "I have long been having a thought over this. The sports and entertainment industries gets more attention to themselves unlike other industries. I believe also that they have or share fans that are into blockchain as well. If these two industries looks into blockchain I believe there would be a strong massive adoption as a result of their total engagement with their fans if they constantly accept Bitcoin payment for their shows and events. Like some clubs already doing this and the response is welcoming. If musicians do follow same step, I think there would be massive adoption as most of them are Bitcoin informed and  inclined. Artists could help spread the move on Bitcoin adoption. Do you think this would be realized if it is given attention to.",

Bitcoin has not CEO, it's not a business per se, it doesn't have funds for advertising. Bitcoin related businesses have that. So Bitcoin itself won't advertise itself, but Bitcoin companies should advertise both themselves and Bitcoin too. Could this be done at a larger scale? Most probably. But overall it's not a new idea.",

There are more industries accept Bitcoin too and are they not important for Bitcoin adoption?Sports related to gambling and you are right about that. Bitcoin and early altcoins like Dogecoin were accepted for gambling years ago and they are continuing to be used in that industry.Recent years, we see more crypto-gambling casinos partner with football clubs and have their logos on club jerseys. The same for cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and OKX.Other industries have big role in Bitcoin adoption too and they decide how we see the adoption grows in future. We need more adoption for Lightning Network to bring Bitcoin to more industries and more people.",

Do you think this would be realized if it is given attention to.The influence of sportsmen and entertainers of every sector cannot be overemphasized. Most of them have a very large fan-base and fellowship that some Presidents of nations don't have. Some of them have die-hard followers that see these celebrities are demigods. Yes, they are one of the potent means of advertisement. In my country most cryptocurrency firms use musicians as their brand ambassadors and it has really contributed to their acceptance.Quote from: Upgrade00 on November 04, 2022, 12:45:20 PMPeople act on their personal gain or interest.

We have had issues where fraudulent companies connive with these stars to defraud people.

And in fact, for the past many years, there had been many known personalities working in the two industries who have become big allies and some of them even promoting Bitcoin but due to the crypto winter we seldom hear from showbiz people and players who are talking on Bitcoin...maybe they are just waiting for the bull run to get back on the scene. For sure, star power can be of big importance so as to reach as many people as possible and deliver the Bitcoin message to everyone.",

That's a good thought of an idea but surprisingly we have alot of industries already into the adoption of the blockchain technology right now while some are still coming in, they got a number of deals to sign MoU with their representing companies or organizations to implement this and i think accepting bitcoin as a payment currency is already in place to an extent, though may not have gone widespread, some were even showing the bitcoin advertisement in their live matches and spectators uses the option of bitcoin to serve as payment in specific locations where acceptable, but know that this does not got limited to the sport and entertainment industry alone, other industries where involved as well such as medical, tech, education and even political professions all uses the decentralized network of blockchain in one way or the other together with bitcoin.",

Some sports tournaments have been filled with crypto exchange ads as well iirc, and maybe even some shitcoins (not sure about this one). Influencers as well have been into crypto, look at Elon himself with Doge, and it also shows how his influence has been pretty big in consideration of the doge market. Exchanges are companies in the end and they can pay advertisements and stuff like that from events, which in turn advertise crypto itself. Musicians, Artists, whatever you call it can be covered under influencers imo so they only need to publicly state it in social media and they can basically use that to their advantage.",

Also, if it's an even that's in very high demand, the speed of buying the ticket can also matter, and then Bitcoin confirmation time can be of issue.
