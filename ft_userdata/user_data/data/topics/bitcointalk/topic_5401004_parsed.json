      "body": "To predict bitcoin price in just one month may have inaccurate result, better to have a long term strategy which can make your sentiment about bitcoin price to be more accurate. I do not know if the price of bitcoin will hit $40000 this month or it may drop even below $30000, anything can happen, it can be up way or down way. All I will just tell people is that if they are losing already, they should know that they are not losing and hold their bitcoin until it increased back and reach ATH which will surely come.",

It seems that we have gotten over the Luna effect and investors are slowly getting back into the market again. We might hit as high as $33k-$34k if everything went smooth in the first 2 weeks and then retrace back to $32k in my opinion.",

Although we have bounce back this last week, I'm not really sure, maybe this could be another trap, sort of catching a falling knife. We've barely enter this month and a lot of things can still affect us, like the noise behind us, the war in Europe and then the Fed rate hike or even another set of FUD will trigger another sell-off.",

      "body": "It is the market sentiment to have a bounce during the start of the new month. This can get carried, but with the present market situation we can't come to conclusion. As per my understanding, the low bottom isn't touched. Probably there is price prediction of reaching $10k. It won't drop that low, but there is a bottom price which is down to $25k. We should remember the days before bitcoin reaching its ATH value. During that time the market was predicted to fall lower after a massive fluctuation, but it moved to the top. So, the market could over perform as well as out perform unexpectedly.",

In theory bitcoin, when there is a crisis in the stock market, inflation and rising interest rates slowing down the economy, should act as a safe haven, but this does not seem to be the behaviour of bitcoin in recent months, rather its behaviour is similar to that of the stock market and the rest of the markets.",

Of course, it did not only that but go to 32k before losing it all in 12 hours. It's going to take a few more attempts to break that resistance (I'd say a couple more tries but it has then to stay above that a week or touch 35k).If not, then it's really just a blink of an eye to wipe 10-20% out and see 24k or so.

Looks like many don't want Bitcoin to reach above $30,000 .Anyway with what is happening right now globally, I believe that we might see Bitcoin go lower than $27,000-$28,000 TBH but only for a short amount of time because I think that we might go sideways for the next few weeks to months. I hate it but fundamentals greatly affects the market. One bad news might affect the whole market. With what is happening right now globally, I believe that investors will still be in extreme fear for the next month. The good thing though is that it tried to surpass the $30,000 price though it ended up as a false breakout. A good sign but not enough to say that we will go up this month. Only my prediction though and I have a 50% chance of it to be correct and it's for fun only .",

I was still seeing the market will remains as it was just like in the past few days, like a month of May. However, I'd never found a reason why we have to worry in the coming days and this month. The market had never fallen bad, still in the up and down movement. Never I see it stabilized which makes me think that the situation will keep running until the 3rd quarter.",

Fed's attempt to have some control over it will go nowhere and only hurt the crypto market further since everyone now is so jumpy to sell their bag over any bad sign in the market: montage rate, unemployment rate, CPI,...I cast my vote at Yes, we'll see Bitcoin drop the price further.",
