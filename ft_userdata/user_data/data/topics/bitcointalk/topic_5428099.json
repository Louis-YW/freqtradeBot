  "content": "QuoteThe global economy has entered a period of elevated volatility, and previous investing approaches won't work anymore, BlackRock said.A recession is imminent but central banks won't be able to support markets this time by loosening policy, according to the money manager.\"Recession is foretold as central banks race to try to tame inflation. It's the opposite of past recessions,\" BlackRock strategists said.A worldwide recession is just around the corner as central banks boost borrowing costs aggressively to tame inflation — and this time, it will ignite more market turbulence than ever before, according to BlackRock.The global economy has already exited a four-decade era of stable growth and inflation to enter a period of heightened instability — and the new regime of increased unpredictability is here to stay, according to the world's biggest asset manager.That means policymakers will no longer be able to support markets as much as they did during past recessions, a team of BlackRock strategists led by vice chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a report titled 2023 Global Outlook.\"Recession is foretold as central banks race to try to tame inflation. It's the opposite of past recessions,\" they said. \"Central bankers won't ride to the rescue when growth slows in this new regime, contrary to what investors have come to expect. Equity valuations don't yet reflect the damage ahead.\"The prospect of limited policy support means investors need more dynamic methods — involving more frequent portfolio changes and taking a more \"granular view on sectors, regions and sub-asset classes\" — to navigate the volatility ahead, according to BlackRock.`Regime of greater macro volatility'\"What worked in the past won't work now,\" the strategists said. \"The old playbook of simply 'buying the dip' doesn't apply in this regime of sharper trade-offs and greater macro volatility. We don't see a return to conditions that will sustain a joint bull market in stocks and bonds of the kind we experienced in the prior decade.\"Wall Street banks from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America to Deutsche Bank have warned that US stocks could plunge by more than 20% in 2023 due to an economic downturn and liquidity risks fueled by the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon sees just a 35% chance that the US economy avoids a recession.A slowdown in the housing market, delays in corporate investment plans, a decline in consumers' savings and deteriorating CEO confidence are early signs of the oncoming economic slump, according to BlackRock.Still, the stock market hasn't yet factored in the potential magnitude of the impending economic downturn, the strategists said.\"We don't think equities are fully priced for recession,\" they added. \"Corporate earnings expectations have yet to fully reflect even a modest recession. This keeps us tactically underweight developed market equities.\"The S&P 500 index of large-cap US stocks is up more that 12% from a 23-month low reached in October, spurred mainly by expectations that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of its interest-rate increases after a recent retreat in inflation.https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/blackrock-recession-warning-stock-market-analysis-2023-economic-outlook-2022-12....Everything inflationary and fiat based appears headed towards a crash.This should be bitcoin's time to shine!  BTC was designed and engineered to thrive during conditions such as these. Does anyone have an inkling as to why this is not occurring? Specifically? Having followed financial markets and news cycles for many years, I feel like I have seen more pieces of the puzzle than most. There are a few different angles to bitcoin not doing as well as an inflation protected and recession protected asset, as it should be. I think most would agree inflation and recessions are terrible. What steps can we take to mitigate issues relating to these negative trends in the future? Can crypto be upgraded and rebooted in a way to offer hard inflation protection consumers around the world seek. What valuable lessons and insights can we takeaway from current market and asset trends? What have people learned from this disaster? If you were rebooting bitcoin in a way to protect it from being traded like an equity. Which suggestions or alterations could be made? Would anyone be interested in hearing my ideas on the topic?",

Inflation numbers are still high but stocks are rebounding quickly, look how close Dow came to ATH only 6% off. You short here and you might make like 2-3 % off the indices max and itll reserve pretty quickly.My grandma could of said there is going to be a recession 6 month ago.

Would anyone be interested in hearing my ideas on the topic?Unlike what you seem to believe, Bitcoin is just a currency at the end of the day. It's a way to transfer value from one place to another but should not be needed for any other purpose. It's nothing like a company, where money actually gets put to work in order to make more money which can then be paid out in the form of profits. It's not even like gold which has useful attributes in things like jewelry or electronics. At best it could be considered a collectible item but it's gambling if you try to predict which way it is going - as we've seen in the massive highs which have fallen almost 75%. Maybe by the time the next bull market comes around, which this is predicting could take a long time, it will climb back up again.",

There were economic indicators that a recession was coming pre-COVID that had the financial sector a bit on edge, but post COVID it became obvious a recession was coming. Nearly all the big banks lowered their economic projections for the U.S. GDP, and of course, the U.S. economy largely has domino effect on the rest of the global economy. Europe experiencing large energy price hikes contributed to lower economic growth and the UK had a small bump in GDP recently but the central banks are still forecasting a recession.",
