It's like a fund that he's willing to lend to the victims or the exchange in rebuilding of what the damage has done.

Because just like you gain from it, you also lose but what's most important is how you learn to get back up on your feet after you must have seemingly lost all. FTX was valued at $32bn but just today, it has been disclosed that he went bankrupt and has handed over reins to someone else. With the way he was hit, and the resultant damages that followed, I think it's going to take a long while before he can get back to the crypto scene.BTC investment is risky, and so is every other investment. At present, we are in the bear season and this is made worse by recent happenings, but I believe we'd still a period where it would experience stability.",

Regulations are not a new thing anymore but it's now becoming a norm. Maybe you are right that the intention of buying FTX is to directly shut down the competition or to greatly lessen it rather since FTX was also one of top crypto exchanges nowadays and they think it will be a threat to them since FTX is slowly gaining a momentum.If not because of this negative news that hit them, then maybe they will now be the second top exchange next to binance and they will completely overcome kucoin, and others. Apart from the competition thing, binance is also known for widening their empire as they also bought cmc on the past so maybe they have planned it already ever since before.",

He affected the crypto market as a whole but that's because he invested and held a lot of altcoins. Bitcoin got affected by this only because dumb people held it on SBF's exchange and when he paused withdrawals they tried to sell their bitcoin and try to withdraw stable coins or fiat. An exchange that is insolvent should've been immediately cut from the tickers so that it can't affect spot price on other exchanges but the system is far from perfect. In my eyes bitcoin remains unaffected. It's good that SBF got his ass handed to him because he was a proponent of centralized blockchains and regulation. We don't need people like him in the space.",
