The only way to recover a relative from such a bad illness is to make him go to a local rehab center.Of course you cannot just drag him by force to the rehab center,it won't do any good if he is forced to go there but it will make wonders if you first talk to him like brother,not just one time but consistently,little by little each day and you will make sure to have an impact on him by giving him all sort of examples of why gambling is bad (just a google search will give you a lot of insights) and finally when you will see that he will let his guard down it is that golden time to bring him by his will to the rehab center.For me this is the only solution to such persons.",

It is very difficult trying to want to help someone who does not even look like they want help, or know that they need help. He is 29 and an adult already, so it may be difficult to help him you should know. But since he is your younger brother and because you are constantly drawn in to settle issues for him, you can talk to him if he will listen so he see's a reason to want to stop. If it is difficult to stop on his own, you can then proceed by recommending help for him from professionals. If everything does not work and you have the clear signal that he is unwilling to change, you let him be and leave him to life to teach him the lessons the harder way.",

You need to let him know the consequences of his action and what he can achieve if he controls his gambling behavior. If he refuses to change his ways and keeps incurring debt, he should be allowed to stay in the police station until he repays his loan.

That's a terrible story and I really hope you manage to find help. In my family we have no one who is addicted to gambling, so I can give you specific advice for that kind of addiction. But I can give you some insights into addictions in general. My uncle was addicted to alcohol for a long time. It took quite a while for us to even find out of his illness (his wife was drinking a lot too and they didn't tell it to anybody and did a good job of hiding it). Only after my grand mother found large sums of alcohol in their house we tried to help them. We did everything from interventions to hiding all alcohol, but nothing helped. Eventually he died of liver failure before even becoming 60 years old. You can't control the life of someone else, there will always be loopholes for them to fall back into their addiction if they don't want to change. My advice would be to try and make them understand that they need to change to get their life in order. It's not possible for us to change it for them. And if they really want to get better they should seek professional help. It's going to be a long way and he needs all the help he can get. Good luck.",

Maybe you can talk to him heart to heart and hope he can tell the truth and you can try to go to a rehab center with him.

How many times has your brother been in trouble with the police, 1,2,3.2. What case did your brother get caught, gambled or owed.Now there are two problems that have happened to your younger brother, gambling and debt.1. Gambling addiction:Solution:1You can put your brother into gambling rehabilitation, don't let him hang around and be friends with his gambling friends again, it could be even worse, because you have guaranteed it, he thinks later if I get caught again and get caught, I will guarantee it again brother.Solution:2If your younger sibling doesn't want to go to rehab, don't guarantee it anymore, if he gets caught again in the future, let him go to jail, make him a deterrent.2. Debts:Solution:1Here it is clear your brother, owes money to gamble, if she wants to change and wants to be rehabilitated, pay her debts, but if she doesn't listen to your suggestions and advice, let her debt be borne and don't bail her out at the police station.",

You can also take him to a gambling psychologist to guide and counsel him on how to break free from addiction.Things can be very complicated... especially if his debts affect the entire household. I have experience with people \"who simply don't listen\", they only react with some kind of force. Sometimes it's the only way \"to bring someone back to earth and reality\". But even that doesn't work with everyone, some people are pretty stubborn and autodestructive. They usually wake up when they hit the rock bottom,  and after they destroy almost everything that can be destroyed around them... usually when it's too late.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 14, 2023, 02:02:01 PM...If there is any advice you can give me on how to approach this matter please help. Obviously, your brother needs a \"wake-up\" call. I don't know how much \"power\" you have over your brother and what you can really do to \"wake him up and get him back on the right path\"... Is there a possibility to control his finances and movements, can you move his focus on other things? Depending on how \"deep\" he is you will need to pay a lot of attention to bring him back on track. In any case, it's necessary to work with him, at first 24/7 probably, which is certainly neither easy nor simple.You are close to him so I guess you should know him, his character and personality... think about it and try to find the best approach. Probably the most important is to not give up even without results at the beginning, sometimes it takes a lot of strength to stay calm in difficult situations and a lot of patience to reach out to someone. I wish you a lot of strength and luck to overcome this successfully.",

Seeking for professional help would also be advisable especially if there a severe need of it. Giving advice would also help but something which qould be suggested by licensed individuals, will be better. And for those who are a bit close to addiction; this industry is cruel simply because it involves money. It is that powerful. You'd sometimes taste the sweet victory but in a long run, it could be bitter. Break the idea that this activity is a shortcut to being rich because not because some people made it, same thing would happen to every one of us.",
