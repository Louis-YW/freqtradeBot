But the same behavior, they can also be hit that much in losses within the day.Quote from: krishnaverma on November 14, 2022, 11:48:19 AMAt such, do you think that increasing popularity of bitcoin has reduced interest of people in stocks.

The bitcoin can do 20% in a day is something the right stock can do too if you get one that's particularly volatile (especially one that looks undervalued).A lot of stocks don't move very fast though and that might be what moves people away from them, I think the 20-30% on the year that's reported is normally investments in the big few tech firms too, if it were more diversified you'd see a lot less active moves (I think funds are using past performce to compete each other and get the highest returns, but it'll probably work).",

But we are talking about the current conditions where the crypto market is in a prolonged bearish season, and we don't know when it will end.But after the increase in BTC at the end of last year and some altcoins could increase high, it attracted people who had been playing stocks to join the crypto market. And even though they understand the risks of crypto that change all the time, they can accept it because they also face the same thing with stocks. And yes, awareness around crypto is starting to increase, and some people are starting to make crypto an investment alternative to the things they already use.",

So, people will invest less in stocks since they are putting some of their money into BTC.Moving on with that thought having people invest in other things will drop stock prices a bit so other investors will look elsewhere.

They diversify their portfolio of course and majority of them included bitcoin, but what's interesting though is that I know one old school stock trader who doesn't want to take care of bitcoin by himself and rather invest via Grayscale. Having said that, I also know people that only started investing in stocks after they profited via bitcoin, as a way to diversify into something that has less amplitudes in price.",

I do think that it is the other way around.The popularity of BTC has skyrocketed over the years given the returns that some have experienced. While stocks is heavily regulated and the trading session only applies to a specific time frame within the day, cryptocurrency reputation is steadily increasing, though regulation has becoming more stringent over the years. Though I am curious as to the returns of stocks that you mentioned- I think it varies in a case-to-case basis as 20-30% returns is significantly huge in stocks.",

They will invest in Bitcoin as in other assets without even having to bother knowing the technical and philosophical assumptions behind it. As with any other asset, stocks have been more popular than they are these days, but even so, they are still quite popular. And guess what; they treat bitcoin as if it was a stock, so in a way, Bitcoin has become a new stock-like asset for speculators.All speculators care about is profit, so if there is money to be made, they will drop in, regardless if it is popular or not. And in fact, that is how they make money, by diving into an \"asset\" when it is still not popular.",

In regards to the profitability I don't think it's that easy these days unless you really know how to predict the price. I'm not sure I have seen a lot of people acquiring Bitcoin to become rich quickly these days.If stock is that easy to aquire a lot more people will be into it.

Some are into both just like me but more stock investors are also investing now in Bitcoin. A few weeks ago I already started auditing my scattered stock holdings.
