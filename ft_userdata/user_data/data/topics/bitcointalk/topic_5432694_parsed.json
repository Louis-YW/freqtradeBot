Children are not called twins only because they share the same birthdays, birthdays did not even matter at some point, Children are called twins because they shared the same space in their mother's womb. To celebrate their birthdays will become a decision but the best day to use is the day the first child came out. This case is also very similar to a case I have seen about children born on leap year dates like 29th of February and which date they will also have to choose to celebrate on in years that are not leap years.",

      "body": "They are still twins and will always be, the interval of 4mins doesn't change anything about them being together even though the timing to when the both arrived varies with year but i will only advise if they can both use the same year especially to claim the new year since the interval is not that much considering avoiding differences, while in their certificate they can bith have the exact time and date but don't necessarily have to claim the two at once, or better they have thesa certificate bearing the same year but only little time changes.",

All that matters is that the time interval is not much and they are categorically a twin of grace. This cam of scenerio happens twice in every 10,000 babies.",
