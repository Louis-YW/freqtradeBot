It still says \"Subscriptions Application submitted Â· Waiting for review\" and it's been over a month.DMing Premium Support didn't help; I got a standard answer and no ETA (you are in line), and the same happened when I emailed them.Does anyone know how to speed this process up?Addendum: i asked on X around but no one could answer that question and on reddit in the subreddit its quiet about. Greets, Ray",

But all you need to exert more is patience. Or try to give them some follow up and maybe that will do. You're welcome, Ray.",
