Genuine companies need genuine reviews that will stick. Does your service stick on Trustpilot? Dont think so, because your site doesn't have a single review on there. However, probably, the scam and fraudulent people are your target audience and you can't resist it, because how on Earth will you detect them since you want sales too. And the only way a genuine company will need a fake review is for black hat purposes, to hunt their competitors down. Good you outruled such a service, but it's all about offers here and rules can change. On the whole, I think your site needs some Trustpilot reviews too. It's too obvious not to have a single fake review for yourself. Thank you.",

It's too obvious not to have a single fake review for yourself. Thank you. We only provide sticky reviews and yes, they stick on Trustpilot too. If you have any doubts, feel free to purchase using a middleman/escrow. The fact we do not have any reviews on our profile does not imply our reviews do not stick. Would you even trust such reviews if you saw? I don't think so. Instead of flooding our pages with fake reviews, we accept escrows and safe payment methods such as PayPal - as long as you are a trusted user.These false accusations are the reason why we don't usually advertise our services to the general public. Instead, we have been working in close contact with online merchants and small businesses within private groups and communities. We carefully select our customers and we do not deal with scammers.Plenty of legit businesses have purchased online reviews from us. For obvious reasons, we can not disclose the name or any other information regarding our customers. If you think that \"the only way a genuine company will need a fake review is for black hat purposes\", just take a look at most hosting services such as Ionos or Siteground. Do they look like real reviews to you? Majority of their positive reviews are fake and we are talking about multi-billion companies.If our services are against the rules, our sales thread will be removed. However, I see plenty of users selling stolen accounts, gift cards and other kinds of illegal products. I don't see anyone enforcing the rules against these users. My team and I provide real services that are targeted at genuine businesses. Even a new restaurant can benefit from fake reviews. We invite you to try out our services and reconsider your statements.",

Because a real product does not require fake reviews, customers automatically leave positive reviews when they are satisfied with the product/service.
