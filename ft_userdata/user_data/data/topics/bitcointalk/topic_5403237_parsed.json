  "content": "I noticed that recently on @bitcoin twitter most users thought that price would reach $15K prior to $25K in the next few months (out of 28.7K votes), with 60% believing price will close the month of June below $20K (40.9K votes). It seems that most Bitcoiners and those following the cryptocurrency are thinking the worse is yet to come. Do bitcointalk users feel the same, who have been in the space for a little longer?My current outlook is that price will either rebound from the $17.5K lows towards $30K, or otherwise if this support is broken then price will capitulate further to $12K.Quote from: dragonvslinux on June 19, 2022, 02:39:29 PMPrice is currently at the 0.236 retracement level \"line in the sand\" since the 2020 lows to the 2021 highs. This is where we saw consolidation in late 2020, so not unsurprising to see a bounce from this previous resistance zone. The positive here is the same as the negative imo. There is a big volume gap between $20K and $30K. Likewise, there is a big gap between $17.5K and $12K. Even zooming out further, there isn't much more volume until $12K. [...]Based on volume alone, it won't be difficult for price to re-test $30K if $20K is reclaimed. Likewise, it wouldn't be difficult to reach $12K if $17.5K support is lost, despite how oversold price currently is. I personally don't understand much fixation with the $14K or $15K level, to me they appear to be of little trading interest. More relevantly, a so-called \"typical\" 83% correction would be $12K, not $14K or $15K.I's a potentially bleak outlook, but if the 200 Week MA is reclaimed (currently $22.4K), then I believe it will confirm a bottom for many, and therefore price would be unlikely to fall lower than $17.5K again.",

The market is bullish presently as bitcoin increased back to $20000 and moving towards $21000, but if the bear market continues, I do not think it will decrease up to $12000, I am predicting$15000.",

Hence why I'd really want bitcoin to drop more. Also, I definitely could be very very wrong but I think BTC's dominance should rise up from here first. This huge drop was mostly caused by liquidation cascades that I don't think we've seen much retail selling yet.",

Investors will know that some new projects out there can't last long and this is also the reason why I'm not investing into new projects anymore. It's very risky for me knowing that the chances of these projects to die or to be abandoned is very high. Most of the new altcoins that are being created is just because of the hype or they are just following the trend and some of them don't have any use case at all like you said. They don't have their own brand at all which kinda frustrates me a bit but it is what it is. As for the OP, I still believe that we might reach the $12k price . I just based it on the 2018-2018 crash. With what is happening right now, I still don't see any catalysts that might affect the price movement of Bitcoin or at least there are no reasons for it to make a trend reversal at all.",
