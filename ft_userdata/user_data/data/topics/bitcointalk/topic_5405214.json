  "content": "Hello all,So I decided on which wallet I want to use, which is the Bitcoin Core wallet. It's familiar to an altcoin wallet I used many years ago, in the way that it has to sync all blocks and uses a wallet.dat file as backup.I wanted to know if it's enough for me to simply backup the wallet.dat file on an encrypted USB stick? This way I can practically remove Bitcoin Core from my desktop and if I ever wanted to send my funds elsewhere I can re-import the wallet.dat file again, but I can still send funds to this wallet.I also wonder, if this wallet.dat file is stolen by someone, but my wallet was encrypted, is the wallet.dat file encrypted? Or was that just a local encryption for my desktop.I would love to just be able to store my holy wallet.dat file away for many years and be able to re-gain access to my wallet using this file, primarily through other wallets too if Bitcoin Core wallet seizes to exist by then.And perhaps it's also possible, or necessary to store individual private keys in text on a seperate device such as an encrypted USB stick? I was thinking the private keys could be encoded in an encoding language to make them slightly extra secure incase any thief has no idea what he's doing.",

Or just keep a spare laptop dedicated to your offline Bitcoin Core, so you can easily get new deposit addresses in the future.",

With a Bitcoin Core feature or an external tool.So far, there's no BIP to encrypt HD/BIP 32 seed with password/passphrase. The other option is use common encryption algorithm (such as AES-256) through offline/open-source tool such as https://cryptotools.net/aes. But since it's not standard/popular method to encrypt HD/BIP 32 seed, you also need to write down how to encrypt/decrypt it and backup relevant software/tool.That's what scares me, having a hidden bug when using the tool to encrypt the seed or not being able to find a good version of the tool when I want to decrypt the seed in several years. That's why I'd need a very standardized and reliable tool to encrypt a HD seed. BIP38 seemed perfect for that.",
