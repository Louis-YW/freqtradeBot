Everybody has a different view on the subject. Some people don't like crypto and never invest in it and some other worship it like they found god. Some other people think it as just another investment vehicle and some other people use it as a currency. The answer varies from person to person.I think bitcoin itself is a safe network as long as you own the keys of your funds but its value against the dollar fluctuates and that might create some problems if you are not a long term player/investor.",

However, you were not prepared for this question simply because you know little about Bitcoin and blockchain technology and how they come into play with the acceptance by people and the world government. The coin has opened the eye of the world to blockchain technology and has advanced digital payment systems which some governments are now building upon. This is not a project that will just disappear so soon, so, anyone could trust it. I recommend you to read to educate yourself and your friend:Forbes Education On Crypto",

But after the bear season ends, bitcoin always recovers after that and hits a new ATH. The crash is not a scary thing but an opportunity because to profit from bitcoin investment, we need to buy low and sell high, and when bitcoin crashes, it is buying opportunity. I think what your friend is worried about is that bitcoin is going to disappear forever, not crash, and I also want to answer that bitcoin will never die or disappear.",

They have different reasons to crash like pumps and dumps, rug pulls, hacks. They can be crashed if Bitcoin falls considerable. Hopefully you and your friend see difference here. Bitcoin falls considerable and other cryptocurrencies crash.If your friend trust other cryptocurrencies but don't trust Bitcoin, he has bad decision.A better question is \"Does Bitcoin not have crash like other assets like stocks, golds, crude oil?\"Stocks, crude oil have falls or crashes like Bitcoin. In 2020, crude oil was traded -$30.",

We should tell them how when bitcoin crashed a few years back, let them see what happened that year.

When he will realise the true potential of the coin, he will automatically join the forum. Moreover anything can happen in future, government can impose strict rules against bitcoins or more worse. So yes currently teach him how independently he can control his finances if he uses Bitcoins. Also say him that he can treat Bitcoins as an asset and can hold it and sell it at more profit. If still he doesn’t wants to join, then leave him at his own way.",

It is a common mistake that many of us did but trust me, you don't wanna that responsibility. Let's say that you talk someone into buying some bitcoin and then it crashes like 75% (which has happened more than once) and in the end your friend might blame you for talking him into it.Quote from: Ayers on February 18, 2023, 08:01:30 AMrs after that and hits a new ATH.
