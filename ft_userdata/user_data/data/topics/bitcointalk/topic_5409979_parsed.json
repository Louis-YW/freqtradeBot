You should also voice your concerns on discord. Devs are super engaging there.Does Doge wallet/core work on linux out of the box without anything done by the user ? Check. Does Neoxa ? Check. Does KawKaw ? Fail. You are missing the point, no user should need to compile crap or go on lib version linking nonsense. It's not user responsibility to make software work, it's developers responsibility. It's unprofessional & bad tone. Software development 101 concepts really.How it's carbon copy ? Take a look at the code may be. I am not saying one coin superiority over another here. I am talking about poor development, especially when you have fully functional reference sources. Is it that tough to install couple of VMs with different distros  and see how it behaves there and adjust accordingly ? Not at all.",
