  "content": "The true identity of Satoshi Nakamo is a mystery that some has tried to unravel in the past and failed. But here's a new one. I came across this tweet by Sean Murray on X where he made an interesting theory linking Jack Dorsey to Satoshi Nakamoto. Would like to know what you guys think.\"Jack Dorsey was:1 of ~1,300 confirmed cypherpunks in 1996 (his UMR email).Wore an Adam Back t-shirt in the UMR yearbook. UMR students were called Miners.Was a CompSci & Math major with an interest in crypto.Member of ACM in 1997 to at least 1999.Created academic research paper submission & review software for Mira Digital Publishing.Known to use: OpenBSD, Windows, Mac, Linux.Confirmed to code in: C, Python, Java, Perl, PHP, OCaml, JoCaml, Lisp, ObjC and more.Still on the cypherpunk mailing list in 2000 under his dnet .com email.Wrote a manifesto about making a mark without leaving a trace in 2001.Subscriber to cryptome .org in 2001.Made a blog post where he jokingly says he is working on a network for drug traffickers.Posted a bio in 2003 that says he is into crypto, pseudonyms, 4am hacks, and more.Posted in 2003 that he is ending his dependence on the US dollar and creating a barter network.Referred to himself as Jak instead of Jack. Jak was his pseudonym.Jack, who was a sailor, tweeted on 8/17/08: Around the horn and home again, for that's the sailor's way\". Bitcoin .org was registered the next day.Jack's twitter profile from Sept '07 - Jan '09 said he was a sailor.The original Bitcoin source code included an old sailor's adage. \"Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three\".The original Bitcoin source code documents are all timestamped as being created at exactly 4AM, just like Jack's bio.The original Bitcoin source code documents contain a brute forced example vanity bitcoin address that starts with NS17 (Nakamoto Satoshi 1/7 ). The documents were created 1/7/09.Satoshi accidentally logged into IRC on 1/10/09 using a real IP, revealing he was in California (where Jack was).The first bitcoin transaction took place on Jack's mom's birthday (1/11/09).Satoshi joined the bitcoin forum on Jack's birthday (11/19).Satoshi's last mined block was on Jack's dad's birthday (5/3/10).Satoshi told Hal in an email about vanity bitcoin addresses and showed him a SECOND one beginning with NS.Jack sends bitcoin to 4 addresses after Hal, including one that has jD2m in the middle. Jack lived at 2 Mint Plaza in San Francisco. Jack Dorsey 2 Mint (jD2m).Satoshi tells Martti Malmi that he is really busy with work. Jack was busy launching his next startup, Square (now Block).Satoshi tells people on the forum not to donate Bitcoins to Wikileaks on 12/5/10.Twitter is hit with a secret court order with a gag requirement to turn over everything it has about Wikileaks on 12/14/10.Satoshi stopped logging into the forum on 12/13/10 and never returned.Jack is made Executive Chairman of Twitter while remaining CEO of Square on 3/28/11 and he tweets that he is very busy with both.Satoshi sends his last email on 4/23/11.Twitter's tech lead suggests that Twitter might integrate bitcoin payments on 5/23/11.Jack Dorsey calls Bitcoin an Amazing Movement in September 2012 and said that Square would accept it if it became huge and accepted.Jack's best friend Alyssa Milano writes a novel (Hacktivist) in the Summer of 2013 about Jack, in which she places him as living a double life behind a famous pseudonym.Square announces Bitcoin acceptance on 3/31/14.Satoshi's gmx email is hacked on 9/8/14 and the hacker attempts to extort Satoshi by sharing that he knows about his connection to St. Louis, Missouri. Jack is from St. Louis.Alyssa Milano writes a 2nd novel about Jack (Hacktivist). In this one, Jack's famous pseudonym is hijacked and his software developed in a way that was not intended. The hijacker has a logo that looks almost exactly like Gavin Andresen's Bitcoin Faucet logo. It was released in installments with the first one going out on 7/29/15.Two weeks later on 8/15/15, Satoshi reappears on the bitcoin mailing list to address the bitcoin block size debates. People are shocked about Satoshi's return and some doubt it is really him but could not disprove it.On 10/15/15, Jack is made permanent CEO of Twitter, officially making him CEO of two companies.The last installment of Milano's novel about Jack is published, in which its ends by him returning as head to his social network.Square publishes a children's book in January 2018 to explain the \"Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto\" in which it makes its Satoshi character look like Jack.On 4/20/20 Lex Fridman asks Jack if he is Satoshi, to which Jack tells him that he wouldn't admit it to him if he was. This is in contrast to Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney all saying explicitly that they were not Satoshi.On 5/25/20 - 145 very old bitcoin addresses signed a message stating that Craig Wright was not Satoshi and that he was a liar and a fraud. The oldest bitcoin address that signed the message started with 1jak (Jack's old pseudonym) and the oldest that signed it contained HiSQ in the middle. SQ is the ticker for his company Square.In February of 2022 Jack starts wearing a Satoshi shirt, first on a Michael Saylor podcast and then at the Super Bowl.On 10/27/23, Jack said at a conference that \"Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved.\"Craig Wright's attorneys argue in early 2024 that if Craig Wright was not Satoshi \"then the real Satoshi would have been expected to come forward to counter the claim.\" It did not dawn on them that the person countering the claim was Jack Dorsey, who was the basis for the COPA v Wright legal challenge to begin with. Jack Dorsey came forward to counter the claim.On 7/21/24 Jack wrote on Nostr, \"I frequently imagine Satoshi sitting back somewhere and laughing at it all.\"On 8/28/24 Jack went on Nostr and thanked Hal Finney (now deceased) for his help.Jack parades himself around in a Satoshi shirt\".Source: https://x.com/financeguy74/status/1890850549035110558?t=AgtdtDexZZ022esNRyzFLQ&s=19",

There was even an entire lore to support this saying he put people on the Square office to work evenings so he could accommodate. The truth? He was never in either office. As any self respecting executive, he would spend most of his time holidaying. None of his employees saw him hardly ever after a certain point of Twitter having hit the mainstream. He remained CEO because it was convenient. His power to enact decisions was miniscule. All he cared about was keeping his fund initiative. Jack Dorsey is a very elusive person. Hardly anyone knows him. Alyssa Milano supposedly being a friend of him is an extreme exaggeration. Jack never confirmed any of this. Anyone who has been following Jack knows that he's the kind of person that never shows any strong opinions. He's opinionated alright, but never seems to care about influencing the world with speech. He's just a guy that struck rich and the capitalist self-made myth that developed around him became so funny that he never denied it. He has never even claimed to be a good programmer himself, yet listen to what people are saying.",
