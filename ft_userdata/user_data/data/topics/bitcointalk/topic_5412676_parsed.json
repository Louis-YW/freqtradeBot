Asking if the deposit and promotional offers on the gambling site would be what is encouraging gambling with unstable coins. I am not also sure, it would be good if OP ask the question in an understandable way.",

I'm not particularly sure though if he's talking about gambling games in general or p2e games since there's a difference between the two. If it was the former then I don't honestly think it matters, try them all and see what you enjoy since every gambling game is reliant on luck anyway whether it's slots, dice, etc., unless you go for sports gambling. Maybe Poker, Blackjack and other types of similar card games but they're still highly reliant on luck. If it was the latter though, then you're in the wrong board mate.",

For reference maybeShould be in the altcoin discussions. Actually, you can just try to browse there and you will find a lot of threads created about play-to-earn games. Your starting post is confusing and I think you are just excited that's why you are having a hard time focusing on what you meant.Ask questions one at a time. We are not in a hurry here. If you like to talk about P2E games then try the altcoin section and if what you want to discuss is not there then create a new thread. While if you want gambling and some freebies like faucets, games, or freebies. Try the Gambling Discussion or Games and Rounds .",

Also, I have never chased bonuses or incentives in casinos as I believe it is a huge money sink: the more you chase it, the less enjoyment you'll get from your gambling session.",

That said, I only bet on games that I know and have information about, in the past I even tried to bet on random things, but the result was that I lost a lot and stopped doing that. Today I only bet on games I knowQuote from: Uang_kartal on September 07, 2022, 04:51:36 AMdon't you try a game that's a little different?Trying a different game requires spending a lot more time on research, one would have to spend a lot of time on researching the new game and spend a lot of money on testing with small amount of money before starting to make serious bets. I don't see much advantage of this when the person is making a profit from betting on games he knowsQuote from: Uang_kartal on September 07, 2022, 04:51:36 AMwhy and for how long?The answer to this question is quite simple:if i'm making a profit on betting games i know then i would only switch games if i started not making profit on betting games i don't know",

Once we find our comfort zone, we get rid of trying new games and that is normal. We only try new games after weeks or months of playing. We could only say that a game isn't good once we try it and we could be adventurous as we want and discover more games if we want to get more familiar with everything.",
