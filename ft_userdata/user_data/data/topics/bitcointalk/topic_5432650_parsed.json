Right? :-PMy thoughts too. Surely at $18 million if you cared about the funds you'd think twice about storing them online or in any way that'd make them easier to attack. Edit: unless the funds were held by those keys to confirm whether they had been compromised or not - an attacker finding $2 million might be happier with that instant reward over trying harder to mess up more systems. Also, the lack of signed message doesn't make much sense either - it would be one of the fastest and most reliable ways to prove the key was actually compromised rather than the twitter account.",

While I'm on the side that his social handle was compromised and the tweet could likely be fud created by who controls the account now, I would also say that should it be true, it doesn't reflect on the state of the Bitcoin protocol.An experienced user can make a mistake an slip up, this doesn't make Bitcoin less safe or secure, it just means that someone wo should know better didn't.Quote from: BayAreaCoins on January 02, 2023, 03:22:15 AMIf Luke can get hacked... a lot of others can be too.If a lot of others don't make any mistakes when ensuring their security, they would not get compromised.",

Is he one of forum moderators?Luke-Jr is not a forum moderator, but a person very important for Bitcoin, for Bitcoin development and also for its history. He is one of the most iconic figures which worked for Bitcoin. According to his LinkedIn profile, he works on developing Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core since 2011. Among his greatest achievements, he mentions the following the following (highlight is mine):- Longest-contributing Bitcoin Core developer, since the start of 2011- Lead maintainer of the enhanced Bitcoin Knots derivative- Diagnosis and addressing of various security issues, some critical to the Bitcoin network (including many CVEs)- Assist in community outreach/education by regular interaction on Twitter and reddit, as well as occasional conferences and meetups- Current editor/maintainer of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals standards process and repository- Maintainer of BFGMiner (formerly cgminer) Bitcoin mining software- Ongoing research into protocol changes (hardforks, softforks, extension blocks, forward blocks, etc)- Ongoing research into safe block sizes/weights, network security models, etc- Maintain real-time Bitcoin network statistical information, monitoring network security, software being used, etc- Maintain Gentoo packages for various software projects, including Bitcoin Core and Knots- Helped design Segwit as a softfork (BIP 141), and updated getblocktemplate for Segwit (BIPs 9 & 145)- Assisted in careful deployment of the BIP 148 Segwit UASF, avoiding a possible catastrophic chain split- Wrote KYCPoll, polling software to use Bitcoin exchange KYC for human verification, to aide in measuring community support for proposals- Research into the concept of sidechains and co-authored the original sidechains whitepaper- Primary author of \"getblocktemplate\" decentralized mining protocol standard (BIP 22/23) as well as reference implementations in C and Python- Founder and former operator of Eligius mining pool- Provided an alternative implementation of P2SH (OP_CHECKHASHVERIFY, BIP 17)- Designed a number of mining pool reward systems to ensure fair division of mining rewards- Expanded BTC precision from 2 decimal points to 8.All in all, when even such profilic coder, which such vast knowledge, gets into such situation, we all should raise question marks. What actually happened to him? How was his key compromised? What can we also do to better ourselves and avoid such situation? Is there anything he could do do avoid this? And so on...",
