If they all do the same thing then it's bound to happen that the project that's going to have more people using it will have more survivability because compared to their other competition that's offering almost the same thing, that's one of the reasons why a lot of crypto projects failed, they were destroyed by their competition and there's really not a lot of stuff that they're offering besides the same solution, now if only they're creative and are dedicated to their works, they might be an industry standard right now. Another reason for a lot of failures is that there's a lot of rug pull and scam crypto projects out there and the people that run this projects are making bank which makes it lucrative for them to just do scam projects instead of a legitimate one.",

This service of banks could have saved millions of failed projects from failure,firstly. banks cannot \"just print\" and spend.. they have contracts that allow them certain reasons to print. they cant just magic money out of nothing and buy an asset. its actually created via loans.. even a bond is a loanQuote from: DashingAgent on December 05, 2023, 04:06:33 AMBanks are well aware that printing dollars or euros creates deflation rather than inflation against the cryptocurrency projects on the Blockchain platform, Because it reduces the volume of dollars or euros in public circulation to support cryptocurrencies,secondly it wont create deflation because buying into a project or buying a coin does not burn the fiat.. instead the project manager/coin seller gets the fiat. so fiat still ends up in circulation so its still inflation",

And since many crypto projects have no clear economics and are just following trends, there is no point in paying attention to them, especially as banks are restricted by regulations that do not allow them to deal with crypto.",

The problem is that whatever exists cannot satisfy everyone, either you have to prove your ability to influence and change things that you feel are wrong, or you should like to think that things that are wrong with you are.The banking system has many limitations, but to be more frank, we are not completely opposed. Let's know the balance between traditional tools and new things. And don't overemphasize the issue of crypto investment by borrowing through banks, because the main bridge is the person using the service. So instead of blaming anything, consider your own mistakes, and in the crypto space, we also have negative/positive things that are all created by ourselves.",

      "body": "OP, what are you even saying???This is just the opposite, I don't know why you are mixing the world of banks/fiat with that of cryptocurrency. As a bank is a business, crypto projects are businesses for many others too. Now tell me, why would banks leave their own business to poke noses into the businesses of another? Of course, if those behind the crypto project have the necessary collateral, they could be helped by banks for loans and others. But you don't expect banks to be fully involved in the projects/businesses that is not theirs or have interest in, and neither should you expect them to market their projects for them.I urge you to start from the basis by learning about this to see the difference in these sectors, maybe you will be able to retract your claims here because I can't imagine why they could have been conceived by you in the first place. And I believe that as with any other projects, if the government did not prevent banks from providing support, nothing is stopping them, however, they must be partners or have an interest in such projects.Economically also, central banks and governments are not so interested in cryptocurrency if that is what you want, and you can't blame them because they can't oversight it, so it's not their fault. But you can't expect the central government and central banks to be so particular about cryptocurrency. The reason is clear, they can't just do that for non-centralized entities.",

      "body": "I personally have other thoughts about Banks. And I really don't understand the train of thought conveyed by the OP. Because you should know that nowadays, even many beginners are enthusiastic about investing in crypto by taking loans from banks. And many have succeeded in getting benefits from these loans. I remember in this forum there was a user who made a topic or post about himself taking a loan from the bank to invest in Bitcoin and he bought it for under 30k dollars of course. maybe around 22k or 25k. I forgot the details. But I'm sure that now he has made a lot of profit thanks to the help of the money he borrowed from the bank. However, this is indeed risky. But for that person the Bank loan must have made him a profit now. But that's not the crux of the problem. What I mean is that even though we may not like the centralized system used by banks. But actually, directly and indirectly, we have been helped by the current world banking and financial system, especially digitally. Maybe the emergence of Bitcoin is much more helpful and now I prefer not to save money in the bank. Except for my daily needs in using debit and credit cards. So I think we can't expect much from the Bank. But we also have to remember that the previous bull run of liquidity filling the crypto market was also the result of Central Banks printing money around the world to help people affected by the pandemic and quarantined. and many people used it to invest in crypto at that time.",
