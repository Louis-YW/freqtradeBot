  "content": "QuoteThough the real world impacts of FTX’s spectacular crash have yet to fully settle, Amazon’s reportedly moving forward with a miniseries about the bankrupt crypto exchange and its infamous former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.Anthony and Joe Russo’s AGBO production company is attached to produce the show, and the brothers are reportedly considering coming on to direct multiple episodes. Variety reports that Amazon has tapped Invasion co-creator Dave Weil to executive produce the currently unnamed eight episode miniseries that details how Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX, and went on to lead the company to a liquidity crisis that ultimately resulted in his being ousted. While no showrunners or casting announcements have been made yet, Amazon is said to be eyeing a number of actors the Russos worked with during their stint directing Marvel’s blockbusters like Avengers: Infinity War.In the years since Avengers: Endgame’s 2019 release, the Russos have largely focused on relatively smaller projects at AGBO like Netflix’s The Gray Man starring Chris Evans, Apple TV Plus’ Cherry starring Tom Holland, and The Daniels’ Everything Everywhere All at Once. A drama about a group of young people riding the crypto train right up to and over the edge of a cliff sounds very much like the sort of project that AGBO might be into, but it isn’t immediately clear what the Russos — who are best known for their action and superhero movies — might bring to this story.In a statement about the series, Amazon Studios CEO Jennifer Salke called Weil and the Russos the ideal partners “to bring this multifaceted story to our global Prime Video audience,” and the Russos remarked on how the mess at FTX is ripe for dramatization.“It crosses many sectors—celebrity, politics, academia, tech, criminality, sex, drugs, and the future of modern finance,” the Russos said. “At the center of it all sits an extremely mysterious figure with complex and potentially dangerous motivations. We want to understand why.”According to Variety, specific details for the show’s story are being sourced from “‘insider reporting’ by a number of journalists,” but Amazon has not disclosed which journalists or newsrooms it’s pulling from. While are currently no other details about the upcoming series, Amazon is reportedly aiming to kick off production some time next spring.https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/23/23475998/amazon-ftx-show-sam-bankman-friedAccording to this, amazon is hiring the production company behind the avengers infinity wars and endgame films to produce an 8 episode mini series about Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX. Apple also tried to buy up the rights to this but apparently amazon outbid them.If wallstreet history and culture are portrayed accurately, it could make for an interesting learning and entertainment experience for the public. Similar to Leonardo Decaprio in Wolf of Wallstreet. Is there anything that Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX bring to the table that hasn't already been covered by Wolf of Wallstreet? They have a polygamy angle and league of legend until you pass out binge sessions. What aspect of the story are they planning to focus upon as the most compelling component. Will Sam Bankman be portrayed as a sympathetic character or a misunderstood superhero given that they hired producers of the avengers. I get the feeling that hollywood has tried to transform stories like FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried into blockbuster hits in the past. Although I don't remember specifics atm.",

And since it's currently unnamed, I want to suggest a name for it. I would call it \"FTXed\".",

And the context is still ... developing. See CZ / Coinbase drama.Quote from: Betwrong on November 28, 2022, 10:41:09 AMAnd since it's currently unnamed, I want to suggest a name for it.

Instead giving widespread spotlight to a failure and the pain of thousands of people in the crypto space, they could make a series of how Bitcoin has make the life of many people from developing countries easier (they would not even need to pay for rights).

Although I don't remember specifics atm.I like watching such films because it helps to unveil certain secrets and teach certain lessons if the story is accurate and not manipulated to suit certain interest. Except Sam Bankman-Fried have other hidden truths, he has nothing to say than how he mismanaged people's funds and caused pains and suffering to many. Nobody cares about his character because it is inconsequential, would it help people get back their funds. It is the common man that bears the burden when crypto related firms go bankrupt, now they want to create a film so that people would spend their money to watch how someone mismanaged their funds. It is a pity that it is the poor that bears the brunt for the mistake of the rich and the rich would still make more money from the mistake.",

Apple also tried to buy up the rights to this but apparently amazon outbid them.This sounds weird, probably the right news is:Pornhub is hiring Ron Jeremy and the crew behind Babysitters and Debbie Does Dallas to produce an 8-episode parody about SBF and FTX, Penthouse also tried to buy the rights but withdraw when realizing what actors it would need to hire to play the series.They bought the rights before the investigation is over if the news breaks out about some more of FTX funds going into the wrong pockets they might have to drop the production altogether if there would be even more unfortunate events nobody will support making a movie about this guy. Plus there is the thing of the audience, who would pay to hear and watch a story about something you don't have a clue about like cypto, and which cypto lover is going to pay extra to watch the story on how his investments went south? Plus, you have a lot of characters in that future movie who you're not sure won't end up in prison by next summer.Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 28, 2022, 11:44:39 AMI find it more an attempt to milk recent events in the way Neflix has done it with F1 in \"Drive to Survive\".

I just hope that Amazon producers show the reality and what really happened inside those walls. To make series on the financial crisis at such huge extent they must study every bit of scenario carefully. It is going to be based on the real story and not just the random fiction story. I hope they will have the best men at work to study whole case. Meet real persons, go inside walls and dig out what really happened. I already see it coming and millions of people gonna hold their patience until it gets released.",

Promote fear of bitcoin and also cash in big: two birds with one stone.Indeed.It only takes a look to the recent news on the collapse of FTX, specially on center-left media channels to notice how they are not only very against the damage done to investors and retailers who had their money on the exchange, they do not only blame this on the mismanagement of funds by an irresponsible CEO, but the hosts of these news also invite crypto-skeptics to expand the FUD beyond a failed centralized platform to Bitcoin itself. I believe Amazon would do the same, so would Microsoft, Google and many other giants of the technology sector.",

I think and feel that SBF is using his money and influence to beautify and make himself look good in the cryptocurrency community.I am full of doubts about that matter, especially since SBF uses the media for its interest to make SBF appear to be a good person. But I hope that when they make that miniseries, they will show the truth and not what it seems will be the result, SBF's image will be even better. When this happens, it's not a good sign.",
