  "content": "In the society we find ourselves today, the issue of rebellion amongst pastor's children is something that has caused a lot of concerns. As Christianity is one of the major religions in Nigeria, a man of God is highly regarded, not just in the society, but in his congregation, and the members look up to their leaders and the expectation that the children follow in the footsteps of the parents is not abnormal. But it's also not a new thing for some of these expectations to not be met as the issue of rebellion can be traced back to biblical times. For some children, the responsibilities and expectations can be too much that they feel like the only way they can achieve something or be heard is to rebel. While others go astray as a result of negligence.  I've heard some say of a pastor's child who has gone wayward that they have been led astray by evil friends. Asides from the above listed , what else can push a pastor's child to rebel? Is it too much expectations or what?",

I've known children of pastors that really were rebelling against their parents at a young age up to their teenage.And then when they've grown up and experienced the bitter truth about this life, they go back to their calling and continue the path of what their parents have started, which is to address the ministry that's been set on their shoulders. That's why I think, age is a big factor and also too much expectation from these children. Nobody's perfect but we compare and try to comprehend because they've got good parents that should lead them as an example.",

Pastor or imam are just spiritual fathers and at that, their still need to take care of their physical responsibilities, but nowadays, too much involvement in spiritual activities have made a lot of those pastors to become too busy that their children are left in the hands of mads and other caregivers who are total strangers and does not have experience enough as to early childhood training and this have led to the children lacking that basic parental guide that will shape their early unruly childhood characters and this has become one of the major issues in our today's society.",

Most Pastor's can not go in the ways of their parents probably because intently the ways of their parents is not their desires and because Satan knew that, he will wants to take advantage of that situations. I know of a pastors daughter that whenever the father has a crusade is an opportunity for her to stay with her boyfriend. She will dress fine enter church and escape from the church to go meet some guys. Dude, this things are serious cases but is more likely to be kind of spiritual battle that's why the parents can't control them, some even smokes, womanize, drugs and stealing. And that affect more pastors in such situations.",

      "body": "Religion has its rules and practices that would make a person somehow rebel as it will suffocate the person, especially the pastors' children. Pastors are the one that teaches the word of God, making the religion going and embraced. They are Godly, and people are quick to expect a lot from the children of them being what they parents are. They will carry it along like it is their surname, and that is where the problems arises because they are being subjected and caged, putting them in a pedestal, expecting them to take the path. They rebel because they would want to get out the narrative, pushing them to do the things that they do not expect. The thing with children, when they did not understand how things work, they would do things outside the box and try everything that people are limiting them. Seeing their parents, who are pastors, and doing every good deeds, of course they would take pride but when they started getting negative criticism, it could get in their head and think they are no better so they would just prove them right instead of changing their mind.",

Asides from the above listed , what else can push a pastor's child to rebel? Is it too much expectations or what? The main problem is that society expects too much from pastors and their families. They are humans who are not spirits so they are also affected by the growing ills in society. When the pastor or his children commits any crime it receives wide condemnation, meanwhile, most of us are guilty of even greater offenses. In my country, a child that is 18 is responsible for his actions and not the parents. So the pastor's child is responsible for his/her action. I agree that some clergymen focus more on the church, leaving their children to suffer from parental neglect. It is the responsibility of the pastor to raise their children based on the dictate of the Bible so that they can be good examples to the family and community. But I see the pastor and his family as a common family like mine, so I don't expect much from them.",

The difference is that the clergy will overcome these social devices easily because he is guided by God and lives a holy life. The pastor child can be influenced by his friends and age groups. Children are easily influenced by the society. If the pastor is always in the church based on his spiritual assignments and neglect his responsibilities as a father. It is possible that his children will turn the other way round. The devil can also play his own role to disorganize the pastor's child to go against his father's will to make the pastor not to stay focus on God.",

Simply because their parents has some religious obligation does not have them bound to the same fate. They are entitled to their own way of life and choices and their personality are sometimes considered as rebellion by the \"members\" of their parent's congregation.Moreso, I would also add that their attitudes are easily noticed because it is almost as though they are placed in the spotlight of the church and sometimes other parents who are members of the church use them as yardstick to judge the behavioral pattern of their own children but this is very wrong!I know that if other members of the church are carefully examined, we will discover lots of other members that are alot more rebellious than the pastor's children.",

Not all children of pastors are rebellious, some are actually very well behaved and good representatives for their pastor parents.",

In some homes pastors forget that in church they are suppose to be the pastor of the church but at home they're no longer the pastor but a father who have to lead the children in the way of life and probably use some scriptures to address them and not making it compulsory that they [children] must follow their ways.Some of these actions force children to act the way they feel like whenever they find themselves outside their homes, like they feel free when they're not with their pastor if a father, they get wild oand friends also contribute to some of these act.Is even hard for a pastor to teach his or her child/children sex education. It would be bad for them [children] to learn those things outside from friends and in a wrong way, so some behaviors of pastors to their children can make the children rebel against them.",

      "body": "Here is why many sincere people, including children of religious leaders, are falling away. They are impatient. What are they impatient about? The things that Jesus taught that the church doesn't teach about.For example, Jesus says in Matthew 7:7,8:Quote from: https://www.biblehub.com/niv/matthew/7.htm7“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.Yet, how many times do we ask and NOT receive? Why? After all, if it was not God's will for us to receive it, Jesus wouldn't have said it.The structure of the universe must be maintained. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness after He had fasted for 40 days and was very hungry, the Tempter said, \"If you are the Son of God, command that these stones be made into bread.\" Jesus answered, \"Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.\" In other words, asking and receiving must come through every word that God has brought into existence throughout the operation - physics - of the universe.St. Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter 4:Quote from: https://www.biblehub.com/niv/2_corinthians/4.htm6For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ.7But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.In other words, we have the treasure of the power of God that brings us to salvation, and can bring us into all kinds of powerful and wonderful things, NOT because we are being denied these things in our jars of clay (our bodies), but to show that the power is from God and not from us. After all, look at how powerful our bodies are; nobody knows how they work they are so full of the knowledge that God has placed in them.St. Paul goes on to say:Quote from: https://www.biblehub.com/niv/2_corinthians/4.htm12So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.Death was at work in the Gospel preachers, because they were bypassing all kinds of powerful things that they could do and be, just to bring the message of the Gospel of Life - Jesus salvation - to the people.Since everything operates through every word of God (the physics of the universe), and since every power is given through the grace that Jesus provides through His work on the cross, why don't the churches have a training program to bring people into the use of the power of God that Jesus won for them... the power of, \"Ask and it will be given to you,\" etc.?The children of Christian leaders are simply impatient and frustrated by their parents, the leaders. They are being told by Scripture that if they have faith they can move mountains, and nothing will be impossible for them. But nobody has a training course for them to use to get to the point of having a little more faith... to do some of these great and wondrous things. Rather, the church leaders keep on rebuilding the foundation of Jesus-salvation, often tearing it down somewhat to rebuild it again, instead of building on it, this Jesus-salvation foundation, the buildings of power.Meanwhile wicked people use the faith they have from God - even though they don't really know where it is from - to build all kinds of fantastic and powerful things in this world... some of which produce great evil.NOTE: The important thing is to maintain your personal salvation with Jesus, both before and after you start being built in the faith that you can use to move mountains.",
