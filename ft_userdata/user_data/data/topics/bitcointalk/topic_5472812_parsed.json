      "body": "Orphaned block are those block which are valid but are not added first to the blockchain because in the block header the parent block detail included in it is yet to be received. Example is when block 2 is propagated and block 1 is yet to be received, block 1 is the parent block for 2 and as such block 2 is dropped first till after the confirmation of the parent block which is 1. Stale block is that block which is propagated the simultaneously with another block and the nodes each accept any of the two blocks but the one which another block is built on top it becomes the accepted block because the longest chain is considered valid transaction and the other one is a stale block which it’s transactions are rendered invalid and can’t be spent because they are not in a valid block",

      "body": "Orphan blocks and stale blocks are different from each other, however many people use the terms interchangeably. You can click here to visit an article on Bitcoin Wiki about the difference between orphan blocks and stale blocks. The image you posted is trying to explain stale blocks. Quote from: Amphenomenon on November 04, 2023, 10:23:15 AMAlso, according to the image above, why is the orphan block still added to the blockchain though is not on main chain of the blockchain? The image isn't displaying a single chain. The image is displaying multiple chains. The blocks that are shown in purple have become invalid because the other chain have more work.",

They're added to the blockchain but might be replaced out later for a longer, more accepted chain.",

In short: orphan block is a block which has no parent, stale block is a block the  transactions of which  can be seen in the following blocks.BTW, according to  https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/n-orphaned-blocks the last orphans were dated  back  as far as June 14th, 2017",
