Just like Bitcoin, mixers weren’t created for illegal purposes, but some people still use them that way. That’s why Bitcoin eventually needed regulation, and we’re already at that stage.But when it comes to mixers, I’m not sure if regulation is even possible, since it would defeat their purpose of providing anonymity. There’s also the possibility that some of these mixers are being operated or controlled by criminals.So, nowadays, using mixers feels risky, you never know if your coins are being mixed with laundered funds, which could put you in trouble.",

I won't say they are bad, but sadly, they have become a medium for illegal activities, and the authorities have flagged their services. They might say that they are just a victim, but nobody believes such a thing since they are aware of the situation, yet they still accept it.I don't expect mixers will regain their reputation after having many negative claims. Because no matter how hard they tried to clean their reputation, the mindset of the people/users couldn't change, thinking that they were part of a big crypto scam and illegal activities.",

They could as well make use of decentralised platforms to make the funds untraceable. Mixers have been doing a great job in improving privacy for bitcoin users for long. There's definitely going to be a bad side. The government knows that cases like these would be inevitable in the future so they try every possible best to eradicate them. Aside privacy, some people use mixers for illicit activities. Even the government that may claim to be against it, no one is truly innocent. They act like that in public but may go dirty in the dark. This bybit case was unexpected and I guess their security team should try their best to improve on that.",

This attack on our exchange is a perfect example why we need to stimulate and support Bisq userbase growth imminently (which will be possible with Bisq Light Client within next 1-2 months), because nobody can judge a decentralized protocol.- Hopefully, Etherscan will reconsider the \"communnity note\" they put today for our address pushed as a result of misleading statements of some amateur researchers that harass us, given that ByBit exploiter funds do not enter our address anymore and it's just an obvious and proven fact, which everybody can confirm. This is basically a result of continuous witch hunting on us for being the last centralized accountless non-KYC exchange out there that doesn't scam its users, where some major hack unrelated to us is being used as a precedent to attack our reputation. For some reason, they haven't put such warnings for Thorchain Ethereum addresses, that have already processed more than 200 times the total amount we processed yesterday and will continue.For any questions, feel free to contact us using official channels (SimpleX, email and support tickets on our website).Love and prosperity to everyone,Sincerely yours,Johann from Private Project Facilitators LTD / eXch",

They can't intelligently shift the blame to mixers. They assured customers that their funds and data are safe and now recent events have proved that that is not the case, so they have no right to blame anything else other than themselves. What they should focus on is making sure something like this doesn't happen again. Quote from: Mia Chloe on February 24, 2025, 07:55:56 AMMy biggest concern about this bybit hack is the inconvenience it will cause to those that have huge stack of coins especially ETH because most of them will likely get their funds frozen too when the intend to move it.Do they have a right to do that? Can they simply freeze people's accounts because they want to move out their funds from the exchange? I doubt that because that will not be right. There has to be a legitimate reason before they freeze an account. Withdrawals were working fine during the hack too.",
