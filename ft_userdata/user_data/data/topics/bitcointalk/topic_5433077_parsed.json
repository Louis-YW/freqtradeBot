I mean people even use images of celebrities they find on internet as their profile pic. But will the celebs mind it or start suing people for this ? In fact, this is free publicity for them and they will be happy with more people using their pics as their profile pics. Same concept should apply here as well.",

The whole idea of them is ownership via blockchain proof. To use somebody else’s means you’ve effectively right click, saved & used it. It’s not illegal I don’t think but it’s kinda shady.",

It’s not illegal I don’t think but it’s kinda shady.Yes, but the point is on the ownership parts can't be enforced widely. It only exists on the blockchain and any platform that supports it. NFT marketplace is still prone to copycat, and on another platform, NFT users only rely on a platform that supports its, like Twitter feature to connect NFT.Copyright enforcement is non-existence within the NFT ecosystem. What should the users going to do? implement a strict DRM? The acts on OP are only a move to mock what has been a problem for NFT's ecosystem.",

Having that NFT doesn't give the assurance that no one will use it since its available in the public and its just a picture where you can easily get it. I wonder why NFT art got that far by just owning a picture where anyone can have the copy. Those critics might see the real value of that NFT but I don't think they should criticize him, maybe its better to educate him about NFT since it only works in blockchain and not on every market.",

The acts on OP are only a move to mock what has been a problem for NFT's ecosystem.This is why I'm not buying such an expensive picture without any usage because it can copy easily and you can't sue them because there is no such law that protects you. It is only available on blockchain and can still be copied by anyone. The only problem here is that, he's a blockchain entrepreneur so probably exposed to crypto as well, I just wonder why he do this, or he is just trying to prove something here, that NFT is not that good.",

No, because everybody else in the internet could grab that jpeg or pic and post it somewhere else. They could even share it with anybody. The original owner could say \"hey, that's my art. I own it. I have the proof in the blockchain. The token is here with me.\" So? Will you sue the man using it?",
