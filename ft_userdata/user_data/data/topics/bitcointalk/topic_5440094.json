  "content": "Hi everyone,I downloaded BitcoinCore to run a full node. I'm already synchronized with the entire blockchain and followed the istructions (https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#upgrading-bitcoin-core) to enable inbound connections but even after that I can't see any in the node window.I wanted to ask you some help to figure out where is the problem. I may have done some mistake during the procedure but I couldn't understand where.In this link there are the screenshots of the various step I made to allow inbound connctions https://imgur.com/a/pJkNsoOpic1: DHCP Reservationpic2: Port Forwardingpic3: current status of my firewall inbound connectionspic4 and pic5: creation of a new ruleThe IP address that I obscured is the same in pic 1, 2 and 5.The language is italian. I think you just need to know that \"Qualsiasi\" means \"any\" or \"all\". Also note that I had only two rules in the firewall at the beginning, but after some time (or something I made) it became two.Thanks for your time.",

Could it be a matter of bandwidth of my interernet connection?It takes hours or days before someone's nodes start to connect to you and it depends on the router's firewall. It is likely the same as torrent it takes a while before you can see more connections. And take note maxconnection is only for inbounds not for outbound I don't know if there is a command to increase outbound.And please read this Bitcoin by default will not make more than 8 outgoing connections",
