  "content": "In most of western societies (like in the EU and the USA) child support is - by law - a thing of the parents. One reason for that is the tradition of a feudal system. Parents are (economically) bonded to \"their\" children, and vice versa. But this concept is not good in relation to the conecpt of euqality. Every child should have the same economically possibilities. Should they?Who is paying child support, when parents cannot pay child support?- or -Why the state is not paying child support for all children f.E. from age 0 to age 14/18/21? I will not answer the second question. This is on you? But I can explain how western societies paying child support, when parents cannot pay child support! Child support from the state is not payed out of taxes of other people!Most of the people are thinking, that, when parents cannot pay child support, the child support for the child is payed of the taxes of other people through the state. This is wrong! Not a single dime of child support was payed out of the taxes of other people!Example - Germany:When a child is born the credit-worthiness for the german state is increasing by ~814,000 Euro (~850,000 USD). This is based of the average expected future tax payments of this person. It is the same, when you go to the bank and asking for a credit. The bank is asking you how much money you will make in the future. On that data you get your credit. But the (german) state will not have the future taxes of one child, in one year it has the credit-worthiness of ~750,000 born childs. That means an average expected future tax payment of ~600,000,000,000 Euro per year. For that credit-worthiness the german state is getting a lot of credit (money) from the banks! Through these credits the (german) state CAN generate a lot of profits. And from these profits child support from the state is payed for children, which parents cannot pay child support.But what is the reason for posting this on a crypto board? The (german) state is not paying the child support for all the children, from which they are profiting of. In Germany and in other western countrys there is a big mismanagement of synthetic money. (Money that is additional generated through the (future) payments of their children. So my reason is a question:Could we tokenize the synthetic asset of \"average expected future tax payments\" and bring it back in the hands of the people? Basically we could create \"crypto token\" for \"average expected future tax payment\" and give it the children to economize their own child support. Do you have another ideas?",

For that credit-worthiness the german state is getting a lot of credit (money) from the banks! Through these credits the (german) state CAN generate a lot of profits. And from these profits child support from the state is payed for children, which parents cannot pay child support.Completely flawed view.First, there is no \"bank' that suddenly offers loans at zero interest to the German government, second, you're mistaken about the whole creditworthiness, and what's even worse you assume somebody will just lend a country money just because it will have children.So, why isn't this working in Nigeria or Bangladesh?   They could have trillions.The other problem is that the government can't make money out of thin air if it gets those loans without devaluation, it can only get those back from taxes paid by the citizen, even if it were to invest in highways or schools or industry, the revenue will still be in taxes, still paid by the average Joe well before the kid will get his first job.But most important you've forgotten about secondary benefits, Kinderfreibetrag and Kinderzuschlag and Unterhaltsvorschuss. These are not like credit granted by some unknown entity and in one case are actually tax deductions, completely invalidating your theory.Also, 600 billion per year? Lol, yeah! so 1/3 of the budget is made out of future loans.

Basically we could create \"crypto token\" for \"average expected future tax payment\" and give it the children to economize their own child support.How about not?!Let's stop tokenizing and creating shitcoins for every single thing just because it sounds trendy or cool or promises flying unicorns farting honey?You're basically proposing money printing, at birth for each child to get 700-800k euros because yeah, printing money out of thin air solves everything!Why even stop there, let's give them 1000 trillion, let's create a school token worth 50 trillion or their education, let's create some other 4 billion food tokens and some 100000 quadrillion toy tokens cause it's to ease, just give people money and everything will be fine!Quote from: Bialke on June 03, 2023, 03:56:07 AM Do you have another ideas?How about not trying to fix what is not broken?",

Read it again! Quote from: stompix on June 03, 2023, 01:20:04 PMSo, why isn't this working in Nigeria or Bangladesh? Also it will working there. I can explain, why it would not work in the German Demokratic Republik: Bechause there were no taxes. But in Bangladesh, Nigeria and India it is working. Of course you have another scale there: In Germany the yearly income per head is ~50,000 Euro. In India it is ~2,000 Euro of course. And in this proportions are expected future taxes per person - in the view of the loangiver. And of course, there are other criteria, but:What you missed was, that I described a problem, why it is not working. And I offered a solution. Read again!Mismanagement of loans was a problem. Bureaucracy was a problem. Tokenization would change it. Are you able to anticipate? Or are you imprisoned in what is?Quote from: stompix on June 03, 2023, 01:20:04 PMThe other problem is that the government can't make money out of thin air if it gets those loans without devaluation (...)This is so wrong. Currency is stored work-time, and when you have more people, you have more work-time. But in this simple construct there is no devaluation, the one who is working is eating for one, the two who are working are eating for two, and three for three, and four for four, ..... So of course, in this simple construct - and your response is very simple/populist - you can create children out of (nearly) thin air, and so is the work-time increasing, with which will produced more goods and more services consumed and used by this more people.Quote from: stompix on June 03, 2023, 01:20:04 PMBut most important you've forgotten about secondary benefits, 1. Kinderfreibetrag2. Kinderzuschlag 3. Unterhaltsvorschuss (child support)These are not like credit granted by some unknown entity and in one case are actually tax deductions, completely invalidating your theory.I changed your response a little. I wrote JUST about point 3. Child support, and in Germany, when it is payed by the governement, it is called \"Unterhaltsvorschuss\". I just described this ONE point, which is not tax payed. It is loan-for-expected-tax-payed. I described it. It is good that there are other payments for children, but this is not what my topic is. (But this is what you are talking about, tax based benefits. So you criticized it on your own. It is not my problem.) Quote from: stompix on June 03, 2023, 01:20:04 PMAlso, 600 billion per year? Lol, yeah! so 1/3 of the budget is made out of future loans. This is not what I wrote. Read again! (It is the number of expected LIFELONG tax payments for all newborn children born in one year in Germany. - But I guess this is easy to misunderstand, because of the language barrier. But if you want to understand, you can understand.)Quote from: stompix on June 03, 2023, 01:20:04 PMHow about not trying to fix what is not broken?This is ignorant. When you live in one of the western countrys (f.E. USA, England, Germany, France, Canada) you know that for a lot of children the system is broken. Child poverty is a thing in those countrys. Often for the growing \"lower class\" there is no lunch money for children, there is no propper education, etc.! Read the news to this topic! --- And yes, this is just \"first world\"-poverty.So will you repeat is, that the child support-system in (my example) Germany is not broken? If yes, this would be evil!",

The point was \"child support\" payed from loans from future expected taxes. It is right that there are other governement payments (in the example: Germany) that are payed from taxes directly! But the one who responded to my point projected \"to pay from taxes\" in the payment of child support. And this is not true. Child support in Germany is not payed out of taxes. (When the parents cannot pay child support.) It is payed out of loans, creditworthy through expected future taxes.I do like to discuss other social benefits, f.E. payed out of taxes. But to say I meant that child support is payed out of taxes is wrong.

      "body": "@The Sceptical ChymistWith the second part of your response I am with you! With the second part of the first part, I believe you! I know a few people working in the social benefit field. Not in the field of child support, but in the field of governement's retirement program. In my country it is based on points.Basically you made 39.000 Euro a year, you get 1 retirement point RP). 1 RP is worth 36 Euro retirement payment, when you reach the age of 65/67. There are some limits, but f.E. if you made just 30.000 Euro a year, you just get 0.8 RP for this year.So this is tokenization by the german governement, without a blockchain - in Real Life.The problem with that, the retirement plans are shitty managed + there is a lot of costly bureaucracy, and - and now we coming to my friends - the RP's are just created by 4 eyes. One of my friend is a lesbian, who is getting the payroll paper (in reality it is the sum payed for the retirement plan on two sheets of paper) and put it in a computer. And the RP is created. But before it is send in the main network, the superior worker is double checking it. (And once a year another superior worker is doublechecking if the income and outflow is fitting. But not checking the creation of the RPs)So I told you my friend is lesbian. And sometimes she likes her female superior worker more than just to work with. So guess what will happen, when they need some extra money for the holiday vaccation? Simular are social benefit checks here, and f.E. the tax based \"Kindergeld\" @Stompix was writing about. So I believe a blockchain could be a solution for that problem. @hatshepsut93In this case (retirement points) the \"points\" or \"token\" are there.
