There are many who doesn't have any technical background here on the forum but still there is lot if ways you can gain knowledge about them.You have little knowledge about creating websites on Yahoo back in those days.But the thing is what you intend to do like making some applications, websites or anything else bitcoin or crypto related as a whole?This is bitcoin discussion forum and you only need to take active parts in discussion or learn through various guides available here to enhance your knowledge so don't worry about it at all.Quote from: Petz415 on July 18, 2022, 10:29:17 AMBut I'm fascinated by bug bounty hunting and helping people, whether there are rewards attached to it or not. They might sound attractive to you but they are not profitable at all and waste of time according to me and bounty hunters on the forum usually remain on one side of forum restricting their growth on the forum.The thing is you will have to share promotional tweets or post on social media platforms having good followers and you will receive stakes according to it but when the time the tokens are listed on any of the exchange they get dumped soon by the whales or the founders so you are either forced to sell at very low prices or they will be lying dead in your wallets so what profit you get out of it?Instead of it the best alternative I give you is to learn more about bitcoin and crypto stuff on the forum with extensive and useful guides from senior rank members ,ask your doubts and can answers to it whether technical or non technical and slowly you will get results and see your knowledge increasing but you should be dedicated towards it.But you should also read the forum rules before making any post : Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQRest you will learn lot with time but if you are still interested in bounty hunting then visit  Bounty",

You need to have a background in coding to understand more of the logical situations and problems for which will make you find if there's a bug or none. Bug or vulnerability hunting requires you that skill and it will take you time for you to extract those vulnerabilities that a project or website may have. It is one of the skills that I like but it will really take a lot of time for me to at least have those basics requirements of understanding how to code, how to read codes and how to execute them.",

This isn't the best answer, but I can give my personal resource when it comes to programming- https://www.freecodecamp.org/learnNote that this resource will just teach you the fundamentals of programming, and not a laser focused material for bug hunting specifically in crypto. You can also complement that website to other YouTube video or any other method that you see fit to fasten your learning curve.Personally, if you happen to at least find a programming language you are comfortable with (e.g., C, C++, C#, Python, JavaScript), you can now start learning the technical workaround behind bitcoin using this - https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook. But really, it's just that understanding the logic behind data structures and algorithms could make you learn other programming language much faster.But again, you are not required to master all the stuff in every field though, just find your niche and, invest some time and master it. There are further technical materials for crypto as well, but you must have a thorough knowledge of bitcoin or crypto in general. - https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/technical-resources.html- https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/developer-tools.html",

To be fair, looking for bugs in code is actually very in-demand. I've heard code auditing companies for crypto projects have a wait list of years. THAT's how in-demand it actually is.

Once you became really comfortable with the core language from building projects, you can start using Python. The framework would depend on what you are trying to build.It is going to be a fun learning experience, OP. Trust me.
