      "body": "There is no way to turn a non-RBF transaction to a RBF transaction. With changing any part of the transaction data, the signature becomes invalid and it must be signed again. Of course, this doesn't mean there is no solution if you have a non-RBF transaction and you want to replace that with a new one. There are many nodes that have enabled full RBF and accept the replacement transaction even if the original transaction has not been flagged as RBF. So, if you have an unconfirmed non-RBF transaction, you can broadcast a new transaction including the same input(s) and hope that the replacement transaction is included by a miner.For making the replacement transaction using coinb.in, click on \"New\" at top of the page and then go to \"Transaction\". - Paste your transaction ID and click on \"Load\". - Add/remove addresses if you want to change the receiving addresses. - For changing the transaction fee, you should change the value of outputs. (The transaction fee is the inputs value minus outputs value.)- Click on \"submit\". - Copy the unsigned raw transaction- Click on \"Sign\" at top of the page. - Enter your private key and paste the unsinged raw transaction and click on \"Submit\". It's recommend to do this step offline (preferably on an air-gapped device) For making the replacement transaction, you can also use electrum. - Create a new wallet using your private key.- Let your wallet get synced and then disconnect your computer from the internet. - Go to \"console\" tab and use this command to remove the transaction you want to be replaced from your wallet: wallet.adb.remove_transaction(\"TXID\")- Close electrum and open it again.- Make the replacement transaction and export the raw transaction. Now you have the singed raw transaction and you can broadcast it. The problem now is that for broadcasting the replacement transaction, you need a node that has enabled full RBF. So, you should try different transaction broadcasting tools until you find a one allowing you to do so and doesn't reject your transaction.  For broadcasting the replacement transaction, you can also use electrum. To do so, you should change servers until you connect to a server which allows you to broadcast your replacement transaction.",

Full RBF is the standard state of the network. According to Peter, 17% of 24.x listening nodes run full rbf. Nobody should treat opting-out RBF signal as non-replaceable. It is currently trivial even for a newbie to simply broadcast the replacement transaction to nodes that support that policy.Quote from: DaveF on November 22, 2023, 12:25:14 AMUnless the pool operators tell us what they are accepting then we could only hope that TXs like that would be mined.Probably what grants them the most profit.
