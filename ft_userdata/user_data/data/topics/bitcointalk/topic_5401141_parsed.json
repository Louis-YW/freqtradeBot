So why will you promote something that will give no benefit for you? that sounds a non sense thing for me. Is not it better if you are focusing into the another thing? I can't give you a recommendation about which a very good NFT to invest your time. Will those NFT paid you for that? Im skeptical about that. The NFT like bored ape already become the most popular NFT. im sure that this is the reason why it was going high.",

Many investor have collected NFT until now they can't sell again after not any interested although selling with lower values than usually.",

You should sell what you bought once you already see the profit showing as the price pump and never believe on someone or even the dev telling you that there are more profits to come if you hodl it.So be smart in every action you made especially to many scams are already in NFT scene.",

I reckon you can make a profit off of it if you were an early investor and people are relatively interested in it. Don't get any NFT projects that are pretty old, they're market is pretty much dead since the hype is all gone and honestly, that's what most NFT's are built up off, so without that, you'd probably just lose money if you were to try and hold on to it. I don't think hodling with NFT's are even a thing, it's probably one of the most \"not\" to do things in the nft space.",

I still believe on the power of P2E NFT since many user are still looking for a source of paasive income while playing. These NFS already prove themselves during bull run so I’m sure many traders are still keepingnan eye on it for a potential reinvestment once the market becomes good again in favor with bulls.",

      "body": "Gm guys.I think I may have found a real gem in the making, a very interesting project called ROTTS.They're still in the pre-launch phase, and there's a lot to like about what they bring to the DeFi crypto space.They have:— A cool collection of unique NFTs,— A simple yet ingenious staking system (passive income),— A dedicated international team,— A low-tax deflationary currency called $ROTTS.The team has made it clear that, unlike many other projects that aim to deliver 100 different utilities on day one and deliver none of them well, they will initially work on a single utility: the payment platform ROTTS.me, a payment platform similar to PayPal, but in DeFi.Imagine a portal you can use on your phone or desktop to send or receive ROTTS, ETH or any other ERC20 tokens, without tax or gas fees, and without revealing your wallet address. I know, the potential is mind-boggling.And, actually, it's pretty simple. Each individual will have a profile or account linked to their wallet. A database will be automatically updated with each transaction, so that each user's holdings are accurately reflected in real time.You will only be able to see your own assets, not those of other users.No more embarrassment of being a little fish in a whale's world. No more anxiety for developers, influencers, designers, artists or any other crypto-currency contributor when they have to show their entire wallet to someone, just to receive the payment they earned in a fair and equitable way. No more stressing about setting up another wallet, just to avoid someone seeing what you previously bought, or what your crypto is worth.It combines the best aspects of crypto and DeFi with the best aspects of traditional banking, and it could very well be the beginning of real and lasting utility in the DeFi space.The NFT pricing structure is cleverly tiered, with a clear incentive for early buyers.— The first 1,500 will be 0.05 ETH,— The next 3,500 will be 0.07 ETH,— The last 5,000 will be at 0.09 ETH.What are NFTs for? To obtain passive income in $ROTTS tokens through staking. 49% of the total supply is dedicated to staking. Every day, 700 million ROTTS are distributed, to be shared between stakers.The ROTTS token will only be launched when 1,500 NFTs have been sold, and it will be launched with a very high liquidity, locked in for years. So what happens if they don't sell 1,500 NFT?This is a unique case, as the ROTTS team is promising a 90% refund to all early buyers if the 1,500 NFTs are not sold. They will only use the 10% of NFT sales revenue for marketing and other pre-launch expenses, so they will have a huge pool of ETH intact if/when they reach the milestone of 1,500 NFTs sold.I honestly think this is a project worth doing some serious research on, the website looks great and is very informative, and the white paper is a great read, breaking down the project into easy to digest chunks.If you haven't discovered them yet, I highly recommend spending even 5-10 minutes on their website and white paper.Links:— Website (https://www.rotts.io)— Whitepaper (https://docs.rotts.io)— Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/rottstoken)— Telegram (https://www.t.me/rottstoken)I'm glad I found it before the herd arrived.As always, DYOR!",

I just think that it is just not the right time to buy into a NFT project right now. The market is on a downward trend for a few weeks now and therefore all project have lost significant value. As usual during a bear market new and small cap projects are suffering a lot more than established and big coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum and NFT projects are in most cases still relatively small projects and relatively new too. I also think that the big hype wave of NFT's is also over now.That does not mean that NFT's are dead but i think that a lot of NFT projects will die in the coming weeks and only the good ones will survive.",
