  "content": "The bitcoin community in Europe is awed to hear the intention of the Liechtenstein local lawmakers about the integration of bitcoin for government payments. They intend to swap the bitcoin into Swiss franc immediately after it arrives in their wallet. According to Daniel Risch, the PM, and Finance Minister, he stated that the ruling body could allow its citizen to utilize bitcoin for government payments, but it's not sure if they'll take in bitcoin as legal tender, he didn't mention it.Hence, regarding the network congestion happening recently, bitcoin communities lament that the Liechtenstein government has not experience network congestion, before the bitcoin gets converted into Swiss Franc it'll take time and they'll pay higher fees too. Hopefully, the whole dust transaction gets decongested before Switzerland concludes its decision of integrating bitcoin as a means of paying government fees. If these countries, adopt bitcoin payment it'll boost bitcoin, but if the mempool busy traffic continues it can demoralize them from taking this step.  https://cryptopotato.com/liechtenstein-could-embrace-bitcoin-as-a-payment-method-for-gvmt-services-says-pm/",

How the local town Lugano had adopted their own token LVGA as a legal tender in March 2022 and also the acceptance of Bitcoin and USDT as means of payment and so far the results have been encouraging. Even if the government do not get to make Bitcoin a legal tender but accepting bitcoin as a mean of payment would help businesses to thrive and create a lot of opportunities for the country.",

Making bitcoin a legal tender only confirms it's legitimacy so definitely a no big deal. Another win for crypto and this one is much more better since the government isn't losing anything here since they're going to quickly convert it to hard currency.",

It is too early for it to become a legal payment instrument. Of course, some states or institutions will switch to this payment method over time. What needs to be done now is to remove the obstacles in front of it. Everyone should be able to do whatever they want with bitcoin without encountering any obstacles. When this happens, the other things we've already talked about will gradually come true.",

It's clear to me that this will drive more power for a better future for bitcoin as an alternative currency should fiat stop helping society so much because of its banks and centralized systems. Bitcoin is worth considering, but really my concern may have been raised and might say tough if the dust attack continues to fill the mempool.Do any of you think that dust attacks/ ordinals attack are a threat to slow bitcoin adoption growth?",

It is a big win for the bitcoin community as this will increase the rate of adoption of bitcoin and citizens will enjoy financial freedom and other attached benefits to using bitcoin.It doesn't mean that bitcoin must be adopted as a legal tender before it can be used freely for payment by its users. As long as the government has accepted the adoption to use it as an alternative payment method,it is fine because there will be no restrictions on bitcoin. The government of Lichtenstein has seen that bitcoin is a store of value and can resist inflation and they know how bitcoin will help its citizens.",

Some folks are worried about the recent network congestion issue, and how it might affect the transaction time and fees. Hopefully, the congestion issue gets resolved before Switzerland decides to follow suit. It would be a real boost for Bitcoin if more countries start adopting it, but if the traffic remains congested, it might discourage them. Fingers crossed for a smooth transition!And I would like to see integrations of Bitcoin without the conversion in any fiat currency, just Bitcoin!",

I believe that we are going to end up with something much better overtime and we just need to end up with these type of nations and governments that support it. This idea alone is a proof that they are pro-crypto.It hasn't happened yet obviously, they are just considering it and they may end up deciding they won't do it as well, but even the idea of it and being considered is enough to actually make it work. It would be better if they start doing it, but even the idea is enough.",
