      "body": "Sadly, most centralized exchanges/instant swaps works in a similar way. My general advise is, if your coins gets into their custodial wallet, always assume they can do whatever they want with it e.g. held it hostage until you KYC. It gets clearer when you read their terms of service.But it's a good thing you didn't lose much op! although even with that amount, I think you could've still split it into two or three pieces. We do this with centralized swaps so that they wouldn't be able to block the entire amount we're planning on exchanging and hence minimizes the loss.Alternatively, there are a couple no-kyc exchanges with non-custodial wallets in kycnot.me which are a lot more laxer - not to be confused with no-mandatory kyc exchanges.",

I get that op should've read the terms of service and whatnot but the thing is, just because they write it doesn't necessarily mean it's legally binding which is why a lot of these services have this clause:Quote from: https://changelly.com/terms-of-useThe invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.Up to what extent is applicable to OP's case remains a mystery... One thing for sure is, op wouldn't hire a lawyer for around 200 bucks.",

Maybe you could help build one  To be fair, if you want a peer 2 peer system/exchange that is censorship resistant like Bisq, you are going to have to go the hard way to use it. From downloading the app, setting it up and connecting to the Tor network. Privacy doesn't come easy in the present day.Exchanges that provide simplicity to the masses easily get manipulated and even censored by regulators.
