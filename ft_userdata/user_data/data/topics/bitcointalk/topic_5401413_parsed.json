  "content": "Exorde is a new protocol based on decentralized technology. The Exorde ecosystem will make its services available to ordinary people, investors, institutions and politicians. The protocol will give people an understanding of what information is in front of them now, where it came from. It will also show what opinions exist about the information and what other people think about it. Exorde will be able to determine whether the information is true or not.InfographicExorde will be able to understand how this or that information affects events in the present. This project is very large-scale and I think it will be useful to absolutely all people, because absolutely all people have a right to know everything about the information they encounter. In our information age it is very important, because today many people suffer from the fact that they are faced with lies on the Internet.Also right now they are having ambassador program, in which absolutely anyone has the opportunity to earn $EXD tokens.AmbassadorExorde official links: Website | Discord | Twitter",
