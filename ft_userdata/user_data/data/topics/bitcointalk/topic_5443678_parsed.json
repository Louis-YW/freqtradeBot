Upon encountering this news via CoinMarketCap's news feed this morning, I had originally intended to sell my Shib. However, the announcement has led me to believe that Shib could perform exceptionally well this year. What's the basis for telling that shib was the most popular token for ethereum biggest holders? Does it make sense to say that Eth whales most popular coin/token that they hold is ETH instead?Quote from: Tellek Garing on March 06, 2023, 08:23:54 AMAs a Shib enthusiast, I would encourage others to hold onto their tokens as we may witness prosperous times ahead, and our patience may result in significant reward.Good luck in holding it and wishing all of you holders the best. I've got friends that has just discussed with me about his shiba holdings and said the same thing that he's optimistic of the next bull run. But I've said the same sentiment that for shiba holders, you're all positive with it but as someone that don't have it, I don't have much to say.",

Doge is the only reason why Shib got a spotlight because it leached on the meme coin hype of doge before. Now that Elon is potentially out, I don’t see any future for the price of Shib and meme coins in general because they are designed useless without any real utility.I will sell all day Shib and any meme coin if I still have this coin on my wallet. But luckily I already all of my holdings 2 years ago.",

When we have bought, of course we will defend it. If we force to sell it now, of course we will suffer losses. The reason is, during the last week the price of coins has decreased. But that information is part of the most important for the continuation of the Shiba token in the future.",

I just can't understand why they don't put money in bitcoin which is a safer currency? bitcoin is at 23000$ and one day it will return to 69000$ that by itself is already a profit of more than 2x, it is a very good profit and with less risk than putting money in altcoins",

Because Shiba Inu now is not a new cryptocurrency, for sure people will start looking for a new cryptocurrency so the volume will shift here to other cryptocurrencies.",

However, in my experience, this same phenomenon is present in both capital and money markets. Even investments in Bitcoin, one of the more established cryptocurrencies, can be just as risky as investing in any other coins presently available. While Bitcoin may double in value in the near future, it's worth noting that similar market conditions could potentially cause shib to increase tenfold. Shib has demonstrated strong performance in the past and is displaying similar promising signs currently. I believe that investing in any coin at this time carries risk, but the potential rewards of a successful investment may be among the best decisions one can make.",
