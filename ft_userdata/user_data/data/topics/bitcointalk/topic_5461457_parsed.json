That time where the scammers ask for 1 btc and doubling it and then someone stupidly gullible sends for real is probably the highlight of that scammer's career but now they're going to create new ways to scam people on Twitter, fake airdrops can still dupe some people right?The scammers are going to get craftier now, remember AI ransom? Where they use an AI voice of a person and then call their relative to tell them that they've got kidnapped and that they need to pay the kidnappers crypto to release the fake person, that's only the tip of the iceberg in this new ways to scam people so be safe out there eveyone.",

Everyone of us has encountered an attack from such scammers in the form of e-mails, online accounts getting hacked, or sometimes a message or tweet done from an account that has many followers. In this case that account belongs to Jason Lowery, and a good number of people follow him, but the hacker who has stolen the account of him made a so naive tweet that even a kid can suspect that something is shady going on. I feel happy when such scammers don't get success with their tricks, and I wish that people should be protected from such scams.",

His followers find that the formula of the author of the tweets that they know has changed significantly, either for a giveaway tweet, as happened to Jason Lowery, or as tweets for an Airdrop with a phishing link, so what is happening is crystal clear that the owner of the account has been hacked and that whoever posted these tweets is a scammer who managed to access the account, but here is a very small category of people who forget to use their minds and easily fall into this fraud.It is good that the methods of fraudsters are old and outdated, and despite that, they do not stop their schemes and evils, and fortunately, there are good members like you and OP who expose them and shed light on their crimes.",

I don't think some of those people are really serious about entering the giveaway - or maybe it's just a trap.So far I haven't followed influencers on twitter much - so I don't think I'll be swayed by such efforts. After all, the average person is educated on some scam attempts - so this will inevitably result in fewer victims than none.",

Now is like a battle between us and the scammers, how I wish we can always detect when they start lashing out their lies, that's too hard though.I really think they have gotten more than the number you said 3, it would be more than 3 people. Because you all know how popular Jason Lowery is with the number of subscribers, the scammers must have gotten up to 20+ members who fell for it...",
