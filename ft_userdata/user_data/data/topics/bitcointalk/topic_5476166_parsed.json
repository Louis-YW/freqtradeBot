  "content": "Happy new month with a sad news from our 001 wey be Theymos carry tori come this afternoon about mixers and the information wey dey go on and how the law enforcement agency dey take seized mixers e no too go well maybe with wetin him consider as well come make am put head together to limit their operation from for this forum. I know say e go affect many of us but like almost everyone for the forum dey promotion them and na mixer campaign come plenty pass self, well make i no too go further because him don give us small grace from now till January 1 2024 to stop promoting mixers or even refer person to use am maybe even trying to copy any link that relates with mixers if them see such post that person go get ban. Any person wey mentioned mixers go get ban.. for general anything mixers avoid am from forum. So like this those our sister and brother wey promote mixers including me as well before 31st night I go remove my signature code all less him come change the otherwise I will say goodbye to mixers since general oga don yan like this..So I quote am like this make you too for see wetin him cap for that thread..Quote from: theymos on December 01, 2023, 11:15:25 AMBitcointalk.org aims to allow about as much freedom as is reasonably possible. But this is not a darknet forum, and with mixers looking \"grayer and grayer\", it's no longer reasonably possible to allow linking to mixers. Even though \"a cryptocurrency mixing service is not necessarily illegal,\" a clear pattern has emerged where mixers pop up, last for a little while, and then get taken down by law enforcement once they get too big. Allowing mixers to be posted on bitcointalk.org before they seemingly-inevitably get declared illegal and seized is not sustainable. Therefore, linking to mixers will no longer be allowed, just the same as linking to darknet sites is already not allowed.To avoid disruption, there will be a grace period: Nothing will change until Jan 1, 2024.Starting Jan 1, 2024: - Existing mixer announcement topics (and a few topics that have no value without mixer-links) will be locked and archived. - Going forward, directing people to mixers in new posts/edits will be totally disallowed, and doing so could lead to a ban. Many mixer URLs will be wordfiltered-out, and if you bypass the wordfilter, then that'll definitely be ban-worthy. - Any remaining mixer signatures (etc.) may be deleted. Anyone persisting in advertising mixers will be banned. - In most cases, old posts will not be deleted. Nobody should be banned for old posts.You do not need to go edit/delete your past posts. Links will be automatically wordfiltered-out as of Jan 1, or in a few cases mods will archive or delete posts, but you will not be banned for old mixer-related posts.It will continue to be OK to discuss mixers in a general sort of way. Just don't direct people to mixers: don't link to a mixer, don't link to a directory with links to mixers, don't tell people to \"Google ASDFmixer\", don't link to a mixer's telegram, etc.Definition of a mixerFor clarity, here is a detailed definition of what we mean by a \"mixer\". Most people know intuitively what a mixer is and don't have to read this.Something is considered a mixer if it meets all of these requirements: 1. It has a feature advertised for taking property, improving its privacy somehow, and then returning roughly the same type of property.     a. Even though you can sometimes use non-mixers to mix coins by depositing and then withdrawing, this doesn't make it a mixer because this is an incidental use of the service; the service isn't advertised as privacy-enhancing.     b. If a site is not primarily a mixer but has a mixer function, such as a mixer function on a gambling website, then the whole site is considered a mixer.     c. If the site takes coins, gives you a possibly-transferrable IOU, and will convert this IOU back into mixed coins much later, then the temporary conversion into a different type of property does not prevent it from being considered a mixer.     d. If the site internally converts your deposit into other things as part of its mixing, but ultimately the point of the product is to get your original type of property back, then that's a mixer, not an exchanger. 2. It is possible for the mixer to steal property passing through it. Assume that the sender does everything as correctly as possible. Also assume that no miners/verifiers on the base-layer cryptocurrency are evil. But assume that every other actor involved is evil (everyone able to vote in a DAO, every coordination server, every counterparty, every member of a multisig, etc.). Ignore short-term software bugs which are expected to be quickly fixed. 3. The service does not collect KYC-type info from all users.Examples of things that are not banned mixers include exchangers (unless they have a mixing function), CoinJoin-supporting non-custodial wallets, and Monero.Abeg settle down read am before you go say you no see am especially those of our people wey no like to post for Meta no talk say you no get the update on time because I know say our people dey funny at times.Na small update I say make i carry come home be that.",

Just as what @Brainboss... said, it's a new decoy by the government to frustrate the fundamentals and campaign for privacy among cryptocurrency users, they just by all means want to control everything we do on the internet and in our daily living. The government are always paranoid and anxious for nothing and whatever fruit that doesn't support their policies they look for a reason to bring it down before it germinates.If privacy isn't very crucial as some of us assume, then why do the government always kick against anything that gives us privacy???

We know say mixers signature campaigns nai dey pay well, and since mixers e no dey again which company go come over take dem. Though I'm dey try to make sure say make the forum e dey clean from bad bad thing. Because if im allow them to run in the forum USA government go come ban di forum because dem go accused am say, the forum dey promote criminal activities in the internet so for im to avoid all these kind of talk make im first ban dem so that authorities no go accused am again. Omen no be bobo juice, to use mixer dey mix coin dey sweet die. I used tumbler mixer to mix coin when dey come first on the first day. As some people make comment on the thread in Meta say, there are some legal mixers in google so anyone who want to mix coin go there and search for them nd use them. But you have to be careful because mixer na anonymous and nai make the ones wey been dey the forum were the best once to use. Because like this na, you know go bring complain from a mixer outside the forum come here and if you try am then you want to ban your account here. The oga kpatakpata don warn say make we no even bring a link of a mixer to the forum. Make Everyone Stay Safe",
