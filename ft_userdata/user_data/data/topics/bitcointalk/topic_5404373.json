  "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) visiting the $20,000 range after one and a half years made mining — the most important job of the ecosystem — a costly affair. However, if history were to repeat itself, BTC investors may witness another epic bull run that previously helped Bitcoin reach an all-time high of $69,000.Changes in Bitcoin prices directly impact the miners’ income, who earn fixed block rewards and transaction fees in BTC for running their mining operations. In June 2022, the total mining revenue dipped below the $20 million range, with Blockchain.com data recording the lowest dip of $14.401 million on June 17.As shown above, the recent dip in Bitcoin mining revenue was last seen one year back when the total value tanked to $13.065 million on June 27, 2021 — back when BTC traded at roughly $34,000. What followed after that was Bitcoin’s five-month-long epic bull run, which was supported by pro-crypto initiatives such as El Salvador’s BTC acceptance and crypto-friendly regulations across the globe.

If I am not mistaken, bitcoin has been very predictable for the last 2 pairs of bull and bear markets. 1st pair 2012 - 2013 was a bull market then followed by 2014 - 2015 bear market. 2nd pair 2016 - 2017 was bull market then also followed by 2018 - 2019 bear market. The present cycle is the 3rd pair with 2020 - 2021 bull market and with the next market being 2022 - 2023.Also, leverage has been the fuel of bitcoin pumps and bubbles since 2017. Many influencers in bitcointalk.org have argued that there is no bubble and it has been very clear that they are wrong. I predict that they will be more acceptable of reality during the next bull market hehehe.",

Jihan Wu and Bitdeer has created a cryptofund to buy their assets. I speculate that there will be more of this type of fund created to take advantage of these investment opportunities.Chinese crypto billionaire Jihan Wu is setting up a $250 million fund to buy distressed assets from Bitcoin miners, as the industry reels from this year’s steep drop in digital-asset prices.Wu’s Bitdeer Technologies Holding Co. plans to invest $50 million as part of a junior tranche, meaning the firm’s investment will be first at risk if the fund loses money. It aims to raise another $200 million from outside investors such as family offices, venture capital firms, alternative investment funds and other mining companies, a representative from Bitdeer told Bloomberg News.With the industry in a slump, highly leveraged miners are selling assets such as mining rigs at a steep discount to better-capitalized peers. Prices for certain types of mining machines have dropped more than 50%. In one recent example, Bitcoin miner CleanSpark Inc acquired a mining Georgia mining facility as well as thousands of rigs from another miner, Mawson Infrastructure Group Inc. “We can buy the cheaper machines and run them in our existing facilities with stable and cost-effective power power purchase agreements,” Bitdeer’s Kong said. “You’ll have the cash flow.”Source https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/crypto-tycoon-s-bitdeer-debuts-fund-targeting-distressed-miners",

I am not quite certain if he is really an expert on bitcoin mining, however, assuming that what he has said is true, bitcoin is presently very safe from the mining death spiral.So if Bitcoin continues to go down, the most inefficient operators are going to go offline, the more efficient operators make more tokens from their hardware, so it’s a little bit self-correcting. But that’s kind of the levels. $10,000-ish right now, depending on your hardware or you electricity costs, is the variable break-even, and $20,000 is the break-even to buy new hardware, or even a little bit above that.Source https://www.thestreet.com/video/price-bitcoin-not-worth-mining",

However, after reading some news articles of Poolin issuing IOUs and Jihan Wu creating a fund to buy assets from distressed miners, I cannot quite trust Wes Cummins statement.CZ of Binance has recently created a $500 million fund to provide loans for distressed bitcoin miners. This appears to be very similar to a bail out. Binance has launched a $500 million fund to provide loans to Bitcoin miners struggling to cope with difficult crypto-market conditions.Binance Pool, the company's mining service, will provide loans for both private and publicly-listed Bitcoin miners — who will need to pledge security, in the form of physical or digital assets, to obtain loans with a duration of 18-24 months. Binance will charge interest rates between 5% and 10%.The initiative comes as Bitcoin miners experienced a tough few months while the price of bitcoin declined. With low bitcoin prices, miners' revenues have declined sharply — with Compute North even filing for bankruptcy.Bitcoin miners' revenue fell 16.2% to about $550.5 million last month — marking its fifth decline in the last six months, and the lowest total since November 2020, according to data from The Block Research.Source https://www.theblock.co/post/177170/binance-launches-500-million-fund-to-provide-loans-to-bitcoin-miners",
