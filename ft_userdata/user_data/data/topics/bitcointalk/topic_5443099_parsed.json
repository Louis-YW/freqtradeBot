Always focus on casinos which have good name in the industry, have been here for long. Though flush.com is here for a year, they are here for business. Their domain name itself talks for them  If you would like to use my referral link, feel free to PM me",

I wouldn't trust any bloggers except the two trusted casino blogs in this forum e.g. gamblingbro and Btcgosu. There's always a risk if you want to play in small casino, shit can happen even though you've analyzed and think the site wouldn't scam you.",

But when I joined this forum, I can see some new casinos which started good and expecting to grow, many are trustworthy as long as they are active on this forum.",

This platform is a platform that accommodates all but genuine and sincere organizations which are reliable and trustworthy. Some few casinos as mentioned my members here are ok to deal with as they have been in existence for quite a long time now and running successfully without any complaints with a good customer care service which is the key focus to a lasting project and they are running signature campaign managed by high ranked members with large followership. Nevertheless, there are some few review sites where you can also ratings for casinos, it would also guide you too making your decision on casino to deal with.",

      "body": "Quotemy question is can i trust these sites , which is on 2nd or 3rd or 4th on list of best sites , which is written by bloggers, keeping in mind that which have more referral commission is going to be in first places,IMO you can. If a casino is 2nd or 3rd on the list it can't be a scam. Even a casino that  is ranked 10 on the list is still good because it's above average since there's more than 50 crypto online casinos.Try some of the casinos that advertise here on the forum. Most of them have decent traffic if that's what you really want. I don't get why you'd depend your trust on traffic, but do as you like.The number of high rollers or big wins that casinos like to use for advertising doesn't make it better and won't mean that you'll win there. For instance Stake has a lot of traffic but it also has a lot of people posting bad stuff about it. What I'm trying to say here is not that Stake is bad, but that a lot of people means a lot of sins and a lot of issues. Less people can mean less issues, faster response from support, and math stays the same. Your chances of winning in a casino with less high rollers and less traffic is the same.",

Stake is already a good site and if you are looking for a sports betting site since, you did look at stake so I assume you are into sports betting. You can try sportsbet, roobet or even with BK8, these are one of the best site up to date and you can see high rollers on these sites which you can review if this can work with you or you still want to try other site.",

I don't really pay attention to how bloggers make reviews other than their goal only to attract you to become part of their referrals. Regardless of the way they give casino reviews, I always refer to a casino in this forum if it is a crypto casino.My advice is not to rely too much on casino review articles. By having a forum in the gambling threads section you can easily find them here and the reviews are pretty honest based on the facts after they play.",
