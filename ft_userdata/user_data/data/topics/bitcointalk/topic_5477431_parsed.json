That's 31 vbyte for a native segwit ouput, 32 vbyte for nested a segwit output and 34 vbyte for a legacy output.More information on the topic created by Charles-Tim:Pay-to-taproot (P2TR) transaction fee",

Is there any exchange which support Taproot btc deposit?You want to send, so all types of Bitcoin addresses can send to it, but if you want to receive, you will need for the platform to support withdrawal to the P2TR address. The reason for this is that without updating the software, the withdrawal system will consider that address invalid.",

That's a P2WSH address and it's valid. As already said, you can send fund from any type of bitcoin address to any type of bitcoin address. If a service doesn't allow you to make withdrawal to a valid bitcoin address, that's just because it hasn't been coded properly.",
