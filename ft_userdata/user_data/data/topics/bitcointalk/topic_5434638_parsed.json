  "content": "This is how I will keep these cards in mind: a hurtful fk-up of epic proportions.If you own a coldkey with my daemon design you are eligable for a free A4 Bitcoin-DAEMON print.See this thread for more info on the print: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5253929.msg54577485#msg54577485Not sure yet if it will get a tiny note regarding this incidient with cold keys recently or not. Probably yes unless majority is against it.Shipping to EU directly from me.Otherwise via minerjones who will be helping me out with US distribution. Thanks man!To receive a print, please send me a private message with a photo of your card(s) and a paper showing your username and current date. Must be clearly visible. Also send me your shipping info if not in US. Otherwise just note that you are in US and shipping will be handled later via MJ.Peeled or not doesn't matter (you probably should peel em, though).I feel sickened by what happened, peeling the cards last night with my own design created over 3 years ago, sucked like nothing I ever experienced in collectible crypto space ever before.My heart goes out to anyone affected by this mess and just hoping to cheer a few folks up a little bit at least.",

I doubt there weren't enough - I included anyone that sent me a message with proove of coldscam cards with my design plus some spare extra. There are 128 mini-cards and around 15 big prints.Two parcels were sent out, one to cygan for Euro-based and one to MJ for US-based.That being said, I never heard back from cygan and also didn't get a response to an inquiry DM. It's been way over two months now and I didn't check-up any further, kind of trying to put that ck-disaster behind me.",
