Mind you,  your platform os not the first or the last casino review sites that we have,  and to let you know that we already know both the good reviews platform and the bad one who's reviews can't be rely on due to fake positive results for bad casinos actors and scam casinos. So the ball is in your court you either build a good reputation for your business or the business get kick in the ass for being a bad actor,  which is why,  most times we rely on forum members review on casinos since they are the real users of the casino and not just third-party opinions.",

You have done a good job by putting up this project for members to always make reference to when ever they want to source or search for casinos. I have to ask you this question mate. I see your review grade or possibly rate. From which of the review sites did you get that from? Do you rate casino yourself or you contract a team to do the review because I believe doing a review needs or requires a first hand information and experience with the casinos. How were you able to come up with the review ratings? Make mechanism was put in place to get that review grades? Please do well to update us with answers to the above questions.",

But I'm wondering why the site doesn't load completely and when I want to view one of the reviews, the page doesn't open. Has anyone experienced this? Or my internet connection is experiencing problems.But I wouldn't be surprised if I found Lucky Block number one on your site because maybe your assessment of the casino is better than other casinos, even the casino on Bitcointalk. I rarely find casinos with a 10 rating like on your site but that's up to you because you are the one giving the rating.",

Me and my team do the review ourselves as we have been playing in crypto casinos for a long time. We have the experience and we know what is important for users, so that's something we cannot outsource. How were you able to come up with the review ratings? We have an internal process where we agree about the standards than an operator needs to have for receiving a rating and being displayed on the site. But I'm wondering why the site doesn't load completely and when I want to view one of the reviews, the page doesn't open. Has anyone experienced this?Can you show more details about what does not load to you? It works perfectly fine for me. About the reviews, they are clickable from the navigation menu in the top, where it says \"Reviews\". We are planning to add a bunch of new reviews in the next weeks so will share them when they are available.Any additional feedback is more than welcome.",

The casinos I saw there were just casinos amongst them although they are alright but the big names that matters as long as crypto casinos are concerned have not been mentioned on OPs website. I think OP missed those ones there and it would be nice they are included too. Truly I see this as you have said relating to affiliate links. If OP does that it is understandable as that would possibly serve as a means of revenue generation  for the site to keep running because from the funds generated in the cause of accessing the casinos through their affiliate links, funds are generated which would aid in the sit maintenance.",

      "body": "One of the biggest problems in this cryptocurrency casino market that casinos have had for years and it is not being easy to solve this problem has to do with the lack of a website that, in addition to being a casino review website, is also a website where casino owners and customers trust this site so that when they have a problem, it is the casino that is obliged to only follow the TOS and not use the TOS as a weapon to withhold funds from customers, show proof when accusing a customer . but according to what I've seen, the casino doesn't show evidence when it accuses a customerand the argument that the casino has used for not posting evidence when they accuse a customer and that this would cause the methods that the casino has used to catch cheaters to be exposed, so if there was a reliable review site, I believe that Resolving disputes like these would already be simple, because the casinos would have to at least show evidence on the website and the website would not disclose this evidence but would confirm whether it is really relevant evidence or not and with that it would give its verdict on who is really right. or notBut for a site to achieve a high level of reputation to the point of having great influence in the world of gambling and being able to become the number 1 review site capable of resolving disputes between casinos and customers, it will not be an easy mission. So I ask you: what kind of strategies do you intend to use to make your site the best review site? And what will you do in case a person creates an account at a casino using your website and then that person does not get paid by the casino? How do you intend to resolve these types of cases?",

Is this category the same as the one you explained in your FAQ? How would you weigh each category to arrive at the rating number? For example, do you value security more than customer support?
