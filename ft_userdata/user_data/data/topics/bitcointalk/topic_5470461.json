Which is to ask on a forum like Bitcointalk to know if a site is a scam or not. Some people will ask the question on this forum when it is too late and when they have already been scammed. One of the important ways that you mentioned is to check the site domain. If the domain is young like some months ago, there is the high probability that the site is a scam. I do not believe in reviewing or rating site. I believe in what that is old and reputed.Newbies need to also be very careful not to connect their wallet to a scam site. This type of scam is very common since many months ago.",

Only enter your seed phrase if you are attempting to import your wallet, and even then you must be careful of the software you are importing it into, you ought to verify it and do it offline if possble.",

They do not expect you to do your due diligence because they often use greed to manipulate their victims. You have made some very good points, I agree with all that’s been said, the only thing missing is a website where people can check the credibility of any website.

I’m done arguing about the legitimacy of Pi network, they seem to have a stronghold in certain areas mostly third world countries where everyone is trying so hard to break free from poverty. Many feel they missed the bitcoin train and see every Altcoin as a potential bitcoin and hopefully make riches out of it.",

Just asking, as the token seems to have a separate blockchain and if they have a separate wallet and these scammers are looking for pie like this, does that mean that they have means of selling it that others don't know? Because looking at the current price of the iPhone 14 and the numbers of pie that's attached to it to replace the price means they really add a lot of value to that pie of a thing, I doubt that site even has any of those listed items in their stock as they can just be blabbing to attract those desperate to sell or spend their pie stock in their wallet.",

See human are so so greedy in a way that whenever they sees something like this flashes their eyes they will think is a golden opportunity for them to acquired such thing at a cheaper price rather than going the normal way to acquire whatever they wanted. Yes scammers are always exploring different ways to try scamming people and the worst things is that they always upgrade themselves and whenever they strike if you are not smart in reasoning they could get you carried without your attention flashing on their main purpose and arms towards it.",

They make promising offers and the greedy ones fall for them. I don't know if there's a natural law to it but I've an inkling that there's something like that which nature follows – If you aren't greedy you won't be trapped by enticing word and ROI. People like unrealistic returns and will easily jump on the slightest opportunity at that, not minding obvious red flags they may notice. If someone is scammed because they invested in such schemes that promise high returns, they should blame themselves.About Pi, I don't know its connection with Pinetstore.cc but I've read about people exchanging for fiat. There's a rush to accumulate it and I don't know what the use is for since it's still enclosed within the Pi community in so much secrecy. That's not how a Blockchain works.",

First of all the real businesses try to keep their site up or write their \"Site maintenance is going on, come back later\" And this site is down.To detect scam, you can use the methods mentioned in OP, all of them are helpful and I agree.

Even if the phone reaches you, the phone may have been stolen or been used by hackers, or its components have been tampered with to contain backdoors that steal your data, so Do not buy a phone except from a well-known store.As for identifying fraud, you can avoid 90% by asking questions, reading reviews, and not using any unreliable service, but sometimes there is fraud that is difficult to detect, as happened with FTX, so the rule remains that you do not trust a third party when it comes to your money.",
