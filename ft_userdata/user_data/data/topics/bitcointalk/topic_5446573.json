They also have many competitors and enemies that always want to attack Binance individually or in combined efforts.If you knew Binance quickly to shift their Binance Global to Binance US. shortly after an explosion of the USA vs China trade war, you would see they are smart and very responsive to risky movements on the world.With latest collapse of FTX exchange and their token FTT as well as attack on Binance months ago (late of December 2022) that caused Billions of dollar withdrawal from Binance, but they proceeded it well and survived, I think you would recognize that they have good management from technical, security to financial.",

Yes it true that they are number 1 or 2 global leading exchange in the crypto space but that doesn't mean it would generally affect bitcoin, though the effect might only boil for a week or a month thereafter but I still believe bitcoin have waxed above any treat that may occur in any exchangers today.For instance these country entirely here are really facing issues with bitcoin that doesn't mean the turbulence has brought bitcoin to it lowest part.",

      "body": "Certainly what can happen with Binance as a platforms can be affecting Bitcoin in the near-term just like what happened with FTX but in terms of long-term view Bitcoin can survive any challenge posed into it as long as the internet is existing and maybe as long as there are people who are adopting it. I would really be sad in case Binance will lose this case but then again the best thing to do is to negotiate just like what banks are doing and opt for fines so as to fast-track things and follow all the things regulators are asking to materialize right before their own eyes. This is one of the big risks of a centralized platform. So should we be selling our BNB now?",

I don't see any big drama here. Big companies like Binance must play by the rules.Nobody wants a \"new FTX\" to happen, but I think that Binance is way more financially stable than FTX and it won't turn into an exit scam.",

Binance have always run their exchange in a shady way only to make money for themselves, it didn't start today and it isn't going to end, i do not have a problem with the charges or whatever would be the outcome, i think these centralized exchanges should face as much regulations as possible, and even if they collapse, the BTC network would continue to work and even be stronger.The charges against Binance are obvious, they allowed US customers to trade derivatives on their main Binance platform, and they also aided these US customers to avoid being detected as being from US. That is more like an exchange setting up a regulatory framework and helping people break that framework all by themselves, it should tell us Binance probably have no limit when it comes to making money.Quote from: lewisrafael40 on March 29, 2023, 06:38:20 AMI think it's worrisome that Binance is constantly facing legal issues. It could lead to loss of trust in the crypto market and negatively impact bitcoin prices.Binance biting the dust would make many shitcoins to be expunged from the crypto market, and even though BTC price would go down temporarily, it is a good moment to buy more BTC for cheaper, because it isn't staying down permanently because Binance went down.",

Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and has a significant influence on the prices of many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. If Binance runs into problems with the CFTC or other regulators, this could lead to anxiety in the crypto community and possibly lower the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.However, cryptocurrency is a very complex market and there are many different factors that affect its price. These factors include general market situation, global events, and I think when this is resolved we will see a stronger market against similar fuds.",

      "body": "I believe there are five possibilities regarding this ongoing saga:1. Binance is slapped with a large amount of fines, which they would probably be able to pay as their profit is probably sitting at an astronomical level at this point.In this scenario, the whole saga will come to a close quite quickly and there will probably be very little effect on the market.2. Binance is asked to shut down their operations by the CTFC, to which Binance enters a power battle where they decline to shut down and continue to operate anyway. In this scenario, the market will probably by effected at a minor level as people panic initially about the shutdown request but then realize that Binance is more powerful than CTFC demands, thus market recovers.3. Binance is asked/forced to shut down their operations by the CTFC, Binance force users to withdraw their funds (without an exit) In this scenario, some market panic will probably ensue as Binance liquidates their profits for fiat currency and panicked users may liquidate as well as their confidence in the crypto market as a whole reduces, plus FTX PTSD might also come into play. 4. Binance is asked/forced to shut down their operations by the CTFC, Binance exits.Quite unlikely in my opinion, but a possibility nonetheless. 5. Binance is asked/forced to shut down their operations by the CTFC, Binance forces users to withdraw their funds (without an exit) and create a decentralized exchange based on BSC and moves all of their holdings to fund this venture.Not as unlikely as an exit but probably still unlikely to happen in a quick manner. Public sentiment seems to be swaying toward scenario 1. I believe that any of scenarios 1, 2, 3 or 5 are possible. I don't believe an exit is coming. I do believe that extreme volatility will come if scenario 1 does not play out, or if scenario 2 plays out and it backfires on binance/cz.",

I see no way binance saga would effect the bitcoin market as it has made a niche for itself before the inception of binance. Of-course binance is amongst the worlds largest crypto currency exchange with large daily trading volume but they are government regulated body and can dance to the gallery with the government but it is different when it comes to bitcoin as bitcoin is not regulated and controlled by government just like binance. With this, i think binance saga would not affect the bitcoin market.",
