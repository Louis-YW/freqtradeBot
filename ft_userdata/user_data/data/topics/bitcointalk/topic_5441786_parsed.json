  "content": "I made a post on their ANN thread a while back but didn't really get a reply from their team but I'm seeing two recent threads against them on Scam Accusations so I'm trying my luck again to see if my case will be more noticed here.What happened:: I deposited 700$ usd on Betnomi on november 28th 2022. After a few bets in a period of 10 days, I realized that the sportsbook was blocking me from placing new bets, saying that my account was limited. I tried to withdraw my balance (824.36$ usd, so only 124.36$ of profit) but my withdraw was rejected. I got asked for basic + advanced KYC which includes ID, proof of address and source of wealth.According to their rules, source of wealth is asked in case of deposits totaling over 5000$, so it really makes no sense as to why I was asked for such heavy KYC documents for only 700$ deposit.Here you can see their rules on SOW + my deposit amounts proofhttps://imgur.com/a/jSFxpfPRegardless, I completed the basic KYC but my source of wealth (bank investment account) was rejected 3 times now because they only accept documents in english. I live in a french speaking province so it's basically impossible for me to get such a document in english. They also state that it usually takes them between 24h and 5 days to check documents but every time I send a new document it takes at least 10 days + multiple livechat reminders to them.https://imgur.com/a/3zpVao7I have used a good amount of bookmakers in the past but this is by FAR the harshest KYC I've ever encountered. I'm not really sure what to do, I've sort of given up at this point because I really don't know have anything in english that they will accept...Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2532772Amount Scammed: 824.36$ USD",

Be patient like a hodler.... I've PM'ed with Betnomi before, he seems reasonable to me. Let us know what you get for a reply thanks again mate. I would think if they allow FR citizens to bet there, they would accept your damn docs, that is kind of dumb...

If they accept players from spain, germany, etc., do they really think these players will be able to provide documents such as payslips in english instead of spanish or german?",

If he is compelled to provide his document in English and he alters the original to make sure it is written in English still them will reject it and tagging him a defaulter. OP has presented his original document why are they frustrating OP in this manner. They know OP is not from an English speaking country and there is no way the issuing organization would give OP that document written in English in  French speaking country that is not possible.  Another is the issue of amount withdrawal limit that requires one doing a KYC before withdrawal. OP was right in his findings how come they are demanding for kyc when OP withdrawal amount is not up to the stipulated amount in their TOS. It would be nice their representative come here to explain and clear their name.",
