The theories are in books than the practicals. I don't think its prefer but what we are given. Personally I find practical more interesting than theory which most if not all black youth enjoy.@OP It might be my poor understanding but i don't really understand the direction of the thread. But if its about how book is killing Blackman then my thought would be lack of practical is affecting us not the book. There exist good books at there despite the poor ones.",

If you check the universities in Europe, Asia and America the Black people are among the top people doing academically.  What is really affecting the black people here in Africa is our system, the system is making thinks difficult for the people,  that is why when the Black's travel out they do excellent in performance just because the system of the country is really working well. If our environment is conducive I think Black's will be breaking records in every profession in theory and practical aspects. Black's are really trying no doubt about it.",

As for the white or other continent, they are of the habit of keep record of every idea whether it is already in actualization or about to be actualized. Many of the innovations we have today is as a result of the idea that was birthed many years back, which was taken over by the next generation. Here in this part of the world, ideas die with the person who conceived them. As for those who think is about reading, that's not true, as the op said, the Africans has played major roles in the life of other continent.",

But the problem is that we lack aprioprate practical materials and sponsorship. In the western world as dey discover you are good at something, dey send you for proper study of that thing both theory and practical. But in Nigeria you'll literarily solve all the equation in the textbook but if you are given that which you have been solving, you can't even identify.Take for instance, we were taught in chemistry, that acid turns blue litmus paper red. We don't know litmus paper not until during waec. I even study computer from my jss1 to ss3 but was not given an opportunity to touch a computer. not ontil I finished my ss3 that was when I registered for computer training. Where as junior school student from UK can beat a Nigerian ss3 student in  computer, because they grew and slept with it all day. So many people have been productive but no sponsorship. All what dey will do is to take a picture of you and shear in social media without helping you. We complain of lack of electricity. This talented young man created electricity out of only crude oil and some components and said if Nigeria can sponsor him, he will produce a steady power supply for Nigeria. And other talented Nigerians   Link==>>>https://www.facebook.com/100064137305860/videos/1234823753894374/?app=fblhttps://www.facebook.com/100092541212508/videos/1009370996859458/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6vhttps://www.facebook.com/LuckyOsegheOfficial/videos/669714191796118/?app=fblhttps://www.facebook.com/100092541212508/videos/1369367380642267/?app=fbl",

You're very correct the black always prefer the theory than the practical when we are supposed to value the practical more than the theory because how can we put our knowledge in practice when we don't no the practical aspects of it. I saw a guy failed an interview of something he reld in school, he studied information management that has to do with the use of computer so on the interview he was ask to type out some things using the computer however the guy was unable to operate a comon system, so that's one of the challenges we are having in this part of the world.",

If you can view the universe, you will see most writers, authors, and researchers that are famous. Most of them are white, and most of them sacrifice their time and lives just to do one single thing, but we blacks will never sacrifice their lives just to be famous. So with that short thinking, that is what usually makes us the black to settle. And think the knowledge we have is okay without engaging in any research to create something that will make us famous in the whole universe.",

OP you making sense from some point, looking from the perspective at which knowledge is being passed across in Africa, it is more of a theoretical aspect than doing both theory and practical. Africans believe knowledge is in the book, read and understand, but it is a foul reasoning not anymore those it work that way.Some persons are built with the ability to understand practical aspects than having the step by step approach of doing things on a piece of paper.Even the richest black men in the world can't even rank anywhere close to the table of the world richest where else Africa as a whole has all what it takes to bring some one who will stand on the list. Blacks are brilliant and intelligent, we just need supports from Government and good tuitors, I believe we can change the old mind set",
