      "body": "NFTs are designed as a way for digital files to be secured in a way that ensures ownership and create scarcity. Like physical art, an NFT can be sold but the artist can retain the copyright, they can offer it to the buyer, or decide on a percentage of secondary sales an owner can have. A long-term investment means you plan to keep an NFT for at least one year before selling.",
