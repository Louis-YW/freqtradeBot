Can you drop the link to this so that we can judge it too?",

      "body": "I believe I know which spammer / troll paxmao talks about here and if it's indeed the candidate in question, I believe he talks about, paxmao is 100% right because it's a very \"bad\" troll. ¬† There's no specific rule yet about such case (spreading lies) but for some particular cases it would be useful to have such a rule. I still believe we can apply current rules, depending on content (or lack of thereof): Quote1. No zero or low value, pointless or uninteresting posts or threadsSuch posts as \"SELL SELL SELL\", \"I agree\", \"+1\", \"Support\", \"Watching\", \"Interesting\", \"LOL\", \"SCAM\", \"LEGIT\", \"FAKE\", other one word posts, posts consisting mostly of swearing, quote pyramids, useless introduction threads, threads about a topic already recently discussed in several other threads.Especially BOLD parts. In my opinion, just a link and a quote from another website without any added comment is also \"low value\" comment / spam. Quote2. No off-topic posts.Some time, such posts are off-topic. Quote3. No trolling.Very often, these posts could be handled as \"trolling\" because spreading lies, derailing a topic or posting the same crap again and again is definitely \"trolling\". Quoted from Bitcointak rules: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0However, a new rule about this wouldn't hurt. Some trolls are well known to cause upheaval, they are just here to link or quote news in press section or even outright disinformation, they are not here to discuss Bitcoin in a meaningful way, they are just here to link content from other sites, or shill a certain fraud service / shitcoin / ICO / NFT / whatever (but not scam so we can't tag them). At least, we can add a neutral tag to make signature campaign mangers aware that rewarding such candidates via paid posts is not beneficial for the forum. But even then: the section, where the troll, that I believe paxmao refers to, is mostly active, lacks of any active moderator, so even currently rule-breaking spam like pyramid quotes or low-value spam or off-topic, isn't getting removed currently.",

I also had recent confirmations that these reported post are sometimes ignored by 'em MODS, which has - in turns - lessen the frequency by atleast 11/2 percentage... How then can we curb situations like the above ones??... I believe it's not, in anyway informative thus, unnecessary.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
