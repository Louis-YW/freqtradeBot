  "content": "This thread is born out of my personal experience and observations on PM offers on this forum.For the past few weeks back I have received various offers through personal messages on this forum, asking me to rent out my signature, avatar, and personal text space to promote their brand on this forum so I went into research to access the risk and the benefits that will come with such offers. And I thought of dropping my views on PM offer here on the beginner and help section to help beginners and older members that may receive such offers through PM!MY FINDINGS ON PM OFFERSAdvantages of PM offer:1: Pm offer to rent your signature and avatar space is high paying than signatures campaign managed by a forum manager in most cases but not in all cases.2: PM offer may be long term contract like 2 years offer 3: some offer to pay in advance but this is a rear situation it doesn't happen in most cases. Disadvantages of PM offer1: possible promotion of scam projects that will destroy your reputation in this forum.2: possibility of not getting paid since you are not under the management of any manager, or using an escrow.Conclusion:Newbie and other forum members should be careful and always do a due diligence investigation about any offer through you receive through your PMs as that is one of the ways some companies both legit and scam companies approach forum members to promote their project on this forum and i think for the sake of your forum reputation it is better you only enrolled on legitimate projects.",

However, every business offer should be considered, and every PM that may be suspicious can be reported to admins.Quote from: Odusko on October 20, 2022, 08:20:23 AMpossibility of not getting paid since you are not under the management of any manager, or using an escrow.You can be unpaid even if the offer is public, which is the case with some bounty campaigns that do not have funds in escrow. Risk always exists, and it's all about how much someone's reputation is worth, so if you agree to promote something for $20 a week, and it then turns into a scam, then it's your fault that you didn't refuse such an offer. I'm not saying that payrate should always be the deciding factor, but I'd rather promote something I believe in for free than risk some cheap offer that could cost me my reputation at any moment.",

I think that kind of offer would be given not even to just a better poster on this forum, but to one of the most known and recognized person. Your advice to newbies should be about how to rank up and also how they can protect their account.Quote from: Odusko on October 20, 2022, 08:20:23 AM2: possibility of not getting paid since you are not under the management of any manager, or using an escrow.Only promotion of scam projects is what is possible, but I think such offers should only be accepted from a well know organization that has good reputation to certain level already. About the payment, how will you be put on signature of a company that has not paid you? If they can not pay due to lack of trust, they can escrow the fund. We have escrow service on this forum.",

You're just giving an assumption without a legit proof here, IMO campaign managers will just skip your application if you PM them or you could be blacklisted since you're wasting their time to read your messages.",

Admittedly, it’s slightly possible for you to receive a business offer through a PM, I think your chances are extremely slim but then you claim to have received several offers, so I may be wrong  I do not think offers to rent out signature and avatar space are as plenty as you would have us believe and very few hero and legendary members get such requests. Your write up has no information and gives no value to newbies and beginners on the forum. On your disadvantages,1. If you do a proper research, you would know scam projects to stay away from. 2. I think a reputable and genuine project would pay for services rendered to remain reputable and in good standing. But it’s always good to put it out there on the need to do your own research on offers and practically anything you come across on the forum and on the web.",

You somewhat contradict what the forum suggests in the rules. Sending private messages is not the best rule of forum etiquette. On the contrary, the user should be suspicious, and it is not recommended that they follow the suggested links. Let's not give hope to users, and even more so to beginners, by the fact that one day they will receive a profitable offer in the PM. Your correction that the newcomer will become a legend in the future is correct, but for this, he needs to go a long way, and of course, he will be able to figure everything out later. I agree, and I know of cases where the managers of two highly paid subscription companies offered participation to some users. But these were very rare cases, and the people themselves were of high rank. But from your signature, it looks like you're still picking the best deal. Good luck!",
