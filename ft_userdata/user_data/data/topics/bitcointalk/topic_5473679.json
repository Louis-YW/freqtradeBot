  "content": "[That is called watch only wallet on Electrum]I observed here, and see a lot of beginners still don't know how to monitor their multiple Bitcoin addresses without inserting their mnemonic seed and private key on their wallet. all this time, if the beginner wants to see if the address received his bitcoin, they will open the wallet with the seed or private key inserted wallet which I think is indirectly dangerous if the beginner doesn't really understand the virus, malware, and any kind of spyware on his PC. I know it's really safe if want to access the wallet directly with a key on clean PC, but I think no harm in avoiding it, right?So, in this case, you already installed the Electrum wallet on your PC and opened it. In section create a new wallet, select Import Bitcoin Address and Private key, and just import as much as you want, but if you want to import multiple address, you can use the methods below:the address below is just an example I take on Random Explorer, so don't focus on the balanceThe picture above is still on sync progress, so the balance has not yet appeared completely*just simple like that. if you want to monitor it on Android, the way is almost the same as the step above.",

Also watch only wallet can also be created by importing private key and master public key too and not just the addresses. For someone using an airgapped device for wallet storage or rather an offline wallet like hardware wallet, the watch only wallet is better as it can still help you to create transactions and also broadcast them after been signed by the keys on the offline wallet.

I thought it was just an option to list the MPK and not any address. Thus, I would not need to copy and track only the Bitcoin addresses that I do not have the keys to, such as the binance address, where I can send and add the address in a new label and verify that it has arrived and then open my account instead of opening the account and searching in blockchain Explorers.It's an alternative to crypto balance tracking especially for someone who doesn't invest in altcoins",

As you said it will also enlighten newbies on how to what looks like to prevent scams, I have witness where scammers mostly social media will promise to sell a wallet to a newbie and they provide them with just addresses to import and when the newbie does that and see balance of huge amounts they promise to give them password to unlock the wallet if they pay for it.
