As the use of cryptocurrencies keeps increasing people would have to choose between them and fiat. Most countries would keep enacting policies that would either increase or decrease the rate of Bitcoin adoption and use. Bitcoin and others would always be an important alternative to fiat. It might be easy for Bitcoin to overshadow fiat in countries such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic that have made Bitcoin a legal tender. But this would take many years because the necessary awareness programs, infrastructure, and policies have to be put in place.",

They just can't allow solely bitcoin to overtake their fiat currencies unless they're like El Salvador that declared it as a legal tender and the same as Central African Republic. Despite that, they've got two main currencies and that's why it will be used the same as their main money.",

Even you can use Bitcoin to pay groceries in your country, I don't think there's a lot demand to use Bitcoin as a currency, moreover I think there might be a possible drama where the owner doesn't really understand how to keep safe their Bitcoin e.g. seeds, private key, password etc. It's really need a lot of time until everyone understand about Bitcoin and there will be no problem to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.",

People will need to empower themselves. Those who are stuck in the old ways of the world will remain there. They won't have their hand held to the better alternative/choice. Over time though, the transition will be made easier. People will be come more educated and will see that it will be vital to help their family and friends to make the transition. In the long future, being apart of the fiat system willingly will be futile the average person. Its surrounding infrastructure though, as franky1 mentioned, will likely remain useful or unavoidable to remove from life in some way. It's interesting to think about this future!",

What you are seeing OP right now is many governments are being tolerant of cryptocurrencies and are keen on regulating them. Governments will have their own centralized versions of cryptocurrencies sooner or later or CBDC which will co-exist with decentralized cryptocurrencies. What we should be hoping for in the near future is legalizing cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin as legal tender. So far we only have El Salvador and the Central African Republic. Let's see who's next to follow in their footsteps.",

Many governments and central banks around the world are considering issuing their own digital currencies, known as CBDCs. However, it is too early to tell how that will affect other types of money such as cash or credit cards. For the time being, the use of cryptocurrency in everyday life is still very limited. For example, there are only a limited number of stores where you can buy products using Bitcoin, and there are only a handful of ATMs that allow people to exchange cash for cryptocurrency. But, i think it is worth paying attention to developments in the cryptocurrency space because of its potential impact on traditional financial systems.",

It is not just a future real money; it is already real money today, although not yet as widely accepted as fiat.

I am tempted to say it might be possible in the future, like say, 3 centuries later but I don't see how that's going to work when there are so many cryptocurrencies available. If bitcoin were the only cryptocurrency then maybe in 100-300 years it might overthrow fiat but with the amount of crypto available today and more to come in the future I don't see how possible it is.Cryptocurrencies would always be a medium of exchange. It has come to stay most especially BITCOIN. There are other acceptable mediums of exchange aside from fiat today and I think bitcoin would be one of them in the future. I don't know how long it will take to be accepted worldwide. When I got on this platform, I began to see bitcoin differently; as a medium of exchange and not just an investment. Fiat is seen as a medium of exchange that is traded and also an investment so why can't bitcoin too be seen and used in that way?",
