You can simply charge that to my manager if I beat around the bush about payment.I'll only pay when the item reaches me (I'll take it for $20 instead), meaning you go first.If you agree, let's talk further.",

Can you show proofs that you have this Galaxy Tab S10 and is this working and also there are other things that are needed to be considered. And I will say that you should give full details and also other such things like Shipping costs and in Which country are you?",
