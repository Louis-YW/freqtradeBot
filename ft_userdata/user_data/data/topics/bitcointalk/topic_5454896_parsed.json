That's what makes it the best ballet wallet. Ballet discontinued them. So unless they start making them again. You won't find one safe enough to use.",

Only info I got so far is you will get three identical cards.The concept actually sounds great.they were great, originally they were $99 then went up to $129, then $159 and then $199 and i think they ended at $229 I think.they kept pushing up the price - not sure why. They cancelled them due to customers who would buy them and add funds but then forget their self created passphrase and then somehow expect Ballet to know it. The whole point of the pro was that Ballet never knew the second part, only the customer did.",

I personally loved it as it was then super easy to use as a hot wallet - no one could ever see the pass phrase and encrypted key at the same time.",
