  "content": "I decided to summarize the events/news that led to bitcoin bull run and bear market since 2013 to date. Bull run 2013: August 2013, Bitcoin was officially declared as a unit of account by German regulators. This led to the adoption of bitcoin, and by December 2013 the price of bitcoin reached $1163 for the first time, which is the first bull run. February 2014: After the bull run come the bear market and this was caused by the hack of Mt. Gox Exchange, in which around 750000 bitcoin that belongs to users was stolen and this led to the bankruptcy of the exchange. Bitcoin price crashed from $600 to $111, which was a 90% drop in just two months from $1000-$111. Bull run 2017: 2017 was the year that thousands of cryptocurrency was created and ICO mania. This made the crypto market like a casino, where investors decide to invest on different altcoins to see it they will make profit, but they were all disappointed as the altcoins failed them. This led to investors having more trust in bitcoin and this fuelled bitcoin price from $1000 to $19892 in December 15, which gave a 20x rise on price of bitcoin within 12 months. However the rumor was that one of the altcoins dev pump funds into bitcoin to manipulate the price. Bear market 2018: In January 2018, Chinese authorities forcefully shut down mining operations in China, which made miners pack up their bags and moved to a bitcoin friendly country like Russia. The made bitcoin price to dip from 14,093 to $3250, which was the bottom line of that circle. Bull run 2021: The bull run was triggered with the news that US SEC will launch the first Bitcoin ETF in the US, also Tesla announced acquiring $1.5b worth of bitcoin. These news skyrocket the price of bitcoin, which led to the high demand of bitcoin due to FOMO and the price of bitcoin hits ATH of $65k in November 2021.Bear market 2022: Bitcoin price started to dip due to some natural challenges in the crypto market, but the worst of it all was the crash of FTX. In November 21,2022, bitcoin price dip to 15787 with a drop of 63%, and that was the bottom line. Bitcoin started bouncing back from January 2023 and till date the price is still moving up. Bull run 2025: The news of Bitcoin ETF approval is a great news that will help bitcoin price to reach a new ATH in the coming bull run after the halving, and let's hope to see a good price of bitcoin https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-price-historyI might say that the approval of Bitcoin ETF by SEC is a good news for bitcoin price to skyrocket during the bull run but we haven't seen any change in price yet. Quote Bitcoin is the only digital asset that Gensler routinely acknowledges is not a security, maintaining that the vast majority of other tokens fit the legal definition of securities that are rightfully under the SEC's jurisdiction.Gary Gensler was under pressure and this forced him to approve Bitcoin ETFWhat are your thoughts on this?Edited: PS",

We have seen that in 2021 and the new on ETF approval by US SEC is not new. So let us stop hoping to see the approval because it might be like 2021 that the approval was denied. Instead, let us focus more on using this time to stash more bitcoin to our portfolio, because the halving event will surely make bitcoin price to go higher after some months. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-price-historyThe bullrun we all awaits is that one coming after halving, it may be immediately or later after some months or even the following year before bitcoin bullrun will begin and new all time high will be discovered on several occasions till we arrived at the last one, but now that the ETF approval is looking to be a fainted hope on nothing else, we need to clarify ourselves on what exactly we are waiting on to make the market price rise and get a new all time high, this is more about bitcoin halving than bitcoin ETF, just as we all know that bitcoin market price is not being manipulative.If at the end no approval was made on ETF applications, we will still be fine with having ATH because there will always be a bullrun after it, this make the number five talk on bitcoin ETF and halving take my attention that the history is yet to be set, moreover, any economic news can also be a trigger to bitcoin rise or fall aside ETF approval or not, which makes halving the only possible and feasible means to what we expect for bullrun than ETF approval.Quote from: Sim_card on January 11, 2024, 02:41:29 PMUS government will never approve Bitcoin ETF if they haven't found a way to control bitcoin because they only approve what they can control.This should not be our conclusion yet, let the SEC by themselves make a public announcement for refusal to all pending Bitcoin spot ETF applications before we can say anything concerning that, you may discover that it's been approved by tomorrow or anytime soon, we shouldn't loose hope yet on that, besides, bullrun is not dependent on that alone.",

      "body": "The narrative really is this, ETF and market opening for many people who don't even know how to use bitcoin. We are going to have a lot of new money coming in, this will really boost the price to unimaginable values. Understanding the dynamics of the cycle a little, you can make the most of it and multiply your capital, but remember, after all, take advantage of the cycle, this is healthy, but always come back to bitcoin, in the end only it is what matters.",

I wouldn’t say they are off it Infact I will say due to this hype we might beat the current ATH before the year closes not like the other bull run.

I won’t lie I had the reason of the OP on what benefits the government will get from all this ETF but I can’t say it is manipulation but rather they want to actually centralized the investors they don’t want people privately owning this. Just like the CEX once you buy this spots you automatically leave it with this institutions and the government actually places your assets on tax or have access to them when they want since they know who owns it, it practically kills anonymity.",

The government will only control the Bitcoin of people who subscribed to buying the currency through third parties. If you keep your Bitcoin in non-custodial wallets, they cannot have control over it. Most people don't care about privacy or becoming their own bank, so many of them don't care if the government controls their funds, all they care about is profit. Quote from: Sim_card on January 11, 2024, 02:41:29 PMI might say that the approval of Bitcoin ETF by SEC might not come soon but it will linger around till the coming bull run. So let us stop hoping for this approval and use this opportunity to stash up or bitcoin portfolio and wait for the next bull run. OP you need to update your post because the Spot Bitcoin ETF has been approved, ending the long-time speculations. The price of Bitcoin is responding positively to the approval and hopefully, it will keep moving up. But I expect the price to beat its ATH and get to another piece milestone. However, it is believed that it might be after the halving or in the first quarter of 2025.",
