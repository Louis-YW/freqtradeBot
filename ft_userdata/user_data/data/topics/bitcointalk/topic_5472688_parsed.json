  "content": "Just as my title said i don't want to be too rude or becoming an enemy of many people here in this our local board, but lemme keep that aside I have often noticed that there are some people who are in founds of creating several topics while the previously created topic gain no attention or hasn't been handled as it's. Although it's not compulsory that all topics must be attended to or people must reply in that thread, what I want us to do is if you created a topic this morning or evening as it maybe wait for at least 24 or 48hrs before creating another topic except it's an urgent information that you need to update the community and even as that we have to examine it to know if is an urgent information.Note I am not trying to restrict anyone from creating topics but I know it because of the weekly merits that is resulting in littering the board which I know we are not doing it the right way rather just a bunch of spam and shitposting, and note If i should come across any or any profile that is regularly creating topic without giving some hours before creating another will result to immediate deletion. And I know if I report a post the mod and admin quickly get them deleted and I wouldn't want to bear a bad name if I report any post or profile that are constantly creating topics without even paying attention to the already created topics and thread.If it's about the weekly merit gained from Hugeblack sorry to say I can also specifically write to him to limit the offer let's see if we'll still see this same energy being wasted over time for creating topics instead of reading other people post to learn what is going on.I can tell you of myself that I don't regularly create topics if not for the one I created last night and this one, not that I lack what to post or lack something to say about new topics, let us be reasonable enough to maintain this good offer someone gave us without jeopardizing it because if he stops I believe many newbie and members even to full members will be very slow except for those already in a campaign that will still have the energy burning.Look I also want to grow above my rank but despite hitting where I am now I still need to grow and climb more higher but I noticed that some people want to misused this Golden opportunities, yes ! I mean a very sweet and calm offer given to us at a platter of Gold is not what we can just stopped it by ourselves. The most important thing is be constructive while replying any existing topics and thread, and again you must not be the first person to reply in that thread to gain merits, even though you are the last or you are at page 30 whenever reputable forum members gets there and read your post he will be moved to drop you merits but that doesn't mean the rest people who replied earlier gained merits before but it's the rate at which you constructed your post.I can vividly say that most of my merits gained didn't from being the first to comment in any topics and thread created. I actually don't want to point at any person or any user but if you knows that you often do this within yourself that is reading this post then know that it's you that I am saying. For sometimes now I never really put much attention over here because I know that I have to give small space to reduce spamming rather read and learn what others has already said.I don't want to go more further but the truth be told, one thing that people don't like to hear is the truth and is always bitter while saying it. Please I will also call on CryptopreneurBrainboss to monitor every profile that is spamming or that is constantly creating topics without giving space for at least 24 to 48hrs, they can reply any post from the local but littering the board with topics isn't ideal for my own view. So if you notice such person do not include them in the weekly merits and also write to hugeblack not to accept their monthly merits awards from the local board so that we can make here a better place for us.Thank you all.",

      "body": "There have been several talks in the board to limit the amount of spam the board is getting since the merit incentives for posts on the board started. Many of them forgot that only quality posts will make the list but throw as much as they can to the board and hoping some sticks and makes the list. This is very similar to how Elon Musk's X curb spamming on their platform since they began paying content creators for the impression they get on their content that ads are displayed on.With the measures (like the one pioneered by @Agbe https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472308.0),we'll see results if people begin being objective and report obvious spam.",

Say I be moderator, admin, local board abi forum owner? Beside wetin dey enter my submission na more of replies and not topic as topics wey dey get better chance of been rewarded no dey too full here na mostly reply dem. If you see someone spamming cautious dem and report dem to moderators for deletions. If dem no tak advice, report dem for spam on those spam reporting thread for meta. No go dey red tagged anybody but you can give dem neutral tag although tags aren't meant for posting behaviors (even theymos discourage us from tagging people for their posting pattern) but when you see person wey no wan do the needful, you make am learn lesson so others will learn from his ignorance and behavior demselfs.Make we no go dey put rules wey no dey forum for here and any rules wey una wan put wey no go in accordance with dat of the forum make una know say na una go enforce am and not looking up to me to do that. There's no rule against creating of more than one topic in 24-48hrs that I know of, you can create as many topic as you want provided they're of quality and when you see someone misusing the privilege, report dem to moderators and when moderators aren't doing their jobs perfectly It'll help us to get our own local board moderators which anybody dat theymos finds worthy (possibly based on their ratio of good reported posts on the local baord) will be made moderator to oversee the board. Make una no dey fear to report, talking no go solve anything. If you report one person to take corrections and him no gree, submit their names for spam threads and watch how others learn.",

Anyway, I no blame that peso sha, I blame the peso wey introduce am to this forum cos the peso no explain give am well that the btt forum no need people wey go d spam the forum d go. Em go be our local board wey we d try build to be where intellectual people we wan know about bitcoin go d. As the shit don happen so, I wan use the opportunity make a request of \"make we d explain well give the newbies wey we wan introduce to the forum\". Make we no just introduce them to the forum without giving them the guidelines on what and what them no supposed do for the BTT forum. I believe we go d alright if we d do that. One love",

I remembered when someone posted something on the list of the most active boards in the forum and our local board was among the first four active boards. It is so because of the posts and contributions members of the forum are constantly making.I know there are lots of shit posts and irrelevant threads also in the maybe to benefit from the weekly merits and I don't think it is a good thing but I don't think that it is right to stop others from airing their view because in the local board because of the mistake of others.",

I know say some post for here no dey too follow and na why some thread no dey get reply at all and some na just one or two but if we enforce some unfavorable rules now Omo everybody go japa from this board.Na moderator wey we never get dey bring all this issue if not na simple thing we mod go dey handle. But like seriously I no happy with the way we dey shout on this issue recently. If I count am, we don get up to five thread now wey dey talk about this thing. People go dey think say we no fit manage our board and e don pass our power. This issue of spam no be only newbies, na all for us join. Spamming na to repeat something wey no necessary. Everyone wan dey relevant and recognize able. If not we no fit gather for one thread discuss and iron out this issue?I no support spam and low quality post but abeg make we allow everyone feel at home.

Legend, you have spoken well. In anything one is doing in this life we need each others back as one person alone can't do it on their own at all just as you said creating of more topics isn't the problem but let it be meaningful and has creativity in it. Though reporting ourselves to moderator may not actually be the solution except in a situation whereby you have been advised on several occasions and still keep doing it then the person can possibly be reported to moderator. Nothing kills a forum like lack of cooperation and organization, like moderating oneself in a forum and keeping to the rules and regulations is what also gives a forum credit. I am made to understand that external bodies (non Nigerians) visits our local board to see how things are going so it will be very sad if our local board is being reported for inadequate activities here so I urge us all to practice things that will bring about good ideas that will elevate us rather than downgrade us.It is necessary for us to know that some other countries ain't happy with the fact that we have our own local board where we can share thoughts and ideas among ourselves so we shouldn't be involved in anything that will jeopardize the efforts of people that solicited for us to have our own local board. If I am not mistaken, we Nigeria is the only African country that have our own local board so we ought to be proud of ourselves and be positive in our activities here.",
