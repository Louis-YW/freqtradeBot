Introducing Spinel Finance - a completely new solution that makes it easier for you to manage your assets conveniently and transparently.Hello everyone, I've been a crypto investor for quite some time. For everyone, whether investing in crypto or not, they need a place to store the assets they have accumulated after so much hard work.Here, I would like to share with you some of the knowledge and tools that I have accumulated in the process of investing in crypto and learning about DAO.What is DAO? If you have not heard of DAO, you can understand that DAO is a decentralized organization, they do not have a head, all decisions of their organization are based on Vote for proposals coming from other organizations. members in the organization. DAO exists everywhere, where there is a community that is part of a project, there will be a DAO. Why do I believe in DAO so much? For me, DAO is the future, DAO has great power because it is decided by many individuals without following a single head. DAOs, like other organizations, need a place to manage their organization. Thus Spinel Labs was born.Spinel Labs, a DAO that provides solutions for DAOs, such as DAO management, Voting, Marketplace,... and in that, asset management. Spinel Finance is a product of Spinel Labs, which has done a great job in creating a feature for DAOs to manage their assets. More than just asset management, DAOs can also exercise voting rights to use their assets, even more than raise capital for their DAOs. Spinel Finance can help DAOs create their own tokens, not only that, users can also participate in DAOs and perform token exchanges. Spinel Finance can split their assets into different supported tokens. In addition to supporting digital assets such as tokens, Spinel Finance also supports NFT. Asset management has never been easier with Spinel Finance, you may not be part of any DAO, you can still create a squad to invest, manage assets alone or with you your friends. Proposals for assets in a DAO are made transparently and fairly, everyone who holds the property has the right to Vote.It can be said that Spinel Labs has been very successful in building a product called Spinel Finance - A great solution for DAOs.
