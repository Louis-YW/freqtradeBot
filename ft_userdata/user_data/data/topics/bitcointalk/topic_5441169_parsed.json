  "content": "Hi guys,If you followed my previous topic about how I turned over a million dollars plus with no bonus from the sportsbook (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434831.msg61599879#msg61599879) you may be interested in this thread.I closed my account with the above sportsbook and was going through my account history and found this bet I placed two years ago.I spent many hours researching and selected 19 legs that I liked. I placed $300 and collected $417,000. I only chose sports that I have a high knowledge of and tried to bet with no emotion. The first match was a rugby game on the 18th of September 2020 and the last match was a futures bet for Kansas City Chiefs to win their conference and make the Super Bowl on the 18th of January 2021. I told a group of my friends to copy my bet but they were impatient and didn't want to wait four months. Only one of my friends followed my bet and he placed $100 which won him just under $140,000. I live in Australia so a lot of the matches were Australian Rugby games.The bet was originally worth $686,000 but Niko Price could only manage a draw against Donald Cerrone (after having a point deducted for a BS accidental eye poke) so the UFC match was voided and my winnings decreased to $417,000.I find sometimes it is best to place future bets instead of match bets if you can find some value. I have a few similar bets which won $644,000 and $258,000 so I will try to find them and post it shortly.Always remember to only bet what you can afford to lose and gamble responsibly.   Main bet: https://imgur.com/a/v8rAEV7Breakdown of individual legs:https://imgur.com/a/SDuZbbvhttps://imgur.com/a/NhOSyejhttps://imgur.com/a/GnYGjFWhttps://imgur.com/a/wEkVnkk",

We then went to the best steakhouse in Sydney and I spent over $1500 on dinner and alcohol. I also gave them $2000 each in cash the same night so they were happy.",

Investing in real estate is also wonderful because the price of houses always appreciates. But you didn't consider investing in bitcoin???I live in Sydney, Australia and the real estate prices here are ridiculous especially since a lot of immigrants and Chinese in particular love Australia. I was already exposed to around $50,000USD in BTC in 2020 and only had one property so I thought buying another two would be the safer option. Judging by current BTC prices and average home prices in Sydney I think I made the correct decision.",

Gambling is not for everyone and not everyone has this big win on their forehead very few gamblers have this big win on their forehead and you are one of them. I advise you to withdraw these amounts to invest in various businesses and various potential assets without using them again for gambling and avoid betting large amounts later on in the temptation of gambling or else you will lose these big winnings.  It won't take long to lose",

I mostly see this kind of bet with only less than $100 amount but you went further into putting $300 in a risky parlay and I think the courage is what I love about that. It's not easy to release that kind of amount, especially in a very long parlay, it could go south at any game like those with 1.82 to 3.64 odds. I bet that is really your lucky day and will be one of the unforgettable moments in your life. Thanks for sharing, this got me pumped up.",
