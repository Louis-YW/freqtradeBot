  "content": "Note the irony. I have seen Zilon's thread that he just locked and as I want to respond I thought of opening a new one that reminded me of BenCodie's one. In it, Zilon asked:QuoteIs there anything that can be done to resolve the negative trust or is this the final judgement on this account?As I am one of those who left you red tag I would like to respond. I am open to review of my tags, but in this case I see it difficult because it is a massive rule breaking with several alts accounts. If evidence were presented that all three of us red taggers were wrong I understand that we would delete or change the feedback. Another thing could be that over time you would continue to use the forum without breaking the rules and maybe it could be changed to neutral, or if you showed trustworthy in some way you could earn green feedbacks over the red ones. Obviously the concern you have about this is monetary. The feedbacks at the very least make it difficult to participate in paid signature campaigns and if there are many without any green ones, they make it impossible. But they are not the end of the world, I have recently seen that Royse777 has accepted Digaran, who does not have a very nice trust profile, in one of his campaigns. Surely Royse777 has weighed other reasons that outweight his profile to accept him. One thing I see is that Digaran has been posting for about 10 months without getting paid and that could be one of the reasons.I want to be clear that this is not a criticism of Royse777, just an example of how a member with bad trust profile could join a good signature campaign.",

You have been able to clear my doubts and i am not in any way soliciting you remove the tag. So far your reply here is clear enough but unfortunately moving on with this account is total waste of time when i have other things to attend to. I won't come here to prove to anyone i deserve their trust everyone have the right to believe whatever and act the way the choose to.QuoteObviously the concern you have about this is monetary.

Let's stop this habit of painting others black just to stand out as the saint, it is uncalled for and not necessary. If Royse777 accepted Digaran in one of his campaigns it was simply a matter of choice. And it will be so funny to realise Digaran is even more reputable than most critics who parade the forum with lots of positive tags. I think it is high time the highly profiled users get policed around.",

On the contrary, I have been quite clear on this issue. In this forum if paid signature campaigns were to disappear I would expect a 99% reduction in traffic. In my case, I have been in other forums for many years, and I used to do this activity before registering in this one, without being paid. Now I am still registered in other forums, but guess where I write 95% of what I write.So yes, getting paid to post is a very important component of the traffic here, but it is also very important to respect the rules. If you don't, you risk having difficulty or even impossibility to participate in paid signature campaigns.",

That's reasonable, and that's basically been my policy as well when it comes to reversing red trust.  But it's rare that someone will PM me a year (or even later) after they got tagged and have any kind of evidence that they've been a positive presence here.  Digaran is an exception to that perhaps, but I wouldn't even count 10 months of non-paid posting as an argument for removing a tag.",

He stated the obvious. I doubt if i will have to fake positive presence just to get the negative tags removed, if i should do that it will show how jobless and independent i am.
