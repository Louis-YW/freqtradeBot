Generally when we are typing on forum or computer browser it takes a lot of time, for this I want you to have a good software where typing can be done from the Speech.I don't know if you think speaking and have it written by some software is much easier. I ha e tried it a few times on Google translate and even with English being the official language in my nation, am always left with repetition and editing of speeches. That's more time wasting than you can get by typing it out. Type more often or frequent and your hands would adapt quickly to your keys to pick just the alphabets or words you need.Instead of looking out for some easy speak and get written app, you should do more of typing, it exercises your digits and a lot more calm as well.",

      "body": "Although I found those speech to text software's not useful for me, as I am comfortable typing on the keyboard and these are also time-consuming while optimizing the text because those softwares don't work perfectly all the time. Also, It is a bad practice for anyone to use them for forum posting, but here is a link for an extension you can use a chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-to-text/jdcdafhjjjfnkoeilnjmnadadaoehgdc?hl=en",
