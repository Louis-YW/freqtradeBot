Or if you are foreseeing your passing soon then you can literally make use of that option.And for the other international exchanges, Upgrade00 is right. You can simply contact the exchange about the passing of the owner just like what's said on Binance article about someone's death and his cryptos on exchanges.Quote from: https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-safely-pass-on-your-crypto-when-you-die[...] the executor of the will should contact the exchanges to inform them of the death and provide all relevant information and documents. The right way to do this is usually set out in Terms of Service of the exchange. This step usually requires proof of death, such as a death certificate and proof that you have the authority to deal with the crypto assets of the deceased account holder. For example, the executor of the will can provide a copy of the will or court authority. [...]",

If you don't see it in other exchanges, it also means that they don't want to have this kind of options. First off, we don't want to leave huge amount of crypto in exchanges, second rule, how will the exchanges know that the person really dies?Not to burst the bubble, but it's going to be hard for a international exchanges to proved that the real owner has passed away. Death Certificates can also be faked so exchanges should have doubts when some claimants suddenly appear and putting pressures on them to released the crypto because he or she was supposedly the one to get it when the real owner die.",

I want to confirm hugeblack opinion that the funds deposited are not for saving but for trading. The amount of money on the exchange must not be large or just for trading needs.Inheriting assets to someone you trust is enough to hand over your exchange account password, GA code and email password.Expecting safe funds on the exchange with this feature option certainly cannot guarantee that the money can be obtained by the person who will receive it because we don't know how long the exchange will last in operation.A safe place to store money is not on an exchange.",

I translated this topic a long time agohttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5285003.0Receiving an inheritance is not a quick process. For example, in Russia, heirs wait at least six months before registering an inheritance, so if the deceased has bank accounts, then this money is withdrawn earlier through a bank card, and real estate or cars are registered by a notary only after 6 months.Do you need these problems? It is better that your heirs have access to the exchange account and can withdraw coins at any time.",

With the recent turn out of events on SEC against CEX, it is disastrous to want to find yourself in the kind of situation FTX users found themselves a few years ago",

I am not sure how popular it is on the international level but Chit Fund is unregulated instrument that also has nominee requirement!! On the other hand WazirX is large centralised exchange which means they have strict watch of Reserve Bank of India. In uncertain conditions like death they will need to take eight course of action for the money on that account. It cant just sir there forever and away from the circulation. It is actually good option for long term traders and with investment on long portfolios.",

But I have not seen such option in international exchanges so far. Any reason why? This can be a good option which will hell transfer of funds to relatives in case of death of main account holder. Your country's local exchange made this possible as a result of them being active and operating in that locality with some regulatory authority involved, which means the exchange has the required information, both legal and personal, that could be used for transactions or ownership, which many other international exchanges don't care to have. Let's not forget that centralised exchanges are no different from our local banks, and as such, the exchange can also be following the same monetary policy that is governing the country's financial system, so it's easy for them to do that. If you are the type that saves money on crypto exchanges, then that might be helpful for you, as you don't need to worry about who will be in charge of your funds if you are unable to reach them, as many people always do, as you will have to set those up on time. But saving crypto on exchanges is not the best option; they are meant for converting, selling, and buying and should be used for such. 24 hours of holding on exchange is even too much to decide where to withdraw your money.",

Why this might be possible,I however don’t see it to be an added advantage.It in fact promotes the wrong idea of having to store your coins on a centralized exchange which remains susceptible to hacks, shutting down, being seized by authorities and maybe getting involved in some wrong investment. All of which could lead to a lose of your holdings and your purpose of having to leave your coin on an exchange just because of a nominee feature would be defeated.Other than, being way too excited about this,You could as well sort out for a best means to confer your private key or seed phrase to a next of kin and possibly some directives to retrieving what is left behind in whatever wallet.That way (although you would be long gone with no reason to worry), your coin is sure to get to the right hands depending on what permutations you’ve put in place to ensure that.",

If its not there, its not there, no question of asking why its not there. Of course it is a good option to have. You can nominate someone and then they have to undergo a KYC and be able to collect your funds in case something bad happens. It is the present in most of the Indian Stock brokers and I guess the crypto exchanges are following the same suit, WazirX being from India.Possible that is near future the international exchanges add in a similar option too. Even some gambling sites have an emergency withdrawal address locked in for every account.",

The details of transferring ownership are complex and differ between countries, and I do not think that a multinational platform would want to delve into these details, especially since many of the cases in the courts are disputes over the rights of the heirs and to whom ownership of the money will devolve, and if there is a will or desire of the account owner and the complications will become more complex, they do not want that headache.",
