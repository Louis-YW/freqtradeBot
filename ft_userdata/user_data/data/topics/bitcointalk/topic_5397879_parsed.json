They have refused to unlock my account or respond confirming that the information is sufficient. This has now cost me $3000. I have tried every avenue imaginable to get them to do the right thing. I am extremely frustrated. I'm considering taking legal action. By all means, do so... Really, there are guys on this very forum that have been trying to pass freewallet's KYC procedure for years... There seem to be only 2 things that seem (or seemed) to work: drag the discussion into the public eye (like you are doing now) and threatening (and following true) with legal action.https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=016660200577587308545%3Aesf40ml9aag&ie=UTF-8&q=freewallet+scam&sa=Google+search#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=freewallet%20scam&gsc.page=1Their mode of \"action\" seems to be more or less the same every time: many people have a strong gut feeling they're paying for positive reviews, good search engine rankings,... so they can lure in new victims.when a victim makes an account, they wait untill they start using itthen, after a while, they selectively lock bigger (but not huge) accounts and force their victims to do a ludicrous KYC procedure including translated and notarised documents and video's they just keep repeating the same questions, even if a victim took the time and effort (and payed) to jump trough their KYC hoopsthey hope that in the end, the victim thinks: \"it's just $2000, i cannot hire a lawyer for that amount\" and gives upAt least, that's my perception of their mode of operationsI want to end with a positive note: most people in our community are friendly, there are several honest exchanges and there are several good wallets... You just had the bad luck of picking a bad one... Whenever there's money involved, there are bad apples, and you had the bad luck of picking such a bad apple.In hindsight: if you would have come into this forum before you started your crypto journey, and told us you'd be using freewallet, anybody with some decent background in the community would have strongly advised against this: you really need to use a non-custodial wallet, like bitcoin core, or electrum, or... well, there are at least a dozen \"honest\" wallets around... If you decide to stick around, please do some investigation and ask us for directions before actually going trough with anything.",

I've remembered Elon Musk have a problem with this exchange on the last year FreeWallet.org is a scam - Elon Musk account locked by Freewallet criminals. His accusation was solved quickly, this because Elon Musk has enough power to influence his followers. Since you're an average Joe, it wouldn't be easy.",
