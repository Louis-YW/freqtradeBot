However, if you are set on running one, then the next best option would be via Tor, and only risking your information being retrieved via the exit node. However, for the majority of people running via clear net is probably okay. As long as your ISP can be trusted, which there's an argument that no third party or ISP can be trusted. It highly depends on your threat model, and who you trust. If you trust your ISP, then there's no real concerns. If you don't trust your security or your ISP security, then if any of those were compromised an attack could potentially find out you run the Bitcoin node, and therefore highly likely to use Bitcoin yourself, which could mean you become a target, theoretically. Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on March 13, 2023, 07:37:58 PMwhy shouldn't you also use VPN as an additional option?You're basically involving another third party, when you don't necessarily need too. The only way someone knows you're running a Bitcoin node via Tor, would be the exit node itself. Unless, the entity you're trying to hide your Bitcoin node activity from owns that exit node, there's no way of them deciphering what you are doing. If you involve a VPN service, then that VPN service could potentially know you're running a Bitcoin node, as well as the exit node of that Tor circuit. Your ISP would know you're running Tor, but there's nothing wrong with running Tor, and it doesn't tell the ISP what Tor is being used for. If your ISP thinks it's an issue you're running Tor, change ISP. However, if all depends on who you don't want to know you run a Bitcoin node or own Bitcoin. If it's the government, they will know it's generally considered even the most private persons on the internet can't avoid the government, plus if you live in a country which requires taxation you should be declaring your taxes on Bitcoin to them.

People are really bad at keeping their VPS safe and secure and are bound to make mistakes that opens up the attack surface. Other than the possibilities of misconfiguration, it gets worse by the fact that only one entity is likely to route their traffic to it. Hypervisors also provide little to no privacy to that.VPN and Tor is pretty doable, Nord has it built in where certain servers are optimized for Tor. It just provides a false sense of security however, and adds little to privacy if any. Try not to use both at the same time.",

There is a reason why most people who are truly concerned about their privacy don't use VPNs. There are tons of ways for people to compromise their privacy when they're using VPN. It really doesn't matter what your government thinks about your habits, you have the rights to maintain and protect your own privacy and they shouldn't have any problems with that. So long as your Tor connection is secure enough such that nothing is leaked.VPNs on the contrary, doesn't provide sufficient privacy. Your VPN client can leak information if not configured properly, the addition of an additional eavedropper in your connection, the possibility of the data being analyzed, so on and so forth. ISPs will absolutely track and collect your metadata no matter what you do, like what NSA has always been doing.",

If you are, then there is no point hiding anything so long as you can protect your privacy properly using Tor. They cannot legally prosecute you without sufficient information, and if done correctly, landing on their watchlist does nothing to you.On the contrary, there are many ways that you can land on their watchlist and using Tor is probably an insignificant part of it. If they want to monitor you, they would pounce at every chance that they can get. Using a VPN in this case provides you with a false sense of security.If you are confident that you can ensure that your VPN isn't already a honeypot, and you can effectively prevent any leakage of information, then go ahead. It would still be possible to conduct traffic analysis to come to the conclusion that you're still running Tor.At the end of the day, you can certainly do so with marginal improvement on your privacy. That is assuming you know how to prevent any VPN leakage and configure Tor to work properly before considering the even slower synchronization.",

GetTor will respond with an email containing links from which you can download Tor Browser, the cryptographic signature (needed for verifying the download), the fingerprint of the key used to make the signature, and the packageâs checksum. You may be offered a choice of \"32-bit\" or \"64-bit\" software: this depends on the model of the computer you are using; consult documentation about your computer to find out more.But I guess if you're living in a place where email is heavily censored as well, the next best solution is to try to find a download link for it on IPFS.Maybe, if some bloke is clever enough to store the download on a blockchain somewhere (probably they already have in one form or another).",
