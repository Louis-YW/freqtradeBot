It's actually my first time hearing it. I am not sure about its safety (malware wise) but could try it out on my old laptopOther tools similar to tradingview i used before are coinlayze and cryptowat.ch. As for Twitter, I must say it's full of shills and wannabe crypto millionaire lately. They can do anything to get followers and people sign up through their referral links. It's a mess out there.",

It does look like you're not a really a technical analysis based trader which is cool as long as you're making profits. Not everyone is going to be a technical analyst anyway. If you made those profits in the bear market, I have no doubt that you'll do well in a full blown bull run.For beginners, these tools might suffice. Heck, even intermediate players can utilize it to seek out good coins to trade. But what I have seennthat has worked for the best players out there is good psychology and some technical analysis skills.",

There is nothing that can achieve you profits but the proper trading channel like having market research on the coin that you are investing. The market research is only from trusted sources and not some shitty youtube channel where they are getting paid to do the promotion. In today's date any shit project would invest heavily in creating good-looking channels and promo videos so let us not fall for the trap. The only valid source is, their continuous updates from the official website. The community that is involved with them and what questions they are asking and what answers they are getting from them. This can add up a tremendous amount of knowledge in understanding what is the direction of the project really. So that's all. No tradinview, no checking on shill accounts and stuff.",

That is very possible. In fact, 120% APY is small to what some people earn. If you think it is not possible, just go to one of the crypto exchange derivative trading leaderboard, you will see the profit traders that have not closed there position are earning. But also a trader can lose while some may not earn up to that in a year.But do not get me wrong, I do not know if OP is telling the truth or not.",

Your tools are the most simplest one and there are many tools providing the same services. So it all depends on the likelihood of someone about some tool.

Way too many phishing links and too many of those scams where “Elon musk will send you 2x of whatever ETH you send to me. People fall for it because it seems to work.I think that's an other thing. Like, once i read a post that a twitter influencer made a post in which he asked people to send him money, and in short period of time he collected million of dollars. And i was shocked like he asked and people sent. First i thought it is just money laundering, because some transactions were huge like 20 to 50 eth huge. But some are small from different Wallets to mix the transaction in each other. Just like a mixer which would made it difficult for authorities to investigate everyone. But later, i came to know that, most people just sending small money in the hope of getting airdrop. So, basically they were airdrop hunters. This technique really left me shocked. So, this Elon Musk's statement you aforementioned is most likely be a scam and such statements on twitter had nothing to do with trading and it does not have direct or indirect impact on the market.",

Fibonacci and other indicators too can work both ways depending on how you are placing your fibo. It is reasonably so because market don't go move just one direction, it is either bull or bear and it is same indicator that are used to analyze the chart.",
