      "body": "Honestly, three days of the trial version sounds too short to get a broad picture of the possibilities of your tool. Events in trading can sometimes be consequential and a sample of three days may not show full functionality (if everything written on the site is really so).Maybe you could offer a longer trial period, a month for example, or some partially limited version, a limited number of alerts per day, for example.Through a short search, I was unable to find any significant references or adequate feedback about your service, perhaps the priority should be to familiarize potential users with the platform first. Or maybe I'm wrong.",

      "body": "Hello, and thank you for your message.It's completely understandable that you haven't found any reviews for our web application yet. Indeed, the project has only been online for two weeks, which explains the lack of feedback so far.Our current challenge is to make our application known to as many people as possible. An initial version was launched in 2018, but we quickly realized that certain aspects needed to be improved. So, we paused the project to take into account the feedback from our first users and refine our offering.Today, we are pleased to present a revised version of our application, which we hope is more in line with our customers' expectations. To allow you to discover its potential, we offer a free three-day trial. This is a relatively short period, but we believe it's enough to give you an idea of what our tool can bring to you. Of course, we remain open to your feedback and are ready to adjust our strategy if necessary.One of the major novelties of this version is the ability to customize all the tools according to your preferences. We are aware that each trader has their own habits and we don't want to impose ours. That's why we've made sure that our application can adapt to you, not the other way around.If our roadmap seems promising, we invite you to take advantage of the free three-day trial. To do so, you will need to enter your credit card information, but rest assured, no fees will be charged without your consent. Once on the application, you can cancel your plan at any time from the settings of your account. If you decide not to cancel at the end of the three-day trial, know that you can always end your subscription later. Only the current month will be billed, as there is no duration commitment.Finally, I would like to highlight that we have integrated Stripe, the global leader in electronic payment, to ensure the security of your transactions. Our application is thus available in 20 different currencies.We hope you will give our application a chance and we look forward to hearing your feedback.",

Indeed, the project has only been online for two weeks, which explains the lack of feedback so far.Just because you are new and still unknown, shouldn't the goal be to encourage new users to test the platform more seriously? As far as I know, the competition in your domain is very serious.QuoteIf our roadmap seems promising, we invite you to take advantage of the free three-day trial.

Only the current month will be billed, as there is no duration commitment.This is a very bad solution. Even for the test, it is necessary to leave credit card information? Promises that there is no place for abuse or unauthorized use are really not enough since you have no reputation or business history.Also, there is no privacy, it is not possible to register anonymously, or to pay for the services of the service with Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. QuoteFinally, I would like to highlight that we have integrated Stripe, the global leader in electronic payment, to ensure the security of your transactions. Our application is thus available in 20 different currencies.btw. If you already have integrated Stripe, then why are you asking for CC information?",

      "body": "I understand you're wondering why we ask for your credit card information even before the trial period. Allow me to explain.We use \"Stripe Checkout\" to handle our transactions and subscriptions. It is Stripe, not us, that manages your credit card details. This means we don't have access to this information, enhancing the security of your data. When you enter your credit card information, it allows Stripe to manage your subscription more efficiently.In fact, with Stripe, you have the ability to change your subscription plan at any time, whether to upgrade or downgrade according to your needs. This flexibility is a key advantage of using Stripe Checkout.Asking for credit card details before the trial period is a common practice for online subscription services. This facilitates a smooth transition from the trial period to the paid subscription, if you choose to continue using the service.We chose to implement this solution as it provided the best balance of security, convenience, and flexibility for our users. We don't have the ability to change this requirement, as it is intrinsic to how Stripe Checkout operates.I hope this explanation clarifies your concerns. If you have further questions or concerns, please let us know.",
