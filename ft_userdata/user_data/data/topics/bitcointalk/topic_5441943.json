No one said that you must invest in Bitcoin.

You should have spent the money on what your father gave it to you for. all that is actually not necessary.",

And from the interface of the exchange in your image I think you used kucoin which means you'll have to withdraw your coin from that exchange into your non-custodial wallet. Remember Not Your Key Not your Coin  so for now I'd say you have no Bitcoin just some numbers been displayed on your exchange.

Your next mission, I suppose, is to make some money to buy more Bitcoin. Are you still a student? A university graduate without a job yet? Either way, you can take simple jobs in the meantime like delivering pizza, flipping burgers, making coffee, and others and set aside a few dollars for your next Bitcoin purchase. That would be a nice addition to what your father gives you. Perhaps a slight cut on your miscellaneous expenses would also help you grow your savings a bit.Anyway, it seems you are using a centralized platform. You can actually buy Bitcoin from non-custodial wallets. At least your Sats are sent directly to an address whose private keys are under your control, and you will also receive real ones, not just IOUs or paper Sats.",

Bitcoin is undoubtedly one of the best coins to invest in. But since you have invested, you must be patient. Because currently the Bitcoin market is slightly down. There may be some loss in the first stage so don't lose patience if you are patient you will surely get good reward.",

For my part it worked well to accumulate small regular amounts in BTC, if you manage to keep them until the next bull run (I hope we will see the next one a few months after the halving of 2024 but no one really knows) it can be very profitable.If you don't already know, I advise you to look at \"safe\" investment strategies like DCA for example. As long as you only use money that you accept as lost, the risk is not huge. Of course, doing an ALL IN in Bitcoin could be more risky.Last but not least, I would advise you to get a hardware wallet if you plan to keep investing for a long time. \"Not your keys, not your coins’’Even a software wallet like Electrum will still be much more efficient in terms of security than storing your BTC on a CEX. Storing your coins on an exchange is extremely risky, and in absolute terms, as long as it's on a CEX such as Binance, Coinbase etc. you own nothing.I wish you a successful journey with Bitcoin !",

Since you are newbie try to learn more about crypto since its not all about buy low then sell it to its higher price, you need to learn technical analysis so that your trades will got a high chance to became successful.  $14.55 is good capital to start you can use this for practicing yourself on exchange and trade it on other altcoins.",

If you want to invest low amounts of money I would recommend you to buy altcoins like Litecoin or Dogecoin, because with those ones you can move the coins paying low fees.

Right, I can't emphasis it enough; No matter how small your holdings in Bitcoin, don't keep it on exchanges. I suppose, when you factor in the fee for withdrawing, it can seem counter productive if you've got small amounts. However, at the very least do it at different targets where your comfortable with paying the fee. Since, new users probably need to familiarize themselves with the right way of doing it, instead of getting too comfortable, and getting stung if anything ever happens to the exchange. Personally, I'd rather lose a little in fees, and know that my Bitcoin is secure than holding it on the exchange for a prolonged period. I usually, only deposit what I'm going to take out in an exchange, and I'd recommend doing the same whenever you're purchasing Bitcoin. Maybe, holding out until you can afford higher amounts to justify the fee might also be an option.",

He keeps doing it whenever he got some profit from his side hustle of selling goods. I lose track to his progress for over a year and now he is holding Bitcoin that greater to mine since he keeps accumulating using his side hustle and job profit. He said he is investing the majority of his profit after he saw that Bitcoin dump below 15k last year.I’m so glad to see this kind of story and I hope that you will become motivated to earn more for your Bitcoin accumulation journey. Most of us here started on small amount and just level up if you become comfortable and believer of Bitcoin. Just take it slow and enjoy the ride mate!",
