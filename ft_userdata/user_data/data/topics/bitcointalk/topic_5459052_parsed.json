My view is quite simple when it comes to economics that maintain life balance and can also govern our lives, from micro to macro actually they are different in terms of scale but does not seem to be much different.I still remember a story about a tree, they are created from a seed, over time with many influences, it becomes a big tree, and maybe from a small tree creates a forest, In terms of economic nature, I see it as similar to that forest, in each different field, but overall it is a common thing.",

Like for example the inflation rate, most people know how commonly happen inflation, most of the time it's about the supply and demand of the products, where we could say due to economic issue that could be experienced worldwide. And every issues in the world affects the economic status of the country for example, war, climate change and etc. For me, when economy are mentioned, the first thing that comes to my mind is just \"it runs by money\" those circulation of money what makes the economy standing like the USD that dominating around the world. And the ugly truth is that mostly rich people are the one who's benefits and taking advantage of the economy.",

Maybe I have to read it third time too. But now I don't wanted to. Because go some extent I understand that he just saying whales are manipulating our economy and trying to inflate more by using artificial methods ( which probably are like with covid-19 situations). And best way is to consider \"Shit coin\" to what? I mean that where I am confused. But according to the title and few lines I did understand the assignment 80% and this members has answered it well to and I also had the same points.Like why we should compare it like a shit coin, because anything either it is shit coin or not can be manipulated by whales. BTC can be manipulated by whales. So you should make a more lenient example.",

A shitcoin could actually multiply your worth a hundred fold very quickly. It can't happen with fiat. The monetary design is that money should slowly yet continuously lose its purchasing power, although sometimes it accelerates out of control. You're also probably wrong when you compare crises like the pandemic to be a time for rejection or correction and that the huge financial whales are forced to sell assets. They're actually not like us ordinary mortals. Even in times of crises, their worth are increasing. Let's not be naïve.

Everything will be severely affected but not destroyed, the US and the EU are no longer the only functioning economies in the world. Our world has become more multipolar and no longer dependent on the economy created by the United States and its allies.

And it also needs to be understood that conducting research on many sectors like that is clearly not easy even though it can be done within a certain deadline, but it can also be tiring because to find out the history that has occurred in the global economy it must be based on analysis from a very reliable source.And for the damn coin pump that you said I consider it a normal thing that only comes temporarily so I personally don't really care about that kind of thing even though there are many other people who care about it for the sake of getting a momentary profit. As for other matters such as the monetary and banking system, it is necessary to know because it can also affect the development of the business economy globally.",

This is precise calculation so far and makes it realistic to understand how bitcoin ain’t gonna get the dominance status any time soon. If we look at bitcoin hundred years from now then also bitcoin won’t dominate the USD because with the time inflation, economic crisis cycles, supply chain getting costly and much more will play their roles.  This will make bitcoin priced or valued at the same ratio as if today. Consider it like real estate or something. Buying an acre worth land at XYY USD is pretty much same as if buying it ten years from now. Because there is appreciation of everything. Cost of materials as well as minimum wagers and bonuses or income. If someone calculate the math properly about this accounting then it makes lot more sense. Better enjoy the profits along the way and stop thinking if it is next dominance or not.",

Simply put, to understand the economy is to start from microeconomics first. Master this sector and maximize its income, no matter how the world economy is rotating between one policy and another, because when you are able to control the surrounding economic growth sector, it will be fine. As long as an organized emergency fund and stored assets can go in and out according to the target then it creates ideal conditions.Apart from that, I think that no matter how chaotic the world's economic conditions are, we still return to conditions that are truly real. Regarding the world economy, it's the government's job, don't look too far into it if before our eyes the economic system is still messy and can't be overcome.",
