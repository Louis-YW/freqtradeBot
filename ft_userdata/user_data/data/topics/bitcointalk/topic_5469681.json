  "content": "Introduction:The world of cryptocurrency is so unpredictable and even so exciting where there's many groups of individuals and known entities called \"whales\" who hold large amounts of digital assets. These Big whales have the power to Increase the prices of BitcoinBTC and sometimes they play mind games or game of sentiments with short-term investors to liquidate them out of market, they use the power of their big asset along with the power of social media to generate panic situation for the sort investors due to this, they caught in the trap of FOMO. Who Are Big Whales?Actually, big whales are essentially big players in the market who are expert of playing game of sentiments with short investors to liquidate their assets by putting them in FUD (Fear, uncertainty, and Doubt) and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) kind of situation. They're individuals or organizations that hold a big amount of a particular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin Because they own the big portions of the supply, their actions can impact the market to fluctuate the price of Bitcoin. Big-Whales often use their power to bring the unexpected sentiments which helps them to liquidate the short investors easily.Game of Sentiments:     Bitcoin big whales have that much power of playing with investor sentiments or their emotion where most of the time short investors get caught in the trap of FOMO and FUD influenced by the big whales. Big whales are aware very well of this game as the Bitcoin market is highly emotional, and short investors tend to follow the majority sentiments of market like what is going in the market. So, doing this seems to be very wrong step of short investors without DYOR. These are some steps big whales use to make their game successful;•  Creating Hype: The main step of Big Whales is creating hype around a particular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. We all know that this is the era of social media so they target the social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc. and they also made some bold predictions about its future price to get success in the future and these kind of action helps to catch the short investors in the trap of sentiments. This kind of hype attracts the attention of small investors and they fell prey to FOMO and liquid themselves. Well, from this point market take the good position for the big whales again at low price.•  Pumping Prices: After creating hype on different social media platforms and getting the attention of short investors, big whales start buying the Bitcoin in large quantities to set the market at their desire level. The fact Bitcoin relay on demand and supply, this increased the demand of the bitcoin price up, and small investors then realize their mistake to becoming the prey of FOMO and FUD. All left behind just repent they have to repent on their decision they took in hurry or being emotional.•  FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):  I also had this experience of becoming the prey of FOMO as I remember I was reading such news on the social media and I took my decision in hurry and took entry in market without DYOR and get caught in the trap of FOMO. Well, as the price of Bitcoin start to increase, fear of missing out (FOMO) starts to show its colors to short investors. They start buying into the hype and purchasing the cryptocurrency at higher prices due to hurry and undesired emotions and become thinking that they might not miss out on huge profits according to their goals and desires. I also have create whole thread on this Topic You can read also it here.....>>>>A Guide for Cryptocurrency Newbies for Overcoming FOMO •  The Tipping Point: Once the price reaches a certain level or desired level according to the big whales, Then the Big whales start to unload their assets and exact number of accumulated holdings. This sudden sell-off in the market can trigger panic among small investors and this may cause them to sell their assets at lower prices to prevent from big losses.Protecting Yourself from Whale Games:Well big whales can be unbeatable players in the market who really fluctuate the market prices against short investors.•  Research: Hmm, A well-known term in the field of cryptocurrency is used as DYOR (Do Your Own Research) which is well recommended for all time. So, always try to conduct research before investing or taking entry also the time of leaving the market as it will helps a lot the one who do DYOR to fell prey of unwanted traps set by the big whales. Don't rely solely on hype and predictions instead of that seek some guidance from expertise and reputable profiles on social media. •  Long-Term Perspective: Just having think of short time profits always be a wrong choice doing this lead us to the FOMO. So, we need to Avoid this succumbing decision of short-term FOMO. Instead of that we should think for long-term and invest in market of bitcoin we believe in, rather than chasing a quick profit that may feel so unrealistic at most of times.•  Bearish Sentiments of market: This is the interesting part of the game where big whales bring the market level down by using their power and borrow large amounts of a bitcoin asset to sell it short, creating an aura of negativity around it which helps them to liquidate the short investors. Then this is the best time for the big whales to enter in the market with big amount where they cover this short position at a down price, and make big profits.Conclusion:In conclusion, indeed big whales can play mind games or game of sentiments with short investors by manipulating their sentiments which put short investors in FOMO and FUD kind of situations. However, these are few ideas that short investors need to keep in mind for overcoming the big whales which are as follow; staying informed, having a long-term goal, DYOR etc. you can navigate the Bitcoin market with confidence and reduce the chances of getting prey to the FOMO and FUD. Always Remember, in the crypto world, knowledge is power, and strength emotions is key towards your goals.",

      "body": "You did a good work here I liked the points and the suggestions to avoid falling prey to these whales. I am quite shocked to see, its been 2 days now, and this post got no reply. I don't know the reason but it did need some attention and correction. For example, in the \"Protecting Yourself from Whale Games:\" section, you should add, how to detect the activities of the big whales, and how to make decisions out of them. Because short investors of long investors, are highly dependent on this thing, they have to use many tools, or maybe only one which suits them best, to track the activity of whales or big transactions that would have some influence on the market. There are many telegram bots and APIs that would help you to detect whale transactions and you can take action before the total disaster. And you might save some money instead of a total losing. Overall I liked the way you are dedicating your time here, but try to be more informative, you are new here, so you definitely need some time, so my suggestion for you is to do top-level research while making topics like these. Because creation process of such topics will help you gain knowledge that might take you more time but doing this, will not.",

OP the text is looking weird you've changed the standard size to a custom one, there is no issue when you customize the size for bolding something like a title, heading, or mentioning a particular point.. Better to use the standard size.You are not at all assisting in readability by increasing the size or anything else you were aiming for, At the same time sentiments are really game changers in your journey but for those who are accumulators, temporary sentiments are not that dominant. FOMO, Fud, and fear whales had nothing to do with them, they don't attack specifically they just adopt a better strategy, Whales don't manage the market a maximum of times, and institution does. Be aware that it in this market you are competing with smarter brains so be on alert and consistent with your efficient decisions.",

What us usually makes their game appears to be a winning one sometimes is that they have studied the reaction of most amateurs and how they react to some bad news which are formulated out of tin air and they happen to always be sponsoring such fuds if the people can learn to over come such bad news and see it as one of those things which come and go, then their is a higher possibility that the crypto market can’t be push around by those so called whales who want to play some price game.",

And when this noobs see that in a exchange, they either FOMO and panic and push the sell button and this whales win the game and scoop all those cheap bitcoins from this relatively new traders.So I guess it will take some for some newbies to gain experience this way. At least they've learn a lesson, albeit it's in a more expensive way. But the thing is that it's going to be cyclical as we all know that there are always new comers in the space and sooner or later they are going to fall for this kind of trap. Even for experienced traders though, there are a lot of things that we are going to learn along the way to be able to get away from this kind of trap being set up by big whales.",

But since you are an ordinary investor, you don't have the money to control the market, so you can only wait when there is an opportunity to buy from the dip. However, those who are big investors themselves have the ability to dip and rise according to their ability by spreading various rumors in the market. And those who listen to rumors without doing any judgment themselves will fall victim to the trap of those big investors. I think big investors always have this kind of game where investors who have less money or small investors are the ones who confess. A common thing is that when the market turns bearish, many small investors become reckless, some sell everything from losing their all assets. Whale investors love to exploit that opportunity.",

Simple whales have a strong physiology due to their experience a broader mindset.Most of the time trades get caught in their trap but when it come to big screen like when they try to liquidate the weak hand by using their power of big assets. They spread most the fake news all around the social media and set some kind of fake predictions and weak hand also get caught in their trap as well. We know that Bitcoin Market mostly relay on Demand and Supply which makes its price up and down as well. So if we look at the supply, like if two to three big whales putting their big assets at once and sell out in the market in abundant then the price really go down and set new point and some of the weak mind setter fell prey to their trap and liquidate themselves to cover their big looses and market take bit more dump. Then this point is very Positive to take entry For big whales again in the market. In this way they really make alot of money.
