Its hard for a newbie to depend to anyone, I’d suggest to learn every process. Altcoins can be profitable if you know how to handle risk especially with the small tokens. Just look for the good project, and alway setup your selling and the cut loss price, this can be a big help to you.",

But if you invested with a trusted and good project then it will gave you a lot of profit for a short time. So the decision is all yours take a breath and then decide are you going to invest in altcoins or in btc and ETH.",

They really are the kings of this market and it could be more profitable for you to have other alts but, it's hard to get on them and predict.",

Who would have thought that a solid coin like Luna will crash? reaches all time high then, break in the top 10, then suddenly the price literally went to 0?So you can do all the investigations on your end and find what suits you, but still at the end of the day, it is not a perfect world, we don't know what the future holds. Perhaps Avalanche, Mina protocol, Phala network and Aleph Zero will go on a bull run and succeed or it will fail miserably.",

Altcoins investment is much profitable then Bitcoin & Ethereum. But Investing in Altcoin is a high risk. It is able to give you a lot of profit in such a short time.

Just that it's a matter of timing so it's very reliant on luck, unlike hodling Bitcoin in the long term which hasn't really failed most investors so far. Well, as they say, high-risk high reward after all. I wouldn't really consider it a mistake but I would recommend studying up more on markets and the projects you're planning to invest in before doing anything. Learn also how to set up stop losses and the like that you need just in case the market goes negative.",

You can  invest in these altcoins but you should be ready to think about the risk it can bring you instead of the profit.

At the moment you can buy BTC for around 20k USD per coin, a few months ago it was at 60k and you can buy ETH for around 1200 $ now which was at more than 4k a while ago. This is also true for the first few projects that you have named i think all of those are pretty good buys at the moment. Of course a week or two ago they were even lower about 20 or 30% but if you are planning to hold the coins long term and you are convinced that the crypto market continues to grow, then i think you can not make anything wrong at the moment.",
