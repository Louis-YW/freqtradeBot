  "content": "While I’m enjoy playing the game, I stumble on a critical bug as shown on the screen shot below. You can safely pass all the pipes by making your little birdy fly high above the pipes by continuously tapping. This feature feature is not available on the original game and we can use this bug as time out when we are already pressured on collecting the coin.Reporting this bug to @theymos and @powerglove just in case this feature is not originally intended for the game.PS: the birdy will drop few seconds delay when you stop tapping.",

You only pass it if you collect enough coins. After you fly to the sky, gravity force causes powerful and super quick fall which you can not control your falling fly",

One thing I notice too on playing using hand held device was a consistent tap on the screen makes the screen size zoom in and out despite I’m not clicking the - & + buttons directly. I still didn’t try in desktop version but this dynamic screen size while tapping makes this glitch very hard to perform since birdy falls fast after a long exposure on gravity above the pipes.I’m very happy complete this game but this game is not happy for me completing it. It’s very hard to collect coins on this game rather than the original game that only requires passing through pipes to score. Theymos flappy bird is too small for the Bitcoin hole.",
