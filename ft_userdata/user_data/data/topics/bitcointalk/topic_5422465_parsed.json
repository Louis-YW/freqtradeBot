As long as it wasn't confirmed by vitalik himself, it is a bit hard to validate.I guess that's just a babbler. If the statements of these people won't be specific enough, then they might just be creating a 'wave' and confusion to investors. \"something important to happen\" is a vague statement. It could also be that he wants to make a community under his name like with Elon and other huge names in this industry. At the end of the day, a statement is just a statement. Well it could create an indirect effect to this industry given that they have the 'image' but as long as statement is indirect, it would be sketchy to make a move about it.",

Or Vitalik babbler?I don't follow Vitalik on twitter but i don't think that he is usually the type of guy that is posting silly memes and meaningless messages on twitter. If you are looking at the comments of this post though then i think it becomes obvious that he is just making fun of some big crypto influencers that have probably said that they have informations that ETH is going down soon and with his post Vitalik wants to make fun of them. It even seems that those people have replied to him in the comments.I don't really know what happened or where the rumors are coming from but in deep bear market times like this every rumor can cause another dump. So i hope it turns out to be false.",

These guys should at least be careful with what they say on social media. I'm not trying to dictate but it's not really the best times to be playful. I'm sure he knows people are quick to speculate.It's not completely a babble, the point of the concern is that Vitalik is concerned about how the cryptocurrency topic progression within Twitter whereas rumours are used to manipulate people. Especially in this kind of time and with the recent FTX solvency, FUD is easily spread among people, where the matter itself isn't verified or simply trusting others' opinions.There are a few things we could take off from the convos, which are that to remind overexposure to a highly volatile market is worrisome and a space that is filled with rumours is concerning.

Perhaps CZ just wanted to protect it from hackers or something.So far we haven't heard anything important from CZ, but we all know that sometimes he trolls those who fire back at him. So maybe this is just one troll that he has used against his detractors. And I doubt that it has something to do with the FTX as well.",

And obviously, the crypto world will react negative causing panic and so this anti crypto are going to have a field day again. But Vitalik counter the troll with his own trolling so tit for ta.And so far, there is no negative huge of this magnitude thankfully. Crypto market is still alive although the price is still down because of the FTX effect. But at least we have settled down already, no more downhill for us. Remain relatively calm in the last couple of days now after the FTX news.",
