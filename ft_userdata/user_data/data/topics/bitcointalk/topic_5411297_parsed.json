  "content": "\"The market crash has not deterred Bitcoin Depot from going public, CEO said\".QuoteCrypto ATM Operator Bitcoin Depot to Go Public Via $885 Million SPAC Deal Popular cryptocurrency ATM operator Bitcoin Depot is reportedly planning to become a publicly-traded company through a partnership with SPAC GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp.A special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is a public company established to merge or acquire an existing entity. Although SPACs raise capital from investors through IPOs, they don’t have active business operations, and investors can pull their money before a merger or acquisition is completed.SPAC offers a cheaper and quicker alternative to traditional IPOs, thus allowing private companies to go public.QuoteBitcoin Depot Signs $885M SPAC DealThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the agreement between Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora SPAC is worth $885 million. If the deal is approved and closed, Bitcoin Depot will replace the shell company in the stock market.The report further noted that GSR II Meteor raised about $320 million, which the ATM operator could use to expand its operations. However, if investors choose to cash out their investments, the company will be left with lesser funds.QuoteCrypto Firms Going Public Through SPACsBitcoin Depot will not be the first crypto entity to go public through SPAC if the deal works out. Firms such as crypto exchange Bakkt and bitcoin mining company Cipher Mining have been listed on stock exchanges through SPAC deals.While more crypto firms such as Roxe are also planning to go public through the same route, some crypto SPAC deals are currently in jeopardy as the companies involved have extended termination deadlines for the deals. sourceThis news may not directly be in connection to btc but still some how related since btc atm are there to serve the btc community to easy transaction of their asset.",

      "body": "The charm of Bitcoin ATM's was that you could fully anonymously get in and out some cash, and that is now lost since more and more jurisdictions are regulating them into oblivion. You basically need your ID in most of them. And some even tell you after you get the bills in. Some fellas got their $100's stuck on these machines. AFTER they put the money in, they get told you an ID, so now you are there forced to either show an ID and dox yourself as a BTC user or just leave the money in there.Im not long on Bitcoin ATM stocks. It's basically traditional banking ATMs at this point.",

While these sort of deals create big headlines and can generate some buzz around Bitcoin which is good for people who hold it, in reality I never understand the sort of people who fund these things. We've seen coinbase shares plummet in value since they listed, which actually surprised me, but it appears that there is still a pool of silly money floating around that are willing to invest large sums in these big gambles. In the long term it is a relatively unproven operation even if it can prove a couple years with large profits, they are potentially historical now and it might struggle to repeat them with the latest price drops. While I don't care much for the institutional investors, any small scale buyers should be very wary of thinking they'll profit from buying into this company early - often it's just a case of the original owners wanting to cash out and get out.",
