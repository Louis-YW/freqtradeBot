In the bull market, the majority of bitcoin investors are buying, demand outweighs supply, market confidence is at a high, and prices are rising.

On the good side, however, that popularity leads more people to know more about what bitcoin really is aside from being considered mostly as an investment. There are lots of blockchain summits, discussions, meetups, and related events that are organized to give the community general knowledge about anything related to crypto, specifically bitcoin.We also have to consider that using bitcoin as a currency is still limited to most places in the world, unlike the usual currencies. But as time goes by, we can expect that more countries will become bitcoin-friendly at such a point that most physical stores are now directly accepting bitcoin as legal tender.",

Bitcoin has many more purpose than what it was created for, asides the peer-to-peer intentions for bitcoin, it has also found a purpose as investment worthy. Because we can invest in it, the price is more important than the first purpose it was created for, my reason is that it is the investment opportunity that made me buy some bitcoins in the first place, not for transactions.",

An electronic peer to peer cash system is fine, but unless a price tag is attached, what you will transact and how you will determine value? Without a price tag, it's simply impossible to transfer value using bitcoin. So price is very important factor which can satisfy its purpose of become and store of value. Nothing else will!",

I want to know your thoughts - Do you consider the price of Bitcoin to be more important than its purpose?  with the price of bitcoin, people will be better informed of its purpose. It has been pretty evident in the few years that bitcoin had broken the mainstream internet. When people's trust rating of bitcoin is low, its price decreases and therefore along with it, its purpose is lost once again in obscurity, but when it does rise up in price, more and more people are becoming eager to know about bitcoin and its utilization. Although in the case of what's important, of course i would side with its purpose since that is what drove bitcoin to be created in the first place. But no one can deny how these two schools of thoughts complement and cooperate with each other.",

However, I don't think it totally take away the importance of it original purpose.Both the price and its purpose is very important. The price attracts more investors which leads to more publicity and adoption. It is also important to state that the drop or rise in price of Bitcoin is an avenue for investors to make profit, hence the price of Bitcoin is very important. But we must not loose sight of the main purpose of Bitcoin, which is to eradiocate middlemen in financial transactions. This is the main purpose of Bitcoin and it is through this means that Bitcoin would affect the common man on the street. Low and fast transaction charges because of the the bypassing of financial institution is the main benefit of people that cannot afford to invest or hodl Bitcoin.",

It depends on who you ask, if you ask this question to speculators they will probably say to you that is the only thing that matters to them as they do not really care about the reasons bitcoin was created and I doubt they have ever read the whitepaper. The rest will say its purpose and the almost flawless execution of Satoshi was more important, but it is undeniable that the price and the volatility of bitcoin still play a huge role on why bitcoin has been adopted so quickly all over the world.",

People were celebrating when it reached 1USD for the first time, then 10, then 100 then 1000...One day it's going to reach 100k and you can't expect people to choose it to transact with over USD that loses more than 5% of its value each year. The price is important because if it kept falling by 10% each year, you wouldn't find people willing to buy it. They'd simply choose fiat that loses value slower and is easier and cheaper to use. Being your own bank is nice but not if it costs you a lot of money. Bitcoin is so popular because it's not only a payment system but also an investment.",

The idea of ​​satoshi is certainly very good about payment systems, but due to regulation and opportunities for profit, this mindset is formed among its users.The price of bitcoin is important because then bitcoin becomes a valuable means of payment. Without a price, bitcoin would not be used as a means of payment [despite not having it at the time of issue] and both are equally useful for bitcoin. In my opinion, the price of bitcoin is more important than adoption as a means of payment, but of course because it doesn't interfere with other innovation.",

In the end it is the price the investor is ultimately interested in, nothing else.If you use bitcoin as a medium of exchange as a consumer or a business owner, then you have the option to convert your crypto to FIAT instantly. Big credit card companies have these products if I remember it right. Bitpay does that for the merchants too. You don't even get any crypto, you just see the $$$ in your bank account and bitpay or the similar 3rd parties do the work for you.
