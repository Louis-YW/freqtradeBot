I even think that with the next halving the price of Litecoin can cross $140 during the halving event, but that's purely my prediction and I won't claim 100% accuracy.The Litecoin halving doesn't impact the market like Bitcoin halving does, but it can surely impact its own price for a short term and that can be a very attractive opportunity for the investors because it's a proven fact that with halving a price spike is a confirm thing and sometimes that's beyond our predictions.Even if the price surge won't be too high but still if someone invests in LTC right now will most probably make some good profits with the coins next halving event. The current price $90.94 which isn't high for such a useful coin from any perspective, and the ones who know this will probably find the opportunity to invest in it.",

To answer your question, I doubt it’ll go as parabolic as you think. If you take a look at most alts, you’ll find only very very few had a true, actual, significant parabolic run. Most are going up in tandem although it doesn’t seem like it. Because at first sight $1 to $10 seems less significant than $100 to $1000 although percentage wise it’s the same… the thing is most alts typically go up during bull runs but rarely (most coins never) get to an ATH against their BTC parity.There are a ton of coins that get a halving every year. Sometimes hype builds up. Sure, Litecoin will have to have a bull run or otherwise mining isn’t worth it anymore. But don’t expect something too wild..",

      "body": "we already had litecoin halving discussion few days ago - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5451279.msg62197635#msg62197635My answer:Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on May 05, 2023, 07:32:16 AMJust like with BTC, each consecutive halving has lower fundamential impact on price:Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on October 27, 2022, 08:53:31 AM1st halving was important. It reduced monetary inflation from 25% to 12%. Thats a big deal. Second halving decreased monetary inflation from 9% to 4,5%. Now we are getting closer and closer to the 4th halving that will reduce bitcoin monetary inflation from like 1.5% to 0.7%. Both numbers are negligible compared to 8% official CPI in US, 10% in EU or 80% in countries like Turkey. So my bet is that halvings fundamental impact on bitcoin price is getting lower and lower with every next halving in oppose to macro data, FED decisions, interest rates, recessions etc. Bitcoin will be more like an asset that act sometimes like gold on steroids sometimes like sp500 on steroids rather than it will fallow \"bubble x days before each halving scheme\"I don't expect any effect on the price. Other factors will play a much more important role, such as the environment (f.e. bear/bull market on bitcoin). Especially since the previous halving did not give much, so unlike bitcoin halvings, there is not even a psychological impact on the price here.\"there is not even a psychological impact on the price here.\" What I meant was that the previous litecoin halving didn't cause much of a pump. Besides, I don't think the project itself is worth much in 2023. There are better alternatives.",

I really missed out on good buying opportunities. If only I had the extra funds back then, I would have never let such great opportunity to gain good profits slip away. Heck, I would've even set up positions on futures if I had the funds. I am still planning to buy in the coming days when I am able though since there's still a good potential to gain profits, but not as much as I had intended to a few weeks back.
