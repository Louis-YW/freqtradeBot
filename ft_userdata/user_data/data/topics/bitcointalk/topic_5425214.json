  "content": "Hey Guys!Essentially, I bought some btc and transferred from Blue wallet to Electrum using lightning. I was then able to open a lightning channel on electrum and transfer the btc to there. However, I could not send or receive any btc. So I right click on the open channel ID and press \"Cooperative close\". Ever since, electrum has been stuck on \"please wait\" as shown here --> https://imgur.com/a/yYti1nF. The green circle near where it says amount of btc was yellow before all this happened. Meaning my btc was correctly in the lightning channel.After waiting 2 hours, I open my electrum wallet on another computer and it says 0 BTC. Are my funds lost or can I still access my btc? Here's the transaction ID: https://imgur.com/a/1L3RTlRAny help would be very appreciated.Thank you for your time!",

      "body": "I couldnt click anything on the electrum page, couldn't even manually close. I ended up force quitting instead of waiting and as soon as I opened electrum again, I received my btc back. All good here! I believe I forgot to untick the \"use trampoline routing\" under preferences so I didnt even sync electrum with the lightning network which I think is why I couldnt send or receive btc after opening the lightning channel.",

That will only be an issue if your channel isn't trampoline; you'll see a blue highlight under \"can send\" row, means that it's frozen.But as seen in the screenshot, it's connected to a trampoline node (indicated by the kangaroo icon) so there shouldn't be any issue when sending funds.The only inconsistency I found is the part that I've mentioned (you probably remembered it wrong)",

      "body": "Sorry my bad. I transferred from Blue wallet using lightning straight to my btc electrum wallet. I still received the funds, but instead of getting the usual unconfirmed message, I got an exclamation mark (yellow color) with the message \"Unconfirmed parent\". This gave me the idea to open the lightning channel on electrum, thinking that would solve the problem. From now on, I'll just send sats from Blue wallet to Muun wallet then directly into cold storage.",
