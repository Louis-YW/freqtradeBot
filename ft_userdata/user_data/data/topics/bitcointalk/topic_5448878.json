  "content": "How do I get the best out of Bitcoin investment?I started with this question because of the way we newbies ask this casually without knowing that we express fear or show timidity by asking this.I heard a message in form of an audio I was listening to sometime back, about how we as humans believe in what we know little to nothing about compared to the term used to describe the fact that we cannot believe in what we know so much about. Both the Christian and muslims or some other religions practice a belief which points to a supreme creator or being which overseas all human affairs. While this is true for some who believe and have claimed to have been witness of this faith, others who have come to other conclusion summarize the way they feel this supreme being operate and think they know so much about the creator that it takes away the power to believe that anything supernaturally out of the ordinary can happen, which isn't already figured out by advancement in science and technology.I don't want to sound religious but my point is that, I believed in the potential of Bitcoin and its forum/community to the point where be it my earnings come from my dedication and focus to it. As a newbie my advise for you is to believe in whatever efforts you put in here and truly the outcome would amaze you overtime. Wherein there is no believe in the system and operations of its forum, the task to post comments, create new topics or participate in its competition will only come off as too much work or stress and might lead one to become discouraged and quit in the end.Believe in what you give your time, focus and energy to and be baffled how the results play out.",

All these stuffs about believing yourself and sorts like that only create unnecessary pressure for those that are eager to get up the rank ladder through getting merit. The sole purpose of these forum is to help us learn more about bitcoin although we got the opportunity to earn from the paid signatures here which I wouldn’t lie is one of the most driving tools here. First your priority should be having the knowledge that brought you here(if at all it is) and not going round hunting for merits with needles creation of threads. Stop treating the forum a hit or die trying place.",

I don't see posting in this forum as a task; I see this place as a learning environment in which anything, I mean any kind of knowledge, can be acquired. It's just a matter of dedicating your time to that field, asking questions, and being gradually guided by your experiences in those fields. The signature and bounty earnings in this forum are just something I see as an added advantage. And when you are now wearing a signature, that's when making a few posts becomes a task; if not aside from that, there is no task given to anyone to be making posts here in the forum. You can contribute, share opinions, etc., or you can just sit and learn from the background. It's not compulsory to make a post; it's only mandatory when you want to get paid.",

Most people can get great results on forum through signature campaigns, bounties, designs or some other thing, but rest assured this should not be the main goal of anyone using forum.

If we still earn money from the signature campaign now, it is because the signature is still worth it as a project promotion. Someday in the future, the signature campaign may be no longer worth it as a part of project promotions. So, this forum may have no campaigns anymore. In that situation, you must be stressed if you too much believe in any campaign in this forum.

Hard work indeed pays off and you’re already a proof to that already.

Misinformation is primarily responsible for newbies becoming bored with the forum and eventually leaving without fully grasping the concept. Some may have been told that there is a money earning platform where you can quickly receive a source of income, but what they fail to comprehend is that you will never reap what you did not labor for if you do not put in any hard effort. Forget about the benefits for a moment and focus on developing yourself and gaining adequate expertise to allow you to continue in the community and contribute more here.",

      "body": "Believe, having to do with faith, right ? Well, it's just normal and a needful thing to be dedicated to what one thinks is worth the effort they put into it so they can get the result they desire. OP, people can believe in something were as they are not putting any effort to it, especially if it's something that they think will be beneficial to them, so In my knowledge, I think you mean it is \"always good to be dedicated to what one thinks can pay off\". for example, I have a friend who have been believing in Bitcoin since 2019 till now but he has not purchased Bitcoin for the first time since then, he is always saying he doesn't have spear money to buy.    So my point is you can just believe, without putting any effort to it, but you cant be putting effort and being dedicated without believing. definitely if you become dedicated and see a good result, you will believe ! Instead of just plainly saying the \"Believe\" 🤣😂",

I must confess that I find your post interesting but it is very difficult for me to understand the write-up. Most people are in this forum not really because of the gain from the group but because they have confidence that Bitcoin will always be a good currency and investment. As you said, they are believers in this currency. But it might not be proper to relate or compare the confidence you have in Bitcoin and the forum to the faith some people have in their creator. some religions believe that their God is all-powerful and infallible and I don't that Bitcoin or bitcointalk can have such kind of influence.",

You do believe in Bitcoin because you have known something about Bitcoin that can help you in your dreams of becoming financially independent both in the economic context and the Bitcoin context.  But I bet you won't even give attention if Bitcoin does not offer you anything.Anyway, before believing anything, we should verify if the fact is proven to be true, so there is a need for research and learning so the effort won't be wasted.  Most newbies are exploited for being naive and oftentimes misguided into doing things in the wrong way.  So it is still best to verify every piece of information that we came across before believing it.  This way, we can be able to improve ourselves in the right way.",

If someone feels discouraged to participate in discussions without some sort of incentives or reward and decides to quit, I say good riddance.",

That is why there is also a significant difference between \"to know\" and \"to believe.\"In the context of Bitcoin, there seems to be a growing behavior that somehow subjectively treats the technology beyond what it really is. We cannot deny that there are individuals who seem to exalt Bitcoin as if it is some sort of religion, a mana sent from heaven, a panacea, a silver bullet that addresses poverty, inequality, wars, corruption, and all socio-economic ills. Do not just believe in Bitcoin. Verify whether it is worth believing or not. Be practical. Be realistic.
