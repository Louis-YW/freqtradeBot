It's currently hashing at 36T dawing 1.9Kw.Temperature readings are as follows:- max chip: 85C- PCB: 60C- Fluid: 45C- Ambient: 32C (89F)My ambient in other rooms is no more than 24C (75F). Could the reason be the unshrouded fan? Because I can feel warm air coming out of the sides of the fan. I opened the window next to with to try to get the hot air out, but it always has been in the 30-32C range.Setup picture here : https://imgur.com/a/LFZIk8EMiner dahsboard: https://imgur.com/a/Vb8eFLoI asked around and it seems people are complaining about T17s temp sensors being excessively high either air or immersed. Am I correct to assume an S19 would do better with this setup?",
