  "content": "We will be launching the Fun13 seeding event this week, To prove our fairness we have generated a chain of 10,000,000 SHA256 hashes where each hash is the hash of the hexadecimal representation of the previous hash. The last hash in the chain is: d45484be76d31ab9f11b68f8b6280812e4f12f8287567b3b844a30da7103f949Every game maps to a hash in the chain: The 10,000,000th element of the chain is the hash of game #1 and the first element in the chain is the hash of game #10,000,000. To verify that a hash belongs to a game #n, simply hash it n times and compare the result with the terminating hash.To calculate a game's result from its hash:Code:const gameHash = hashChain.pop()const hmac = createHmac('sha256', gameHash);// blockHash is the hash of bitcoin block 761700 hmac.update(blockHash);const hex = hmac.digest('hex').substr(0, 8);const int = parseInt(hex, 16);// 0.01 will result in 1% house edge with a lowest crashpoint of 1const crashpoint = Math.max(1, (2  32 / (int + 1)) * (1 - 0.01))blockHash used is Bitcoin block 761700 which has not been mined at time of posting. Basically we are using the hash of a future bitcoin block as a client seed so players can be certain that we did not pick one in the house's favor.",

But it will be better if you can add US English too as most of the user is on a US language base.",

As i see this post looks more of advertisement with no graphics presentation. I checked your profile and found out that  you are yet to register for the copper membership so you could upload pictures. Try do that so you could communicate properly your organisational functions and activities to members onboard who come across this post because that is the focal point for communicating and marketing your organisation here as most members picks interest in it. I was able to go through your websiteand i must say you really have a great and catchy graphics which i must say it is a welcome development and i applaud you for that. If i may ask is your casino kyc free or kyc inclusive because  i could not see such, are you licensed casino hub? Lastly at what stage of development is your casino currently?",

So whether KYC check will be, or it will be possible not to pass the personal verification procedures. If the initial Devs of this project is the inhabitants of China, as I understood, or they are just the Chinese living outside their native country, then, of course, it is clear that the Chinese was originally. But there are big difficulties with online gambling for those who live in China. Or maybe there are already some relaxation from the power of this country.",

Not only the banners but also the description on games and others. It sounds weird reading them. Maybe this wasn't a big deal for others because they can still understand what the word implies. Another thing that I did not notice at first is the withdrawal and bonus distribution.The numbers are crazy. Last day you saw it was only 38 million dollars for withdrawals? But, now it was over 39 million. I think that was so fast for a casino that is likely new because we haven't heard of them before. They think having a high stat is the only way to attract players but they did not know that there are also people who like to support small casinos.",
