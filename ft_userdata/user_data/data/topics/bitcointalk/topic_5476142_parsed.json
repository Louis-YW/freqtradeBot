  "content": "Although I am a new user I haven't spent much time here on this forum. But I already had some knowledge about Bitcoin since mid 2022. At that time I was in college and knew about Bitcoin since that time I saved my college stipend money and invested it in Bitcoin and gradually saved fractions of good Bitcoins there. When I collected and invested my stipend, Bitcoin was at a much lower value, and I made a lot of profit at this point. I might have made more profit if I had held it longer, but I bought the thing by selling bitcoins for one of my essential tasks. I had an opportunity to study in university after completing my college life and there I really needed a laptop but didn't have enough money to buy it, family financial problems were also a lot. Having no choice, I sold my invested bitcoins to buy a laptop for my work needs, and I decided to study there as well as freelancing. However, the current bullishness of Bitcoin that I see in the market seems to indicate that Bitcoin will rise even more very soon.  If I had held on to my bitcoins I might have made more profit when the bull market started. But I have no way to do this because I don't have money, but I will try to raise money and invest again in bitcoins to hold on. However, I have benefited from selling my bitcoins currently and using them for my needs, but I feel like I missed out on a huge profit.",

In the age of information technology, when many people still do not have the opportunity to access the Internet, for those of us who know bitcoin and have investment opportunities and even jobs, it is always a great luck.",

It would be best to have a laptop for your work and freelancing, so there is no reason for you to regret selling it. Bitcoin cannot function as a laptop, and while you may not have sold at peak value, you are fortunate to have enough Bitcoin earnings or holdings to purchase a laptop. Some individuals sell their Bitcoin during low market conditions due to unforeseen circumstances and do not profit from it.I understand how you feel. Next time, try to sell your holdings at a price you won't regret later. Set a price with the mindset that you won't regret it, even if it continues to increase.",

If Bitcoin were the key to success, everyone should be successful using or at least involving Bitcoin in their businesses or their job... but in reality, that's not the case. Moreover, there are many ways to achieve success without Bitcoin. (I don't mean to underestimate Bitcoin, but it fact).You seem very confident about Bitcoin, but it appears to be based on your feelings as you haven't provided mathematical reasons for it. According to the data I've gathered, in mid-2022, its price was around $20k. While it's true that you can profit from investing in Bitcoin and selling it recently, it's not the only path to success.

Why did you initially make the investment? Was there no financial benefit to you? If not, you should be pleased that your investment was profitable and that you were able to make a meaningful use of it. Don't regret it because it was done for a worthy cause. You should be appreciative because there are people who invested in bitcoin but were unable to profit from it. Since education is a vital aspect of life, you made the proper choice in selling those coins to get a laptop for yourself. Bitcoin is an investment that you may participate in at any moment, so it's never too late to start investing again.

As the next bitcoin halving approaches, everyone is expecting a tremendous price increase, much like the last one. Since then, we've been in a bear market, and you may have been lucky to have sold your bitcoins since the market is full of ups and downs, and there was a point when we had a tremendous fall, so who knows if you would have sold at a loss during that period, due to the downturn, many people ended up selling at a loss.Holding bitcoin when you have financial problems seems pointless to me, why suffer when you have money to spend? I'm not suggesting it's a good thing, but when you're desperate and have no other option, you can sell a portion of it but not all of it.",

While you may have missed out on potential gains due to the recent bullish market, remember that financial decisions are often about balancing immediate needs with long-term goals.Considering the current market trends, it's wise to explore ways to gradually reinvest in Bitcoin when feasible. Keep an eye on your financial situation, and when possible, consider allocating a portion of your funds for long-term investments. The crypto space is dynamic, and opportunities may arise again.

It is essential for you and regret about this educational investment is unreasonable.Be realistic like Bitcoin from now will not give you like x100, x1000 profit as it did years ago. [1] It's because Bitcoin marketcap is big already and assume it can help you to x2 or x4 your capital in 2024 or 2025, I am sure it is not what to feel regret too much.Because with education and jobs, you can earn x2 or x4 of that money easily.[1] https://casebitcoin.com/charts#roi_chart",

In fact, over the last 3 months Bitcoin has continued to close the month with positive increases. And when you see this of course you will feel a strange feeling within you. But at least you have done the right thing. You sell the bitcoins you have collected to buy a laptop that you really need for your college assignments. So all you need to do is don't give up on making more money and start reinvesting in bitcoin with DCA. And remember don't FOMO. Because markets don't always go up, there will always be a correction. But because it is currently approaching the Bitcoin Halving, expecting a big decline is a bit unlikely.But you also have to stay focused on your studies. Don't let your concentration be disturbed. It's better to reduce your time looking at the market. Unless you are studying the market in preparation for accumulating bitcoin again. But if you don't have any plans to invest again. So it's better for you to concentrate more on your studies. At least you have enjoyed selling your bitcoins to buy a laptop that you really need.",

You also said that you have got profits, it means you succeed with your Bitcoin investment. So, you actually don't need to regret it, you have done the right way for your life.By the way, if you keep your Bitcoin, you may get more profits but you can't study properly at university without a laptop. What for your Bitcoin asset if it can't help you? Everyone has a priority in his life, your priority was buying a laptop at that time. You've done the right way by selling your Bitcoin asset and bought a laptop. You can start collecting again Bitcoin when you have money in the future.Quote from: Septex on December 01, 2023, 06:26:10 AM~I will try to raise money and invest again in bitcoins to hold on.

We are heading the bullish season, Bitcoiners sell their Bitcoins during the bullish season. They will wait for the Bitcoin price passed their last ATH, then they prepare to sell the Bitcoins. I don't know whether you have an urgent need again, but surely you will regret it because you sold your Bitcoin too early.",
