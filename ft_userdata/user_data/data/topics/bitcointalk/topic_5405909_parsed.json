Take a look through this page:https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360038583951I’m presuming you performed the KYC which is mandatory for all accounts. If not, that would be the root cause of the message.In any case, you should probably open a direct ticket with their support if the above does not help to clarify the cause and procedure.

If not, that would be the root cause of the message.On Binance, for accounts existing since before the mandatory KYC implementation, Know Your Customer is mandatory for everything except withdrawing, closing positions and I think a few more things.  Theoretically, you should be able to withdraw your own funds even without completing KYC procedures.  This makes Upgrade00's take on the issue more plausible.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Please can someone help a newbie understand and resolve this issue because I am so freaking out . Thank you.Maybe you should just take a chill pill, and try again in like an hour or two...It may be a network issue sometimes and these exchanges do not want to look like the have regular challenges hence they hide behind ambiguous statements that confuse users. There may be nothing wrong with your account. Within the same timeframe you experienced that, I'm certain other users somewhere also making use of their service at that time had the same notification as well.If the issue persist say for like a day, you could contact their support team.",

I am asking because I found some examples of people that were blocked due that.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 11, 2022, 08:01:04 PMIt may be a network issue sometimes and these exchanges do not want to look like the have regular challenges hence they hide behind ambiguous statements that confuse users.

Nah, I don't think that's some bullshit message Binance wrote because they want to hide technical problems because in that case loads of people would be affected which wouldn't go unnoticed. They will probably ask for some additional verifications or something equally annoying in order to unlock withdraw.",

But I remember, a friend of mine had this issue but it was later resolved. The payment wasn't suspended because you wanted to withdraw, it was suspended before the withdraw process. The possible causes are;1. You funded your binance account with your local bank, and it seems that your bank sent a flag signal in your account. 2. You added a debit card few minutes and placed withdraw immediately (this can happen due to withdrawal)3. It could also be other minor issues, due to the system is automated, the message is displayed for you.Kindly, follow the customer care or wait for some hours incase number 2 was your case.",

Please can someone help a newbie understand and resolve this issue because I am so freaking out . Thank you.Maybe Binance is trying to make sure that the coin is not stolen, they may see suspicious activities that they might think is not you.Binance is not a noncustodial wallet, it is a custodial exchange, they have a support you can contact, that will be the best thing to do right now. You can try and wait for like 24 hours and see if you will be able to withdraw.If you want this type of error not to occur next time, use a noncustodial wallet, you will have the private keys to your wallet and you will have the full control over your wallet unlike Binance that has the control. But protect your wallet.",

Thank you.Did you maybe deposit the money on Binance very recentlyI also thought of this as well that maybe a transaction occur of recent without being confirmed and yet he want to withdraw or perform another transaction on top of that, i think this is one of the reasons to prevent double spending if your case aoplies to that, also one thing i know about Binance is that once your account is not yet verified, you will be restricted to perform some certain functions, now the question here weneed to know is weather if this is your first transaction or not on Binance.",

I think it would be a lot better if they are more specific. To avoid causing unnecessary worries to their customers, they shouldn't just inform them that their withdrawals are suspended due to risk management, which is quite hard to digest. Could it not be changed to \"Transaction failed. Please update your app and try again.\" Or something like this. Or perhaps there's a link provided that leads customers to a different page where possible reasons are detailed on why such an error occurred. Anyhow, thanks for the update!",

Ugh.  When is the speed of money transfer settlement going to go to zero?  This reminds me of the old days when businesses wouldn't ship something until your check cleared, which was usually 7 days.  It always amazes me that in 2022 it takes days for even things like stock trades to settle, or eBay payments to make it from the buyer to the seller's bank account.  Anyway, I'm hoping tech catches up to the financial system's needs or vice versa.",
