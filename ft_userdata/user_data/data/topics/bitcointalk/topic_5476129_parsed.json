I also think that it's going to take time if each sats will have value in the future.To make it short, and for other calculation. It's going to be with a dollar per satoshi.1 BTC = 100M sats = $100M to make it at least $1 per sat. And if it's going to be in cents as per philip's calculation, that's still going to require a lot of price and market cap for Bitcoin to achieve it.",

Each satoshi will become more valuable with time with a condition that Bitcoin will be stronger with time and being stronger means bigger adoption and higher value.The bullish case for Bitcoin. I believe you have been in Bitcoin market and the Bitcointalk forum long enough to know about this article but I share it as I see it is helpful for newbies.Make your plan with future halvings: 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2044, 2048, 2052, 2056 and 2060.https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/halving/#calculatorSee Controlled supply and see how many % of Bitcoin total supply will be left after each of those halvings.",

Does anyone else also see individual satoshi becoming valuable in future? If you are sensitive to the value of Satoshi itself, you will discover that it is increasing and this is normal. Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, so it's Bitcoin itself but in a minute small amount, therefore as the value of Bitcoin appreciates, it's technically right for the value of Satoshi to rise. The same thing goes for when it decreases.And now, Bitcoin appreciates and has good future prospects, so yes, Satoshi's value will rise in the future.Earlier than this, if you noticed the value of Satoshi, let's say late last year till early this year, each Satoshi was worth about $0.03, but now, it's $0.04+. This is because the value of Bitcoin has increased, and it will continue to grow if Bitcoin grows.",

Well, this whole frenzy about ordinals has shown that some people think that individual satoshis can be worth a lot of money, regardless of the current price of BTC, halvings or anything else. It's not something interesting to me personally, but I can understand that some people want to monetize everything possible that has to do with Bitcoin.Besides, I don't see the reason why people are so obsessed with how much one satoshi will be worth in the future - why look at things at such a low level? Perhaps it would be easiest to conclude that every satoshi you have today will be worth a lot more in the future, and everything else is just speculation and throwing around random numbers.",
