It's really sad that most of those members aren't active any more or their accounts exchanged hands. Perhaps a greater number of them moved on to better things that caught their fancies once Bitcoin became popular.

See Alwaysmining's profile. I didn't know that.I remember theymos wrote somewhere that for some solid reasons, he can take down a VIP or donator status. Let me find it for you.Still finding but not find it yet. Probably my memory is about honorable VIP member that can be taken down by theymos. For actually donated VIP members, the badge stays forever.About the banned case you listed, is it a glitch?I really believe it is a glitch because logically a banned VIP or donator account can not lose the badge. A banned account can be better than a scammer account.See.Quote from: theymos on November 28, 2012, 03:43:24 AMMy current policy is to not remove scammers from https://bitcointalk.org/donate.html , so you can compare that list to the list of scammers. Note that I also don't update names on https://bitcointalk.org/donate.html when the names change. For example, \"Goat\" is in the donate.html list, but his forum name is \"Chaang Noi (Goat) ช้างน้อย\".QuoteI'd guess that there are 2-3 VIP scammers and 3-6 Donator scammers.The fun facts about % of scammers among VIP and Donator members are higher later. DetailsGraphs made in 2019. Meanwhile, I have this.Quote from: theymos on June 06, 2018, 05:24:34 PMQuote from: TheQuin on June 06, 2018, 01:19:43 PMMaybe they didn't donate 50 BTC but were gifted the VIP status because of their contribution to Bitcoin and the forum.Right. I posted about this somewhere when I did it.IIRC MagicalTux also got VIP without paying 50 BTC because he contributed significant resources in other ways.Quote from: theymos on September 30, 2013, 09:20:24 PMMagicalTux got \"free\" VIP status for hosting the forum for a long time, too. I think that him plus Hal are the only free donator statuses I gave out. You'd have to do something pretty extraordinary to convince me to give out another free one.I don't see any point in donating 5 BTC now and then 5 BTC later. You won't get Donator status until you've donated a total of at least 10 BTC. It'd be better for you to earn interest on the 5 BTC somewhere until you're ready to pay 10 BTC. The forum isn't in need of money.Quote from: theymos on December 15, 2012, 06:07:35 AMI gave Hal a VIP tag even though he didn't donate because he is nearly as much of a Bitcoin legend as Satoshi IMO. He received the first-ever Bitcoin transaction, and he's been contributing to Bitcoin since before 0.1 was released.Some honorable VIP members, like Hal Finney, not in the donation page.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=42942https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2134Quote from: OgNasty on November 21, 2023, 10:16:48 PMAs a Donator I can tell you that we have our own exclusive section of the forum (which controversially staff members are also able to participate in) and there are a few Donators such as myself that occasionally post things in there.
