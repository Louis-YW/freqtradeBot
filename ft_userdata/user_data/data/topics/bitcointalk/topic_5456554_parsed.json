  "content": "With the ongoing saga over the sale of Manchester United it's been reported that the glaziers are gambling over the negotiations with Sheikh jasim and an announcement over the sale of the club is still yet to be known but there are speculations that it would fall in place soon. Meanwhile Manchester United pursuit of the Danish Atlanta fc striker, Rasmus højlund is not likely to be done due to the hike in his valuation of about £80m, i consider that a very big joke for a player who hasn't proved himself in a top flight competition and is not scoring up to 20 goals in a season, though he's a young and talented prospect, I believe his value should be around £40-50m and Manchester United should focus on other cheaper and better alternatives other than making another error in over paying for a player that might not meet up to standard or adapt to the league. The price strategy against man United by other clubs is getting out of hands due to their old traditions of over paying for players, it's affecting them in the recent times because other clubs are now taking advantage of it and hiking values of their players when United try to negotiate a deal with them, this is due to mismanagement and it's high time the glaziers leave the club so new owners would come implement their own policies and try taking the club back to glory days. However the Manchester United female club are experiencing a great loss in the team with a departure of Alessia Russo and Batlle, the unseriousness of the glaziers is affecting both the male and female sections of the club and it's very important for an imminent rebuild due to losing of their great players and lack of seriousness from the board. On the other hand their neighbour ManCity after winning the treble are about securing good signings in person of Chelsea's mateo kovacic and Rb Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol and it is said that both deals are in their advanced state of negotiations with both players ready to switch sides to their club, now this is a club that knows what they want and are going for it, with good board and serious backings from their owners. I belive there are Manchester United fans in this forum and as a fan what do you think about your owners the glazier, also do you think their could be another fan protest?The discussion is open to non United fans as well.",

      "body": "The saddest thing is if agreement for acquisition will take up to 10 weeks. That means if we will not see an official announcement from glazer regarding whether the team already acquired by jassim or not. That's very bad to hear that. I have expected it to happen sooner but it seems like that my expectation is not even coming true. Is not it too early for city to sign kovacic from chelsea? It's caused by gundogan has not yet determined its future. Gundogan already rejected dortmund and arab's club. Arsenal and barcelona have become the remaining clubs to get him. It takes very long time for him to determine his future. Manchester city was also offering to extend his contract but no answer from gundogan regarding this.",

So it's either you're giving your opinion if you're a fan of any of the Manchester clubs or know anything about the saga just like Jeff Brad did or you go reply on transfers news in the thread you mentioned.",
