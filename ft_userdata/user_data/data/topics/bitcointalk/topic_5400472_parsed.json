  "content": "HelloWe have an NFT project ready with everything - smart contracts to graphics to community. Our main goal was to launch it, however right now we want to transfer the entire ownership and sell the whole project due to lack of time and extra funds needed to survive in the competitive market. If anyone is interested and has a budget of over 500K, please let me know I will be glad to share all the details with youAssets: Total Units = 7777 @ 0.06 ETH each = 466 ETH ( Over 820K USD )",

That's what I wanted to write. The buyer can sell them at 0.1 ETH or whatever price he intends. It doesnt mean we will charge $820K for it. Its just what we valued the NFTNo we are not selling air  We are selling the whole project which includes the well made NFTs, lots of graphics and videos, a present community of close to 30k people, a fully complete smart contract, an active Twitter and discord and everything else that should be present in an NFT project. Close to an year's work has gone into this project trying to make it better than most other NFT projects we see everyday.",
