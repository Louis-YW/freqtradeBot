I think this sets the bar for the others to follow but I'm a little bit curious by this action of Bitwise.

But their users already have trust in them. As for Bitwise, this serves as prove of reserve.I will like to say that the real bitcoin are not the ETF shares. You do not need to know any third party if you buy the real coin and not a token or shares. Also the only time you have the complete control is when you buy the real bitcoin and have it on noncustodial wallet.",

I think this sets the bar for the others to follow but I'm a little bit curious by this action of Bitwise. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitwise-becomes-first-u-s-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-disclose-btc-holding-addressesBitwise has done well by voluntarily publishing its Bitcoin address holding and they have set a pace of transparency and openness. I also hope they will disclose more of their financial operations like how many shares have been acquired this is to ensure that they have enough funds to back it up. I also see this move as a marketing strategy to attract investors to the asset management firm. Maybe other asset managers might follow to prove that they are also accountable. QuoteDoes this mean they can't still falsify records even as they've displayed their records to the public?These centralised platforms could do anything just to prove that they are trustworthy. They could go as far as borrowing Bitcoin from other sources and transfer it to the address just to deceive investors. You will never know how dirty these companies are until they have problems. It is better to buy your coins directly and keep them in your wallet because you will never know what is happening behind the glamour more of these firms are showing.",

Does this mean they can't still falsify records even as they've displayed their records to the public?I have counted about 11 spot bitcoin ETFs that has been approved since the beginning of the month. Yes, Bitwise has done a noble thing by trying to push for more transparency in the crypto finance space and I applaud them for this. I which the other companies will follow in this path. What are the other ways that these companies with spot bitcoin ETFs approval can show transparency? If you are here reading this, I will recommend that you stick with the real bitcoin. The real transparency is in you being in charge of your bitcoin and controlling it. That is the real transparency.",

Invest in Bitcoin by directly buying bitcoin, not Bitcoin Spot ETF shares and not Wrapped Bitcoin tokens, is good.To be safe with bitcoin we have, we must store bitcoins in open source, non custodial wallets and make sure we back up our wallets well, correctly and backups surely can be used for recovery. Remember to test backup by using it for recovery before funding bitcoin in that wallet.Those Bitcoin Spot ETFs have to buy bitcoin before issuing their shares to investors but it's safest to buy bitcoin and store it by ourselves.A similar advice.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsList of Bitcoin Spot ETFs and their fees.Fee is a partial reason of migration from Grayscale.",

Anyone or businesses sueing for anonymity would have failed if they opt for the ETFs instead of buying BTC and storing it in a non custodial wallet.We would see other exchanges do same soonest and what's more of a concern to me is what becomes of Bitcoin and the ETF during and after the halving.",

It's in fact strange that it's not mandatory for exchanges to disclose their addresses. The only reason they might do it that comes to mind is fear of the mass exodus and panic if they ever get hacked or decide to exit scam. It doesn't pose any threat to them as a company when they make addresses public.

Some crypto enthusiasts feel it will be cool for these others to follow in the steps of Bitwise so it will boost competitiveness per se, but like you pointed out, most of their users have implicit trust in them thats why they aren't really in a hurry to show the addresses.I got this from cointelegraph that Arkham was able to unearth some Bitcoin ETFs on chain addresses of Black rock, Grayscale and even Franklin Templeton. . I don't know if this is permitted to be done. A company has not allowed the release of documents like this and you do it, is it legal? But then again, if you've got nothing to hide, there's no biggie right?",

This approach enables investors and regulators to independently validate asset holdings and transaction flows. I believe that if Bitwise were to attempt to falsify their records, it would be detectable.Other companies may choose not to follow suit, perhaps due to security concerns. We are well aware that hackers are always lurking and can seemingly infiltrate and exploit anything, considering only the additional risks exposed, such as cybersecurity threats.Trust in these companies is not solely based on the disclosure of Bitcoin addresses. It is built on various factors, including its track record, security measures, and regulatory compliance.",

It is pointless to just present to the public how much Bitcoin you have when the public doesn't know how much Bitcoin you should have. It's like Binance saying we have this amount but people are clueless as to how much their users actually deposited to the platform.",
