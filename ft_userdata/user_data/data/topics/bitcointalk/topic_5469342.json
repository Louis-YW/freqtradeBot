So, if you were able to buy a dollar worth of Bitcoin 14 years ago, you would already have a staggering $36,034,846.94 today. Who would have imagined that? That's just in a matter of 14 years. Nothing can beat Bitcoin's price growth. But that's the initial price as far as the New Liberty Standard (NLS) is concerned. I have read many times that the first fiat value of Bitcoin was merely $0.00099. That was also in 2009 when Sirius here traded 5,050BTC for $5.02 over PayPal. So, that's probably the first BTC-fiat exchange, although that wasn't done on a platform like NLS.",

And for sure if we can go back in time and buy $1.00 = 1,309.03 BTC then we will do it.The thing with Bitcoin is that everything is recorded in our community, so that we can see how it really evolved since the inception and we can only wish that we are one of those early adopters so that in just a span of a decade or more, we can simply be a crypto millionaire. However, it's not too late for us, we can still accumulate any amounts that could translate into profits in the next decade or so.",

Unlike those early stages, the market has become highly liquid and to move the market by one pip requires so much capital. Nevertheless,  it is certain that will see some growth in coming months considering rhe series of activities lined up that are all favourable for a bullish season.",

Creating honey pots for Hackers2. Institutional corruption and centralized failures. (MtGox)3. Market Manipulation (Fake trading volumes ... )4. Higher fees (Exchanges add additional fees for the trades)5. Introduction of an intermediary and the reliance on them. 6. Destruction of Pseudo anonymity (KYC)7. No control over your own coins (Private keys)8. Censorship of use... (They do not allow certain transactions) These are just some of the negative things that were introduced with the Exchanges coming into the Bitcoin scene. (Not your keys.. not your coins)",

If many investors just new that bitcoin would ever reached on 5 digit price for sure many of its old accumulators will hold their bitcoins or they will not play around with it and save for future. Faucets are also available which gives huge bitcoins before and if many would notice that they have a chance to became rich just for solving captcha before for sure all of those available website will be used by many and save the balance they acquire. But we cannot do anything with and that's part of history.
