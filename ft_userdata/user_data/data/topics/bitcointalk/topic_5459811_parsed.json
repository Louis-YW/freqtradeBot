  "content": "The President Joe Biden's administration has forgiven students that have outstanding students loans they haven't paid. This forgiveness runs into about $39 billion in student loan debt to more than 800,000 borrowers.This gesture which I describe as one the best gestures this administration has done.This are some of the government policies I sometimes applaud because it has a direct effect on cushioning of debt burden on the students, which some of them have been struggling to pay off.To a large extent, it shows the administration has humane Face. This will really go a long way in relieving some of the students past and present that are indebted.What do you guys think about this news from the department of Education and what effect can this have on the US economy.https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/biden-administration-forgives-39-billion-student-loan-debt-more-than-800000-borrowers?intcmp=tw_fnc",

Some government have mistaken priority and they decide on policies that won't add value to the economy. This loan that has been forgiven is still going to be channeled into the economy one way or the other because those students are going to be graduates that will contribute to the economy and those who want to start up a small business can use the money that would have been used to repay the loan to start the business. It is a good decision but may not be unconnected with the forthcoming election because politicians know that the largest voting population is the youth and so they focus to win them over during electioneering season.",

I think this move is really good in long term since this student will surely get their job once they already graduated. It’s better than some politician pocketed government budget for their own good without any economic benefits for their country.Here in PH, There’s a law here which you can have a free education up to college by enrolling on state universities. I knew that education system of US is very expensive. Just trying to emphasize that a country can focus on helping students with their college fees so that they can have work faster when they graduated.",

Besides, they've sent Ukraine more than that in aid over the past year.This is nothing more than a campaign tactic for Biden seeing as it's election time. The Supreme Court struck down his insane proposal of forgiving nearly 500B USD in student loans which would have allowed him to spend an unforeseen amount of money and circumvent Congressional oversight simultaneously. Not clear how he has the authority to forgive 39 billion -- assuming it's through executive action, all he did was essentially print 39 billion USD into the economy.

You can't just go the market and absorb finances just like that. God dammit this is not saving the students but this is putting more burden on those peeps who are yet paying their taxes and are working hard for their lives. Those who are saying this is nothing and that is nothing, man this is how it gets piled up over a period of time and the pot of debts keep feeling. It's funny how casually this is being taken. Definitely, they are not students since most of the education loans start availing the interest after the student is qualified for the job. I mean that's a huge loss for the banking system. Now they will have to print more money out of thin air and speed up inflation. That is serious. It might look tiny budget but they keep playing this card for various schemes and everything rises with time. It's an uncalled burden, to be honest.",

Although, the policy to loan student money to complete their school is not necessary in the first place and I assume it to end in this way. Nigerian government has replicate the policy as well which to begins in September. full details here.The point is, what student need is a working system that their future will be assured after graduation. The government should allow students and their parents to struggle for school fees while government employs them after graduation and not the other way round of giving them loan that they can not be able to pay off after graduation due to lack of job. By offering the loan will just inflate the number of jobless graduates in the street.Provide a working system and not loan that you will continue forgiving. It's obvious, you either forgive or you arrest countless number of debtors.",

Like many students were scammed by brokers to bring them in canada and when they caught by the authorities, it was announced that all those students will be departed but now authorities has changed there minds to accept them in their country. And coming to the economic progress part I think in the long run those students might made their mind to come up with something that would help the US economy because most of the student want to do something for the country in which they are studying amid the fact they are from foreign countries.",

I remember reading that the supreme court had ruled that the forgiven progress was not allowed to go ahead, does that mean the instead of the education secretary performing the loan forgiveness it ended up being Biden completing it instead? If someone has been paying for education for 20-25 years it does feel like it would more than paid off the original cost and excessive amounts more. It's nice to see presidents doing this rather than destructive things like signing off new artic drilling or destroying national parks.",

Businesses will also enjoy high patronage and jobs can be created. But its long-term effect will be inflation. And the inflation will affect everyone, meanwhile, this policy favored few persons. I don't see anything wrong with students paying back what they owe if they have been gainfully employed. Politicians can do anything to gain political power.

The financial recklessness of the government in financing the war in Ukraine is nothing to compare with the amount spent on this loan amnesty.

I know that some students who really have the desire to pursue formal education can go to any length to make sure they acquire the education, and having to take a loan to do so is not really bad because definitely those students would still graduate and can still be employed in some government organisation. By so doing, they are serving the country, for whom they have also received a favour in the loan repayment, so I think it also contributes to the economy. Perhaps the government knows how much they have repaid each student.
