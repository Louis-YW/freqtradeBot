  "content": "In order to have an overview of the level at which each user is, in relation to the number of merits received, I decided to present a table in which users are divided by various levels of merits received.All users who have earned more than 1500 merits were distributed in 5 divisions: +10000 merits; +5000 merits; +2500 merits; +2000 merits and +1500 merits.Data collected, based on information provided by LoyceV in Merit data analysis.The indicated merits have not counted the number of merits received when the merits system was implemented.I will try to make regular updates.Last update 16-09-2022earned Merit +10000_______________________ o_e_l_e_o (12141) LoyceV (11057) fillippone (10698)earned Merit +5000_______________________ El duderino_ (9208) theymos (9013) Ratimov (8339) DdmrDdmr (8274) suchmoon (7178) pooya87 (6391) LFC_Bitcoin (6243) JayJuanGee (6117) gmaxwell (5791)earned Merit  +2500_______________________ dkbit98 (4901) The Pharmacist (4664) nutildah (4564) satoshi (4561) mikeywith (4530) 1miau (4500) xhomerx10 (4440) BlackHatCoiner (4430) Pmalek (4287) TryNinja (4120) achow101 (4093) ETFbitcoin (3965) NeuroticFish (3957) Hhampuz (3901) Last of the V8s (3892) NotATether (3837) Rikafip (3830) n0nce (3767) HCP (3745) bitmover (3700) DaveF (3686) philipma1957 (3677) nc50lc (3660) stompix (3652) cAPSLOCK (3631) BobLawblaw (3547) DireWolfM14 (3438) zasad@ (3387) icopress (3316) witcher_sense (3283) mocacinno (3262) tranthidung (3211) OmegaStarScream (3135) Lucius (3129) Toxic2040 (3122) lovesmayfamilis (3095) CryptopreneurBrainboss (3057) Torque (3042) Rath_ (2973) TheBeardedBaby (2952) Charles-Tim (2927) mk4 (2923) Plutosky (2917) d5000 (2884) GazetaBitcoin (2764) bullrun2020bro (2699) LeGaulois (2698) AlcoHoDL (2682) jojo69 (2611) Welsh (2609) cygan (2575) nullius (2569) hosseinimr93 (2554) Hueristic (2550) DannyHamilton (2516)earned Merit  +2000_______________________ VB1001 (2493) Paashaas (2490) hugeblack (2419) Hal (2412) ranochigo (2355) qwk (2350) Coding Enthusiast (2313) mole0815 (2271) khaled0111 (2240) jeremypwr (2225) bob123 (2206) hilariousetc (2196) babo (2144) JimboToronto (2135) buwaytress (2130) yahoo62278 (2120) krogothmanhattan (2099) abhiseshakana (2082) DarkStar_ (2079) yogg (2068) Coolcryptovator (2016) gentlemand (2007) Husna QA (2005)earned Merit  +1500_______________________ duesoldi (1999) OgNasty (1972) Lakai01 (1964) Bthd (1950) franky1 (1939) Vod (1934) Lauda (1932) Steamtyme (1924) HairyMaclairy (1924) d_eddie (1924) ivomm (1916) OutOfMemory (1907) Carlton Banks (1853) Royse777 (1849) Upgrade00 (1840) morvillz7z (1838) SFR10 (1819) PrimeNumber7 (1791) minerjones (1782) xtraelv (1775) Lafu (1773) shahzadafzal (1768) marlboroza (1765) xandry (1760) mu_enrico (1754) Paolo.Demidov (1734) roycilik (1732) jackg (1727) Coin-1 (1708) Jet Cash (1692) Goran_ (1690) eddie13 (1688) sportsbet.io (1687) ChiBitCTy (1686) famososMuertos (1674) aysg76 (1664) odolvlobo (1656) Xal0lex (1603) LUCKMCFLY (1602) taikuri13 (1585) Julien_Olynpic (1584) vapourminer (1584) madnessteat (1573) Trofo (1564) infofront (1563) sirazimuth (1561) Saint-loup (1560) DroomieChikito (1560) Biodom (1559) YOSHIE (1553) bitbollo (1553) joniboini (1552) Veleor (1550) dragonvslinux (1547) tyKiwanuka (1536) tvplus006 (1520) Foxpup (1506) mprep (1504) Bitcasino.io Support (1500) bitebits (1500)Note: I haven't found any similar tables, so I believe this one.

I will include the +1000 tier in the next update!  Yes, it will be very big, given that many people have crossed the 1000+ merit level, with maybe a bigger number of them between 1000 and 1500 merits. I'm not a programmer, but I believe there should be a tool that can make the data look presentable and not too bulky to read when it's shown here.

Every user who has earned over 1000 merit up to 12000 merit more is on the list below. I took it from merit dashboard again. It will be great for your work.Now I expect to add a few more categories, for example 500+ merit. That must be a pretty good amount too.Code:Merit       To User Name12,141  o_e_l_e_o11,057  LoyceV10,698  fillippone9,208  El duderino_9,013  theymos8,339  Ratimov8,274  DdmrDdmr7,178  suchmoon6,391  pooya876,243  LFC_Bitcoin6,117  JayJuanGee5,791  gmaxwell4,901  dkbit984,664  The Pharmacist4,564  nutildah4,561  satoshi4,530  mikeywith4,500  1miau4,440  xhomerx104,430  BlackHatCoiner4,287  Pmalek4,120  TryNinja4,093  achow1013,965  ETFbitcoin3,957  NeuroticFish3,901  Hhampuz3,892  Last of the V8s3,837  NotATether3,830  Rikafip3,767  n0nce3,745  HCP3,700  bitmover3,686  DaveF3,677  philipma19573,660  nc50lc3,652  stompix3,631  cAPSLOCK3,547  BobLawblaw3,438  DireWolfM143,387  zasad@3,316  icopress3,283  witcher_sense3,262  mocacinno3,211  tranthidung3,135  OmegaStarScream3,129  Lucius3,122  Toxic20403,095  lovesmayfamilis3,057  CryptopreneurBrainboss3,042  Torque2,973  Rath_2,952  TheBeardedBaby2,927  Charles-Tim2,923  mk42,917  Plutosky2,884  d50002,764  GazetaBitcoin2,699  bullrun2020bro2,698  LeGaulois2,682  AlcoHoDL2,611  jojo692,609  Welsh2,575  cygan2,569  nullius2,554  hosseinimr932,550  Hueristic2,516  DannyHamilton2,493  VB10012,490  Paashaas2,419  hugeblack2,412  Hal2,355  ranochigo2,350  qwk2,313  Coding Enthusiast2,271  mole08152,240  khaled01112,225  jeremypwr2,206  bob1232,196  hilariousetc2,144  babo2,135  JimboToronto2,130  buwaytress2,120  yahoo622782,099  krogothmanhattan2,082  abhiseshakana2,079  DarkStar_2,068  yogg2,016  The Cryptovator2,007  gentlemand2,005  Husna QA1,999  duesoldi1,972  OgNasty1,964  Lakai011,950  Bthd1,939  franky11,934  Vod1,932  Lauda1,924  d_eddie1,924  HairyMaclairy1,924  Steamtyme1,916  ivomm1,907  OutOfMemory1,853  Carlton Banks1,849  Royse7771,840  Upgrade001,838  morvillz7z1,819  SFR101,791  PrimeNumber71,782  minerjones1,775  xtraelv1,773  Lafu1,768  shahzadafzal1,765  marlboroza1,760  xandry1,754  mu_enrico1,734  Paolo.Demidov1,732  roycilik1,727  jackg1,708  Coin-11,692  Jet Cash1,690  Goran_1,688  eddie131,687  sportsbet.io1,686  ChiBitCTy1,674  famososMuertos1,664  aysg761,656  odolvlobo1,603  Xal0lex1,602  LUCKMCFLY1,585  taikuri131,584  Julien_Olynpic1,584  vapourminer1,573  madnessteat1,564  Trofo1,563  infofront1,561  sirazimuth1,560  DroomieChikito1,560  Saint-loup1,559  Biodom1,553  bitbollo1,553  YOSHIE1,552  joniboini1,550  Veleor1,547  dragonvslinux1,536  tyKiwanuka1,520  tvplus0061,506  Foxpup1,504  mprep1,500  Bitcasino.io Support1,500  bitebits1,490  coinlocket$1,489  asche1,489  bct_ail1,467  MoparMiningLLC1,459  actmyname1,455  JSRAW1,444  Poker Player1,444  DooMAD1,440  FatFork1,437  skarais1,421  webtricks1,410  Halab1,407  masulum1,401  hatshepsut931,390  KTChampions1,386  laszlo1,382  Elwar1,376  paxmao1,365  Maus07281,358  Tytanowy Janusz1,347  marcus_of_augustus1,326  Cyrus1,324  johhnyUA1,313  wwzsocki1,306  TMAN1,299  BitMaxz1,298  HeRetiK1,296  gospodin1,285  igor721,280  Quickseller1,277  Artemis31,277  Bitcoin_Arena1,255  ibminer1,254  Best_Change1,242  TwitchySeal1,240  efialtis1,239  mindrust1,233  PHI16181,231  Heisenberg_Hunter1,231  hilariousandco1,231  logfiles1,230  safar19801,228  Phil_S1,227  20kevin201,220  RickDeckard1,219  cryptoaddictchie1,218  Baofeng1,218  Kalemder1,202  BitcoinBunny1,189  jokers101,187  -doubleU-1,186  Snork19791,185  yhiaali31,181  Ale881,176  BitcoinGirl.Club1,171  bitcoinPsycho1,168  GreatArkansas1,166  Piggy1,165  cabalism131,163  Mbitr1,154  xenon1311,153  SaltySpitoon1,152  lightfoot1,146  aundroid1,145  Cnut2371,130  Bttzed031,125  anonymousminer1,125  MinoRaiola1,121  klarki1,120  Arriemoller1,119  JollyGood1,115  rdbase1,113  Csmiami1,113  Vispilio1,112  GrosWesh1,106  Soonandwaite1,101  garlonicon1,100  ImThour1,100  Little Mouse1,100  nullCoiner1,098  sabotag3x1,098  trendcoin1,093  bitserve1,091  600watt1,089  Corrosive1,083  Coyster1,077  NotFuzzyWarm1,074  BITCOIN4X1,067  seoincorporation1,063  goldkingcoiner1,047  ryzaadit1,041  Blacknavy1,040         serveria.com1,039  amishmanish1,036  _BlackStar1,035  TopTort7771,030         imhoneer1,029  Globb01,027  igehhh1,027  sheenshane1,022  kawetsriyanto1,019  gbianchi1,018  exstasie1,017  theyoungmillionaire1,012  PawGo1,004  Smartvirus1,003  lossnet1,002  Hispo1,002  examplens",

I'm sure people can see it more easily, but that's just a suggestion you might consider. But I hope the data is still incomplete, I have reached 1041 merit, but there are still 1036.Sometimes statistics can be considered boring as several people can access them in several tools like Merit Dashboard, BPIP, Loyce.club or others [if any]. But that's okay, it's just for something that can make it easier for thousands of other users to know about the data.By the way, I'm new only at the first tier. LOL",

Maybe can look into the possibility of adding other topics for lower tiers.I do not agree if lower than 1500 merit because it does not match with the title, if other members want to adjust and add below that 1500, better to create more threads with the title: \"Tables of users with the most merits earned (lower than 1500 merits)\". This is a thread for up 1500 merit, don't show up if the post belongs with lower than that. or overaction list the table because his alt is not listed on the OP",

This is a thread for up 1500 merit, don't show up if the post belongs with lower than that. or overaction list the table because his alt is not listed on the OPWhy don't you think the title can still be changed to make all the same ideas in one thread instead of having multiple thread?Then I can really think you're now wanting to make some silly assumptions about alt possibilities that aren't listed on that list. Having alts is allowed, so what makes you think someone shouldn't suggest ideas for threads to be nearly as perfect as expected? This is just a thread about merit gain statistics among users, actually I can expect some of the best users with alt to make it on that list. Even if they abuse the forum rules, then it should be a different case.",

It's a nice topic for those that care about merit though.I agree with your sentiment. Your post also got me thinking about what statistics I would be interested in seeing. It would be cool to know how much BTC people have transacted, but I imagine that would require a revamp to the feedback system where people link feedbacks to actual transactions to a user’s staked address. Would be cool to see. I can’t imagine too many other statistics that would actually matter.",
