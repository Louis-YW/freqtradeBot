      "body": "OP, you no lie at all. Wetin you cap na the reality of we country now. As you see so, na we Dy do ourselves all this things no be our leaders. All these things wey we dey do ourselves naim dey make our leaders Dem too dey do us anyhow. I don come to realize say most of all these hike in price of a thing na intentional act from vendors. Dem too dey take advantage of situations at the detriment of fellow Nigerians without having any conscience or second thought of the outcome of their actions. Lets take the fuel scarcity for example. I remember that very day Mr. President may his acceptance speech and told the whole Nigerians the truth behind the fuel subsidy what happened that day, just some minutes after that filling stations and depot started closing down. Marketers were threatening strike at was a shot down virtually across Nigeria. Why did they do that. Other aspect of the economy joined Dem and started to increase price on everything causing untold hardship on Nigerians.So I will not argue or doubt with your case here. Your observations are all correct. Na we dey do ourselves for this country.",

It is very bad how people beg you to help them be at the top but immediately the reach the top they begin to treat those that aided them as trash.They will look for any avenue to make you believe in them but afterwards to turn to wolves in sheep clothings. Well, which ever way it is no one can be in power for a life time so one day when dey loose power they will be judged based on how the use or misuse the power given to them.Life is a boomerang as one good turn deserves another and whatever one sows is what they would reap, they may not reap it directly but through their loved ones and relatives they will still reap it.Power ought not to be mismanaged as your actions can also affect you in time coming so we should be cautious of how we use power when given the opportunity.",
