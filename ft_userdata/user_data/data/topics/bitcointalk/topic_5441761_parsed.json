      "body": "Security is one of the strong points of Bitcoin.  It is secured by proof of work and needs a huge amount of money to create a 51% attack.  Aside from that, the deflationary feature of Bitcoin is also another factor to look at. We all know that Bitcoin has a fixed supply but along the way, people are losing their passwords and private keys that they are unable to access their Bitcoin, thus this make Bitcoin rarity to increase.You can also consider the liquidity of the Bitcoin market and the country that accepts it as either legal tender or a mode of payment though some countries are hostile, many countries accept Bitcoin with open arms.  And the community of Bitcoin is the largest among the cryptocurrency.",

In all the Cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem bitcoin is respected and giving specific treatment because of it value in the ecosystem market space. Bitcoin is valued not because it is the first to be created among the Cryptocurrencies, overtaking is allowed, but no crypto can over take bitcoin, I have stated some of the reasons in the first lines of the comment",

[1]Limited supply --bitcoin has a fixed supply, which means that it is a deflationary currency and this is in contrast to fiat currencies, which can be printed at will by central banks.[2]Security-- it is secured by a cryptographic algorithm called SHA-256, which makes it virtually impossible to counterfeit or double-spend, and also the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin provides an immutable ledger that is resistant to tampering.The last one could be, the real decentralized meaning was on bitcoin.",

Quote from: Ryker1 on March 01, 2023, 10:57:08 PMSecurity-- it is secured by a cryptographic algorithm called SHA-256You've confused it. Bitcoin is not secured by a hash function, that is SHA256. It is secured by mining, the process which includes perpetual calls of that function until a hash that is lower than the target is found.",

Most people have heard of bitcoin ahead of coins like Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana and Polygon (perhaps also doge but maybe that's just a twitter thing). It's yet to be beaten on security and market cap too.",

Among this, different people have got difference of opinion and choose bitcoin for different reason. Some prefer it for its volatility believing it could bring good profit in the long term. Some for the privacy and the reason counts.",

Being the dominant cryptocurrency in the market, its price is highly volatile, which others may consider as an bane, while some consider it as a blessing. Depending on the investment, a person can potentially earn and profit thousands to millions of dollars if he/she is able to maximize its opportunity or HODL.Another characteristic on what makes BTC special is its overall acceptability in other countries. With its strong foundation, some countries have started to accept and integrate it to their financials and economy. Though there may be countries that are skeptical about its use, it remains as a fact that BTC is to co-exist with fiat as a means of alternative payment to other purchases.",

Above that, Bitcoin has a lot of strong hands supporting its security; unlike other coins, Bitcoin is the only coin I know that halves every four years, and Bitcoin is the only coin that lots of people are having a great interest in just to find out the developer and try to make it centralized. Some individuals have also made false claims about being Satoshi (Bitcoin developer).",

As far as I know, most other blockchains have shut down or stopped working a few times, but since its creation, bitcoin has never been hacked or stopped working. One of the things I like about bitcoin is that its creator has completely disappeared, which makes bitcoin decentralized and will never be controlled by anyone.",

But I'm the case of most other tokens or coins the dev of the project have the ability to dump the price completely and making it useless for HODLers.",
