So if it goes up and hit 25100.00 the trade ends and I lost money. I did not place a limit on profit. In that way, it can keep going down and down and I'll end it when I want to.THIS IS HOW FOREX WORKS. So I have an Open Order on Bitcoin.It keeps going down and I'm making money.I open the order to get out of the trade and collect profit.However, the only thing I can do is Cancel the order.If I cancel the order I lose everything.There is no way for me to end the trade and collect profit, just like FOREX.Unless I'm missing something?How do I end the trade and collect the profit?When I click the \"Insert Image\" feature, all that appears is: http://http://",

Lost money?I don't understand how you lost money after selling your bitcoin and your order is filled. You will receive either cash or stable coin after selling your bitcoin. The amount and value can be bigger or smaller than your initial capital but you won't lose all your money. Price of Bitcoin when you sold it is $25,100 not $0.QuoteWhen I click the \"Insert Image\" feature, all that appears is: Forum stopped accepting image links from imgur.com.

And you set a \"Limit\" (Stop Lost) at $25100. Fyi, I've never used Coinbase, if I'm on Binance, I just close positions through the list of active positions like this",

The only thing I see is, \"Cancel Order.\"I am not very familiar with Coinbase, however I think that you are currently navigating through the spot trading section of that platform. I am not sure if Coinbase offers futures trading, but in case that they don't, there are other platforms such as Binance for which futures trading feature is currently available.",

The only thing I see is, \"Cancel Order.\"It means that your position is not yet fillied if cancel order is still available on your order status. What type of trade you are doing? Spot trading or Futures Trading because the forex like feature on trading that you are talking is Futures trading while spot trasing will just let you hold the coin.Or are you using an option trading? I’m really sure that your order is not filled since there’s still cancel order feature? Check your total balance in your wallet if your money is still there. Probably your balance is still on the open order that’s why you assume that your balance already loss because you can’t place an order anymore. Cancel your open order so that you can retrieve your balance.",

Lets suppose you created a short limit order to sell Bitcoin at $26000 and the order gets filled, now you have an open short position, and after sometime the price goes to $26500 then you are having negative return from your shorting. And, if the price goes down again to $25500 then you will have positive return from shorting the Bitcoin. In first case if you close your position you will lose some money but in the 2nd case you will make money by closing the position.",

So I assume you're currently trading the spot market and that is different from trading forex.Quote from: David92506 on June 15, 2023, 06:47:23 PMIf the order isn't filled then the only way out is to cancel the order.Yes, and you don't mean to lose money because you have the coins. Or you're actually using another \"Coinbase\" that we don't know, can you give me the link?QuoteHow long does it take to fill an order?I put a Sell on Bitcoin. $20.00. I waited 30 minutes and it still wasn't filled. So I canceled the order.This depends on where the price is moving, you have to wait until the price hits your target selling price or higher. But the waiting time is infinite and there are no brokerage fees for it.",
