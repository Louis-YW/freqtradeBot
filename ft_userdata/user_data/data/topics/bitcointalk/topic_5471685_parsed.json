      "body": "Well, at least the predictions I see are not too far-fetched, which lately I have seen some who have forgotten what has happened this very cycle. Let's hope in terms of approvals that this is the case, and that from January 2024 one ETF after another will gradually be approved, coinciding with the approaching halving, which will push the price upwards.Quote from: Catenaccio on October 26, 2023, 02:10:19 AMI don't trust their price speculations and some speculative prices are just too low, lower than my expected price for BTC after 2024 halving and a consequent bull run after a halving. I believe halvings are more important to trigger Bitcoin bull runs than Bitcoin Spot ETFs.And have you forgotten what has happened this cycle? The maximum has been only 3.5 times the previous maximum, despite predictions of up to 20 times the maximum. I think they are making conservative predictions and doing well, but I also think that if that calendar roughly comes true, along with halving, and if we don't have any major negative news the price may peak a little higher than the average of what is listed there, probably $250K.",

      "body": "I tend to think that Bitcoin Spot ETF applications will make the price fall, as excessive optimism regarding the acceptance of the Spot ETF will push the price up to $48,000 or even $52,000, and the rejection that will bring the price to $28,000 to $34,000 comes before we reach $39,000 in March, which is halving time. ETF acceptance may happen by the end of the year, and it may be the reason why the price rises by the end of the year, to $100k in 2024 and $170k in 2025.",

But perhaps with the new sets of application and this time it's almost very tight now, that no gaps can be seen from this application specially on who's who as far as those application those. They are the most powerful financial firm in the world, totally in trillions of money. So it's very difficult for SEC to deny it know. And we can say that they have a big pressures on their shoulder as everyone wanted them to accept it.QuoteAs the US Securities and Exchange Commission evaluates the applications, here is a detailed list of all spot Bitcoin ETF applications:https://beincrypto.com/full-list-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications-deadlines/",

Considering the fact there will also be halving next year that will pull the price up for months to follow, etf + halving influence will be combined. That means price above 100k dollar is very likely and fair enough. I always wish we could pull traditional market investors into crypto. I think 2024 will be that year.
