  "content": "Trezor has launched a new version of its official website - https://trezor.io/.It looks very slick if you ask me. The thing I feel is missing is a dark mode. I just hate looking at all the white.- I am not sure if the old Trezor website posted information about the number of sold hardware wallets. But the new site states that Trezor has over 1 million customers. The Model T was sold over 300.000 times, but the clear winner is Model One with over 750.000 units sold.- According to their blog announcement, the Knowledgebase section is also new. It helps you get started with your hardware wallet, you can learn about Bitcoin, the Trezor Suite, security, privacy, etc.  - A new version of the Trezor Suite was also released today. Version 22.10.2. This comes in preparation for the CoinJoin feature that will be introduced in the future. The other change is a new tag next to multisig and transactions signed by multiple parties. They are now labelled in the Trezor Suite as Joint BTC transactions.   More info is available here:https://blog.trezor.io/new-trezor-website-and-trezor-suite-update-october-66788fedf4f3",

I'm not sure that number is going to be increasing soon though, not with the recent changes to the T model price anyway.",

I have tried this extension in the past, but I didn't like it. I know you can tweak the settings, colors, and brightness levels for each website you visit to make it better, but the default look is bad if you ask me. It's the complete opposite of all the white and turns the whole page in a similarly unattractive but just black version.   Quote from: dkbit98 on October 20, 2022, 07:08:29 PMOne more bad thing I see on their website is new price for Trezor One wallet that now cost almost 90 euros, that is way expensive if you ask me, and it's ever worse for Trezor Model T. I guess it depends on the IP address and the location from where you access the site. Yesterday when I checked it, the Model One was shown to my at a price of €69. I now see €82. Model T was €217, now it's €260. It depends on the IP. If you add one of the wallets in the cart and go to checkout, try flicking through the different countries in the list. EU countries are €82-€86. European countries that aren't part of the EU, Asia, and Africa are €69. Depending on local tax and customs regulations, that €69 initial price could become bigger once the HW gets shipped to that location.",

But it has USB C!And honestly speaking I do not really understand why one support other coins than other. At the end it should depend on software wallet, no? I find a bit misleading fact that hardware wallet supports XXXX coins while Trezor Suite (dedicated software from the producer) just a few.It is similar to steel plate producers who tell us to use it as a seed storage saying that \"it supports BIP39 seeds\" - come on, it is just a piece of metal!",

I guess it depends on each individual person and their needs. Model T has a bigger color touchscreen while you have to work the two buttons on the Model One for all your actions. The number of supported altcoins is of less significance to me at least.The biggest security improvement on Model T is that you are entering your PINs and passphrases on the hardware device itself, but on Model One you do it through the software. Trezor's don't have secure elements, and I am not sure how and if this can be exploited in some way. Model T also supports Shamir backups and FIDO2 authentication. Both don't work on Trezor One.Quote from: SFR10 on October 21, 2022, 03:47:10 PMConsidering that Ledger had 5M+ sales already, I was expecting the number to be a bit higher for Trezor, but looks like I was wrong.

I guess Cardano and other similarly complex apps won't ever be supported on the old Trezor One unless developers find a way to decrease the codebase to an acceptable level, but without negatively affecting security. It's already been a few months since support was added back in May. It's either not that important and they are focusing on other things, or they just can't do it.",
