  "content": "Most of us know who Hal Finney was, and I think we can all agree that for his work when it comes to Bitcoin, he deserves a special place next to Satoshi Nakamoto. Although Hal has not been with us for 10 years, it is nice to see that people still remember him and that the Human Rights Foundation decided to establish an award that will bear his name, and that the first winner will be Hal posthumously. HRF allocated a total of 33 BTC, of which 1 BTC will go to Hal, and given that the prize will be awarded every four years, there will also be prizes for the periods 2012-2016, 2016-2020 and 2020-2024. It will be interesting who will receive the awards for the remaining three periods, and of course it will also be interesting what the members of the forum think about it.

This is taking nothing away from the action of standing up to those trying the hardest to silence voices.

While Hodlonaut definitely deserves it for his fight for the truth. Also I think an this award should also go to El Salvador or top influencer in making bitcoin a legal tender there, since they are the first country for doing so.Quote from: tranthidung on April 23, 2024, 03:52:40 PMQuote from: Lucius on April 23, 2024, 03:07:39 PMHRF allocated a total of 33 BTC, of which 1 BTC will go to HalI am curious when reading this and want to know how HRF distribute this prize.

I guess his family will receive that reward after him, and you are right he deserves a place with Satoshi but only if we knew where Satoshi is, maybe you are talking about giving some kind of rank like there is a rank or title for the satoshi on this forum. Am I right?The rewards are not so much but its enough as we know the wife of Hal Finney (fran Finney) is raising funds for the research of ALS which is the study of microorganisms causing the disease. So, these funds will do a lot in her hands. As you asked who will receive the awards I guess this award is initialized with the approval of her wife already As this site states:In 2024, the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) created the Finney Freedom Prize with the blessing and approval of Fran Finney",

Shouldn't theymos get the recognition he deserves for keeping this forum alive and taking such good care of it for all those years? This is the official Bitcoin forum created by Satoshi himself, but if it wasn't managed in a good way, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be in the state it is today, and we can't neglect the efforts of theymos for doing that along with other members who supported him.Understandably, later developers are deserving as well, but I think he should at least get one of the awards from 2012-2024 because even if he didn't contribute much to the network or the blockchain in these years, he has been around and managing and keeping the official forum alive which isn't less than other contributions people have made for Bitcoin.",
