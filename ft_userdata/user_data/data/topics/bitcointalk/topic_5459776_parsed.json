If anything will be done, I can suggest FG to beat the money up to 30k , then requirement to be a beneficiary should be by having a bank account. The names, account number /bvn of people working with government, companies or business who earn above 100k should be collected and set aside, then every account not associated with the working class or earn less than 100k should be paid 30k on monthly basis.To do this, it requires skilled and professional technologist/programmers to put this in order to avoid embezzlement. This mechanism will be automated such that everyone recieves their pay directly, no need to entrust Any special body with the disbursement of the fund.Â  I believe it is possible since the bvn carries the people's information. Bank account that must be used mustÂ  be trusted banks in Nigeria. Everyone who didn't recieve it's pay should forward complain to a body who is entrusted to monitor the flow of money into all acoount.",

Let's not even add even aff transportation and other necessities.Well, I'm not sure how they arrived at this said amount to be disbursed to the entire populace, but I feel there should have been better ways to cushion the effect of subsidy removal and not just by disbursing a mere 8,000 that's not going to yield anything meaningful than a meagre square meal.The sad reality of this disbursement is, not everyone will have access to the funds eventually. Because someone might just end up diverting a chunk of the fund for his/her selfish interest. Such a sad reality.In my opinion, the PBAT economic team should come up with creative ideas than disbursement of 8,000.
