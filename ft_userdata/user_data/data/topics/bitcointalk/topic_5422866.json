  "content": "Funny story: Sometime last year, I got introduced to a \"scheme\" that claimed it would pay you in BTC without much work. I didn't know much about cryptocurrency then. I wasn't exactly moved because I have a hard time believing in things that come easily and I'm usually suspicious of things I get easily. So... At some point I started buying the idea because I knew some few persons close to me that were making real money from it. You didn't have to refer. I didn't want to be left behind, so my curiosity kicked. I was told if have to get the application, put in some BTC and then buy a mining machine   I got did all the processes voila, I was making money...... At least for the first three days, I was making money. After that week, we were told they wanted to make some upgrade to the app, so we won't be able to place withdrawal at the moment... That was when I knew I was in trouble. Just as I thought, the whole scheme \"collapsed\" and our money was gone. Ignorance did me bad.So my question boils down to: are cryptocurrency mining machines really real?  I need answers. How do I know what to trust?!",

How do I know what to trust?!To answer your question,  cryptocurrency mining is real, but one has to use the right mining equipment for such to be successful. So on that note, I will like to ask just only two questions.1. What mining equipment did you buy or used for your mining journey, or was it just a mere online mining? Because most are scams2. Did you make any deligent research about it before investing or you just went into it just because of the review of a few?This should be a lesson to you from today to never invest in what promises a reward too good to be true, as thats the first red-flag of a potential scam",

Without paying others involved through the mining process, but the blockchain mining of bitcoin requires alot of devices and technical set up arrangements to make because it is the only genuine mining process.",

There are lots of challenges miners face, first you have to buy the necessary hardware and you also need electricity for your farm, nowadays you need to confirm if bitcoin mining is allowed in your region. Quote from: Simplycallmecollins on November 23, 2022, 06:31:50 PMHow do I know what to trust?!Never trust the freebies. There’s nothing free on the chess board only gambits, it’s sad you lost your money hoping to get a bigger reward but it’s a good lesson to have as a beginner. People often fall for cloud mining scams because they feel it’s a cheaper way to get Bitcoins. Personally I think the era of accumulating free bitcoins from online games, faucets, are long gone. In 2022, the only way to get bitcoin is to buy some.",

How do I know what to trust?!It's real, cryptocurrency mining requires physical machine and electricity in order to run it. The cost depends on where you live and it might be not worth it for you if the rewards get spent for maintenance charge without leaving anymore profit for you. You don't need in front of your machine 24/7 to check the mining, it isn't going anywhere unlike the cloud mining where they went away with your money.",

Mining equipment is expensive, loses value and get damaged/obsolet relatively fast, requires a lot of room and a cold source to not overheat and damage everything even faster.It means a lot of expenses with energy, besides the initial investment which also has to be a decent one. In the end, bitcoin may continue losing value, decreasing the profitability of the business more yet.If you have enough funds and a big area, better to think about a more stable and guaranteed sector to invest in, while also thinking about the possibility of producing goods while you sleep.",

This is ofcourse a scam because cloud based mining doesn't pay you well.I learnt this around 2016 and started cloud mining on some websites. But they were free sites and did not ask any money to be paid.In your case it is obviously a scam. These days cloud mining is definitely not profitable. You will have to buy mining rigs and run it to get some decent money.There are efforts involved where you have to pay for the electricity and do the maintenance of the mining rigs.Hence mining machines are real but you have to put your efforts in it.",
