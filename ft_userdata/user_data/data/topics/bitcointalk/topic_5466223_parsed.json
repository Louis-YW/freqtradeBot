  "content": "Hi everyone, wanna share my experience that I had on coinbase. I usually deposit here and send to FreeBitco or other wallets. Today, happened something funny, my account got limited after I buyed some ETH. So wasn't able to Send & Sell anymore. The support, make me lose also 4 hours, asking me to change hundred times the browsers.Then , at the end, the guy from the support said me , is because the system detect something suspicious. I always login from same network (from here), in any case, I understand that, so I resend a selfie & front/back of my ID card. After the confirm of it went good, I wasn't still able to Send & Sell. So then I go to \"Disable account\" (to receive my eth) and close this weird service. Again here, it says I've to contact the support. Contacted, and instead helping me with Disabling the account, he went straight back to the first ticket I had.So what I should say, if u wanna see someone joking with u're coins, just use Coinbase. Now I bought a one-way flight to binance, good luck guys, just wanna share a way that coinbase block our funds for several time for no reason. Have a nice day everyone!",

Look freebitco.in is a gambling site if you made some transaction using Coinbase to send or receive from freebitco.in then you've already violated their policy.Also, coinbase is not a good place to buy coins their service is pretty strict compared to Binance based on my experience.Anyway, how do you buy ETH did you use coins or FIAT?If you paid it with FIAT through a bank you can maybe able to dispute the transaction.",

Whatever is good to know, I just wanted to share my experience with you, so you can avoid risking you're crypto, they do magic, can make them vanish  . Also is very stupid this rule, cuz I can transfer to a wallet, and then from there I do whatever I want, but yeah I just move to binance instead supporting this gov platform. #DeleteCoinbase",

Whatever is good to know, I just wanted to share my experience with you, so you can avoid risking you're crypto, they do magic, can make them vanish  (also I live in Italy)There are some users here who experience the same thing they also received a response that support said there is a suspicious login but the real reason is they also violated the gambling policy they admit it.So I believe that's the reason why your account is limited.If the support tells you that there is a suspicious login why not try to request for login history and IP? So that we know if they actually pointing to suspicious login and not the violated policy.And then ask them what should you do to lift the limitation?",

So all I know so far, is that I just give up that funds, contacted my bank and explained how they block my funds hope to get refunded back by them.So coinbase should not let me buy Crypto knowing I was banned for that reason right? Instead they let me buy it, that's how they rob some of us. But I repeat, I am not here to complain but would like just to let the people that use coinbase what can happen to their crypto too.",

They both have their fair share of shady decisions to suddenly freeze funds, lock accounts, disable withdrawals on the basis of \"something suspicious.\"",

So all I know so far, is that I just give up that funds, contacted my bank and explained how they block my funds hope to get refunded back by them.The support team responded with inaccurate information, but from what I mentioned, the reason is the gambling site. I do not think that binance has a similar policy, but in any case, and to avoid this happening in the future, try to break the link between the last withdrawal/deposit process and your wallet with several intermediate wallets, meaning that you send money to several wallets you manage them Before depositing or withdrawing, it is true that twill cost you more fees but it is rare for these sites to go through a chain analysis of longer than 3 transactions. You can also use mixing services.",

There will be a delay, but you will get them. The other side is the rules are many and not well documented so you never know where you might trip one.-Dave",

So move to better exchange which gives better User experience.",
