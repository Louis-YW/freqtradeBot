Those who apply for airdrops do that at a high frequency, meaning they reveal personal information about themselves on various platforms and that could be sold or hacked and find its way to the dark web, this in turn could be used to make purchases in the person's name and result in huge debt.Airdrops in my opinion are not worth the stress it takes to apply for them, and when you factor in the risk involved, I would advice to avoid.",

Never connect your main wallet, you can always use a new wallet for airdrops only, finding a good airdrop is like looking at a needle in a haystack, I have a friend who's so active in airdrops, who had over 100 airdrops and only 5% of them have values, and sometimes you have to wait for months before it lands on exchanges and there's no value because the whales and the team dump their shares first, airdrop participants are the last one to receive their shares and also the last one to sell it.",

If so, then don't fall for those. Also joining airdrop using telegram bot is totally scam or fake because 99% won't pay you until it's a good project who are doing that airdrop officially.

Well, there is few types of airdrop like incentive testnet with airdrops or retroactive airdrop. For retroactive airdrop, there won't be any official statement from team. For example, early users got UNI or 1INCH or PARA airdrop for using the dex platform. So better look into twitter threads where any defi researchers post details if there will be airdrop for it or not.You can follow BitByte Crypto for such contents and here's a thread for you to look into if you're interested into incentive testnet for airdrop or retroactive airdrop: https://twitter.com/officialbitbyte/status/1628727899942690816Quote from: Call_LSI on February 27, 2023, 01:31:33 PMLet's be careful what we connect our crypto wallets to.

Let's be careful what we connect our crypto wallets to. In my opinion it is better to skip airdrops completely, now it is completely true there was a time there was some money to be made out of them, but the competition for it grew exponentially with the use of bots and the quality of airdrops dropped considerably as the majority of them do not pay their bounty hunters, and when you out those factors together it becomes very clear the time to collect airdrops has passed and it is never coming back.",
