Is it really just isolated to getting a massive win? because if that's the case then I must say that's a massive scam lmao. Most casinos will ask for KYC upon deposit or withdrawal, not for massive wins, the latter is just barring you from getting your money, and is thus a form of scam (to me personally) even if the KYC went through and allowed you to withdraw your bankroll, cause that's a form of delay they take in order to either recuperate losses they incurred from giving you the win, or just an outright delay to make you forget that you won something considerable. In any case, KYC shouldn't be questioned, it's a very reliable form of verification to ensure that law enforcements can get a hold of you when shit hits the fan, and it's also a form of customer protection as a company that requires KYC is obliged to work in close relations with their respective government, if things don't go well for you, you can sue them in court and have them pay you for reparations.",

That should be the case but in some cases, casinos are declining the KYC because they cannot establish the identity how can it be possible if you are the one playing and you submit all your documents then you are declined?It's hard to accept for a player if he can't get his account verified even though all the documents needed are already submitted.I already did KYC on government institutions and some sites and they accept it because it's really me and all the documents they requested are all submitted then how come casinos cannot?",

If they want an excuse to not payout a big win, KYC the client and reject any documents they provide for whatever arbitrary reason. Introduce a third party (who picks the 3rd party? It won't be the player, it'll be the casino) and you have the same issue, except your trust is outsourced to the third party.I decline to play on casinos that abuse KYC.

If I am these people I will be uncomfortable with what the details and documents I have submitted be used for. KYC verification can fail due to some reasons, like fake documents being submitted or poor lightening for video verification (for casinos that go that far), but the actions of these casino's should be to try to ensure that the user sorts the challenge and pass the verification process. Casinos that there are too many complaints about their KYC verification should be avoided.",

This part of the gambling site service is what I don't like the most. It's too wide and has holes if they want to abuse the system. All the reasons why we should stick with reputable names and avoid those who have chances to take advantage of it especially if we are planning to bet high amounts that will go beyond the amount of AMLA restrictions.But let us also not forget, this is part of the security that they want to apply. What if there are people who are trying to take the money while it's not really theirs? Forgery. It's not that hard anymore in this era. Anyone could be anyone and take money from a fund that he doesn't really own. Some gambling sites want to do the right thing but others do not. It's better to leave it to those who will investigate this kind of problem or just do the KYC as early as possible to avoid such things to happen.",

Declined kyc are often from not clearly and visible documents or incorrect details, that is to say, during time of registration you could asked to fill out your real names that would correspond with your documents and if in any way date of birth aren't the same with which on documents then such casino has the right to reject their applications.As you said earlier, it's bad to do kyc while you already had funds inside the casino because the possibility of rejecting kyc is very high, so do not do kyc after you win or deposited fund into a casino or in any exchange.",

If the casino is reputable then I don’t see the point for them to lie or reject someone KYC documents because they have nothing to gain on it.I experience to undergo KYC many times and some casino use a 3rd party KYC verification that has a very sensitive bot to verify documents.

And perhaps the customers is saying the truth and going to extra length to do video conference to proved that he is the one playing and that all of the documents is legit.

Obviously this is because the casino has to protect its business and from their side, I feel it completely normal to implement, since there are people who are trying to exploit site's codes or use tainted source money to win.Also the reason why so many casinos have come up recently, because one site starting KYC fiasco means the users will attempt to migrate to another while the other one stays non-KYC, will also implement KYC in a few months - its seems like a cat and mouse game.",
