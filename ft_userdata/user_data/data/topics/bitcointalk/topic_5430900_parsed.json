  "content": "Confidence is one key factor in a man's life and the ability for a man to be confident is a virtue.I've spent over 4 days on the forum and despite the criticism, one thing I've noticed in this forum Is that no matter what the response might be, one must always be confident in all the doings and activities of the forum. Qualities of a confident person ~They listen more than they speak People who are truly confident already know what they are about to say so most times they wait to hear your opinion before speaking and hence on the forum, you shouldn't be in a haste to respond to topics but rather take your time to understand the topic before making quality and meaningful contributions to the topic.Celebrating other's winsFor a true confident person also wishes to see everyone succeed rather than feeling insecure seeing others succeed. staying in pleasant mood always Confident people don't let the opinions of others tell on them and hence they don't feel insulted in any form and always want to learn from every incidence and one should imbibe such culture on the forum.not ashamed to seek help or assistance When they're challenged, they have the boldness to seek for help and not feel ashamed of it.There are lot more qualities of a confident person.So what do you think are the qualities of a confident person?Let's discuss it here in the comment.",

A man that has prepared very well for a particular task would be confident that he would perform such responsibility effectively and efficiently. Therefore, one of the ways of becoming confident in this forum to acquire the required knowledge or information about a topic before you start posting or discussing it in the forum. If you are sure that your contribution is a quality one, it would boast your confidence. But in cases where you are not sure of your responses, you would always be sacred that your mistakes or ignorance would be discovered and you might be criticism or even cautioned.Another catalyst of confidence is the consciousness that you are doing the right thing in the forum. If you are sure that you are not breaking any of the forum's rules in your conduct or activities, it has the tendency of improving our confidence level.",

      "body": "You're correct..But since you said confidence is a virtue, is it supposed to be learnt and practiced just the way you've advice? No? Anyone that'll do much better in here is supposed to have learnt that in the outside world, -- Cus we're all fuckin' humans and we all have emotions,.. okay?.. some can control them, some gets controlled by them and that's where it becomes a bug in a social gathering like this.Op wrote something 'bout staying pleasant always: everyone gets angry dude. Believe me, there's always a time a bomb shells up for whatever flimsy reasons it might be, the same in humans. You're gonna feel insulted but you're simply gonna look pass that crap; sometimes you could even take 'em too personal and -- before you realize a thing -- you'll tell anyone else to never fuck with you else they'll get the same measure as the previous dude ...lol üòÇ I remember a case btw Bitcoingirlclub and ratimov? That's if memories are vivid.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

      "body": "In general, I agree to your guidelines but: Quote from: Obari on December 21, 2022, 06:20:44 PMCelebrating other's winsFor a true confident person also wishes to see everyone succeed rather than feeling insecure seeing others succeed.It's ok to congratulate someone but we should only do it, if we have to add considerable additional constructive content. Just saying:\"I'm very happy for your win, you really deserve to win [insert price of the giveaway here]. I hope you'll be happy to receive your price soon!\"or\"Congratulations to reach a new rank! It has been hard but now you have [insert new rank achievement here]. It's really a well deserved achievement!\"etc.is production of unnecessary shitposts because such posts don't carry any insightful content and are totally generic. Should everyone do that, imagine 20 people flocking to the topic and writing 20 one-liners about such congratulations. That would be one whole site (20 comments) without providing any added value.¬† In addition, such posts might be considered asQuote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM1. No zero or low value, pointless or uninteresting posts or threads.and will possibly get deleted by moderators. But I agree: your suggestions are beneficial to consider when writing a constructive post in general.",

      "body": "Based on your third point, I think it takes more than confidence to celebrate and bask in another's win; and that attribute is a lack of self centeredness and pride. Just like Hakeem noted, we are humans; but it takes one who is not just confident in himself but is also willing to let others grow that can do that.¬†¬†It may seem funny, but dude, there are folks on here who take the forum space to a competitive one and as such miss out on it's main purpose of setup.",

The first step to know in his first accepting that you do not know something then seeking help to know it. If you did not accept that you do not know something there is no way you would want to seek help or assistance to know more about it. Don't be ashamed if you don't know something, the forum is a place to get help and assistance especially with issues regarding bitcoins, be confident enough to ask for help.",

First and foremost, confidence helps you believe in yourself and your abilities, which can help you take on new challenges and pursue your goals even when you encounter setbacks or obstacles along the way. The more confident you are, the more likely people will be to trust your ideas and follow through on them. But, confidence isn't just about believing in yourself. It's also about believing in other people, especially when they need your support and encouragement. When you show confidence in others, it can help them feel more confident themselves.",
