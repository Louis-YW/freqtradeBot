I got the money I use to buy solar from fishing and my little savings every morning I follow my father to the river to catch fish, most times my father asked me what am I using the money for but he hasn't gotten a good answer, now he finally does.

However you seem to be a newbie to this forum so it's important that you review the beginner boards to learn more.You may now be free to analyze and study bitcoin but it looks like you still have limited energy even though you basically have solar panels but that won't be enough if you have bigger electricity dependents, so it's important for you to save the energy you have for now.",

      "body": "You have shown great commitment to learning about bitcoin and you have proved it through your doggedness and hard work. One of the impediments to the spread of Bitcoin adoption in Africa is the lack of power supply. Many African are living without electricity mostly in rural areas. With the problem of power solved, you can now have access to diverse resource materials on bitcoin and hopefully, you will gain profitable knowledge. After you have learned about the coin, you might also save some funds from your fishing business and invest it in bitcoin, you might make some good profit in the nearest future. With your zeal, you can achieve more, congratulations.",
