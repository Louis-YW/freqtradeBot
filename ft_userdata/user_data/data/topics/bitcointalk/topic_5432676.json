Bitcoin mining has become very competitive over the years and operating as a solo miner has become less and less profitable, particularly when you're operating with just your personal computer.Quote from: Dickiy on January 02, 2023, 04:16:21 AMwhat I'm asking is whether this will damage my CPU and my mining tools later? and what should I do to deal with this to continue my bitcoin mining?An inconsistent power supply would further reduce your chances of earning slightly, but shouldn't do more damage than that, except the amount of volatge being supplied is inconsistent. For this, you can get a surge protector for your device or stabilizer (depending on what it's called inbyour locality).",

      "body": "Since you said it was an experiment, why don't you take a break and wait until the power stabilizes? In the meantime buying a UPS might be a good idea so you can turn off your PC in the future when this happens again. I don't see the point of continuing your mining experiment since I suppose profit is not your goal here. Risking to brick your computer is definitely not worth it.In addition to this, I think you should check all electronics in your house. Based on your explanation this affects your whole power network and your computer is not the only thing that was affected by it. I'm not an expert in electronics but I heard inconsistent power off and on can damage an electronic device[1]. CMIIW.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_of_electronic_components",

Actually it depends on the specifications of your CPU / computer, but in my experience this adequate specification will make your CPU endurance fine, if it's lacking I don't think you should push it too hard.Quote from: Dickiy on January 02, 2023, 04:16:21 AMand what should I do to deal with this to continue my bitcoin mining?Trying to use the UPS for security, looking for adequate or recommended CPU/VGA specifications that are good enough, both internal and external CPU/VGA, this is if you mine it personally at home, if the industry requires a lot of other supporting devices.",

Even a better ASIC that consume lesser electricity is recommended.I hope you are not discussing cloud mining. Cloud mining are scam, do not pay any miner to mine for you or mining bitcoin on a website, those are not bitcoin mining.",

Initially used it since the RTX cards were handicapped by LHR.Frankly speaking, mining Bitcoin isn't always about purchasing a dedicated ASIC machine just to pound away on those numbers. Business models are getting smarter by allowing users like us to mine altcoins that isn't power-demanding like BTC, which we could then cash out in BTC from crypto conversion (e.g. $10 in ETC => $10 BTC before fees)Pretty much the same concept, just that we don't own any virgin ones",

Btw, do you have access to cheap electricity before you decide to buy an ASIC? If you don't have them, I doubt you'll make a decent profit, even reaching a break-even might take some time. You can probably start another thread asking about profitability with your setup if you still have a difficult time calculating how long you need to mine before you can make a profit.If you decide to research more into altcoin mining, then browse the Altcoin board for further info. I don't recall seeing a general guide there, but you can search or post a new thread if you found something that you don't understand. Most of the time you'll find a dedicated guide for each software/pool so just see if one of them is suitable for you.",

It depends how was energy unstable sometimes it will not damage anything but if electricity goes to 400volts for example it will blow some caps etc.it happens depending energy lines shorts or other cases.",

I had a situation when the mining farm turned on, and after checking it turned off due to a short circuit, and I didnâ€™t go looking for a problem for a long time. Mining farm is still working. But mining on a PC is now unprofitable.",

As long there is nothing important in your memory its should be fine. Dont you can stand with that situation ? , seems to me isnt doable even for daily routine",
