  "content": "QuoteCalifornia sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of pushing sellers and suppliers into anticompetitive deals that lead to higher prices, including at rival online stores.The lawsuit, filed by state Attorney General Rob Bonta, focuses on the way Amazon — the largest online retailer — deals with third-party merchants, who account for most of the sales on the platform.California alleges that Amazon penalizes sellers and suppliers that offer cheaper prices elsewhere on the internet, including Walmart and Target, for example by displaying their items lower or less prominently or outright blocking their new postings.\"Amazon makes consumers think they are getting the lowest prices possible,\" the lawsuit alleges, \"when in fact, they cannot get the low prices that would prevail in a freely competitive market because Amazon has coerced and induced its third-party sellers and wholesale suppliers to enter into anticompetitive agreements on price.\"California's antitrust lawsuit is among the biggest legal challenges to Amazon in recent years, as lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and abroad have investigated the retail giant for potential anticompetitive practices.An Amazon spokesperson denied any antitrust violations, pointed out that a similar case in the District of Columbia was dismissed, and said the California Attorney General has it backwards.\"Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,\" the company said in a statement. \"Like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.\"California also accuses Amazon of creating a \"vicious anticompetitive cycle\": Sellers view Amazon as a must; Amazon charges them higher fees to be able to sell on its platform; Sellers, in turn, raise their Amazon prices. And, even though it costs them less to sell on other websites, Amazon's policies push sellers to raise prices on those sites, too.\"Through its illegal actions, the, quote, \"everything store\" has effectively set a price floor, costing Californians more for just about everything,\" Bonta said at a press conference on Wednesday.Earlier this year, a judge dismissed a similar lawsuit that was filed in Washington, D.C., though the city's attorney general has appealed.In that case, Amazon argued its deals with merchants were meant to prevent shoppers from being overcharged, and punishing Amazon would hurt consumers.Amazon has separately proposed a settlement with European antitrust regulators, who charged the company with violating competition laws. Their key allegations accused the company of using data it collected from third-party sellers to its own benefit.https://www.npr.org/2022/09/14/1122995430/california-sues-amazon....For many years, consumers were encouraged to by local. Pay higher prices for locally produced products. Rather than shop on amazon for rock bottom prices.Now it appears california is making the inverse opposite case. They're claiming that amazon pushes prices higher. Rather than lower. And that there are illegal business practices in the form of market collusion and price gouging. Which are pushing prices higher in stores across the board.These are interesting claims to say the least. California being the home of silicon valley and 5th largest economy in the world. As well as the homes of google, apple, tesla, microsoft and countless other world famous US tech start ups. One might wonder how california came to have leadership which blames amazon for high market prices. Is this the future direction for silicon valley and the united states as a whole?Interesting case to say the least. What does everyone think about this?",

In this respect, there is no difference between selling directly on Amazon compared to going through a retail store. If Amazon has raised their prices because of the shortfall caused by the new law, Maybe, then more power to them.",

It's great that California detected the trend and taking actions accordingly. It's their practice to create products under the brand name of Amazon Basics and sell it at a low price to capture the market. Once they capture the majority percentage of sales in the market, they start increasing price. That's how they play the game. I believe California government is doing the right thing.",

      "body": "A free market competition where the market in California feels competitive because the prices on Amazon are much cheaper while the images and quality of goods have the same strength. This is not only happening in big companies, mostly triggered by the rise of imported goods with similar duplication and sold at relatively cheap prices, even much cheaper. So that consumers are interested because the value set is much different. The global market competition system is almost the same as other micro markets. Let's say a market with a Chinese supplier of duplicate goods has a low selling point. This makes consumers unable to distinguish between genuine and fake goods, especially if the goods are on Amazon, which is the largest marketplace platform in the world.A little story, I am a reseller (third party) in the biggest marketplace in my country, which is selling goods at low prices by shops/suppliers (I only act as an affiliate). Indeed, in terms of fixing the price, we are given the freedom as long as we get from one item x around 1-$2 x 100 items. Only selling pictures and taking care of the goods is the supplier's job.",

But the future can really change quickly if people realize what is actually happening in the market, and if government support the local products more then surely the market will come back to neutral again.Another reason why prices are getting higher is because of drop shipping which is new business idea and lot of people engaging in it, they simply buy from a seller and sell it back again on the platform.",

I think this is an interesting experiment that should help inform consumers, and sellers. Thanks to the Internet, the cost of selling goods is more transparent than ever.There's likely motives in play, of that I am pretty sure because Amazon is a pretty big deal and I think that there's enough people that Amazon has good terms with that they go towards this case. Good competition is out of the picture, it's unlikely that we are going to see any competition against Amazon, they're essentially a monopoly in e-commerce.Amazon has caused thousands of job losses around the world, which is a much larger number than the jobs it created. It may have become easier for small sellers to sell their products through Amazon, but this has created a real jobs crisis after the company itself manufactures many products on its own and controls the entire distribution process.I did not expect any party to cancel its activity contracts locally due to the company's popularity and the huge number of its clients. On the other hand, I do not know if Amazon's competitors are able to fulfill the state's needs with the same smoothness and ease that it was with Amazon.",

      "body": "I'm open to the argument that amazon might have a monopoly in local markets because of the wholesale/online advantage, which might require some level of regulation. Except the tyrants in California decided to lockdown their entire economy during COVID and implement business killing regulations which allowed Amazon to drink up the consumer base when small businesses couldn't adhere to the COVID regulations. Combine this with inflation, I'm sure it would appear the higher prices are a result of corporate monopoly and not anti-competition government policy.Seems on par for California to blame the businesses for their own incompetence. Somehow they're still confused as to why they're leaving.",

It is clear that Amazon has been using its market power to stifle competition and keep prices artificially high. This is detrimental to consumers and is a clear violation of antitrust laws.Hopefully, we will see some real regulations after this lawsuit else it will be frivolous and futile.",

I can say with full confidence that the arrival of Amazon helped to lower prices for 99% of the products and to remove the middle-men.

There were countless invasions of third world nations, which resulted in military expenses of trillions of USD.
