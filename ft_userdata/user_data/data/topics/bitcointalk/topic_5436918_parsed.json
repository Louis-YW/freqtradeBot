Some examples include:Covenants: This proposal would allow for the creation of smart contracts that can be enforced by the Bitcoin network, but some critics argue that it would introduce too much complexity and could be used for malicious purposes.Drivechains: This proposal would allow for the creation of sidechains that are pegged to the value of Bitcoin, but some critics argue that it would introduce too much centralization and could be used to attack the Bitcoin network.TARO (on LN): Some criticisms of this protocol are that it is not a true layer 2 solution, it introduces more centralization, and it could be used to attack the network.Critics to LN and Liquid: Some people argue that these networks are not true layer 2 solutions, they introduce more centralization, and they could be used to attack the Bitcoin networkIt's important to note that these are just a few examples and there are many different proposals being discussed within the Bitcoin community. Some people have strong opinions on these proposals, both positive and negative. It's important for people with technical knowledge to openly debate the pros and cons of these proposals so that lay people can be more informed and make decisions.As you pointed out, it's important for the bitcoin community to be vigilant and cautious about changes to the protocol, especially those that could potentially harm Bitcoin in the long run.

I think the community cares a great deal in which direction Bitcoin goes. If the community didn't care as much, I don't think we'd have as much discussion as we do here. However, the Bitcoin community is much larger than what we've got here, and there's constant discussions on how we can improve it. They might not be right, but you can see that people are motivated to improve Bitcoin. On the flip side, that also means people don't want to see the wrong decisions made. Ultimately, when it comes to big changes, and therefore hard forks the people get to decide what they want to adopt, and what they don't.

(Bitcoin BTC eventually came out on top.... and we stayed in good hands)  Division isn't always a bad thing. It means, that all alternatives are being considered. It's those with the strongest argument or merit to their idea that should succeed. It means, we haven't got just a handful of people making the decisions, but hundreds or thousands of people contributing to the future of development. I would rather have a debate when it comes to important changes, so that all angles are considered, than having a one way discussion where no one else proposes any other ideas.",

IMO in the long run ETH users will come to a conclusion that this was a bad idea and it will cost them some money if they hold these tokens. Probably second on that list would be what BCH was pushing which was a fork and block size change that would result in abandoning the current chain that we're in.

There will be less conflict and more harmony if everyone is proposing ideas that are according to the set principles the Bitcoin system is based on. If everyone agrees that this is not about changing or deviating from the hard-coded rules Bitcoin is built on participants can then harmoniously build applications within the set boundaries.And conflicts will drastically reduce if there is well defined rule every activity is based on.
