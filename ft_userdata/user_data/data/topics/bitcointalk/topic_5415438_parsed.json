  "content": "I have a BTC lighting channel that's DISCONNECTED. I've never closed a BTC lightning channel before and want to know how to recover the unspent funds. I've looked far and wide, but can't find anything useful that explains this. I see \"Force-close channel\" as an option, but is that safe to use? And if so, how long does it usually take to recover those funds?Background: I've had an open BTC lightning channel with coingate for almost two years that I've been making a monthly subscription payment from. Electrum hasn't been running for probably a week. In the meantime coingate has apparently quietly withdrawn from using the lightning network--the option to pay invoices with the lightning wallet has been removed from their interface, they haven't responded to queries about it (so far), and I guess they've closed their end of lightning channels (or whatever they've done has caused an electrum indication of DISCONNECTED on my end).Thank you for your help,Chris",

How do I know if the backup file it creates uses a non-static backup? Or, what does it mean that the backup is \"non-static\"? The application says that the channel type is STATIC_REMOTEKEY. There's also notation that says \"This channel cannot be recovered from seed. You must manually back it up.\" Do any of things definitively tell you if it is of the non-\"safe\" type for performing a force close?Is there any advantage, since the channel connection is now active, in force-closing the channel, upgrading, and then establishing a new channel?Thank you again for your help,Chris",
