Experience will make you form your own opinion and it seems that your opinion based on your experience is that there's chance that you can profit from gambling or even make it as a means to make serious and steady money but experience also tells other people that it's also the opposite, that you can't do it because the odds and chances in the games are all in the favor of the house and there's more losers statistics wise in gambling than winners so with a little common sense, it can be inferred that you can't make a consistent money with gambling. Is your term for profitable only fitting with the players or does it include the whole gambling industry? If it's the latter then yes, gambling is a the most profitable industry out there because of how much money there is that many people lose in slots, roulettes, card games and more but if it's players I don't think so.",

Even if you play same game as those who win constantly do but it doesn't mean you will win as well. In life, what works for others may not necessarily work for you and no matter how successful someone becomes in gambling it is still accompanied with luck and in this life people needs to stick to what works for them and not to copy what others are doing.Gambling isn't that bad as some people paints it to be it's just the nature at which some person takes it that makes it appear like a bad habit. But however, gambling shouldn't be used as a skill or a career as even if you're recording success in it you still need to be doing other works that will fetch you income then you can continue your gambling but for someone who isn't that lucky in winning, it is advisable for such person to play with caution.",

I have been gambling since February 2014 and I know a lot about gambling when it comes to profit and loss. It is good to let people know the bad side. Nobody is discouraging gambling, but newbies should know that gambling is not a way of earning income, this is where the addiction starts. As for most people, the success in gambling is not actually the money you make from it, it is what you achieved from it and a way you will be able to avoid losses with the money you can not afford to lose by not using such money to gamble.",

Secondly, you need to make a difference between what profits making and consistency in making such profits vs what jackpot means. Yes is possible to win millions of dollars from a $1 stake game and become a jackpot winner of all time. But there is no way that you can repeat the same formula consistently and still record that winning which is what consistent profits are all about, Â your ability to make profits all the time, Â and for sure if you are an active gambler as you proclaimed then you already know from your personal experience how risky it is to take gambling as a mean to make consistent profits.",

Or do you think anyone would want to log into their account and start to lose money when theyâre are aware that a certain strategy could help them avoid losing a single dime? I agree that they are strategy to help minimize losses but that does not still guarantee success in gambling.",

It makes me question whether these individuals are truly involved in gambling or if they're posting without the real experiences and knowledge. Op it seems you are the one misunderstanding the entire argument about profit making in gambling.Yes! People can make profit in gambling if they are lucky. What people like myself is debating against in such arguments is when the word consistent  is attached to theÂ  idea ofÂ  profit making in gambling. Except the gambler is a cheater or has collaboration with the casino that he should be winning consistently making profits each time he comes around to gamble. There's nothing like consistent profit making but there's profit making but not consistent...

Of course there are people that have made success in gambling but it wasn't out of a consistent profit making, it could be through a one time lucky big win that became a life changer for them. The strategies of staying discipline etc etc only help in preventing the gambler from addiction, excessive losses and not that it's an assurance for profit making. You can be disciplined in all ramifications of a healthy gambling lifestyle buy yet haven't made a single win in all your time of gambling. Haven't you heard of stories of gamblers saying they have never experienced a winning before be it a small or big sum, since they started gambling.QuoteIf you're someone who doesn't believe anyone can be profitable in gambling, you might as well consider yourself not welcome in this thread.

However, I am sharing some strategies that I have used and won. Firstly I bet against a strong team which can be guaranteed. I didn't bet on every match, I just bet on the team to win. I didn't participate in the bet from the start of the game, I participated in the bet in the middle of the game. And especially I participate in bets with funds like 1 mBTC, I never participate in bets with more dollars. This is my strategy but I take part in betting with a healthy mind and keep myself safe. My request to all please never participate in betting while drunk.",

In 3...2...1... go!My opinion is that you are particularly not correct but not entirely wrong.If it's as easy as you narrated it, then those who have been battling to earn consistently without giving up on gambling for over a decade would have had good success by now. Gambling is not as you think, it's not such that can be fixed in a way or that a piece of specific advice can take care of the situation of everyone. There are people who are suffering from gambling and its addiction due to your advice and belief, they would have thought there must be a secret of gambling. They would now believe this as an avenue to make consistent money if they play continuously without a stop and also have the belief if they learn more about it until they achieve their goal.But in reality, they are merely wasting money and getting more addicted to it. While some will make consistent money simply because they are good in their game or they are merely lucky. The kind of games we play matters to the consistent earnings too, but still, only a very few would be able to make money consistently from gambling, and no matter how others try, they will not be able to achieve that status. This should be obvious all around you as the people you see that has gambled for years should have hinted you that gambling is not easy. People shouldn't also be desperate about making money in gambling, because if they do, it will never end well for them. That's how it has always been.",
