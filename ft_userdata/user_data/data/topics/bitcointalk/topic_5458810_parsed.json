What I thought was that the bet has been decided when immediately the match finished and nothing will alter that. We have different gambling sites with some changes in their terms of service, maybe some gambling site may include it that if the match was later cancelled and to be replayed if the loser was later declared the winner, that they will deducted the money from their customers and settle people thought to be the loser, but I do not think that is how it works on gambling sites. Once a match is finished, the bet is settled without exception. If the match result is later altered after the match has finished, non of the gambling site business.",

In a case where a football game has been settled and the cash out showed up in a player's account and he withdraws only to find out that the game went through some panel either because of some bad officiating and irregularities then rematch was order and it happens that the winner became the loser whilst the casino had already paid out profit based on the old decision whereas the bettor had already withdrawn his winning, is a serious issue. If this was written on the ToS then the casino have to do the needful to pay the second winner but depending on how much winning the first winner may not return to the casino if it is a very big win.",

If there are gamblers who were mistakenly paid, the site will deduct the excess amount from their balance, while those who lost will be paid their winnings. However, this can be a critical issue because some gamblers who have already withdrawn their winnings might not be willing to deposit more funds if they know their balance will be deducted. In such cases, I believe the gambling site will bear the losses as they are responsible for paying the winners.",

However, it looks like the payout will be given some time after the winner of the match results is known. if there is a change in results due to situations, it seems that it is no longer the responsibility of the casino, because the results have already been published and the payout has been given. If the casino had to pay based on the 2nd result, surely they would pay using their own money, and this sort of thing is not possible. The only way is to withdraw the balance that was sent to the winner on the 1st decision and sent it to the winner on the 2nd decision.",

The most logical path here is to just get it on with, and refund the wins of the players who made a bet to Betboom and give it to Tundra, although of course, there would be issues that would come around considering that they already made the bet. I'm not sure as to what would happen or what other casinos would do in this type of situation, but I'm guessing it's either of these two choices: 1. They give both parties the win, in which case everyone would be happy but the casino would suffer immediate losses which they can probably gain anyway in a day or two, a whole week if they are unlucky. 2. They don't do anything and carry on with their lives, in that case people will definitely bang on their door to do something especially those who made bets to Tundra since they deserve the win in a sense. Among these choices the best one would be the former, except for the temporary losses they could recuperate anyway especially if they are a reputable casino, this act of honesty and integrity could paint them in a great light to gamblers, resulting to more revenue for them as these people will surely recommend the casino to their peers.",

Another solution is just voiding all the bets on that game. If some gamblers are already paid for their winning ticket then just take back whatever the gambling platform gave them and give back their betting amount. I mean, it will also not be fair for them because they also thought they already won it. But this is more of a heartache for those who lost the bet but after 24 hours will know they should actually be in profit. Will they accept a \"voided\" result instead? I will. As long as I get my money back. That's better than a loss and I will not even fight telling it should be a win. I'm satisfied with just the money I bet to be sent back to me.",

The terms of service will be the best document to settle this controversy. But if the ToS is silent in this matter, there should be a place for compromise, maybe the new and old winners should accept half payments. But if the first winner has absconded, the casino and the new winners would have to find a common ground to settle this issue. The first winner can just withdraw his funds and stop visiting the casino if he is asked to refund the win. Most reputable casinos will devise a way to settle this issue but others might find it difficult to handle it. Some casinos pay 24 hours after a win. This clause would have limited the consequences of this change of result.",

There are gambling platforms that give refunds to their users, some still maintain the results of the previous match, even if the results change in the end. Because losses will certainly be experienced by both parties, whether it's the gambling platform or the user. If the gambling platform returns, they will definitely make payments twice, which could make them lose. Or if they keep their previous results, maybe they have nothing to lose but will receive protests from users and users may be reluctant to play again on that platform. So cases like this will usually be troublesome for gambling platforms.",
