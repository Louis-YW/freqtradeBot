  "content": "Bitcoin Price is seems like crashing !Literally, Bitcoin price is not crashing because there are so many Bitcoin investors are selling their Bitcoins, it is also is not that there are no body buying the Bitcoins; but factually few Bitcoin Exchanges manipulating the Bitcoin price by selling more than 6 millions Bitcoins of their trusted investors, which they hold on. Because these few Bitcoin Exchanges have become too much greedy that they want to cash out on other people's Bitcoin they hold on behalf of theirs trusted clients. When they have the power to manipulate the Bitcoin price by selling of 6 millions Bitcoins over the last 3 months and when the price fell down they will buy back again cheaper. They will make a profits over  600% after they buy back.  Bitcoin Exchanges are for trading Bitcoin only, any investors suppose not to trust those Bitcoin Exchanges to keep their Bitcoins in their Exchanges.  It is time for individuals investors to transfer all their Bitcoins from those Bitcoin Exchanges to their own private Wattet. If all their clients follow my instructions then the Bitcoin price will return back to its normal patern of growing.",
