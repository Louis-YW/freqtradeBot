Perhaps, you won't be successful if you have made this plan. You have created two more threads recently by asking similar thing. I don't see the reason of doing it. You have the option to edit your previous topic and ask for the information there. Your enquiries are almost same1. Can you suggest a crypto sportsbook with video streaming of sporting events?2.

Are they accept BTC upon depositing? I rather want to bet on sportsbet.io than on this gambling casino which I don't know about. If you can give more insight much better.",

Broadcasting site also have their own frequency standard, I don’t know if this is all about gambling but to OP, we can’t help you if you only provide this kind of information, better to be more specific and well detailed next time so we can also know if you are on the right thread. Streaming speed will also depends on your internet connection, this can be a big thing and if still having trouble, better to check your connections first.",

Maybe OP is trying to make precise predictions on live betting.The user you are replying is kind of promoting his own by the looks of his username. Obviously OP is new here and is looking for sportsbetting site like aiscore.com. He must be betting there but this aiscore.com is not for crypto. A few more days of going back in the forum, OP will learn to find the list of sportsbook and even compare them all.

It also depends on how fast the book confirms bets. Yeah, his intention is clear here. But he isn't going to get the success in it. The bookmakers depends on their odds provider. The odds provider close the betting option as soon as possible when there is significant changes in a sports event. Then they update and enable the betting option after few seconds. The odds provider do these things carefully and very quickly. It won't be easy to beat the odds provider by getting faster information. Moreover, bookmaker will block the user account if anyone can do it.",
