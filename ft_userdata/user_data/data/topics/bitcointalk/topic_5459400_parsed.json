Last (First*) few bytes are checksum and there is a fixed number of words in Electrum wordlist. For the maximum security, I wouldn't generate the multisig using the three seeds at the same time on the same computer. Rather, I would get the master public key and combine them to get the MultiSig wallet and compare their addresses. You have to import each seed into separate computers and derive the master public key individually. I'm assuming that you're able to do this, given that this would be the ideal setup for a secure airgapped multisig.",

Since OP has generated the seed phrases using electrum and they are not BIP39, the checksum isn't the last few bytes. Instead of having a checksum in the way a BIP39 seed phrase is generated, electrum hashes the words and then checks if the result matches any of the correct versions numbers.",

Even if the addresses are correct, the multisig wallet is properly setup. If there is a mistake in the setup, likely the wallet will not be created at all.

Or some combination?How are you planning to sign it with second seed phrase? Are you importing that seed phrase in to a clean device alongside the two other xpubs? Again, where are your xpubs backed up?I would not create a transaction at all. What I would do instead would be to access each seed phrase back up individually, use each back up to derive the necessary xpub, then take all three xpubs together and recover a watch only copy of your multi-sig. If the addresses match up, then your seed phrases are correct.I would also point out that creating a multi-sig on a single device negates the whole point of a multi-sig, which is to remove a single point of failure.",

Though you could mistype one or two of the words and still be able to recover it since they are still using the same fixed wordlist. If you miss out a word or two, that's still fine. You can't get the correct versioning without a few specific phrases which would automatically eliminate most of the seeds without the need for further key derivation.Jumbling them up sounds quite intentional, so that shouldn't be too much of an issue.",
