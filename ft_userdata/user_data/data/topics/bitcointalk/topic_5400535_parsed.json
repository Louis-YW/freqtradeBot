We will get to see that happen.The two kings of the market are plunging and that truly affected the market as a whole. I think we're now getting to the point that many alts will be eliminated.And those that are strong will remain to be the best and eventually many of those that have good market cap will lose volume despite that. Which will be making them harder to trade and majority of the investors shall remain to bitcoin, ethereum and other top and good altcoins.",

Because as you can see most altcoins now are in red mark, it's not just Bitcoin and Ethereum that was hit by the dump session and you cannot blame it all on them. Blame it on the investors, the whales, the manipulators, or wherever you want to point it but not at the two top coins which are just moving according to what the market tells. About the future of Ethereum, we don't know that yet.",

Hmmm..., i agree with you, PoS looks like it will have a bad impact on prices even though the Ethereum network will improve.In the future we can only hope that crypto adoption will be more widespread and also hopefully more people will become aware of this crypto, if adoption increases, the MC in the market will also increase.",

It will be as the community and investors will decide. But there is also a common opinion, that the transition to PoS won't happen for a long time, it will be a long story. Also, we can't rule out a split in the community and the formation of a hardfork, where there will be PoW ETH and PoS ETH. There is a huge investment in ETH mining and it will not end that easily.",

If BTC will drop, for sure other altcoins will follow and most likely we noticed it in the market.ETH has gained huge community support and I don't think there is no one who will easily break it that cause dropping in the price. No one will leave ETH it has a good foundation now and supported the community, only the community will decide which they preferred.",

It's not like that, we are in a bear cycle, so all the price are going to be down, including BTC and ETH and it's going to be a lot of bleeding in the street.If you are new here, then you haven't seen the bloodbath in 2018-2019 wherein ETH went down below $100. If my memory serves me right, its about $80k. So that is a huge dump from their last all time high of less than a $1k.So the best thing to do is have a patience, learn how to deal with the bear market and buy when the price is on a dip because they are cheap.",

Altcoins is not losing any value and altcoins is what cause cryptocurrency market competitive and the thing is that altcoins is coming out of different and the value is different from each other, people began to dislike altcoins and don't want to invest in them because of many of them do not progress in the market, but for altcoins to leave market is not going to happen because Ethereum is the chairman of altcoins and without Ethereum dies altcoins will not die",

Looking to the extent of the bear season, it is to expect that the dumping of prices is what to see until the moment that it was over ( yet we never know when). Indeed, becoming patient is simply encouraging to all of us. It wasn't a weird feeling of being doubtful and worried but we need to control this emotion as this could be the reason for more dumps and our losses. While people know how to hold, that absolutely helps the prices won't go like the 2018-2019 bear season.",

It's true that if they do something, this could be slowed down or at least mitigate and avoid happening or had less impact. Well, we're on the reality that all markets are hard hit because of this war that's happening between Russia and Ukraine. The best solution is for them to have a truce and stop the war wholly and all the markets will react and most investors will have its confidence again.",
