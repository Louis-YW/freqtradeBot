  "content": "hi. I'm a biologist.I love Nature and Bitcoin/Blockchain, and it was interesting to see if there couldbe any way they could benefit each other.Recently I wrote an article on 'Nature + Bitcoin' collaboration.it's kind of sci-fi, and tells a possible futuristic way of Bitcoin evolution.Nature and blockchain could co-exist, live in harmony, and benefit each other. Blockchain could be improved by taking inspiration and power from Nature. And Nature’s wisdom could be organized and efficiently used with the help of the blockchain.Nature is not just a supermarket, but is also a museum. Nature's wisdom is one of the most precious resources we have.We just need to recognize it, organize it efficiently, and let it flow into our systems design.The article tells a story about NatureLand. It is a village populated by animals, endowed with intelligence, and freed from the influence of centralization and money. The main character is a curious and intelligent Hedgehog that traveled between different dimensions to gain knowledge required to built the NatureLand.Even though NatureLand might seem utopian and futuristic to you, a lot of things described there could be built with what we know today.if you have some time and interest, you can take a look:(Nature + Biomimicry + Bitcoin: Mutually Beneficial Partnership)https://hackernoon.com/nature-biomimicry-bitcoin-mutually-beneficial-partnership",
