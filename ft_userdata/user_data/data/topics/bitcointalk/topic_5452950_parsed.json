      "body": "Firstly, I feel sorry for his lost bitcoins; it's really painful for one to lose his earnings to some scammers. I will also want to ask how your friend lost those bitcoins: was it to an online scammer or phishing site, or was it by sending his bitcoin to the wrong address as a result of a clipboard virus or losing access to an online platform? I'm asking to know if there can even be a small opportunity for him to recover his funds.If there is no way for those lost bitcoins to be recovered, the best advice you can give to him is to move on with his life and see those lost funds as things of the past. We can't continue allowing what we lost to hunt us and stop us from seeing greater opportunities ahead. And this time around, he should be very careful with his privacy, security, and the kind of things he should involve himself in, both online and in the office. He should also mind the kind of investment he will engage himself in, and he should not always be tempted by great offers. Greed is one of the things that makes people fall victim to scams most of the time. If one can see some offers that are too good to be true as scams and not opportunities to make money, then the person can actually escape some common scams.",

      "body": "Sorry for his loss but there is no way he can get those bitcoins back. It’s unfortunate your friend had to learn the hard way that there is no shortcut to making money. He is going to have really tough times ahead, and it won’t be easy since he doesn’t have a job and also does not have any savings. The labor market is quite congested right now and finding a good job isn’t easy but it is his only option right now. He should find a job and start saving.",

      "body": "He's better off starting small as a beginner until he's experienced enough to handle higher amount of Bitcoin. Or he could learn first or get someone trustworthy and experienced in Bitcoin for guidance if he chooses to start big.I hope he doesn't give up now. He may try again with small amount or learn how to use Bitcoin safely before buying more. I think he will succeed through a qualified guardian or through necessary knowledge.",

      "body": "If your friend lost his Bitcoin through scam, then it's obviously his fault. Although you did not tell us how he got scammed,Quote from: Sakanwa on May 16, 2023, 03:03:03 PMA friend said to me that he lost all is his bitcoin and I asked him how and he said he was scammed and has never doing any savings and just join as of 2months backDo you mean he has no savings apart from the Bitcoin? If yes, then it is the wrong approach to investing in Bitcoin. On every passing day, we humans always have one need or another, and it is very important to keep some fiat money so that one can use it to settle our needs, should any arise. Just advise him not to lose faith in wanting to invest in Bitcoin again, but rather teach him all the security measures you have learned so far on how to safely protect your Bitcoin and also how to protect yourself against some scammers. The worst thing that could happen is for him to repeat the mistake of being scammed a second time. Also, when investing in Bitcoin, he should save some fiat in case of needs and emergencies, and then he can invest the rest that he wishes to invest in Bitcoin.",
