      "body": "We are usually going to see each country to have their stable coins and they're called the CBDCs or the Central bank digital currencies.

I don't know what's on their head and they keep attaching it to the crypto market.Maybe we'll get pairs of these CBDCs to buy for Bitcoin and that's going to be another source for Bitcoin to pump and get more demand.",
