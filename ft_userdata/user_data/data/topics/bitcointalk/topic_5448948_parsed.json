  "content": "Sometimes, it is better not to be informed than to have a half baked information. I have known of multi sig wallet, but I never knew about its core usefulness. Today, I searched the internet on how to have a joint Bitcoin account. I thought it won't be possible or something like that doesn't exist. Since there is no harm in trying, I still searched, and I was surprised to see the real concept of multi sig wallet. 1. What I do on Binance P2P when buying a coin can be done by three or more people who don't even know one another with a multi sig wallet.2. Instead of spending money for hardware wallets, I can actually use three or more devices to save and secure my coins, especially if one is air gapped or I use a paper wallet.3. In the case of a joint project, this system can be used to secure the project funds.There are some drawbacks, like one losingÂ  two of the three devices simultaneously or one of the signatories conniving with the other to cheat the other. Every system has its drawback, but I believe the advantages overweight the disadvantages for this multi sig.The essence of this post is not to explain how multi sig works because I know there are experts with years of experience who are into it.THE PURPOSE of this post is to have two people who would help me practice this. Please, I want to practice this, and I don't have a bitcoin enthusiast around me. This could help me to avoid a bank joint account when I marry by next year.Please, I don't know how much it will require to test it, but I'll provide the coins.Also, it is said that one device will first initiate the transaction before others will join.I will download electrum, because it was recommended. How does the signing and signatories work?",

You can set up a multi-sig wallet on your own with three different Electrum wallets on the same device. Doing so removes much of the benefit of the multi-sig wallet (since all three wallets are on the same device, so the additional security gained over a single sig wallet is very minimal), but it is sufficient for testing purposes so you can learn how it works.",

The concept of the third party has defeated the idea of decentralization.Â  But humans are difficult to be trusted, even with Binance centralized and monitored system, there is still substantial amount of scam going on.

Please point me to it.Bisq is a great example of a decentralized exchange which utilizes multi-sigs like this.Their old system used a 2-of-3 multi-sig, where one key was held by each of the buyer, the seller, and Bisq themselves. All coins being traded, plus a security deposit from both parties, were deposited to this multi-sig escrow. Once the fiat trade was complete, buyer and seller would sign to release the coins to the appropriate party and return the security deposits to both parties. If there was a dispute, Bisq could step in and sign with one of the trading parties to release the funds.Now they've transitioned to a 2-of-2 multi-sig between buyer and seller only, without Bisq having a private key at all. The system is otherwise the same as above, but now additionally both parties also sign a timelocked transaction which empties the multi-sig in to the Bisq DAO, which can be broadcast after the timelock expires in the event of a dispute.",

Thanks for this.I have downloaded the Bisq exchange and did my initial set up. I am so much relaxed and comfortable on reading that Bisq is an Open source and decentralized. I also read what you said above on the Bisq website( should I call it a website? Because Bisq said it's not a company but a code)Quote Each trader must lock bitcoin in a multisignature escrow until the trade is completeâthis is part of what makes trading on Bisq highly secure.QuoteBisq does not hold any bitcoin. All bitcoin used for trading is held in 2-of-2 multisignature addresses controlled solely by the trading peers themselves.Is Bisq running on Bitcoin network? Because as Bisq was launching I saw these;Connecting to Bitcoin network...Synchronising with Bitcoin Mainnet (via Tor)...I also want to ask. Since I now have my backup and seed phrase saved, amÂ  I free to use Bisq as a personal wallet?Since there is no KYC, if illegal activities are carried out on Bisq, is there a way government will trace it since Bisq doesn't have a CEO and not centralized ?Finally,Â  Why do most people not use this type of system that guarantees privacy, rather many people troop into centralized exchanges like Binance and even use it as wallets. I mean, without this forum, I wouldn't have knownÂ  an exchange called Bisq.",

Even if they take down the Bisq websites, then individual users can still run the Bisq client.

People are too lazy to use the slightly more complex Bisq over somewhere like Binance, even although using Binance gives them absolutely zero security, zero privacy, zero ownership of their coins, and zero protection against scams.

But then there could be a changeÂ  in the future. There are people cross carpeting.For instance, I have been a centralized guy since I know about cryptocurrency but now I am trying to join the decentralized people. But it is so difficult for people who already knows and enjoy decentralization and privacy to cross over to centralization. That is a big plus.I feel regret now because the few people I introduced to cryptocurrency, the first place I took them to is Binance and they made account and KYC, they buy coins and sell and make profits and they are happy at me and with themselves. But I now feel like I lead them through the wrong part. It is not totally my fault, but I acted according to the information available to me as at then.",

I had to alternatively type in the seed phrase from my mobile to the laptop and that served as the master key.At the end of the process, the address in my phone was same as the one on the laptop.

Hopefully most, but I doubt the overwhelming majority backs up master public keys in paper. Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on April 16, 2023, 11:14:13 AMGreed and laziness are the main ones.I get the latter, but why greed? It comes more expensive to use Binance, unless we take into account the time that a complete newbie has to spend to learn how to use a free software like that.Edit: Okay, I get what you mean. I think the main reason newbies begin with Binance is reputation. You will not prefer to begin your journey with a peer-to-peer network, if you don't understand how that works; instead, you will pick the first exchange Google will return you, according to reviews. Binance is more time consuming for a competent user, but I'm not so sure for a complete newbie. Especially in an Internet market where everything is done in custodial manner (i.e., Amazon, Ebay etc.).",

Someone's willingness to switch from a CEX to a DEX will greatly depend on the success they had with the former. Usually when something works all right, people will keep using it expecting the same or better results. OP's friends made profit on Binance. There is a great chance they will now view Binance as something positive that is worth using because of the returns. On the other hand, it's easier to change the mindset of someone who had a negative experience. OP can always try though.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on April 24, 2023, 04:38:14 PMI think the main reason newbies begin with Binance is reputation.

Exactly. With marketing and advertising, you will come to learn about Binance and similar big names sooner or later. That's not going to happen with Bisq, Peach Bitcoin, AtomicDEX, etc. Keywords like \"crypto exchange\" are much more popular than \"decentralized crypto exchange\", so CEXs always have a head start.",
