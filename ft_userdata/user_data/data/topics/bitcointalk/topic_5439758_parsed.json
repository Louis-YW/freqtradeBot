  "content": "[PRE-ORDER] GBG Block erupter “Glass bell” - A new one of kind bitcoin theme collectible@gbianchi and me  @bitbollo  are delighted to present a new bitcoin theme collectible called: “GBG Block Erupter”(two images taken from the test... yes we have tried to realize an \"antminer\" version  not for sell on this topic  )Essentially, as you can see from the photo, this is a glass bell, with a base printed in 3d.The base has a layer printed with UV filament! See below images of production and base produced... Inside the bell, there is a precious  “ASIC Minerblock erupter USB” that is part of our forum and part of the history of bitcoin mining. These are still working! But of course we suggest to not use for mining etc etc...Each item will be linked to a public key (address loaded by the seller with 0,001 btc) and it will be accompanied by a paper certificate.Moreover, what is “new”... we have implemented a system that allows users to track ownership of this item by using blockchain and OP_Return function: for this step please check the this topic with all details. Starting from today, we are collecting pre-orders for this item. Only 11 items would be initially realized and released in the “First series”. Please note only 08 11 items are available! Book your favorite number !Base would be printed in green or red + a small layer reacting to UV ![Of course, if there is “enough” interest by collectors we can implement in the future a second series or even produce “glass bell” also for other collectibles...just send a DM or reply here]Price of collectible = 0.01 BTC [loaded with 0.001 btc]Shipment will be done starting from MARCH 2023 ---> Items will be shipped from ITALY (EU)(Fees to be payed by buyer)Price for shipment in EU/UK/Emirates/Philippine/Morocco = 40 euroPrice for shipment USA/Japan/Brasil/Argetina = 45 euroPrice for shipment in Russia/Australia/ASIA/Perù = 50 euroPrice for shipment Oceania/Uruguay = 60 euroPayment are accepted only in bitcoin on this address: bc1qm9wnwsgy52jdefvm5g4w72lxqep5d9ks4gq62pEscrow available at buyer expense.",

      "body": "How does the new system work?Each collectible (each glass-bell) is provided with a public address printed directly on the item! This public address is provided directly from the buyer.With this system, the collector owns the private key (of course) and in case s/he wants to sell the item he is required to prove the ownership by signing a message.This address will be loaded by the producer.  Transaction used for load will contain in OP_RETURN the basic information about the collectibles (we will see in the next post all these steps in detail). All items loaded by producer can be checked at this address: 1GBG1boyVmsdpqsfYHhY1mbDKdZ7TGKrEwOnly 00/10 has been loaded with tBTC and can be verified here: mfxNrbFyANf2tuppL9f2v78kKT3ooV69eThttps://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/63831e97d33af308e02bbdbb50eeeac4b828e5af3559139f0d6e3fd8a8baa7d7?expandIf the original owner of the item decides to sell, first of all... he must be able to sign a message to confirm he owns the private key. . At this point new buyer could conclude the transaction (always escrow is recommended)Once received by the new owner, the original owner will send the amount of btc to the address provided by the new buyer!Using blockchain explorer that allow to check OP_RETURN functions it will become possible explore the previous passage and verify the owners of the item. Passages of properties between customers take place through btc normal transactions!To avoid any kind of fraud (in general not only applied to this item) a paper certificate is provided. Each item has been printed with a small layer UV and the original address is printed on the item. In any case, only the owner (or subsequent owner) of this bitcoin could be confirm to have the original ITEM! edit: producer address update... sorry for this mistake...",
