  "content": "Nigeria is at her worst state after the civil war. From history, the same things that lead to the avoidable civil war that claimed the lives of over 3 million people from the then Eastern Nigeria are all happening all over again. The 2023 general elections have created so much hates and animosity in the country. It is rather unfortunate that politicians have resorted to tribalism and bigotry as a means of achieving their political ambitions at the expense of our peace and unity. So worrisom is the fact that there is open confrontations along tribal lines. How did we really get here? Can anything be done to change this trend? What does the future hold for a country like ours where people are treated or judged along tribal lines?",

Forgetting sae their family members and friends don marry and born pikin with other tribes. As this our country d so, na politician keep am like this. Na them the cause this ethnicity havoc wey d happen for election time. Em d too unfortunate sae we Nigerians allowed our politicians to be messing around with the unity of this country for long. One day all this ethnic havoc go backfire at them. Thank God sae we Nigerians are getting wiser of not to be used for the disunity of this country. Na better Nigeria wey d fight for. Irrespective of the tribe, religion or belief",

      "body": "It's indeed a worrisome, because if something is not done urgently it may lead to another civil war again, because things are get out of hand about this tribalism and marginalization,On how we get here,is when someone tribes believe that we are one Nigeria and have the mindset of taking things common, not knowing that some other tribes have a secret agenda. This election have exposed so many things,.We are going into division if everything continue the way it is right now,but Nigerian should have learnt from the past experiences and avoid this kind of hatred and tribalism.and All this was cause by our politicians as a result of bad leadership in the country..",

This thread is entirely election-related and therefore does not qualify as a topic. Topics like this will only fuel hate speech, and we do not want what is happening on Twitter NG to happen on the forum.___________________++++++++++____________________WE understand that everyone is pushing to support the local board but we must also be ruthless to some extent not not allow the place turn to spam hub, activity farming land, and \"how to post\" hub. OP I'm surprised this thread is still open",
