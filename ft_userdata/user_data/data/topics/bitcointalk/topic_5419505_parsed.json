Maybe but its rarely to find a qr code for payment can somehow associated with such scam links. If there was a indirect to another site you should find it suspicious but if you are using a physical store which are well establish I doubt it will be risky to use crypto payment. But make sure always you are dealing with a legit party.",

I don’t think you can get hacked if you scan wallet address barcode. It’s not something to be suspicious of, I prefer scanning a wallet barcode to typing the address manually, I have also discovered copy and paste isn’t that safe either as  your clipboard may be compromised, you stand the risk of the digits of your bitcoin address being changed. It’s best you make it a habit to double check the wallet address before making transactions.",

Let's say the stores are actually honest and trusted, but there's a scammer who change the real barcode with the scam barcode, obviously the stores has a CCTV and it can be used to track the scammer. I will say it's a tiny chance you can get scammed by scam barcode, it's better to check the URL barcode first if you in doubt.Quote from: Zilon on November 05, 2022, 11:18:10 AM Guideliness to avoid QR Code Security Threats Install an Antivirus for Additional Security Enable Two-Factor Authentication on Your walletsTurn Off Live Location Keep Your Wallet UpdatedSource:Lol, this isn't a solution to avoid QR code scam, actually it doesn't help anything.

I'm fine with the QR code when paying, but I really need to make sure everything is correct before proceeding with the payment. The same thing you need to do when you make a payment with a QR code so you can avoid mistakes.

Like @Solosanz said it's more secured to use QR code in stores as it'll be easier to catch the criminal that tends to change their QR code to a malicious one. However, scanning a random Qr code is not advisable because of “quishing and QRLjacking\" these two scam techniques are used by cyber criminals to redirect victims into a phishing site after scanning a QR code and trick victims to scan false QRL different from the real one. Once the QRL is scanned it'll retrieve your password and the device will be hijacked. “ Under the right circumstances, hackers can even use QR codes to initiate a payment from the user's device or force the device to join a certain wifi network\" These are ways to prevent Quishing and QRLJACKINGDo not scan a QR code to receive moneyAvoid logging in to an application or service using a QR codeDo not initiate any payment if you are notified about putting any sensitive information like your private keys after scanning a QR codeAvoid scanning random QR codes from suspicious sourcesDo not scan QR codes that you receive via email from unknown sourcehttps://www.infoguardsecurity.com/how-cybercriminals-exploit-qr-codes/",

I can't think of different risk when you scan a barcode or a Qr code because no matter how many times you scan the barcode or Qr code the result will always be the same unless the barcode is tampered, changed or edited. If I provide a barcode right now and try to scan it then the result will always be the same. I don't know if this is considered as risk but I'll share it,  I can only say that if there's a malware that can change the information/data when you send a payment either scanning a qr code/barcode or when you copy/paste then there's a risk.",

The difference is, address takes much time to input correctly and even at that, the address could be switched on an already compromised device else, you would do fine and other cases that involves manual writhing of the address, you could get some characters wrong given by its length. Still, ther is more safety in addresses than barcodes.A shifty merchant can’t switch the barcodes or perhaps input a malware so it doesn’t work on the device and you look out for other means but, your device has been infiltrated and head on, the damages can start happening there after.",
