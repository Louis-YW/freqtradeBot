  "content": "I bought this coin from ebay recently... and have been told by a few other collectors that they have also bought this coin.https://www.ebay.com/itm/265678699381https://www.ebay.com/itm/265674236625I tested it with a Sigma Metalytics metal tester... and it comes back as less than 90% silver.. but that may just be the plate, as it doesn't measure on any of the other silver ratings.Just wanted to know if other people have bought this coin...The original was made by Eodguy149 and could be purchased here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5188612Quote from: Eodguy149 on September 29, 2019, 06:13:47 PM210 coins were made total but only the first 50 are pure silver and numbered. Not sure what the other 160 coins were made from, but these ebay ones are not 999...",

No, not marked in any way to indicate 999 silver.I was able to find the original one I bought here on the forum from Eodguy149....It does test as 999 silver.. see belowSo guessing the sales on ebay are the \"other\" 160 coins that are not pure silver..  Contacted the seller to see what they say.Also sent Eodguy149 a PM to see if they can clarify this.",

Was simply an idea we had to incentivize ticket sales for our conference and offer a momento to the speakers who attended the event. We made 50 that were pure silver, they are numbered 1-50 on the edge of the coin. I can't see the edge from any of these pictures on Ebay but that's what you would want to look for. The other 160 were simply silver plated and do not have anything on the edge. Really hope you're able to resolve with the seller!",
