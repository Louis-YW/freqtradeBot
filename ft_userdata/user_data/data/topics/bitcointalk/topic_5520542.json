So yeah, it's getting stronger every 4 year cycle and it's obvious by now that it is too big too fall as there are countries like El Salvador who treat it as legal tender. And then the recent US election wherein Trump was elected based on the strength of him being a pro-Bitcoin candidate and that is enough to push him and win the election, thus the final catalyst for that $100k that we all been waiting to see within the end of the year. Of course, in 2026, we will see another bear market and then the whole \"Bitcoin is dead\" obituaries will be created again.",

Additionally, the decentralized nature is the main factor that makes bitcoin special and this factor has not disappeared even when it is used as an investment. So instead of saying it died when it strayed from its original purpose, why not think that it became more versatile when we can use it in many different cases, not just stopping as a currency? More importantly, it has been and is benefiting us and the world, and that alone proves that bitcoin is on the right track.",

And when the call of the majority tells that the pump is about to happen, you should expect the opposite as well. But that's just a nice observation out there and Bitcoin still does the unexpected so let's hope so that this isn't the indicator yet that we'll see an end for this bull run.

One of my friends will jokingly say that some of the people who punished these Bitcoin obituaries may have died but Bitcoin is still alive and waxing stronger . These obituaries usually increase during the bear season because of the decline in Bitcoin price. Sometimes unfavourable government policies can also necessitate such obituary announcements. I suspect that the ban on Bitcoin mining in China would have given rise to some obituary announcements.",

People now trust bitcoin more. They sone panic sell when they hear a rumour or when they see particular public figures selling large amounts of their coins.More people understand bitcoin now. Before, people just invest without knowing the basics. I understand that there are still people lik that now, but compared to how many they were before, it has reduced a lot. People have seen bitcoin claim back from a heavy fall so even when bitcoin dips these days, people don't panic like they used to.Of course I don't expect a lot of people to talk down on bitcoin during this period. They'll look very foolish calling a thing that's growing dead. But when the bear market comes and bitcoin starts dipping, trust me you'll see a whole lot of \"bitcoin is dead\" talks.",

What I can say is that people reacted that much in the early years, because bitcoin was a new technology that came to change the traditional ways of doing things. So it was only natural for people who felt threatened to react that way back then. Because they lacked the proper knowledge of bitcoin, but now that they are more enlightened about bitcoin, and all their evil thoughts about bitcoin has been defeated. So there are no more lies to feed the people who cares to listen to them about bitcoin, as it has survived many years and still going strong.
