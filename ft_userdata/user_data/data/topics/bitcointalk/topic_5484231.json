Especially since we got etfs now and people are putting BTC into their long term retirement portfolio.What will go extinct are many altcoins however. Many altcoins typically go -90% and then lose another -90% and become irrelevant and extinct. Then usually the exchange delists then coin and eventually all nodes stop and the alt coin is gone completely. Won’t happen to Bitcoin.",

Anyway, what are the chances of bitcoin going extinct? We never know until all the bitcoin is available to be mined; we will never know what will happen next in bitcoin, but as long as the maximum bitcoin to be mined is still not reached, then bitcoin will keep its place and its price, as many more investors are coming and investing in bitcoin, if that's what you mean about bitcoin being instinctive. Many people have wondered how long bitcoin will last, but in reality, we don't have a concrete answer to that; only time can tell what will happen. But as long as bitcoin is there, the important thing is that you maximise its potential for your own benefit. Instead of worrying about bitcoins dimming, why not invest in it?",

But if you’re looking at it at the perspective of maybe people dumping it and other cryptocurrency can emerge thereby sending into extinction I will say know. Currently it doesn’t look like that it will go into extinction just yet because even you look at the time remaining to mine the rest bitcoin that date is way too far and we all know after then many people will still hold on to it bitcoin because it will grow in value.",

I think this strengthens its position and makes it difficult for any new cryptocurrency to surpass its level of adoption.As a long-term asset, bitcoin is less likely to become extinct since, in my opinion, it has developed into a widely accepted store of value and the perception of scarcity.Although it may not completely disappear in our lifetime, we will never be able to predict how bitcoin will fare in the future because people grow tired easily. Therefore, I suppose it really depends on the circumstances facing our future generation.",

But I would say losing 99.999% users is the same as being dead, and we can't exclude that possibility. Right now Bitcoin is relatively popular because the price goes up all the time - what would happen if it was going down instead?",

All these are hard to happen though. What's more probable is that Bitcoin might lose relevance in the far future. Times are always changing. Things are always improving. And it is quite impossible to imagine that Bitcoin will remain relevant for as long as humanity exists. Bitcoin is not perfect to begin with. Something better might come out in the next centuries.",

What is behind bitcoin is not extinct and in my small analysis because the supply is limited and the value to maintain itself in the market is much more likely to happen compared to other coins. No one can generalize the process of Bitcoin's future journey, but people can make predictions for at least the next few years with the assumptions and realities that are happening in Bitcoin today.I'm not thinking about Bitcoin going back to zero, but what I want to do is how I can exploit Bitcoin's potential as long as it can generate profits. Now and in the next few years I am still quite optimistic that bitcoin will be the only best coin in crypto and bitcoin will also be one of the most recommended investments by many people in the future.",

Quote from: satoshi on February 14, 2010, 03:52:23 PMRight.  Otherwise we couldn't have a finite limit of 21 million coins, because there would always need to be some minimum reward for generating.  In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.  I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.Quote from: sunsilk on February 06, 2024, 02:00:58 AMWith that statement from the creator himself just assures that anything can possibly happen.
