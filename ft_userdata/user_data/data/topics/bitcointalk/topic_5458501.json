You should move this to Speculation board where the topic of discussion is about the price of Bitcoin. Don't share such a false news like this because In last 3/4 hours Bitcoin didn't dump under than 31k level. So you should check it again and never rush into creating this kind of fake news again and don't spread rumors in this forum.Here is the 4 hour chart of Bitcoin price:",
