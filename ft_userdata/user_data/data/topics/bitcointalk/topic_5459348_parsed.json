Learn about bitcoin or learn how to navigate through the forum?If you want to do the forum, pick your best learning method and go with it. Spend time everyday learning about bitcoin. Most importantly learning about how to invest right. From experience I have noticed that most people start out by investing in bitcoin then they go back to learn  about it. So learn how to invest right especially risk management.As for the later, read through the threads on the rules guiding members on the forum. The links has already been provided by some users in this thread. You will know what is expected of you as a member of this community.",

I will have to ask you a simple question, which is: what do you mean by how do you start? Do you mean how do you start earning? Or how do you start learning about the forum? For surviving the forum, The forum is a social place where you can be free and be yourself just as in the real world. The rules are not hard, and you will enjoy your journey here very well if you can be able to follow a few simple rules, which are \"Don't Plagiarize\". Don't get yourself involved in creating a lot of low-quality threads with a bunch of copy-and-paste content from online. For now, focus on reading through others threads and opinions and asking questions where necessary. And follow the guidelines of the link provided above and the ones that will come after. For earning, you will first have to know how the forum works before you can start earning from it. Your contribution is what's going to earn you a couple of merits, which will possibly rank you up if your activity is up to a rank, and the more you continue being active, your consistency is surely going to pay off. Then, if you have other skills like programming, graphics, or any other service that you think you can offer, you can also make some little earnings from them by just advertising yourself, and those who will be in need of your service will contact you. You just have to keep a clean profile.",

I can presume from your username you're crypto enthusiast, isn't it?  glad to tell you that you're in the right place. Right from the moment you created your account here, you have already started your journey. The necessary links to guide you have been provided in the previous comment above, it's important you peruse over them, understand and make use of them accordingly.It's important to note, I emboldened text from your post I quoted above which is not clear enough to me. The Forum is not an office to start with, that you'll be thinking of working. It's an avenue to give and receive knowledge. Although some folks are only here to earn some penny by participating in bounties and others but that's clearly a false impression of this forum. It's beyond that and you can choose the purpose your are here for.In case you have any service to offer since you emphasis on working, then you can visit here. But you seem not to attract any client with brand new account who have nothing to show yet. You're welcome to Bitcointalk once again.",

I am confident that you will never be sorry for joining this fantastic forum.Since you were introduced here by your friend, who is a bounty hunter, as you said, I am sure he has explained some basic rules guiding this forum for you, although I can see that you have been provided with so many links that are very useful if you go through them one after another because that is all you need right now.Bounty hunters are accustomed to copying and pasting stuff from social media platforms. I hope your friend informed you that copying and pasting (plagiarism) is not permitted in this forum, and you will be banned if you are caught. As a result, avoid plagiarism because it is a serious offence on this forum.Furthermore, if you focus on making money, you will not learn anything here; therefore, I recommend that you focus on learning everything you can about Bitcoin in order to achieve your aim of joining this community.",

There are pinned post on any board you enter. Do well to read them all as that would guide you on that particular board.There is also local board here where you can meet with your country men and women. There you can enteract and communicate with them at same level. I believe you could learn very fast from them together with the links already given you here by members.Lastly,  you  should focus on growing yourself here first before any other thoughts because only then you can be able to grow very well making valuable contributions and adding more value to the platform by doing so, you can earn merit which will make it possible for you to rank up and earn as you plan to.",

You’re not the first newbie that was introduced to the forum as a means of earning bitcoins, some chose that path and spend all their time here on bounty section while others took the bold step to explore the forum and become a part of it. Since you know about bounties, I’m assuming your friend may have told you half the story and left the important parts out so I’m going to be the one to break the news to you. Bitcointalk is a bitcoin discussion based forum, while members can earn from signature campaigns, bounties and contests, you’d have to first grow your account to a high rank before you can enroll in campaigns. To do that, you need merit, which brings us back to the links given above.",

I believe if you do that, you will be more motivated to learn until you realize that staying in the forum is a lot more fun and exciting while learning a lot about crypto and Bitcoin. And if you have spare money to invest later on, then take some risk too aside from taking part in signature campaigns that are paying a good amount. My only advice is just enjoy the forum, and never be pressured on when to make profits. You will have more opportunities to earn profits later on after you've gained personal knowledge and skills in the forum.",
