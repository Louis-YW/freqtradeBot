They made many purchasing rounds so far and made only one selling round on 22 December 2022, that is posisbly for accounting and tax report.They have been in this market for two market cycles and by going through a bear market in 2022 and 2023, MicroStrategy actually understood more about Bitcoin market cycle and this makes them stronger. If they didn't shake their hands, sell their bitcoin in the last bear market, I believe they won't do it in a next bear market in 2026 and 2027. I am not naive to believe that MicroStrategy will never sell their bitcoins, it's just their marketing saying.",

Well, not $200k, right?In a word, the hype has begun. Everyone wants to invest when bitcoin grows. Bitcoin grows even despite the fact that some investors are liquidating their bitcoin. That is, \"greed\" totally dominates over \"fear\".",

The OP didn't even bother to find out if his telegram message was correct, as he was in a hurry to create a topic and write an obvious conclusion that bitcoin will soon reach one hundred thousand. Unfortunately, people forget that everyone has the Internet, and such news can be left outside the forum, or at least share the real source.",

Ya like I said I think they are doing DCA, but that means buying all the time, and fixed period, rather than as what was posted something about the lines of 'hmm I think we need more green dots'. It to me signals a little bit like they're asking him to buy when he feels like it rather than just setting aside a budget for it every month or every quarter Anyway, big whales, not my area",

Either way, thanks for sharing, I guess that’s the news we were looking for. If it’s just microstrategy then this isn’t really news, to be honest. Yes, the amount they are going to invest in is crazy (in a good shocking way) but we have always known that Michael Saylor was one of the biggest fans of bitcoin and got his company to invest in bitcoin years before even before it was surging like crazy. That’s how you invest. Pick something that seems profitable, buy when it’s cheap, accumulate more, and then take profit once it’s getting valued at extreme prices.",

Although I also believe in Bitcoin and Bitcoin will not fail, but it's not correct to invest in something just because you believe someone invest a lot money in there.

Most of the telegram channel usually use a “trust me bro” format as source to their news. Probably, the owner of the channel is using a tracker for big buys and he created a narrative out of it without researching the identity of the buyer.Honestly, huge buy like this is obviously from institutional investors like Microstrategy, Blackrock and more since that amount of capital can’t be spend by an individual alone on crypto.",

It is still difficult to predict where Bitcoin will go in the next few years. If we look at the case of MicroStrategy, a large holder of Bitcoin, they are constantly accumulating Bitcoin and will continue to do so in the future. If this continues, then a large part of Bitcoin will be added to their possession and at that time, the price of Bitcoin will increase more than the current price. In addition, the number of institutional investors is also increasing all over the world. Due to which the price of Bitcoin is reach to the high movement before the expected time.
