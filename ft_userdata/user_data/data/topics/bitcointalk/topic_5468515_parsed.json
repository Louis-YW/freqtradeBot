Instead of looking at it as a means of making money, players should approach it with the intention of having fun.Casino basically is for fun and entertainment purposes with an added advantage of winning a price. That is why you are asked to gamble responsibly. Casino always have the advantage of making profit because the odds most times falls in their favour so more profit for the casino when gamblers make much loss. Â In some cases, when it happens that casinos are accused of manipulating a game or wrongfully bans or suspends a members account on their platform for some certain reasons, the funds there are all gone and the casinos would not make any refund as this has been the case of many gamblers here. You can check the scam accusations board to see for yourself complaints of gamblers towards their casinos.I have come to realise that the one thing which makes gamblers addicted is the process of chasing their losses. When a gambler makes any games and possibly would want to recover their losses and would go extra miles against their budget making them step their gambling limit per day and in the course of doing that, they keep losing and losing and it turns to another level where the gambler refuses to curtail their excesses and it becomes a case of addiction.",

They are suitable for playing when you feel that luck is on your side and you might make some money for the day.However, there is a more serious aspect to card games and sports. One can apply strategy and careful consideration to make wise decisions. While luck still plays a role, the adrenaline rush experienced is quite distinct from playing slots or roulette.",

Everyone should be aware of that and stop getting emotional and raising bets, because that will result in losing more money. I think casinos are a business so when gambling there we should think that we are having fun like going to a nightclub. When looking for fun, it is appropriate for us to spend money, so never get carried away by emotions and think that the casino will be happy to give us winnings every day. Casinos are not charities",

What important there is we enjoy and maybe we can only get that feeling if we are in total control on everything especially the size of our bet place and the capital we used. Discipline is what we need to avoid creating huge mistake since if we don't have good control we might get stress and think about getting unwanted revenge on next gaming session we play. Casino is one of popular source of entertainment so people should not think about more than that since if they expect something unrealistic maybe they fall from the trap that they don't want to experience.",

It's common sense, if money is very easy to make there will be no poor people in this world today. Whatever you want to do in life, always have it in mind that it's not going to easily, this will get you prepared for anything, you will rise up after every fall, because it's never meant to be easy already, gambling should be interact with in such a manner that you are fully aware of the possible loses again and again, that's you using what you can afford to lose will never hurt your plan and your life.",

Most of the time, we enter the world of gambling with the pursuit to enjoy and entertain ourselves. But the moment where we experience serious and major losses, that is the time where our reason why we engage in gambling becomes different. Because instead of enjoying, our mind is clouded with the idea that we have to obtain back our losses which makes us kept on chasing our loss. Lucky that it did not happen to me, but it makes me sad about our fellow gamblers who had to experience such things. As what you have said, it is not advisable to play in casinos if you are driven by your emotions as it will lead you to possible problems.",

Craps pay above 1:1 which is why itâs still the best game when it comes to house edge advantage.Your explanation above is really true but most of the gambler failed to abide it because itâs more on gambling for profit is what always the common goal instead of just having fun.

Sometimes it works out accordingly and sometimes it just happens that you will have to bear it that way but tactics, skills, knowledge and sometimes experience comes in play too if one can really predict the outcome of a game and if it ends up as predicted, they win it big if otherwise, so the outcome still remains the same but one should have it in mind that gambling is for fun so while gambling, one should gamble responsibly.",
