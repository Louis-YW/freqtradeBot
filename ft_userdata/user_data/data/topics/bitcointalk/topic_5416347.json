All entries must be accompanied by proof of work, which means you must include something like your username and the date on a piece of paper next to your entry. No AI programs for contest #2Have fun with this! I know if you have kids this is something I'm sure they'd enjoy doing with you, as well as getting to eat the salted & baked pumpkin seeds at the end (yum!).  Please also share this with others outside of the collectibles board.  Everyone is welcome to compete!Contest Start Date: Right NowContest End Date: Halloween Day, October 31st How will the winner be picked?: There will be a poll ran from Oct 31st to Nov 3rd.  I'm not 100% sure how I will run it, but will try and get some feedback from the community on how to most fairly do so.  Please chime in if you have any ideas!

For some reason those type of pumpkins are kinda hard to find in my country as we don't really have tradition of pumpkin carving, but I'll do my best and if I find a couple of suitable ones, I will certainly join. Quote from: Oasisman on October 08, 2022, 04:32:54 AMIf my carving skill sucks, I believe I can try some digital drawing. Imho, since this is bitcoin pumpkin carving contest only submissions with an actual carved pumpkin should count (OP mentioned that you could add drawing to that) otherwise this contest will be drowned in drawings, gifs, animations etc. But lets see what OP has to say about it.",
