No one is really mining to your own wallet. What pool you are using? Do you check the outgoing transactions? You checkt in cpuchain explorer? Your wallet is synced? Give us more, i mean how should we help = \"i get no payouts why?\"So how should we know that without any information?Quote from: yhiaali3 on April 25, 2023, 05:21:03 AMAre you sure the project is still alive? the website does not work!!I looked at Twitter and reddit  didn't see any conversations for three years!!!https://www.reddit.com/r/CPUchain/CPU Coin has also been removed from all exchanges because it is dead!!!It is not removed from all exchanges - you have xeggex and altmarkets online - but as described - only mining with direct swapping into btc or usdt or what you want - use zergpool.",
