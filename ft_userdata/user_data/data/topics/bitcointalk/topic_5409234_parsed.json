Maybe someone on this forum can help me. To be honest, I'm desperate. The thing is, I sometimes gamble. Not very often, just to have fun after my working day. I've been playing at MBit Casino https://www.mbitcasino.io/ lately. My favorite slots are Rooster Fury, Buffalo, and 100 Zombies, I play them most frequently and sometimes win there. Everything was fine until I won 14036 DOGE at MBit Casino. I can’t withdraw my winnings for more than 2 MONTHS.   I sent them selfies with my passport.  I sent them a bank statement. I did absolutely everything they said. But guess what? I never got an answer! I have repeatedly written to them in the chat and by email. They just ignored me for almost 2 months (I won on June 17). This is outrageous! Where else can I turn for help so that I can withdraw my winnings???",

I really hope that they'll still listen to my complaint, as I didn't expect such a situation. I truly look forward to them fixing the problem and I'm ready to provide proof! I have all the necessary screenshots where I won the amount, wrote to the support, to the mail and so on! They have to understand that I won't leave it so easily. No one has the right to treat people like that. MBit, we're your players! We make deposits, participate in tournaments, like your posts on social networks! You can't just keep ignoring me, it's not fair! I'll never spend money in your casino again and I don't want to have anything to do with you. But I won't let you ignore me, I want my money back! I repeat: I can provide all the necessary evidence of my rightness! They just need to listen to me!",

Base on your explanation that you have given them up till two months is really a enough time for such an issues related to Withdrawal to get resolved. We have had a lot of people that has this issues of some betting platform inability to process withdrawals and withholding customers funds after numerous wins and in their attempts to make a withdrawal of their funds.",

      "body": "Getting a player to write up a bad review is the last thing that casino management wants to hear. They have their reputation to consider after all. However, there are some facts here that should be noted. First off, the player has not been banned from the casino. That means that he or she can still get his money. Secondly, the player is not being accused of cheating or otherwise breaking the rules. So, it is possible that there was some sort of misunderstanding between the player and staff at the casino or the player simply has to wait a little longer until his case is resolved.The best thing to do is to stay in contact with the casino and ask them what happened. @ambilianburnet, when was the last time you got a response from the casino? What was the gist of that communication if you can share with us?",
