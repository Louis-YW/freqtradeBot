Features like Hedge against Inflation which even the fiat currency can’t boost of is what makes bitcoin a safe investment. During every bearish period highlights why bitcoin is the only safe cryptocurrency out there. But nonetheless the peace of mind in investing into bitcoin or cryptocurrency at large is gotten from the nature how one invested. Someone who has invested an amount that is beyond is capacity will always be in a state of panic even if the invested coins is bitcoin. These set of investors get concern about even a dollar drop because of what they have invested. The only way to invest in bitcoin peacefully is to invest an amount considered being losable my you so as to hodl for so long and not panic like the alt coin investors during bearish period.",

People call it digital gold, so it is not only currency but a store of value.If you are holding any other altcoin, you are not sure whether it will survive a few months or years and whether will it be able to keep the interest of the investors however with Bitcoin you are confident that even if it dumps it will pump back. You can never lose in Bitcoin investment if you have the holding power.",

But unfortunately, not many people believe in bitcoin, especially when the price drops dramatically like now because most of them panic when the price drops too much.Those of us who have been investing for a long time still believe in bitcoin and keep holding on to bitcoin firmly because we believe that the decline is only temporary and the increase will come soon. It's just about how we can keep the feeling of worry and fear in check when the price of bitcoin goes down because if we can do that, we can hold on to bitcoin firmly.And those who are still worried about bitcoin should try to get rid of their worries and keep trying to hold bitcoin. They should be aware that investing in bitcoin is long-term and that it's okay if the price goes down because that would be a good time to buy bitcoin again.",

In fact, at this point, I'm a strong believer that the risk of not getting Bitcoin is higher than the risk of having it. I mean: the risk of losing the value that you can afford to lose that you invested buying a few satoshis is lower than the risk of being a no-coiner in the case Bitcoin becomes a generalised currency. That said, to me having Bitcoin is a source of confidence in the future, no matter what disasters happen in my country or the world.About the real content of this thread: yes, if you don't want to be a kamikaze with you portfolio, then having the highest percentage of your holdings in Bitcoin (and maybe Ethereum) will give you confidence.",

Moreover, people who have been involved in crypto investment for a long time, surely everyone will agree, bitcoin is the safest crypto asset. So it's true, if you want to invest in crypto, bitcoin is the most appropriate to buy. The system is decentralized, making bitcoin safer, because no one has a special hold on bitcoin, because the special holders are the people who invest in it. So don't be afraid that bitcoin will be manipulated, because it is us who move the market, as investors.In contrast to other crypto assets, other crypto assets can be manipulated by the people who created them, one of which is by taking their liquidity, and making the price of the crypto go down and it is difficult to go up again. Therefore, crypto (altcoin) which is not bitcoin is something that is dangerous to be used as an investment tool. Indeed, sometimes there are very crazy increases in altcoins, but it's all just to attract customers, so they buy and invest in these altcoins.",

Bitcoin is often seen as a safe haven asset due to its decentralized nature, limited supply, and high liquidity. Additionally, Bitcoin has proven to be a resilient cryptocurrency, having survived and bounced back from multiple market crashes and bearish periods. As with any investment, there are risks and potential losses, but many investors believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the benefits it can provide as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.",

The fact that bitcoin completely dominates the cryptocurrency market demonstrates its superiority over all other coins.

These people constantly monitor the market price, and when it keeps falling, they get frustrated and some even start to doubt that it will ever rise again.
