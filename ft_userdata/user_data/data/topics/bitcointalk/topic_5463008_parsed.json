  "content": "Have you ever wonder when you open your computer something is not right and you have no idea how it happen?This are things that you should not do:Exposing your public ipCreating weak password or forget to change default passwordport forwarding with default portnot enable block failed multiple attemptsDon't disable your firewall in your computerExposing your public ip - I know we sometimes experiment and also want to access our routers outside, access our nas or data outside, since you just follow the tutorial we forget changing settings etc, all this things can expose your ip outside, I once port forward a test lamp and as i check on the server there is someone trying to brute force, the server, which if succeed can expose a lot of things.Creating Weak Password - Creating weak password can lead to hack and steals information, keys etc in your computer, not changing password on your router can also a big problem if hackers can access it, changing port or use vpn can be better, or don't allow access outside.Port forwarding - if your going to port forward makes sure to change your default port so that it will not be easily be access and brute force Not enabling a security features for access Enable security features in your router/computer like block multiple attempts.Dont disable your computer firewall - This feature is their with a purpose, so don't just disable this one virus can just get in your computer without knowing when this is disable, curious people disable this one since they are having problem, but the real problem is when you disable the firewall and allow a worm or malware to get in the system, doing the damage and steals your data.There are lots of things you should not do in your computer, do things when its neccessary do make an extra care doing this because, once your computer has been infected, you don't have any idea what data has been steal and will be expose.Having a decent AntiVirus, a clean network, and a router having rich features is better you can also try opensource firewall if you want, but having said its up to the users don't click anything or install, download things you don't know, to be sure.",

Most of the people that were playing innocently that they've been hacked and don't know how it happened is that they've probably downloaded an app or file that contained malware. And from there, everything went easy to the intruder thus not knowing by the user what's happening with their PC. So, never download from pirated websites and unknown sources because that's where mostly those things are from, in general, be careful in downloading files online.",

      "body": "Somehow, you are right, but this is not only the case; there are several mistakes that can get one's privacy and security compromised, through phishing links on email, several cases of email attacks, and also browsing on some unsafe webs that are greatly flooded with hackers. Perhaps I can say that hackers are launching a relentless series of attacks on every internet users, and they only need a person to make one slight mistake and they will hack the person's assets and any valuable things they can get.",

      "body": "Your information is valid, but I believe that someone who downloads software from internet and install those software on his system is giving direct access to the hackers who have made those software for the purpose of stealing information out of those users. Many of the users download and install download managers to download videos from YouTube or other sites and they don't know that most of those download manager can have malware inside them. Other than that there are some users who do port forwarding without knowing that they can allow hackers to access their system with the help of those opened ports. Hiding of one's IP address is almost impossible these days if you aren't using a VPN or some other method that may hide your IP, but there are drawbacks with those VPN's or other proxy related services as well. A few people are still using old versions of Windows OS on their systems which is out dated and has not been receiving any security updates. Those people are the most vulnerable ones. I have been into the field of cyber security for a long time and I can say that a single mistake can make your system comprisable. Even sometimes our operating systems can have bugs and other issues which reverse engineers and hack if know can make exploits out of those.",
