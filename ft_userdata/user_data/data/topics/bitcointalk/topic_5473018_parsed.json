  "content": "Many topics are created to explain and guide newbies on their way to earning merit. And although I consider such topics important and useful, because receiving merits is of great interest and concern to those who take only the initial steps on the forum, but I also consider the question of how to feel comfortable in this community more important. After all, beginners often face stressful situations for themselves, when they do not fully know what and how to do, and how not to lose motivation when some users responds sarcastically or even rudely. And this happens, it's a fact. That's why I decided to share my experience. My recommendations aren't that extensive and comprehensive yet, because I still don't always feel confident sharing some of my observations, even now that I'm creating this thread. There remains this feeling of a newbie, as if you are surrounded on all sides by heroes and legendaries who are just waiting to tell you that the questions you raise have already been discussed and resolved a long time ago. But they are new to you! And I want to share them, ask them, discuss them, and at the same time not feel detached and stupid. That is why I want to share some tips on how not to feel this, but on the contrary to find your niche and not feel a lot of pressure.1. Do not try to imitate others. I will start with a piece of advice that can be perceived as very unpopular, because from all corners we hear that it is necessary to take an example from those who have achieved success on the forum, analyse how, where and about what they write their posts, and based on this to improve quality of your own.But! Their style is not your style. You may not share their interests, and you may not understand (yet) the topics they write about. And that's normal. Instead of writing low-quality posts where your \"idols\" write them, it's better to focus your efforts on delving into the issues that interest you. Just write in the way you feel most confident. With respect to grammar, of course, and without violating the rules of the forum. Do not adapt your thoughts to some imaginary and subjective constructive templates.2. Do not chase the merits sources. I often see newbies writing in threads where a lot of merits are given away. Although they do not understand these topics, and therefore their posts go unnoticed. But they draw the wrong conclusion from this, and continue to attack various topics with their posts, without receiving merit, and without learning anything. It is better to write something what you understand and will be confident about. Sooner or later, sources will notice you if you focus on the content of your posts and not on impressing merit sources.3. Ranking up takes time. Just accept it as a fact and stop dwelling on it. You won't be able to run ahead of the train, and there's really no point in doing so. Perceive the time while you gain merit and activity as necessary to increase your personal level, not your position on the forum. After all, if your motivation is to study and improve your knowledge and skills, then this time will only benefit you.4. Don't worry that you will be perceived worse if you have a low rank. I saw a lot of members and even junior members who wrote interesting and useful posts, and they were treated with no less respect than a hero or legendary. Your image on the forum depends much more on the history of your posts than on your rank.5. Do not think yourself that you are worse than heroes or legendaries. Don't flatter them just because your rank is lower. Knowledge and interesting ideas do not correlate directly with rank. Your thoughts can be just as original and in demand as someone`s else. Be yourself, don't lose motivation, and you will definitely find your place in this community.",

      "body": "Thanks a lot for this piece of advice. Sometimes we just get carried away with the whole merit stuff and that affects how organic our write-ups become to a very large extent. The originality in the content you post in the forum will gradually reduce when all you do is to chase after merits and will result in not contribute positively to the forumIt might even stop you from contributing to some threads you feel won't get you merited and even when you see a question you can offer a reasonable answer to because your mind has been fixed on the whole merit-chasing mentality, you won't see the need to air your view.Within the few moments I have stayed in the forum, the merits I received were mostly a product of the organic postss and contributions I made out of my ideas, curiosity or contribution to an already created thread. I know that the urge to rank up as fast as possible is always there but I just like to follow things the way they come and I strongly believe that by moving just a step at the time, we will get to the top one day.Kudos to the journey thus far!",

      "body": "A good piece this is I must say and things like this don't come everytime but I just hope it reaches the intended audience and they abide by them. You know it becomes hard to get originality sometimes from newbies if their only aim of coming into the forum is to rank up and possibly join a campaign. They'd may, in their bid to quickly achieve that aim, miss out on some of these minor but necessary steps probably because slow and steady is not what they are looking for. Don't blame those who cozy up to these higher ranked users so they can get one merit or two because maybe to them thats the only way merits can come their way and some even lose \"appetite\" to stay or even contribute when their plan doesn't work.There's no quick way to success but if there's consistency and determination, the goal can be achieved but not all of them know this. It's not bad to have someone you admire in this forum for their style of writing or the way the act in general but some tend to lose themselves simply because they are trying to emulate their idol. Getting merits is simple. Just be unique, post good, informative posts and try not to put having the merits in front when making your contribution because that can put a damper on one's mood if the desired result is not gotten.",

I am not saying that they have no right or reason to do so, but for newbies it could be too much pressure.

That i why merits are often given to those users and posts which already have lots of merits. Of for something funny. But there is no objective rules, common for everybody which regulate merit distributions. Considering campaign managers, I would say the rather make a focus on merits, because every good campaign offers higher payrate for those users, who have 1000+ or even 2000+ merits. It has recently become something like a \"new rank\", which is higher than Legendary.

To be honest, getting merits is not as easy as it is because sometimes, a user can even make good posts but may not get the desired merits and may feel it's not about making good posts alone. From what I've seen too on the forum of how some users get merits, those who dole the merits may do it for reasons best known to them and not mainly on the fact that the post being merited was good alone.QuoteI have never done this before, so you will be my first user I will help with the merits left to the next rank.
