But I was wondering if there are any apps for Android users. Most of my local users use Android devices. So, here I am with another PGP thread, and I guess this is the last one. I do not have a MAC or iPhone to test PGP on those devices.

This is the best comment I have got so far from this forum. I was amazed by your comment, which will motivate me to write about such topics in the future. As you can see, I have written two more tutorials before, but I do not see any genuine interest from forum users. Either they do not understand the importance of learning PGP or just ignore it. I thought it was a lack of writing.
