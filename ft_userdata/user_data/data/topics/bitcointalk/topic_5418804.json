Example is duelbits, they started their $250,000 halloween event week ago and today is final day to draw the Jackpot prize. Lesson for you, if you are interested to join in specific special event, it would be better for you to find information at least a week before the date because usually casinos do not do the event in a single day (in the main date only).",

This is an answer to give OP more options, beside most casinos have halloween offers. Plus most casinos have scam accusations either in this forum, reddit or any gambling-related platform, either its solve or not, it's up for people to whom to believe in.And the experience of person doesn't reflect to all members/users of that platform, because if this is the case then the casino will have zero users sooner. So you can't force anyone to use and avoid things. DYOR is the best thing.And again, im not advertising/promoting anything in my post as it against the rules.",

I majorly play at Stake.com , but sadly in this Halloween , they didn’t have any sort of contests or bonuses. I occasionally play on Rollbit, and this time they had a bonus . Have you checked it out? They are legit and running the business from couple of months. So you won’t have any issues with them. Please check it once.",
