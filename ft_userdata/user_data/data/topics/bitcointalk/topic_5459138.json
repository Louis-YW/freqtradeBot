No one can conyrol the outcome of each holdings of everyone only but yourself. I agree with you mate and if bitcoin  wasn't decentralized,  then I believe  it would have been compromised and due to binance popularity and dominance in the cryptocurrency, .any other people confuse binance  and cz as the owner of every other cryptocurrency and determinant of bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices.Op, I believe  if there was a way to get bitcoin compromised,  then the top government officials  would have gladly invested in such project but unfortunately I don't think they can and even if they can, then it will definitely  not be now.Binance  is a third-party  and the fact that they wanted to investigate an attack should  solely be because the transaction was still within their reach and the truth  is that except from using third parties, no one is in charge of your hodlings except the holder and it seems your attack is more on mixers and you should talk to them and not attack bitcoin  in general.",

Obviously, the concern ChipMixer holds logs exists since day 1. There's nothing revealed to us, after it got shut down. They have no power if they wish to, as you say, because there is no evidence they were keeping logs. If they did keep logs, then yeah, there would be concern the feds have accessed them, but there's no such thing known.",

However, it is important to recognize that Bitcoin is still more decentralized than any other form of currency.Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by central servers or authorities. The network is maintained by a distributed network of miners, and anyone can become a miner with the right hardware and software. This means that no single entity or group has control over Bitcoin, which is a significant advantage.Furthermore, the Bitcoin network is constantly evolving and improving, becoming more decentralized and secure with the development of new technologies. For instance, the Lightning Network enables instant and low-cost transactions, making Bitcoin more accessible for everyday use and reducing the reliance on miners for transaction processing.Exactly what I said.
