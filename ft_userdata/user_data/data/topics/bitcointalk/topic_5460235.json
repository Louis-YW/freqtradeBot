  "content": "I give myself task to do a kind of feasibility study, to know how different people de see bitcoin and how dem de rate am. Within a week i ask more dan a hundred people, and most of dem na enlightened people. Twenty percent say dem never hear about bitcoin before, anoda twenty percent say dem don hear am but dem no know exactly wetin em de all about, above fifty percent wey say dem know am de ignorantly associate our bitcoin with various  scams for Internet. especially de liken am to MMM and yahoo. While less dan ten percent, na im give am pass mark. Aldo dis my result fit no de accurate because e no capture di opinions of every Nigerians, but truth de inside. I no too de surprised say people wey associate bitcoin with different scam de plenty pass, because I once de like dem before I eventually enter am.Dis negative image wey Nigerian people get about bitcoin, evendo say no be Nigeria get am, no good at all, so my concern be how we go take change dis perception. CBN too no help matter as di cryptocurrency ban still dey. So I de reason say one of di ways wey we go take create positive awareness about bitcoin and crtpto matter at large, na to get a recognized bitcoin body, wey reputable people for our country, wey de into crypto go belong. Because I de sure say many intelligent minds for naija, de trade and invest in bitcoin, aldo most of dem na on di low key. So dis association go be an official voice to de address issues wey concern bitcoin, like dis CBN ban and de negative perception of crypto in general.Aldo I no know weda we get dis kind of association about bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, for inside Nigeria. But if any association like dat de and im de recognized by our government, den I no de sure say dem de do enof to better di image. On di oda hand, maybe people wey de into crypto matter no send about wetin people think about am, sofa say dem de make dem money and dem no break any law.",

      "body": "If I ask you to tell me if Bitcoin is legally recognized in Nigeria, can you be so confident to say yes? As a matter of fact, the body language of CBN does not show that they are comfortable with crypto at the moment rather they see it as a threat as it reduces their control and power. So, If government have not openly supported Bitcoin as a legal tender, I don't see how they will recognize any organization as you have proposed.On the other hand, our country and government love trend so much... so if we put more effort at educating people and encouraging businesses to use and  accept cryptocurrency and it become a trend and common practice, I am confident our government will become to look in the direction of cryptocurrency.",
