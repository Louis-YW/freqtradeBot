I did check thier domain details and found it to be registered from 2018 till 2024. Still, it is not that easy to trust any platform on the internet",

NFTs have been the buzz and have gone down the drain to make way for the next buzzword. Buy them at your own risk, I personally would not.Sadly the OP of this thread has been away for some time. Hope they join us back soon.",

      "body": "IMO NFTs are worthless and there was a time people used to buy it like sheep due to endorsement by some celebrities and now we have seen celebrities like Cristina Ronaldo, Logan Paul getting sued and moreover I have never heard of this project and as far as Indian market is concerned or let any South Asian market for that reason NFT is useless and people don't want to invest into digital art. Better to stay away from NFT projects itself be it any NFT projects.",
