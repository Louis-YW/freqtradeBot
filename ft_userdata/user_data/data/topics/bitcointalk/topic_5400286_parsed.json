  "content": "I work in a men- dominated office. I dread going to work everyday because I have to face my male colleagues who think because I am a woman, all I need to do is to sit and look pretty.In my work place, I have a lot of Negative attitude directed towards me from the men, and even though I'm qualified, I have been denied promotion opportunities twice. I have been sexually Harassed by my direct supervisor and boss. The HR has refused to carry out an investigation despite my complaints. I have a plan to quit my job soon, but getting a new job with this pay is very difficult (I was out of a job for about four years), Hence my motivation for taking cryptocurrency learning more seriously to be able to earn me some level of financial and life freedom. As a newbie in the space, I'm interested in knowing what your motivation is and why you are taking cryptocurrency learning seriously?",

Are you sure it's definitely men?In addition, speaking seriously, there are more motivational posts every day.But in your first introduction, I saw that you are somewhat familiar with cryptocurrencies. For any person, be it a woman or a man, additional education and constant growth always give only pluses.We must keep up with the times; otherwise, without developing, you can remain in the Stone Age, where the whole face of a woman is to give birth and raise children.Do not rate yourself so low. If you are attracted to something modern, feel free to study, and do not let yourself be humiliated. Learning and investing in cryptocurrencies entitles you to become financially independent. After all, sooner or later, most of the world will be in the digital industry. And you can always be in demand by learning all the intricacies of the cryptocurrency market.",

There might be a few that have already achieved enough wealth, and want to contribute to a system, which could potentially either replace our current broken system or be the foundation, and inspiration from future cryptocurrencies. Although, I would say they're thin, and far between. Ultimately though, Bitcoin allows you not only remove the requirement for any third party, but it also allows you to work remotely much of the time. Especially if trading, but also a lot of what Bitcoin offers is global transactions, without the risk of chargebacks like fiat currencies. So, some will be here to avoid those issues, especially if they can do their job without working for a company, and offer it online.",

Crypto isn't the answer to the financial freedom that you're looking for, the possible profit is too volatile the same as the price of the crypto, and there's no assurance of making you rich.  If you have enough capital, find assets that generate profit, that way, you can stop your work.  But crypto alone will not solve your problem. Sorry but I discourage you not to do this, just invest in crypto while you're at work, for the long term much better.",

So, while your advice is good, since it probably does apply to most people that are working for other people, if you can work for yourself using your skills, and transfer them to Bitcoin, I'd say you have a better chance of escaping the rat race, due to that inflation.

I didn't get your point, I think if the @OP has a good skills to become a freelancer, she wouldn't struggle in his current position since she would just quit her jobs and focus on freelance. It doesn't matter she got paid with Bitcoin or fiat, as long as she got paid, then she can live by freelancing. Some people also don't want to get paid in Bitcoin, El Salvador citizens are the example.",

I always make this clear as a lot of people are just betting that bitcoin/crypto is their only way out of poverty/hardships.",

You'd need an actual job which (i) pays you out in cryptocurrencies and (ii) lets you work remotely [otherwise the above will most likely repeat itself in the new workplace].(ii) is more straightforward to get done than (i).

Perhaps this idea would be greatly supported if we actually had a way of making 12x more crypto than our monthly salary at a real job. I used to think that mining might help but in the end I had to go to work \"for one reason or another\" even though right now I can make a few dollars in the crypto space including trading.The crypto world is full of hope and sometimes it can never work in your favor. There are many things you should consider before leaving your actual job, but it can be difficult to decipher them all because each of us has a different opinion.

I recently graduated as an associate in information technology (only 2 years in college). After I graduated, the job was really difficult and I couldn't help my parents with house expenses or debts while I was in college. At that time, I was also searching for an online job, but after a year, I still haven't found it. Then I came across Bitcoin, and you know, the price was too low at the time, and you could earn decent money on it based on my online friends who are currently earning money on it, so I started learning it, mostly for bitcoin, and all my efforts were rewarded. I am starting to earn some money and I would say it is a decent one.  Our life before was really really poor. We were struggling to pay the electric bill and for fast foods or restaurants. Until I graduated, I hadn't tasted it using our own money since birth because it was really expensive to buy. This is really my motivation to learn crypto to make decent money and that could help my life too.",

I mean, were you harassed by one or two men? It would make your case stronger if you're not the only person who suffered this. If I were you, I'd quit my job! As regards financial freedom that is normally attached to Bitcoin, I'm afraid it is almost always misunderstood. This is only my personal understanding, of course. I don't think financial freedom here is to be understood in such a way that you don't have to get employment anymore because you are already into Bitcoin. In other words, this is not, or at least less, about money or income. I think financial freedom here means getting away from the shackles of the traditional financial system. I think the proverbial financial freedom that Bitcoin gives us is more of the freedom from banks and the government rather than the freedom from having less or no money.",

It is quite a thing these days where in a male dominated office, a lady is often seen as an easy prey, but with a hard evidence against any harrasment coming your way, the persons involved can be dealt with. Not all men are same, there must be one who fancies your carriage and would come to your defense if need be...but what do i know...As regards cryptocurrency however, i dont have much experience in this area, but i do think that it is not a one way ticket to financial freedom. The healthy thing i do is much as possible learn about whatever topic of interest i think is worth learning and pay close attention to trending news as regards that crypto subject. While working at a job that doesn't satisfy my bank balance or mental stance, i invest during my free time on getting ahead with other crypto options to better my chance of increasing my income while understanding how to get the best out of it. You however don't need to be told if to quit your job or carry on, but one thing i know is this, if your instinct nudges you to look ahead and explore other options, hell, why not? This life is too short to be conditioned to give up mental sanity or morals just to please someone who thinks he is doing one a favour by paying you a stipend for your time while making you feel less or under subjugation to harrasment.",

I'm not forbidding you if you plan to crypto investing, it's just that,keep in mind that investing carries a high risk considering that you are new to cryptocurrencies, right? so it's very easy to lose if you can't manage your finances well.My little story: Initially I also did not come from a wealthy family. but I have the determination to learn business, not monotonous and try to change my life for the better than before. then I tried to manage finances from where I work in the real world by turning it into several other businesses including crypto investment.but all back to yourself, depending on how the role you control in the business field. because making a business more efficient is sometimes not as easy as we would like it to be, but fixing it now is better than nothing.
