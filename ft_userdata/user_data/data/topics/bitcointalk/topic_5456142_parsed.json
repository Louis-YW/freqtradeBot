On the other hand, I like gambling because of the sensation I get there. Regardless of the gains and losses or the positives and negatives that we ourselves feel, I am an adult and I have the will for what I do, as long as gambling doesn't interfere with my life and my small family is still sufficient financially then I will still do this because even though I don't know whether I fall into the category of addicts or not, I have limitations in what I do in gambling.",

The former are not a problem because they do it occasionally, and thus do not significantly affect their finances and the lives of their families. Those who think they can profit from the game and still do not know how to control themselves are a problem for themselves and society, because every addiction creates abnormalities.I can't say how to deal with the problem of gambling, but I think that the one who enables gambling should take more responsibility and recognize the addict and prevent him from gambling, and also offer him free psychological help. Ignoring a problem always just creates an even bigger problem, and then it's very difficult to help people.",

On societal views on gambling and how gamblers are perceived those that gamble the answers simple, gambling has categories and most of the gamblers who are always put in public eyes are those that visit casino shops or other situated gambling Centers and spend a lot of time in there and also spending a lot of money playing and there after walking home with nothing at the end of the day.",

The first answer why I gamble is for fun.the second answer is why I still gamble to test my analytical skills in assessing a match.Maybe what is meant is not good for gambling because it ignores other needs that are more important and addiction to gambling has made players willing to do anything to get money to gamble.Gambling depends on each person, in my opinion it is like that and of course different thoughts from me in looking at gambling.",

      "body": "Not all gamblers are being seen as bad people; it all depends on your level of involvement in gambling. If you become a gambling addict, then it's actually a good reason for people to see you as someone who is wasteful because you are not seen as someone who is making anything out of your life, and your parents will actually be disappointed for such a thing.Let's take someone like Drake who wagers millions of dollars in live betting. Will he be seen as someone who is not resourceful, wasted, or even doesn't know what he's doing? Some will, but most won't, because he has the money to spend, and gambling is not just what he is doing.So for me, I don't see gambling as something that is bad. The advice I always give to gamblers is to know their limit and gamble responsibly; don't take gambling as your pay job; don't steal money from others just to gamble; don't borrow to gamble; and if all of those can be kept, then there is actually no bad thing in gambling, and I wouldn't mind even allowing my own child to go gamble, have fun, waste some money, and if possible, win some back home.",

There are some educated gamblers who gambles responsibly which You and I may not know or detects if they are gamblers but are secretly gambling online. There are village gamblers who holds betting slips around the village and their locality which inversely calling drawing attention to themselves are the people who are making gambling to be worst and something bad to anticipates.For underage gamblers which is from 15 to 20 years of sets are the groups of people whose parents (Mother & Father's) shout on them due to their nonchalant attitudes and refusal to focus in life. Again if these sets of people involving themselves in playing draft (Okwe or Akgbu), if time not taking they might be a school dropout because the distraction of that game is much on them. So you see why i said gambling is of various types the ability for you to detects them matters a lot.Most some people gamble to catch cruise, to earn more money and also to ease themselves from all forms emotional attack, stress from work, family disturbance/ distraction and depression. You hardly see a gambler who suffers all of these a mentioned.",

Gambling is really not good if you don't have the luxury to do it because it's an expensive source of entertainment. Your parents are right about most of this lesson because the majority of gamblers don't know how to handle it properly or if they are really worth it to be involved in gambling.Gambling is the best source of entertainment for people that seek excitement by risking money to earn a quick profit. This is same with illegal drugs, It's destroying our body but why there's a lot of people using it most importantly that it is illegal.",

Nope- there is not a single mystery about gambling as everything is all about luck.Let me ask you a question: have you ever dreamt of winning the lottery? Have you visualized yourself winning thousands of cash by betting only a small amount of money in the process? Well then, those are just some of the questions in which a lot of people seek to answer. They see themselves winning and experiencing the luck that may yield/give money that can send them straight to retirement. Gambling is not just about entertainment, it is also about luck. The luck that we are talking about here involves cash; and everything in this world revolves around cash. Now, you see the reason on why people still gamble?The argument that people steal and become parasite to the society is somehow true but this can be avoided with proper discipline and patience. Again, only a fraction of people profited in gambling; whereas a majority of these gamblers lost more than they gained in the process.",

Sorry but I will answer your question with a question..The Bible/God condemns sin, it is written that we should not kill, we should not lie, we should not steal, we should not envy, we should not hate, we should not disobey our parents and so and so on, but yet people still do this things, what do you think is mystery behind it?And let me give you another example again, and this time, i will use a car, aeroplane as an example, many have sustained various degrees of injury through road accidents, many have lost their lives through road accidents and plane crash and other vices, but has people stop driving cars? Has people stopped boarding planes to their destinations? Of course no..There are rascal gamblers and there are responsible gamblers, it is not a bad thing to be a responsible gambler, but you become a menace to your parents, your family and society if you are rascal gambler, unfortunately, rascal gamblers are the ones denting the reputation and image of the responsible gamblers in the society, simply because, there are very many rascal gamblers in the streets, and very few responsible gamblers.",

People are still Gambling. WHY? Is There Any Mystery Behind? I think that your problem is an overly narrow view on all this. Perhaps it is on purpose, to see what answers you get. But the right answers are there for long, what I will say it's not new.Gambling is about fun and adrenaline. It's like a roller-coaster, but with money and lately on your own chair.But like with pretty much everything else, too much of it is not good. If you are not careful, you can lose your money. If your mindset is wrong (eg. \"earn/make money\", \"recover the loses\") then you can easily fall into an endless pit. And obviously, the younger you are, the bigger the chances you'll end there, just because your brain is not trained to fully understand the risks.Gambling is about having fun. Of course, the bigger the money and the risk, the more the adrenaline and some will also say the fun is bigger (I don't know, I don't play big money). One has to think it over (for real), assess the risks and the benefits and if he wants to throw in a couple of bucks now and then for some fun, why not? But be careful to not exaggerate.",

People are still Gambling. WHY? Is There Any Mystery Behind? There are only few people who interfere with others and we should learn to ignore them because such people are the real discouragers who will never give up on their habit of discouraging. The gambling if done without selling your body parts, your properties, or something special, is just a type of entertainment, but if someone delves into the deeper side of gambling and gets addicted to it then that's not a good thing at all. The gambling addicts are so crazy for it that they can sell anything for gambling and losing all their money is nothing for them. On the other hand if someone gambles just because of the entertainment part of it and to make some money with it then nothing is wrong in doing that. Many people just love those casino games and they get endorphins during the gameplay and that's a good thing for a healthy and happy life. Some people are into gambling purely to earn an extra income from it and those people will not gamble on the days when losses are more than wins. Let's take my own example, I love playing poker games, and it's far more entertaining for me than movies or other type of video games, but I don't play it with real money and that's why it doesn't fall into the category of gambling, but let's suppose if I play it with real money and at the same time I enjoy playing it then I don't think that anything is wrong in doing that.So the only option to get rid of those people is to ignore them, and if they are someone who cares about us and our good health then we should listen to them and if needed we should give up on gambling because there are some people in our life who are far more important than anything else, and if our giving up of gambling makes them happy then stopping the activity is the best thing for us. Otherwise, continue the thing and enjoy it only if someone isn't losing everything, but if the losses are far more than wins then we should do something else instead of it.",

I think people who play gambling can be divided into 3 categories:1# Curious peopleThis type is those who are new to gambling. It could be out of curiosity, spending free time, or hearing that a friend won a big win2# Returns the lost moneyThis type is those who lose a lot/little of money. They play gambling and hope that the lost money will comeback. But that never happened3# Gambling addictionThis type is those who are no longer logical. They keep playing even if they win or lose. They are real gambling addicts. they can't stop before all the money is gone",
