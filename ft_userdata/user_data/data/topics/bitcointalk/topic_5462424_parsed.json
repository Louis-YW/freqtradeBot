One thing you should realize is that nothing good comes easy I get the fact that you did try to trade in other to get some quick money but it turned out not to be a success. Believe me when I say that they are so many users here in this forum that have been in the same shoe as you currently are and once had the same thought you currently have right now (which is to harm yourself) if they had done anything stupid to themself do you think they would have been able to achieve what they have managed to have now? No.Quote from: Wozzie on August 07, 2023, 10:06:27 PMI think this will be my last message to the world, I am sorry Like it’s popular said in my locality “Nah who Dey alive Dey fit make corrections” Meaning “Only those alive can right what they did wrong” so if you decide to end your life (as you said in the end part of your post) what effect do you think that will have on your family? Or your friends. You just lost money and if you continue to develop your self I’m 100% sure that you’ll make x10000 of what you just lost today, so take some time off the internet look for activity to engage in so that you can forget what happened because if you should stay idle you’ll surely have some negative thoughts so just go out there and try to forget about what happen and when the urge to harm yourself has subsided you can return back to the forum and I’m sure that forum members will be willing to guide you through your learning journey.",

Have you considered life is far more better than what you thought?Yes! this is true because just 10k$ or 1M$ can not be quantify or equates to your life simply because you lost your money at the cost of trading or having to get involved with scammer who cheaply swept your funds away from you doesn't mean you should commit suicide for any reason.There are some people who had gone a long way but they don't give up for any reason, the reason of life is to fall and get up dust yourself and pick a wave and direction to follow instead of wanting to sink to due to a little hit or a silly attack launched to you, why on earth have you been so loose to have gotten your funds swept or do you in any way follows a copy trade or implore a trading bots?These are the common things that makes man cry so loud because of the malfunctioning of the bots could possible lead to the drain of your account.And again, something possible could happened to someone in the crypto industry is when you applied so much greed and quest to make profits easily lands you in a quick lost because you were desperate to profits, and the scammers often use those who are desperate to enrich themselves so easily and they easily fall for those cheap scammers. Well, just brush up and take another wave of your life as I think today is not the end of a man or woman, in as much as you are still breathing you can't overcome dangers and problems. In fact as living beings you would always meet problem at point of your life, it could be today or tomorrow but know it at the back of your mind that is something inevitable, and off course, it could come from family members or children maybe possibly your wife.",

They can help you work through these feelings of shame and help you develop strategies to cope with challenges and it's also important to confide in a close friend or family member who can provide emotional support.Because IMO, seeking help is a sign of strength, you don't have to go through this alone. There are people who care about you and want to support you on your journey toward healing and personal growth.  Next time, don't rush having Bitcoin trading because that's very risky, at least you have a knowledge on it.",

Sit back, take deep breath and spend a few days or weeks to do things unrelated to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. Just don't do stupid things!By spending cooling down time, you will have better view on what you have done, what are your mistakes and can improve yourself.My advice, not financial advice, for youYou traded but are not good with trading. So don't trade again!Spending time to digest this fiasco and later, if you still want to be in this market, change to invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin only, don't invest in altcoins which have bigger risk for you to lose your capital.If you decide to invest, apply Dollar Cost Averaging https://dcabtc.com/Important to store your bitcoin in non custodial wallet.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

Many individuals want to get rich fast, and Bitcoin is a tempting yet brutal way to do it. You failed, but it doesnt define you or your worth. Bitcoin is something many people are proud of and should never be criticized. Even if it didnt work out, you can learn from it and promote Bitcoin, the future of money.

Your life is worth more than the money that you lost and as long there is life there is hope. Let this be a hard lesson for you not to jump into crypto trading especially when you don't understand how to trade. Don't see anything that you are investing into as a get rich quick project. This is where newbies fail to understand that trading is very risky and can suck your funds within a  twinkle of an eye. Most newbies jump into the crypto space to trade and not to hodli which at the end they end up regretting. You are not the first person that has lost all you have on trading and you won't be the last. See trading as gambling and only trade with the amount that you can afford to loss. Try and buy some fraction of bitcoin again and don't think of selling rather think of holding it till 2025 and keep on buying anytime that you can afford it, you might recover your loss by 2025",

You should calm down and find a way to start over, don't be too pessimistic because your life is not only yours, but think about your family.

I think this will be my last message to the world, I am sorry Hey man, there are two ways to look at this. First as a loser and second as a lesson learned. I want you to change your perspective and look at if from the second perspective. It is not easy but you should force yourself to see it that way. With this sad experience you have learned the wrong way not trade which is putting all your life's savings trading bitcoin. That means you need good risk management strategy. I do not know your level of skill or experience in trading but you have also learned that practicing with a trading simulator for some months where you use fake money should come before starting live trading. One other lesson you may have learned is that trading should not be an activity that occurs in isolation especially if you are a beginner. You need to be part of a community, you need mentorship. Lastly, we have all made mistakes, as long as you still have life, you can be sure that you still have hope to recover your losses.",
