Once your token becomes listed to any of those, then that's where the investors will get their attention and that is because they want the tokens they're investing as something tradable.Quote from: GreatPigsby on May 27, 2023, 08:40:59 PMPlease check my website and let me know what you think about that to. That would be great!You might change that tag about investing. Just my opinion though but it doesn't sound good honestly and more of a ponzi whenever there's some recreational words about making investing fun.",

Otherwise, it's never going to appeal to them. If it wasn't and you're fine with small-time investors, it's time that you'd need more than anything else. I mean you already have a community as you've said, and they're actively trying to spread the word about your project so I guess it's fine on that side. So really, take your time. If it really has something on it, then investors will come along as you go. The speed depends on the marketing you're community spreads it though.",

That would be great!-cut-You might not ever get users no matter the tactic, and most likely if you are paying with that promotion campaign with your own tokens, those are just going to be a sell pressure now or later. Those people will not be your customers, they are advertising because you pay them, and in twitter it's most likely that their followers are just other spamming bounty hunter accounts. People spamming in telegram is a sure way for me not to buy that something because that type of advertisement is borderline harassing.What comes to your token, i could see myself buying it if it was trading in L2 like arbitrum or polygon. I am not fan of the eth fees.",
