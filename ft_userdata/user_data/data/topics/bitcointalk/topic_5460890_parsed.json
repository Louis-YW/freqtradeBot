  "content": "Hello fellow high rollers and gambling enthusiasts,I come to you today with an exciting opportunity for both my fellow high rollers and myself. I have an exceptional group of referrals from stake.com and bcgame, consisting of six diamond players with jaw-dropping wager histories ranging from 25 to 100 million on stake, along with five other high rollers with impressive wagers of 5 million or more on bcgame. These individuals are true high rollers, and they are eager to explore new platforms that genuinely appreciate their status and dedication to the world of gambling.To ensure transparency and accountability, my referrals are more than willing to undergo any verification process required by the recommended websites. We understand that verifying their high roller status is essential for claiming exclusive welcome bonuses and rewards, and they are more than ready to prove their credentials.If you have personally experienced or know of reputable online gambling platforms that cater specifically to high rollers and can provide welcome bonuses, please do share your recommendations here. We highly value your insights and experiences, and your input will help us make informed decisions.Please remember that we are not looking for generic welcome bonuses available to all users. Our goal is to find platforms that genuinely recognize and reward high rollers for their achievements and contributions to the gambling community.Thank you all for your time and contributions. Let's continue elevating the high roller experience together!Best regards",

Personally, I've had positive experiences with Roobet and Duelbits, and I've never encountered any issues. Though I'm not a high roller, I can vouch for the overall good user reviews these casinos have received.",

It's unfortunate that  you had to go through such but I believe it happened as a result of their policy or maybe upgrade if they truly did such. When ever there is a change in policies or terms and conditions, you start having experience but  however that doesn't mean you will relax but however due diligence should be a thing of priority now so as not to have such encounter again.",

I believe the answer is already on your main-thread (It's Stake), even we all know the monthly and weekly are have down % bonus but they are the only website that give you good benefits for high-roller. Most-casino only have (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Rakeback and Rank up Reward), meanwhile Stake have (Weekly, Monthly, Reload, Rakeback, Stream Weekly Bonus, Post-monthly, VIP Bonus, Top Waggering Reward from your VIP). So, my suggested stick with the Stake because until now we still not seing a website give you a good offer bonus + have big bankroll than (Stake).",

It’s very hard to find someone that is willing to browse all the affiliate deals of each casino here since only few players bothered to check affiliate commission while all the info you needed is known by your competitors for affiliate commission. I doubt your competitors will give you an answer to your inquiry here. You will need to browse manually here on each casino to find out what suitable your preference in regards with commission.
