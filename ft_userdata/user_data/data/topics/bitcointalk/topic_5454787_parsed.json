On the other hand, if we are in control of money, then any amount will be sufficient.Arrogance and feeling the greatest when there are many sheets of paper is not something that needs to be done because it will not always be of value.When we are able to direct or arrange sheets of paper with different designs for each country so that they are always of value, then that's great.Sheets of paper that will become obsolete are like magic that will pull us into the abyss, so it's no wonder that in every country we always see many high-ranking officials involved in corruption cases.",

When you have the power to control everything through being a regulator and then you will able to make your way to get the money much easier than you think. Contesting in politics is not easy. You can imagine if there will be dark money that backed his opponent and his money will never be enough. He needs more than it to win in competing to get political power.",

Like, before turning 18, we have been taught to make money so that we could make a happy living some of us got the point and some of us ignores it because? Idk what is the reason. But i do know that, teaching the topic of \"Money is never enough\" is so necassary for all youngsters and i understood this point few years back due to some financial conditions. Which were repeating due to same mistakes made with money as you have mentioned a story of oil well owner, same as it is ours. I also spent a lot of time teaching the same thing to my you get brother that no wonder oldest will tell you to remain on earning more blah and blah but you have to give a thought to your own moral self and think about it for a second that how important money ks and how much important we should give it. Because, when we give more importance to money then it deserves we are ruining our life along with our loved ones because let say, your oldest (anyone) gave you money to get them something from the market and you are under 18 and lost the money. What do you think is gonna happen when you get home. (I know you will say a teenager deserves that) but he/she also deserves forgiveness which the money lover ignores as he love money more and gave money more importance than it deserves. I have seen many cases in my life, and understood this statement very well and i suggest all of in support of this statement that they should also adopt it in there livings and improve there life with this concept that money is not everything, even if you get a well of oil and get a 5$ from the road, it will never be enough until you satisfy your heart and control your wishes of getting more (not greed).",

Do you ask yourself why some fraudsters, atheletes and business men go broke? most of them get stuck and stop getting money after their big earning. If a person understands how money works, follows the right investment and is comfortable with what they have, they can manage money wisely. Out of greed people fail to manage money, like the mentioned guy, he got greedy out of his love for money now he's broke. If he knew the right candidate and invested the money on the person with a higher probability of winning the election, and eventually the person wins, he, the investor, will enjoy more and gain extra money as the person he sponsored will shower him with lots of opportunities and help his oil business.",

Second, immediately invest your money to keep your money and increase the wealth you have. third, immediately try to start your business so you can learn to manage money and even if you lose you will get expensive experience, so that later when you start another business it will be better because there has been an evaluation of the previous business so you don't experience losses.and the man who runs the oil industry fails to take advantage of the opportunities that come his way and cannot organize and manage what he gets.",

Come on, let's be more realistic about that. Â Yeah, there would be other constraints to what might get the individual bankrupt but, am not so sure that individual owned an oil well in the first place.When we refer to money, we've got to understand that it diminishes with time. Money not well spent and by that mean invested would as well diminish. There is a reason why continual earnings is regarded as income. Its supposed to keep coming as you spend. If you aren't getting regular income, then you ought not to spending more.",

Especially if you consider yourself a threat to consolidated structures inside your local society. There will be retaliation later, without any doubts... We can't say with sure the intentions of your oil dealer friend on his political misadventures, but the chances are that a greedy, unscrupulous individual is more likely to win than to lose, and considering he has lost twice already, the chances are that he isn't on the level of cunning and trickery politics demands from a person.In your example, you have expressed money is never enough for the oil dealer, but thinking by the other side, he didn't have a spot in politics because money wasn't enough for his adversaries.",

Money can always satisfy you only upto a certain level after that you only want to reach to the next higher level. When a person doesn't have any money even a little salary is enough for him, but after he starts earning that little salary eventually that'll also not be enough and he'll want more because we humans have that tendency to increase our needs, lifestyle and wants with our increasing salaries.",

I don't think money breeds pride because there many people that are poor but proud. The richest man in my country is one of the meekest personalities I have ever come across. He lives a modest life than many people that even depend on him to make money. Anybody that becomes proud when he becomes rich has some traces of pride before the money came. If we understand that money comes and goes we will be more humble. There is no need to be arrogant because of money because someone's earns in seconds what you have acquired throughout your lifetime.QuoteThere is this oil dealer guy in my community who happen to be hot market pro in the oil industry, he owns an oil well but this guy it gets to his head and start contesting for political power which he has lose twice now and the worst of it now is that the oil well is dried because suck the money into politics, loss everything. Money is not enough for people that are not content with what they have. Based on your story the reason why this man went into politics is not to serve the people but to make more money and show off. He is a greedy folk that is not content with his income from the oil well. This is what happens to people that don't appreciate what they have so they end up losing what they had in the process of chasing what they don't have. QuoteThis money is never really enough, no wonder even the President of nations still fights to get money after office. Presidents of a country are not expected to amass wealth while in office. The only reason why they become super rich is because they steal from public funds. So it is not out of place for ex-presidents to go into business or other ventures to make money. It is only in some corrupt countries that past presidents are even richer than most global businessmen because of corruption.",

I could also say that since there's a threshold to how much money will make you happy, and once you've reached that threshold earning more money wouldn't make you happier anymore I can see these people chasing that high, which then leads them to feats that are so stupid all for the love of money.",

However, the lesson we should learn from these incidents is that excess greediness is never good. Most of the time though, we humans don't follow this, and the reason for this reminds me of a saying that people's mouths are never filled unless it's the soil of the grave.

Everyone with a business mindset will always be looking for chances at new or improved revenue streams, it feels like he gambled his on the possibility that he could wield power into even more money. That is a very dangerous game, because if he had no charisma, had poor connections or the face simply didn't fit - then he was unlikely to transfer easily into the game of politics. He would have been much better off following and optimizing his original line of business, but then, he may have been bored of that and was looking for a new challenge, but he ultimately failed and wasted a lot of money in the process.",
