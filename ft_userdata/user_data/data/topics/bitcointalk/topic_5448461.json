I know it's important to keep my seed phrase (or secret phrase) safe and secure, but I'm not sure what the best way to do that is.I'm considering writing it down on a piece of paper and storing it in a safe or safety deposit box, but I've also heard about other methods like engraving it on metal or storing it on a USB drive.What do you recommend as the most secure way to store my seed phrase? Are there any tips or best practices I should know about to ensure it stays safe and doesn't get lost or stolen?Thanks in advance for you help guys",

      "body": "If you only want to use it for bitcoin, if you can be able to also store your passhrase in different but safe and secure locations, going for passphrase is good, but I do not know if Bitbox02 supports passphrase. The passphrase would generate different keys and addresses for bitcoin, but not sure of altcoins. Even if passphrase is not included, paper backup is good. You can be smart enough to get a book and store it somewhere there. Have like two or three and keep them in different locations. I can easily do that and people around me will only think nothing good inside one of the papers in the book of many written words, while still keeping it in a very safe place that would be difficult for people around me to access. Or you can go for a steel or stainless sheet.If you can make your device airgapped, you can encrypt it in a memory card, disk or flashdrive. But you will need to have like 2 or 3 of this and you have to check the file often to make sure that the card or flash is not corrupt. Which means it can be just as making your device airgapped inorder to check this like every 3 months. If it is bitcoin, the passphrase makes things easier for me and makes me feel more secure, but it is needed during wallet recovery.",

Are there any tips or best practices I should know about to ensure it stays safe and doesn't get lost or stolen?Write the mnemonic recovery words carefully numbered on paper. I recommend to document further details like date of creation, purpose, which wallet created the words, more than the default account used, etc. Just about any details that might come handy in the case you need to restore the wallet. (I recommend to practice a desaster recovery before you transfer your real coins to the hardware wallet, valueless Testnet coins are great for that.)The BitBox02 offers to save your seed on the included microSD card. If you do this, then this microSD card is never allowed to be inserted into any other digital device than the BitBox02 itself (this is important). This seed backup on the microSD card has to be kept as safe as your paper and optional metall backup. (I recommend to add a metall backup as suggested in fillippone's thread that @hosseinimr93 mentioned.)Never take a digital picture of your physical recovery words backup(s). Your wallet recovery words shall never touch an online digital device. Never!Quote from: Charles-Tim on April 11, 2023, 09:57:26 PMIf you only want to use it for bitcoin, if you can be able to also store your passhrase in different but safe and secure locations, going for passphrase is good, but I do not know if Bitbox02 supports passphrase. The passphrase would generate different keys and addresses for bitcoin, but not sure of altcoins.The BitBox02 supports an optional mnemonic passphrase. But you should only use an optional additional mnemonic passphrase when you fully understand what implications this has. The mnemonic passphrase has to be saved and stored separate from the recovery words. Do not try to only remember it in your brain, this is very likely a recipe for desaster. Reason is that any individual mnemonic passphrase yields a different wallet, the smallest error will give you an empty wallet. It doesn't matter for which coin.",

But recently, just a few days ago, when I faced the need to restore my ledger wallet, I was horrified to find that I didn't remember the location where my password was hidden. I had the SEED in my hands, but no password.I found myself on the brink of despair. Nothing was left but to try to restore the password from my memory. Luckily, after several frantic attempts, my efforts succeeded.Hence the moral, the locations of storage for both the SEED and passphrase must be carved in stone in your memory",

If you REALLY get someone in robbing your home there is an infinitesimal chance that they may find your metal seed and take it.Not because they know what it is, but because they are just grabbing it.Even if you have it someplace safe, you spouse, your kids, your family that is helping you do something may move it. Not doing anything bad, but just cleaning / reorganizing stuff like that.Having it screwed to the back of your cabinet / dresser / pantry / whatever just makes it look like you did a hack job repairing something if anyone can even see it without moving other stuff.-Dave",

It's extremely dangerous to store it in anything connected to the internet because there are too many hackers in the world who are waiting for you to make one mistake so they can gain access to your PC. Therefore, be cautious about storing your private keys or seed phrase online, on your PCs, or on your phone. In my opinion, the best way is to write it on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere in your home/office or any other private space that only you have access to. I'm sure you're already thinking of many places where you can hide it, so go ahead and do that.Quote from: Hatchy on April 11, 2023, 09:32:45 PMor storing it on a USB drive.A flash drive could break at any time, and you should not trust it to hold your private keys.

But most people today use passwords with easy-to-guess combinations, because when they forget one time they will still remember what password they used so there will be successful attempts. Use strong password combinations that are not easy to guess. My bank password is even worse, it's just a 6-number sequence.",

Well, never say never. The passphrase that extends the seed needs to be complex enough. A \"1234\" as a passphrase provides very little in terms of additional security.
