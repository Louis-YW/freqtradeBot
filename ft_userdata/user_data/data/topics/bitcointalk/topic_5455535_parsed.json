  "content": "As the new administration of President Bola Tinubu kicks off properly, the ground has been hit ruined and the government is taking steps to help revitalize the economy and also taking steps to strengthen the naira against the United States dollar which is the major exchange currency in the international stock market. Major breakthrough by the new government: 1: one of the significant moves this government made was the president's inaugural speech where he declared that fuel subsidy is gone since then we have seen the impact of that speech on the petroleum product PMs pump price, but with its long-term gain on the economy as the government now gives licenses to independent markets and private individuals to import petroleum and sell at market price, that means more competition that will eventually lead to price case. 2: border reopening,  this have been a speculation around the social media that the president have have reopened the Nigerian border which has been closed by the past administration all throughout the 8 years tenure, and this will open up the Nigerian economy to the international marketplace where. Exchange of goods and services will take place. What impact does all of this have on the value of the naira against the dollars? My analysis of the term: The naira has been devalued furthermore by the Central Bank of Nigeria from the official price of ₦‎464 to $1 to around ₦‎645 as a unified exchange price according to the new government, well we all know that the dollar's official price has always been under subsidy too, since at the black market all of us who are into cryptocurrency already used to the black market price of ₦‎700+ for the past one year or also so we are more enlightened that other members of the public on how much the government pay as dollars subsidy just to keep the exchange rate at that so-called official price of ₦‎464.So at this point what can we make out of this situation and at the same time what are the advantage that awaits traders most especially cryptocurrency traders and those that exchange their USTD, Bitcoin and other digital assets into the Nigeria naira in this period? Do you think the unified exchange rate will stabilize the naira value?",

Exchange of goods and services will take place. I have seen this news in almost all the social media platforms today but I haven’t seen any official announcement of it in any newspapers or news channel, maybe if there’s any you’ve seen, you can send here and update the thread.QuoteWhat impact does all of this have on the value of the naira against the dollars? My analysis of the term: The naira has been devalued furthermore by the Central Bank of Nigeria from the official price of ₦‎464 to $1 to around ₦‎645 as a unified exchange price according to the new governmentThis is something unarguable that the naira has devalued furthermore against dollar. But what still baffles me is that the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele is still denying this fact and keeps claiming that the value is still the same as ₦464 till date. QuoteSo at this point what can we make out of this situation and at the same time what are the advantage that awaits traders most especially cryptocurrency traders and those that exchange their USTD, Bitcoin and other digital assets into the Nigeria naira in this period? For those that exchange their assets to naira in this period they’ll definitely inquire a lot of gain than the previous ones. Some people have been waiting for this period in order to cash out lots of money but the real fact is that devaluing of naira against dollar will only make life more difficult for the common man.QuoteDo you think the unified exchange rate will stabilize the naira value? I pray so, there’re many things that still needs to be done before we can achieve that but I hope and pray that with time the FG will be able to make it unified. If that happens, the naira value in the global market will be much appreciated.",

      "body": "The less a country rely on imported goods, the more its currency likely to have more value to dollar, and this bold moved taken by our new president by removing fuel subsidy hence licencing local producers and private individuals to venture into the sell of petroleum products is a very good move that we will all benefits in time. While the opening of border is another smart move taken by this new administration, as it will enable people now import goods in and out of the country without relying on monopoly which always causes the price of goods to increase since he has no competitors.Quote from: Wiwo on June 06, 2023, 09:53:47 PMThe naira has been devalued furthermore by the Central Bank of Nigeria from the official price of ₦‎464 to $1 to around ₦‎645 as a unified exchange price according to the new government, In regards to this, I think that was a rumor which the CBN went on it's official Twitter handle to announce to the public that it never devalued the naira, but still maintains its official rate of #465 per $1",

Exchange of goods and services will take place. Although I am yet to see any legit news source publish this news, but I have two different thoughts about this boarder reopening.1. It will improve our dollar rate if our citizens are trading their home made goods abroad.2. I am a bit concern about famers who's farm products has getting value due to the boarder closure, if the boarder is open, some of our citizens will prefer importing some of these goods which will devalue our home made foods.QuoteWhat impact does all of this have on the value of the naira against the dollars? Do you think the unified exchange rate will stabilize the naira value? The unified exchange rate will be the possible solution because the price can easily be controlled, but if the price differs, it will be difficult to control and our naira will keep devaluing even though CBN are denying it.",

I disregard what I read on social media and other unverifiable news outlets, they are mainly there for the money and often sell propaganda whether it's right or wrong. Their motive is to be one of the first outlets to propagate the news which is not always giving the right information.What I know about this unification of the exchange rate is that it's still a proposal, it can't be done immediately because a president wants or says it. It's outside Tinubu's jurisdiction, and he could only force the CBN governor politically if their views are not aligning.For the avoidance of doubt, have you checked the official exchange rate on external websites online to confirm whether Emefiele is telling lies or not? I did on 7 websites and the average remains N461 per $1 as before.",

      "body": "@EarnOnVictor @Hyphen(-)@CryptoHeadlineNews I greet una special, although I just want to clear some air here, just like I mentioned in the thread this is just a rumour but there is a high possibility of this happening since the president have constantly mentioned that there will be no multiple exchange rate in the nigeria stock market and also a unified exchange rate will never leave naira at it current state and price there will definitely be adjustment in the value of the naira against the dollars since the government is paying high subsidies to keep naira at it current official price. We in the cryptocurrency industry already know the differences and we are constantly in contact with the price USTD vs Naira since either ways we have to exchange your bitcoin or other coins into naira using the united state dollars as the exchange rate determination and since we already know how much we sell at the black market which is some where as high as ₦750+.",

I know say politicians get stake for this him refinery but I hope Tinubu no go allow them spoil his government. I believe say in the next couple of weeks to months ahead the price of things is going fo crash further just as there are beginning to wake up to the reality on the ground and by so doing there is high market competition e.g the recent crash is the price of cooking gas,  Kerosine and other petroleum product who's subsidy were removed around 2021-2022 wherein the price then skyrocketed. But right now that sector is beginning to witness competition and the price is already crashing same will happen with PMs when independent marketer will start importing petroleum into the country.",

Buhari closed all the Western Eastern and Southern Boarders and Open all the Northern Boarders. Now Tinubu has come again, Open all the BOARDERS AT THE WESTERN PART and the Eastern and Southern Boarders are still in tight close yet the ignorant youths in these places are happy that Tinubu has open boarders. Port Harcourt and Bayelsa Boarders are in tight close. From my distance look at things, even the present present is not for good for the East and South but for the West and North.

I'd dollar dey rise cryptocurrency traders and investors go make money from dollar but go still loss when dem go change it to Naira.
