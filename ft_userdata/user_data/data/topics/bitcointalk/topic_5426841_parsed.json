      "body": "Find a sales job that is commission only that you can work on your own time. Then learn the industry really well and practice, practice, practice making calls and closing deals. There are plenty of sales training videos on YouTube that you can which many are industry-specific so all you have to do is put in the effort to learn.There are many profitable industries that are always in need of sales agents. Insurance, Loans, Mortgages, Real Estate, Investing, etc.Make sure the commission is at least $500 to make it worth your time. If you can close 1 deal per week putting in 1-2 hours a day, then that is $2000 per month extra income.",
