  "content": "For me it has always been blissful doing remote work because I can for certain schedule and meet up deadlines without many distractions in form of much sleep, tv programs, or food. I don't think however that this is quite easy for some because this requires some kind of discipline. The way we respond swiftly or sluggishly to a situation that involves investment, be it income or time is mostly a result of one's current organization. Do you after work, set your station in order? Do you create and remember mind maps for ease of continuation where you left off? Can you recover accounts either lost or passwords forgotten, painstakingly?  Since the outbreak of covid 19, during which remote work gained massive adoption, living and working efficiently has of course been redefined. The bitcoin space has gained more followership, because people could sit from their comfort and make money by investing or trading online. Thanks to technology. It takes a level of organization for one to be able to maintain multiple streams of income, wallet, and investments. What is your most efficient way to staying organised? What strategies do you employ should you have a need to declutter? How do you know the right time to declutter and re-organize?",

In my own case, I tend to reduce clutters to a minimum as an organised schedule helps keep me focused and determined. So if peradventure I leave my workspace disorganized, and need to declutter, I employ the method of putting them into boxes marked so as to enable me easily locate them when I have a need for them.",

The mistake most people make and why their space become most unorganized is because they wait for their space to be completely scattered before they choose to organize it. My method of staying organized is to not wait for everywhere to first be scattered but Keep things properly arranged on the go, doing things the right time as well and avoiding procrastination.",
