  "content": "If you have been here long enough and have actively participated and engaged in discussion about bitcoin in the various boards, chances are that you have become more financially literate and intellectually curious than many of your peers who are not involved in bitcoin. To put it another way, if you had taken a pretest on financial literacy before joining this forum say in 2021 assuming you were a complete bitcoin noob and scored poorly. If you are given the same test in 2024, after actively engaging in the community, you'd likely score much higher. Simply by being involved, discussing, and learning from other members, your financial literacy could easily double or more compared to when you first registered.. In addition, other things that you would have seen happen to you within the time are that:You will tend to be intellectually curious and emotionally stableyou will value personal growth, relationships, community over material possessionsThis is the result of a study by a behavioral scientist from University of Toronto called Stefano Di Domenico, PhD presented at a Canadian Bitcoin Conference.  Now, although the data wasn't collected on this forum specifically I find it relevant to bitcoiners in generalize and can be applied to our community. At least I speak for myself and newbies who I have watched go from making off-topic posts to engaging in intellectual discussions about bitcoin and related topics. What do you guys think. Are the findings of the study relatable in your experience, or that of someone you know on this forum or elsewhere?",

Reading different kinds of threads in here made me curious and interested and therefore allowed me to go beyond what I know and really study other details about bitcoin or crypto. I also think that not only in crypto but just in life general, this forum has helped me. It has given me advices when it comes to financial and career options. The impact this forum has is definitely something researchers should study.",

Found bitcoin when I had near-zero(knowledge of a fresh college grad with a non-finance degree) financial/economic knowledge, only the thought that I needed a 'currency' to use online without having a bank account.After bitcoin then rose in price from approx $700 to around $3000, I was like — \"what the heck is this Bitcoin thing anyway and why is it going up\".

I am not saying I just earn from the forum; I learn how to make money from crypto. At the beginning of joining the forum, I only knew about Bitcoin but wasn't aware of how it actually works. From the forum, I learned about cryptocurrency and how we can take advantage of it. I engaged in a valuable discussion thread and learned. Though there is no end point to learning, what I learned helped me a lot to become financially stable. I learn crypto marketing and trading from where I am making money from home. So if someone concentrates on learning and has good intentions, they should be financially stable here.",

I’m gonna be honest and say that I do feel like I am part of a much exclusive elite community compared to my peers who aren’t aware of bitcoin forum lol.But seriously speaking, if I were to teach someone about crypto this is probably where I will direct them to. Sure there are many articles out there however to be able to converse and participate in a community-based platform is always much better.QuoteYou will tend to be intellectually curious and emotionally stableyou will value personal growth, relationships, community over material possessionsThis happens because you have to remind yourself that you are interacting with real life people with real life opinions and you have to be respectful and kind to everyone yiu encounter.",

I find it hard that people that are still not exposed to bitcoin investing are still existing especially those people that are at my age, that's really surprising and like people don't really care about the fact that they should be investing into something to get profit for their future expenses? I mean it weirds me out but I do get it because not everyone has an extra money to spare when it comes to investment as not everyone who works have a really good paying jobs and even if they do, most people would choose the happiness of buying stuff that would help them along the way rather than risking it on something that they don't know much about.",

If you're actively engaging in the forum discussion and you're still struggling financially, it means you have a big issue to deal with. I mean, is there any financial concept we've not discussed here? And the beautiful thing I love here is that you're not just talking to people that aren't talking there financial life seriously or that have no result to show up for. Apart from this being a Bitcoin discussion niche, I can boldly say that this is the most organized and active financial forum I've ever come across.When I started, I had zero knowledge on Bitcoin And the whole crypto ecosystem and had to struggle to read multiples of threads so as to even have a grasp of the basic knowledge that will help me strive well here. Could only contribute in my local board because other board discussion appeared too complex for me but with time, things have changed and my thought process and intellectual capacity has broadened too well that I can comfortably air out my views on other board without sounding too foolish. Still remembered that I made so many inaccurate replies on the speculation board that were considered off topic to some thread and I had to learn so many things and accepted all the critics and it has helped me grow in the forum till this moment.The advantage of being a part of this forum suppases mere growing in rank or even joining a particular signature campaign. The aspect of the forum discussion that causes you to exploit your inquisitive prowess and causes you to think outside of the box when engaging in the forum discussion is an advantage you can't undermine.",

I think the multiple boards sectioned and divided into more sub-sections is really smart and makes it very easy to navigate through. Sure there could be some improvements to make here and there however I think in general it’s really good and simple compared to other platforms out there. I also think that the merit system along with the trust system makes it easier to identify which ones to kind of look out for in a sense.",

One thing I observed is that you will keep on learning something new everyday here in the forum and that would broaden your knowledge on bitcoin and bitcoin related stuffs. I was a noob when I joined the forum with no hope of investment, but this community made it possible for me to exploit from cryptocurrency through the knowledge that I got here.I am also more financially buoyant compared to then. This forum has helped a lot of members to plan and have opportunities for other means of income. Most of my friends don't understand a bit in bitcoin, but look at me given the opportunity to invest in a future gold and the latest form of currency with great value. Knowledge is power.",

Good thing that you did get interested in bitcoin but I don't think that total disinterest is a real thing for you to happen OP, I'm pretty sure that you're going to be interested to any investment that will be shown to you no matter because you're going to be seeing the money that will be involved, you might've also fallen for a lot of Ponzi schemes if it weren't for you not getting interested in bitcoin.

I have also learnt to navigate debt by investment of more time and coins in Bitcoin, because whether anyone would like to agree or not, the future of Bitcoin dominance is here and it showed to observers and investors alike after the halving, that Bitcoin has a strong potential of dominating the financial aspect in the world more than BRICS currency or Brexit or dollar would.",
