There have been few lucky lottery winners around the world and they are well known, nothing happened to them when the news broke out, but I understand that not all countries are the same. I choose to start gambling because there is now online gambling, what I don't want people to know about me is my involvement in gambling, and online gambling platforms solve the problem, I don't want my people to have a wrong sentiment about me and to avoid some lies and gossip about me that's why I don't do local casino gambling. NYC's saved more than many realize, the damage that a casino who requests no KYC can do is way higher than the damages that a regulated casino can do, the gut that people have to share information with a non-regulated casino is crazy, some use their credit cards on such platform.",

The benefits you added to your list, people want to bypass all of them without doing KYC I agree with you on the need for privacy in the gambling industry or any online platform that allow us to use cryptocurrencies which,  whose main aim is to give it user privacy and freedom in their online activities,  this is what makes up for whatever becomes of the frame up of the mind to either hand out their personal details and documents on some of the online site that there has less trust on. But then also we have to look at KYC and what are its possibilities to our contemporary online life ranging from centralized exchanges and other financial services providers that cryptocurrencies users may not be able to do without,  but need to comply with regulations,  this makes KYC in some cases an unavoidable evil that we need to face.",

Human beings can't ever be trusted and not companies as well, this is why KYC is good, at least it's a layer of knowing companies and the people dealing with them.I do wonder how some people would be defending No-KYC. I believe any no-KYC casinos should never be trusted as they might have something they are hiding, they might be possibly daring and not just responsible. No person or company that means well for the world to keep it safe from illicit activities would shun KYC, and the risk of dealing with such company is very high.The exception to this are mixers, by practice, they are to increase privacy for the purpose of having huge money that you might want out of the prime eyes' radar.

Who knows what they are capable of when we don't know them?Privacy is important, but except that I really don't like the \"paperwork\". Why would I bother providing all the documentation to some casino? In my opinion, it's pretty discouraging, KYC can't improve my gaming experience.

Crypto should be open for all and free for all! So KYC is not in crypto spirit and that's another reason why I don't like it at all.",

Although, I have never seen or heard of a case involving a casino before but most people are afraid of their personal information being stolen, we all have read how someone was faced with a huge problem because someone was was able to steal his data from an exchange where he completed his kyc and after much investigation it was finally discovered that it was not him but instead a hacker. So unlike the reason you have started; the main reason why users don’t like kyced casino is simply because they value their privacy.Quote from: Kakmakr on November 13, 2023, 05:55:45 AM7.

I am playing Devil's advocate... if you did not notice it.  I think it's fine to use KYC in today's world when gambling online. In the past it may have been that people really wanted to protect their personal information and where scared that other people find out that they gamble online. However, the world has changed over the last few years and it became much more common to gamble online. The boom of crypto casinos due to the covid lockdowns meant that a lot of people have enjoyed gambling from home and it's not something only a few have done. Among my friends almost everybody has visited online casinos a few times in the last 2 years and using KYC became the normality. There is no reason to feel bad about gambling online and also sharing our personal information happens at so many different levels when browsing the internet. In my opinion we just have to accept the KYC requirenments and move on. As long as the casino keeps our personal information safe I don't have any issues and if there was an issue with safekeeping and storage of KYC data I would probably switch casinos.",

In overall, elites manage to launder money with or without KYC through banks, verification doesn't matter if you have deep pockets. See the scandals of money laundering though one of the biggest bank in the world, deutsche bank.2. Yes, it may reduce under age gambling but teens can also ask other adults to borrow account and gamble with adults account, that's not a big deal too.3. Doesn't make sense.4. Doesn't make sense.5. Valid point but take care of digital security and you won't face that problem.6. KYC is forced by governments.7. I can't agree with you here, it's very individual process. There are casinos that really care about their customers and there are ones that try to use the weaknesses of their users as advantage.8. Yes, good point.I suggest you to keep in mind that people use bitcoin for it's anonymity and decentralization. When you use Bitcoin, you care about your privacy and bitcoin casino should be the one that will help you to take care of your privacy. If they ask you for KYC and your bitcoins are traced or getting watched where they come and go, then it's meaningless to use crypto. There is a fiat for privacy-less world.",

Because I stadistically, the more webpages or services have our information, it becomes more likely our information will end up in the hand of criminals. So, I have got no problem to give my information to one or two big casinos which I can trust to some degree because they have got a big budget for security and whatnot, but it is completely different when one is the kind of person who likes to go around testing new casinos and in a year gives all their personal information to them. It only takes one of those casinos to commit a security mistake and one face, passport, name, etc would be used by anyone somewhere to steal our identity online and get us in trouble for no reason. I have not problem when AML measures or anything used to stop criminals, since I would not care less for them.",
