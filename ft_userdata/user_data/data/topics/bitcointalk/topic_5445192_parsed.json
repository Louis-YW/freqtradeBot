  "content": "I have been paying around in reflection tokens since the category started two years ago.Recently I have seen a new style of Reflection-token. It's a combination of: (Reflections + Defi) to create hopefully sustainable reflections.This could solve the issue most reflection tokens have, which is lowering volumes as new user growth is saturated.I have found three projects in this category right now. All three are super microcaps, still being at or under 1 million MC. IMO these have extreme moon potential: (BSC) FATCAT  https://fatcat.army/(BSC) DARKTAVERN  https://darktavern.online/(ETH) FUNICULAR https://funicular.info/In slightly different ways, they all convert some of the reflection tax into yield Defi positions, then use the passive ROI to invest back in their token economy, creating sustainable perpetual feedback loops.Honestly, these three get me super excited!",
