Bitnaka paid you while citybuildtrade refused to do the same?LOL, This OP is really funny, he promotes Bitnaka which is a Ponzi project and its scam currency, I think he is part of this scam project, and today you find him posting to warn the community about Citybuildtrade.I do not know what motivated this OP to be contradictory, but perhaps he would like to use his intelligence to gain the trust of members because of his warnings for another project, but it was better for him, before posting his topic about the Citybuildtrade.com project, to reconsider the project that he promoted in cold blood to deceive traders that the project offers trading bots.As for Citybuildtrade.com, if we go to review sites such as Trustpilot, we will find many bad reviews about it as a scam platform, so yes, this is a scam project that we cannot trust.",

I have seen several forum members who were promoted Ponzi but later become reputed for detecting scam. And build their reputation on the forum. They received negative but as they changed their minds negative changed to neutral. Or deleted previous feedback. So, op may try to do the same and if really that can then that will not be bad.",

What benefit will its token give us when the project itself doesn't have real team and idea? People buy in because they know the project team is working honestly, good roadmap, secure contract and their community is very strong.The project you promoting is just Ponzi scheme and has nothing behind the scene. you are now trying to report same kind of projects so that your tag and flag may be removed. you are decieving yourself. no member will hear you. Quote from: Researchoo on February 09, 2023, 07:38:07 PMok, sir no worries we will delete our review from bitcointalk.org you were advised many times to stop promoting but you ignored and continued promoting and now when you tagged you saying this and has not Deleted yet",

Regardless, you should either create a new topic about it or discuss it with existing topics at Altcoin Discussions or Trading Discussions topics. Mate, you stay on topic, which was your initial post about the Citybuildtrade scam. Additionally, you should explain why you are operating Bitnaka, an obvious Ponzi scheme. In fact, Bitnaka and Citybuildtrade are identical. They are both fraudulent ponzi schemes. There are numerous ways to make money. If you want to earn good karma, you need to stop defrauding others.",

You must be feeling very grateful with this \"small amount\" of withdraw that you promoted them.

You have not created any post before this one and also you have not created any post after this one.Let me think you are a legit person and you have no-connection with the site.You have invested a small fund so they may not scam and they may wait for a large amount.
