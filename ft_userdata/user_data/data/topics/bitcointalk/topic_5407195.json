  "content": "Everyone has negative connotations when it comes to gambling activity but little that we know that gambling when done in moderation can offer great benefits to our mental and physical health and finance.According to this articles[1][2][3] gambling if done in moderation can give us the following benefits.Makes you Happier - this is no doubt a known effect of gambling and is backed by studies.  It was said that the happiness of individuals rose when they are engaged in gambling activities.QuoteStudies by the Behavior analysis and therapy program at Southern Illinois University have shown that gambling can positively improve your mood and cause happiness. The results of the study showed that people who gambled as a hobby were happier overall than people who did not.The study showed that the level of happiness in individuals rose while they were engaged in gambling activities. When compared with those who used the television as a source of entertainment, the individuals who gambled were happier. Engaging in gambling as a hobby is a surefire way to improve your life and happiness.Stress reduction - stress factor is one of the major reason why many people become depressed and possible mental degradation and retardation.  Gambling as an entertainment help to minimize this stress.  Gambling in moderation is also known for its stress-relieving effect.QuoteBlackjack, a casino game helps to reduce stress. So many people suffer severe mental degradation and retardation because of stress. Stress makes the brain cells dull and people who suffer from stress risk having serious health challenges. If you are suffering from stress and you go King Billy casino and play the game of Blackjack, it will take your mind away from the things that are bothering you at the moment. You can also play casino games online from the comfort of your homes through gambling apps created by gambling companies.For example, when playing Blackjack, you need to take the money winning aspect as a bonus and enjoy the fun of the game.Stress is reduced by the fun and amusement created by sports betting and playing casino games. Blackjack is an effective stress reliever.Relaxation and Comfort -  relaxation and comfort help the brain to erase any traces of or form of worries from the mind.  It also safeguard our mental health.QuoteRelaxation and comfort are two factors that help to protect and safeguard the mental health of humans. Most people that make huge amounts of money from gambling use it to have fun and entertain themselves. Relaxation and comfort comes when you are having fun. Relaxation and comfort calms the brain and erases every form of worries from the mind.Gambling activities have so many economic benefits to the game players. People who engage in gambling activities can make money and also manage this profits effectively. However, the health benefits of gambling make it a very attractive proposition. Happiness, stress reduction, increase in social networking, the sharpening of the mind, and the performance of the brain due to relaxation and comfort are the surprising health benefits of gambling. So if you want to enjoy a good mental health, engage in sports betting and play casino games.Improves your Skills -  this is more focus on observation, reaction and mental task of brain on determining patterns and numbers.  This is very beneficial to brain since it exercises our brain when engaged in gambling activity.QuoteGambling enables you to pick up skills while playing. You learn to be more observant, mentally task your brain, and study patterns and numbers. It is suitable for your mental health to keep your brain engaged with the activity actively. Using strategy and tactics to try and win helps you to exercise mentally.Learning how to play a new casino game, for example, involves you trying to carry out your complex strategy to achieve your goal of winning. This helps keep your brain in tip-top shape. For instance, in blackjack, you would need to know the rules and use your own devised strategy to win the game.Helps with Socialization -  human are social beings, so every person has a need to belong.  Gambling activities help provide this to people engaged in gambling.QuoteGambling helps with socialization among individuals. As we mentioned earlier, gambling is a form of entertainment, and this brings people together. Some side benefits which materialize as a result of this socialization include relaxation. Some individuals enjoy using some of their share cash to gamble and relax with friends.Games like blackjack and poker are games that bring more than one player to interact, play, and win all in a friendly setting. Studies have shown that most individuals report that they enjoy gambling because it gives them an escape from the everyday routine of life.Potential for Big Wins Well gambling is a game of chance where if you got lucky and hit a huge multiplier, you can bring home a huge amount of money.QuoteWhatever the main reason might be for your gambling, every time you place a wager, there is a chance you end up winning big.Certain games such as video slots are capable of producing wins that are worth several hundred or even several thousand times your bet.Albeit rare, when this happens, you’ll get to feel like a big winner. But it’s not just about emotions.If you’re gambling in moderation and only spend a certain amount of money each week or each month, if you are lucky enough to hit that big win, it will provide you with a small fortune that you can put towards a specific goal.For example, you could go on a nice vacation or spend it on something you’ve always wanted to buy but never had enough cash handy. It is essential that you put your gambling winnings towards something that you actually want, and not put them all back into the casino or poker software. The thrill of a big win can be quite overwhelming and make you feel invincible. However, the nature of gambling is such that you will eventually lose the money back. There is absolutely no reason to increase your stakes or your gambling budget just because you had won. Use the money for something non-gambling related and stick to your usual playing style.Engaging in gambling in moderation will greatly save us financial losses compared to engaging in entertainment outdoor.  Aside from that, recreational activities such as picnics, watching movies, and playing arcade games often have our finance in an outflow system.  The only reward is entertainment and happiness whereas, if engage in gambling there is a chance of getting back what we spent since gambling always involved a chance of getting back what we bet in a certain multiplier. Of course, we are talking about gambling in moderation.  Besides this kind of control, we are far from developing a gambling disorder.Aside from the personal benefits, we are also contributing to our country's income by playing in their gambling infrastructure.  It is proven that the development of gambling addiction in a gambling engagement in moderation is highly unlikely.  With that, do you think it is worth moderating our gambling engagement to maximize the benefits of gambling activities?[1] https://www.healthtechzone.com/topics/healthcare/articles/2019/11/21/443799-health-benefits-gambling.htm[2] https://holycitysinner.com/2020/08/17/the-surprising-health-benefits-of-gambling/[3] https://www.mypokercoaching.com/benefits-of-gambling/#:~:text=Gambling%20in%20moderation%20can%20help,to%20escape%20your%20usual%20worries.",

QuoteDopamine is known as the “feel-good” hormone. It gives you a sense of pleasure. It also gives you the motivation to do something when you're feeling pleasure. Dopamine is part of your reward system.",

      "body": "This is an interesting article- most of the time we associate and perceive gambling addiction as something negative. But with the article you posted, there are at least, some positive effects of gambling when done in moderation. I guess, we often times overlook the things that give us positive effects when done in moderation.Though I am curious- is gambling done in moderation considered also an addiction? I mean, if something is done consistently, will that tantamount and equate to addiction? I just hope that the fact that gambling in moderation can bring positive results, this does not rationalize and advocate gambling in general.",

So, they may not be too happy when winning, and not too sad when losing. if we have good on those things at least, we can control our emotions not to feel depression every time we are losing or not winning. But, this doesn't mean that we only control the emotion, but we must also analyze and learn why we are losing, there should be any evaluation and expect to have winning later. SOmeone who are often losing in gambling commonly will easily get stressed and depression, moreover if they are not using free money for gambling, itis a big mistake and disaster for him and also for family probabily.
