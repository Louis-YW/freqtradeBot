Learn how to trade, create a workable strategy, back test it to see if it's really worth it, and then you can think about bots.",

There are also bots that have a working duration according to the bot's price when you buy it. If I'm not mistaken, the pro you mean, does it have anything to do with the price of the bot when purchased?",

If you don't have these things, other trading way will not work. Of course, now several mobile apps or bot systems have come out for trading, but if one could only use them to succeed in trading without their own strategy, then the experienced people in the field of trading would not have any value and most of the people would be billionaires.

Bots can execute trades and react to market conditions at a much faster pace than human traders.  They can monitor multiple markets simultaneously, analyze vast amounts of data, and execute trades with precision and speed, which means it works on behalf of you by following your command.  This allows for quicker order placement, reducing the risk of missing out on profitable opportunities.But of course, IMO I only use a trusted and proven automated bot not like what OP mentioned, it's uncommon.",

Very well spoken my friend, the market is very dynamic, this is one important thing we all must understand in the first place, the way the market behaved lets say a week ago, might not be the same way it is behaving today, and if I must point this out, the dynamicity of the market can only be matched by the dynamicity of the human brain, not trading bot can be configured to work like the human mind or brain, and as such, it is difficult for a bot to match the dynamics of the market going forward into the future...This is because, a trading bot is configured to reason or behave in a certain pattern, that pattern is the same pattern the market is showing, at any time the market shifts from that pattern into another, and the developer of the bot is not there to update the bot, it becomes very difficult for such a bot trade and make profit because, it is now operating on a pattern that is different from the pattern of the market .",
