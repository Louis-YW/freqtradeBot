Bitcoin is always profitable in the long run for me,even if we mine it at a loss still we would be in great profit during the next bull run.Many people will argue that you can buy the coin which is a set and forget process compared to the ongoing complicated mining with devices which need some supervision.For me this can be a choice but most likely when you buy the coins you most likely are not that engaged and you may miss important price changes while when mining you are daily checking your devices to see their performance and as such you won't miss a thing.",
