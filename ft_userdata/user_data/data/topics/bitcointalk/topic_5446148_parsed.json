  "content": "Hi guys!I was just going through the profiles of different legendary rank members in the forum. While admiring their achievements through the ranks, their numbers of posts, merits. And I felt wowed by their years of dedication to the forum. In my thoughts and out of curiosity I said to myself has other forum members ever pondered or wanting to know  a few legendaries rank members with the highest posts and merits in the forum. And how has the journey so far being for them in their achievements of such milestone.Myself I currently have no knowledge of these supposed forum members and am curious same time excited to know, and am sure there are some others like me that would be eager to know too.  So please can forum members endeavor to post a screenshot of their profiles here to enable us acknowledge them. To avoid spamming I am limiting the number of legendary profiles to five (5) screenshots per post to enable us achieve the main aim/objective of this thread. Aim:* At least newbies and other  rank members like myself would be reminded of the time, energy, wealth of knowledge and dedication these legendary members have put in for the propagation and quality of the forum since the years.* A way to show acknowledgement to all legendary rank members in the forum.* That with determination, legendary rank is possible for anyone.This thread was inspired through by the post of bullrun2020bro  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5251894.0 Feel free to drop any corrections!",

It sounds to me like what you want isn’t a screenshot of their profile but a interview to hear their experience being on the forum. There is already a thread to that effect  Some users have shared their opinions on certain subjects on that interview. Others like fillippone have shared their story and given advice on how newbies can increase their rank.",

BPIP, Merit Dashboard and Ninjastic.space and Loyce.club can tell all about these statistics. If in fact the idea is to encourage newbies to have more motivation to reach Legendary, then I think they just need to increase their interest in forums and bitcoin.",

Those were really the years when spam flourished on the entire forum, now it's only a little camouflaged in some boards, but it's far from disappeared.",

This is the fate of most signature participants, or does it pay to shy away from the reality?Listen, I understand what you are talking about, but this forum was not created for the reason that members earn money from signature campaigns, because in the first years they probably did not even exist. Many of us came to this forum (including me) without even knowing what a signature campaign was, and I have been a member since 2015. I only joined the first campaign when I became a full member, even though I had something in my signature even before that.As for the campaigns and their rules, I don't want to comment too much in that direction, but I never liked the \"minimum post\" option because it only forces people to behave unnaturally and do what they don't really want to do. You don't have to run away from reality, but then accept your \"job\" as a real job (even though it shouldn't be like that).Just a note, I am not currently in a paid sig campaign.",
