For traders who agree that trading is same with gambling, they are just lazy to go into work and adopt the ethical way to trade and those are:1. To cut your losses and increase your profit: You can conveniently do this by using stop loss or take profit adjustment or trailing stop but in gambling, is one straight end once you have gone on the bet, you either loss all you bet or win or you bet for.2. A trader can adjust his risk appetite by reducing the lots size to suit his account and determine his appropriate leverage but in gambling, a bettor has to go with the odds provided for the gay. He can't reduce or increase it against the fixed odds.3. Traders use analytical tools to determine what market price will be and wait for appropriate timing but gamblers play by the rules of casino.

They are different but having some similarities too.One of the similarities is that a new trader can be trading,  having no strategy and technical or fundamental analytic means to use trading to earn profit. But instead, they trade for luck and fail. There are some traders that we use as an example of gamblers that lost high amount of money, but to trading in just some minutes, hours or days. So if representing trading as gambling for newbie traders, and also letting them know how different both are, it is good.Definitely, trading is different from gambling. People that are trading and also gambling like people like us know the differences. They are very different. What I can say is that trading is more flexible in making profit and you can try to have some strategies to try to want to minimize losses and still make better profits, but which gambling do not offer. Trading can be more attached to success even as dangerous as it can be, discipline and having the right strategies and trading experience are what that are required.But it is still worth it to always say that trading is as risky as gambling.",

If newbies trade in a wrong way and luckily make profit or fail to make profit doesn't make it to be the right way to trade so it should not be classed as the way to trade. Every trader today have done trading with luck and succeed or lose as a newbie . That is why we understand better today to show newbies that luck doesn't carry you all the way in trading.Quote from: Oshosondy on June 18, 2023, 12:22:21 PMDefinitely, trading is different from gambling.

There are many types of bets available in gambling, How can you say sports betting, poker, slots like trading, is there any graphics or volume there or cheap or expensive coins to buy and sell, of course not.Crypto trading, as far as I know and I have done there are only a few options, such as: Spot, Futures, Margin, it is clear that in these three options trading activities are not the same as gambling, for me there are certain things to learn about crypto trading to get good profit, in understanding it is quite clear betting and options trading are different in every way.",

      "body": "I think trading is more profitable than gambling. Trading here will not face much loss but if the market goes down for a time it will go up again. And very few people lose by trading, most people gain from it. But I have noticed that in gambling when a person places a bet it is not certain whether he will win or lose. But many gamblers keep playing and lose and lose all their money causing huge loss to their business. If an intelligent person starts trading then he will definitely go for trading because trading brings profit. But if a person does not gamble much for his business then he must make mistakes as the rate of loss is higher than the profit. Betting in gambling mostly depends on luck so I think it is better to avoid gambling.",

You require luck in gambling but you require work in trading. What is your thought.Absolutely right, because, but after reading your post i am forced to contemplate that, we used to say \"invest in crypto with what you do not afraid to lose\". and we also used to say \"play in gambling with what you do not afraid to lose\". Then what other difference remains there, i have read so many topics like these and always thought we have to see this issue from the eye of a gambler too, who is making strategies in a few gambling games, to increase his win rate and when that person will read this topic, he will be totally satisfied with your points but few things will be unclear for him, like the one i have already mentioned and the risk of failure is also very higher in both terms. Now the point is, no wonder trading is not gambling but it becomes gambling just like blunt gambling in which you do not understand the functioning of the game and how the casino is working, like either they are working in favor of customers or are eager to fill their own pockets plus what strategies they are using and how I can decode them. etc. etc. i am not a gambler and i might not have used the exact terms to explain it but the context remains the same. They are different things because we have way more tools to analyze the market in comparison to gambling. And gambling at the start involved many illegal activities no wonder crypto (trading) also involved that but gambling was on at bigger scale, plus gambling will make your living worse if you are so addicted to it, in my thought, gambling is not a good thing to do.",

      "body": "Gambling has some partial similarity, which is uncertainty in the outcome of your trade or bet. It's just that when you stake a game, you are not sure if you will win; even if you speculatively expect to win, it might end in a loss. In trading, someone could be good at technically analyzing the market movement, but there is still every possibility that the market can go in the opposite direction of your prediction. But one good thing about trading is that, even if the market goes against your predicted direction, you will still have your coins with you. But it depends on the kind of trade you enter. If it's a normal buy and sell order, you have the advantage of still holding your coin until the price goes up before you sell, but if it's future trading, a trader's asset could easily get liquidated. In gambling, if you lose, then you have lost all the money you staked; you will not have anything left to yourself, but in trading, you could apply a strategy called stop loss and take profit,\" which in gambling is nothing like that.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

Yes, in trading, people come and learn to trade to get profits, which can indeed be learned and applied, even with high risks too. Meanwhile, gambling is clearly based on luck being the main factor. I don't deny that trading requires luck, but luck can be achieved if we can understand market conditions when we trade. Logically if trading and gambling are the same, why don't more gamblers not come to trading? but on the contrary, many traders actually go to gambling after they get profits to have fun there. At least that's what I've seen so far from the habits of a trader and gambler.",

If someone compares trading with gambling and considers trading as gambling then it is up to the trader, then trading does not become gambling. There are two categories of gambling, sports betting and casino gambling, where different gamblers have their different preferences for gambling. Trading is an investor's place, where professional traders engage with their talent and experience. So a trader must have experience, talent, and knowledge about how the market works before going into trading. And those who come to the market without any skill and lose their funds by trading, in fact they are not even gamblers, they are greedy and lazy people who think that they can easily get everything without any effort. So it seems to me that trading is misused by some people as an easy way of making money, and as a result they end up losing their capital.",
