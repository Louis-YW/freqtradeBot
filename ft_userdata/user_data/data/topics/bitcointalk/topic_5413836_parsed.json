  "content": "Alik BakhshiRussian-Ukrainian war of 2022- ... for the salvation of the World      The war started by Russia with Ukraine took on a protracted positional character. Undoubtedly, Ukraine was ready for a surprise attack by Russian hordes, which Russia had been massing along the entire border with Ukraine for several months, ostensibly, according to the official version of the Kremlin, for the usual planned military exercises. The assurances of the Empire of Lies were taken seriously in Kyiv. The words of the famous liar Putin were taken properly, which was demonstrated - the Russian attack bogged down. The hope to take Kyiv in 2-3 days turned out to be reckless. The planned blitzkrieg turned into a blitzkrieg for the aggressor. Putin failed to seize Ukraine for the Victory Parade. (1) Having lost a significant amount of equipment and personnel, the Russians switched to a war of attrition, relying on Russia's resource incomparable to Ukraine. However, the West, realizing that the Ukrainian people are not ready to part with their newly acquired freedom and will stand for it to the death, decided to provide military assistance, despite the Kremlin's threats about its readiness to start the Third World War. How can one not refer to the results of the Russian-Finnish war of 1939-1940, shameful for Russia, in which, despite the colossal quantitative superiority in weapons and human resources, the Russians could not conquer the Finnish people, and in fact the entire population of Finland did not exceed the population of Leningrad alone . By the way, the female population of Finland also participated in the Finnish war, which indicates the determination of the people to sacrifice themselves for the sake of independence. Thanks to that feat of the Finnish people, today we know Finland as the most prosperous country in which there is no oil, no gas, no gold, there is nothing at all, but there is only a people who valued freedom and showed what it is worth fighting for. By the way, here is a good example for the Russian people with its great-power worldview, which sees its happiness in robbing other peoples, instead of wanting to live a peaceful life and work not for the production of weapons, but for the creation of things necessary to improve their well-being. Unfortunately, from this side, as history shows, the Russian people did not show success. Who knows what kind of goods Russia produces, acre of nesting dolls? Lies have become the hallmark of Russia today. (2) She is her only product.    The Russian-Ukrainian war, taking into account military supplies to Ukraine, will continue as long as Putin is in the Kremlin, driving himself into a corner with the fact that defeat in the war will cost him not only the loss of power, but also his life, because the newly-minted Fuhrer cannot escape international tribunal for a great many crimes committed, for which the Russian people also have to pay, and that payment will not be easy. Of course, in order to avoid defeat, it is possible that Putin will decide to use tactical nuclear weapons, but the West can prevent such a development of events and provide Ukraine with an equivalent response in this case. There is no doubt that Russia, with its weak economy under sanctions pressure in a protracted war, has no chance of winning. Putin miscalculated his plans to restore the empire within the borders of the USSR, in which the war with Ukraine was the first step. He probably did not expect, despite Russia's efforts to sow discord, the same response from the West to the unleashed war with Ukraine.  After long hesitation in assessing the aggressive actions of Russia, the countries of Western democracy finally realized that their future is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. On the map - the future of civilization. Thus, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of the need to deprive Putin of a chance to win the war with Ukraine. “If Putin succeeds, it will result in incredible suffering for the whole of Europe and the whole world will face terrible consequences. We will never feel safe again,” she said. In fact, the responsible mission fell to the share of the Ukrainian people to rid the World of a monster from the era of lizards that has survived to this day. In other words, \"Carthage must be destroyed.\" (3,4) The Empire of Evil, as well as the Empire of Lies represented by Russia, will inevitably become history after all the previous empires, thanks to Putin's revanchist. 1.

So really it was not a pity the loss of thousands of soldiers because of this. It was necessary to immediately use heavy weapons in order to quickly end the war and save our soldiers. By the way, could you explain what you think of heavy weapons. I thought it was tanks, artillery, rockets, but it turns out I was wrong.",

Heavy weapons are things like tanks and artillery. Rockets fly, so they must be light weapons, to even be able to get up there... even if they carry nukes.Even the Nazi's of Hitlers day believed in the light of the sun, when you get closer to it. Are you Nazi's smarter than Hitler's Nazi's?",

Ukraine will not win its war against Russia, even if they give it the weapons of the whole world, because it simply does not have enough experience in wars, as the Russians have, in addition to that it is itself a battleground. In the most extreme cases, Russia will lose military equipment and soldiers, but Ukraine will be completely destroyed if direct confrontations develop with the Russian army.",

The Afghanistan war, the Korean war, and even the invasion of Iraq and the Syrian war, which both sides fought by proxy on Syrian territory. At least, Russia can be compared to its American counterpart in that neither of them fought a war on their own soil.
