How can I increase my rank by earning my merit points. and how much merit can make me higher rank like Sr, Hero, Legendary? Merit is a kind of reward. Which everyone gets based on their post quality. And if anyone likes your post.  And if he has Smerit then he can give you merit. It can be of different types.  Because not everyone's choice is the same, everyone's mentality is different. Like someone like meme and you post a good meme then he can give you a merit on your meme post. Or if someone like informative post and you made it then he/she can give you a merit. Merit is actually distributed in this way. Not everyone will give merit in all the posts. If I like a post, someone else may not like it. In that case, even if I give merit in that post, no one else will give it there. This is how the merit cycle works.Read the thread of Theymos. There are details available about how many merits can increase your rank and make you Hero/LegendaryQuote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMIn addition to activity, everyone now has a merit score, and you need both a certain activity level and a certain merit score in order to reach higher member ranks. The required scores are:RankRequired activityRequired meritBrand new00Newbie10Jr Member301Member6010Full Member120100Sr. Member240250Hero Member480500LegendaryRandom in the range 775-10301000You get merit points when someone sends you some for one of your posts. Additionally, when someone sends you merit points, half of those points can be sent by you to other people.Note - You post only POA for different Bounty Campaign. These will never help you get any merit.",

Given your post history which consists mostly of those \"proof of authentication\" posts its a miracle that you even managed to get those 5 merits.

You joined the forum back in 2020. The five merits on your account till date are a few earned from signing messages and voting for Bitcointalk Community Awards.Rest of your post history is for joining campaigns - but you did not get accepted in any of those - right?This shows that you thought merit was something you get for doing specific tasks and never took the initiative to actually learn how the forum works and how to make posts - 2years later.Participate in the forum discussions, I am sure this has been said in many threads before this but you guys dont care to read those. Try to get involved and gradually you will earn merits, dont chase after them.",

You need to convince others who has spendable merit to send you. Don't ask for it but earn it. When you make good posts which worth to read then you will earn it from members. If you continue posting poof of authentication then you will never earn anything.I am curious to know, how did you get the 5 merits you already have?",

Altcoin section is messed up with members spamming the whole board with shit posting and there are very less chances of getting merits there so he will have to spread out his post to different boards and yes the main and basic thing is to acquire knowledge for the same what you are going to write in your post which will help you to rank up.Quote from: iroseyike on July 12, 2022, 09:55:59 AMMerit is simply same like the likes you get on social media platform like Facebook or Twitter when your post amaze or interest the reader.On like here you get merit for your Quality post.

He seems like an alt but I honestly don't think he should be limited to speaking up and voicing his opinions.Ironically many users care about the merit system but they don't like reading and try hard to get it. Beginners need to read more than write if they really want to be quality posters. There was no reason to force a rank while their knowledge wasn't good enough, so it had to be worth the effort and knowledge. For a knowledgeable user I think merit will be easy for him as ranking will be guaranteed based on his knowledge and post quality.",

Not to mention the tlfact that, the Legendary has a tricky way to determining activity for the rank as, its not definite.
