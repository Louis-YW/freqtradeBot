It did not apply in the past but after the DeFi and GameFi, NFT, Metaverse trend in 2020 to 2022, I saw Coinmarketcap did a great improvement by attaching their warning on mint function in smart contract. It serves a purpose to remind investors that those project teams can mint more tokens in future with the Mint function.QuoteMost of these currencies collapse during the first weeks of its launch.Altcoins are pump and dump games which are not responsibility of Coinmarketcap to control.They only can reduce rug pulls for investors with their criteria. Rug pulls usually occur with projects that list their tokens on DEX, Poocoin and they even don't have chance to appear on Coinmarketcap.",

I thought at first that you have to pay to be listed in Coinmarketcap but I'm wrong, the listing is free. As long as you fit into their criteria you will be listed. So the question is why there are many listed scam tokens since the listing is free? \"Maybe\" it's because of the donations.",

Be warned, using Coinmarketcap or coin gecko for choosing new projects is wrong, you need to do your research, these platforms are there to give you the right information about any crypto project, that's all, they don't give investment advice, so use them right.",

There are thousands of altcoins that are not traded anywhere, but they still on aggregators like cmc or coingecko. There are even people or groups that offer \"coinmarketcap listing\". You fill online submission form and wait. Most likely coinmarketcal will add altcoin to general list if project looks more or less legit. In fact, they are interested in adding as many as possible alts, as users are redirected from coinmarketcap to trading platform and coinmarketcap earns affilate rewards, or users can buy directly from coinmarketcap. In short - the more they add, the more commission they earn.",

It is also not the job of the coin/token aggregator to verify the project itself. Neither the users also should rely upon CMC or any similar websites, it is expected that the user themselves should run through their own due diligence.Back to the CMC part, if we take a look at the current total listed cryptocurrencies, only a handful of cryptocurrencies are worth taking a look at, say only the fifth page from its total page, 90. So being listed on CMC doesn't imply any significance of a project, in fact, some project favour that CMC listing as part of the project's milestones, which is it's a truly shady decision.",
