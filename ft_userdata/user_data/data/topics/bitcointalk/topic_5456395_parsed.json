But all the same,  you are right when you said those who are addicts are not aware or simply overlook their gambling excessiveness but another person can easily notice that.",

I thought that a few gamblers might have met with an accident that caused hearing loss. We tend to see such heading in main stream media as click bait. Coming back to the topic, any kind of addiction would alway make the addicted person behave in the same manner. This is common as an addicted person would never accept his addiction.",

All their thinking would be to eat and take some rest, at this point you could start a gist that relates to gambling to draw all their attention, at ending of discussion you may tell them some disadvantages of  gambling that involves when someone is going off track about gambling.To forcefully stop them is like a torgue of war were you are partially wanting to become a limitation to their success through gambling. What a gambler believe is that a day to come they must definitely strike a winning at any point in time, so they keeps trying that why you see people going worse everyday all in the name of gambling because they have focused, channel their efforts from getting Rich in gambling. So, whenever you try talking to them you automatically becomes their enemy that wants to limit them from becoming whom they want through gambling.",

When I was in school, my friend advised me but I did not listen. When out of school, I mean after I finished the final year in school, I met new friends and some of them know that I am gambling and using too much money for it. Many of them advised me, I thought they were wrong. When I lost huge amount of money a year after, the money that I supposed to use for something else, I changed not to be addicted anymore by quitting gambling for a year.",

You know that something is collecting money from you, why can't you quit that thing.Quote from: QueenVera on June 15, 2023, 08:27:46 AMYour topic is actually something  else and at first when I came across it, I was really  interested  and wanted to know how possible this could be for gambling to cause physical deafness.He only meant that to be advising someone but the person is not listening. I think I have heard an idiom like that before, but maybe I am not right, but that is what the OP means. The way OP used it in the topic title makes it to have different meaning.",

Most gamblers hates advice,when you are telling them to quit. This is because some are addicted to it and will always keep on chasing their losses believing that some day their dreams will come true of hitting it big. While some see it as fun. Those that turn deaf ears to advice on gambling will only learn from a hard lesson because they can only learn by experience and not by advice. This does not just apply to only gambling but alcohol and smoking too.",

But now, online gambling has become rampant and it has become even easier because it is promoted by famous influencers who don't care about their followers.Then, when there is a gambling addict, because he is addicted to gambling, he doesn't care what his friends or family say about what he is doing in the gambling industry. Theirs is that they can get what they want to gamble in the casino.",

This problem of making sure that we keep gambling does not start in one day, it is a continue habit that we might not understand how we get into it. It is very important to have people around that will keep scrutinizing our affiliatiom to gambling activities. I was once a ln addict too and how I was able to stop gambling waw still a dream to me. It will strict practice for those that are already an addict to stop and keep going. One of the things that can stop us from reducing our gambling activities is when we involve ourselves in activities that are taking our time and not giving us chance to go gamble or play bets.",

If they stop gambling today they will have no other sources of income and they won't know that they're getting addicted.I have experience of advising people against reducing the way they gamble and they did and also other experiences of advising addicts yet they seem not to hear. I think those that are still early into the addiction will respond to your advise than those that are deep into the addiction. If you try helping an addict and they responded negatively doesn't mean you should stop trying to help them. Addiction is very hard to breakout from so you can get the person professional help and hopefully it helps to reduced the money and time he use for gambling.",
