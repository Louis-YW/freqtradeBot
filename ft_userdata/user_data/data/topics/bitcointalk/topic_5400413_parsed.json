However you should be ready to fund your project at least at this early stage before you can look for partnership. People won't want to invest or partner in what they have not seen the possibility, so source for your fund and take your thread to service board",

If your answer to that is yes then I guess you're totally in the wrong room. This isn't a charity bro, investors and community to drive-up your project are the best you can get here.",
