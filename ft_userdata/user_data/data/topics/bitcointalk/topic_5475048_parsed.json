So, I think we should take advantage of the time to accumulate bitcoins instead of spending time arguing and criticizing others, to prove ourselves right, but the most important thing is that we don't own many bitcoins.",

In the bitcointreasuries among the top ones, it's coinbase, not binance. Binance came in late.

If these organizations do not appear, there will be others, and I believe that is the journey where bitcoin becomes widely accepted when it is easy for us to own bitcoin. And honestly, I still have to look back at our behavior, when we all see a good product, balancing our current lives to be able to share good opportunities from bitcoin also requires a process of adaptation.

But my biggest problem now is, if the CEO of Binance finally happens to pay his charge which he pleaded guilty yesterday by the U.S Justice department of over $4 billion (i.e approx 109,589 BTC), his position as the 2nd highest Bitcoin holder in the world will be move over to \"Grayscale\" (i.e if 109,589 BTC is been subtracted from the current Binance holding of 643,546 BTC)While the U.S Government will be having 207,189 + 109,589 = 316,778 BTC",

It's actually alright to not rush yourself if you cannot really accumulate in your current situation for example in your financial status, if you still cannot afford to invest due to your money is just enough to provide your essential needs. We know that this kind of topic and thread is to motivate people to invest in Bitcoin, knowing their potential, but I hope some wouldn't be pressured with some words like \"you might be late to invest in BTC\". There are no latecomers, it is just that you can profit hugely if you started earlier as Bitcoin is increasing its value and reaching its new ATH. Just don't use the money you can't afford to lose in investing in Bitcoin, or even worse taking a loan due to FOMO. Though you can hold it might take a lot of time for Bitcoin to increase which can worsen your situation for paying up your loan with high interest. Invest with yourself first with knowledge and skills if you don't have the funds yet.",
