So let's say, you have 0.5 btc, after several months, you still have your 0.5 btc in your wallet.I understand you bought btc hoping that it will continuously increase but it is not the reality, as we have roller coaster ride in any marketnot only the btc market. But the hope of most btc holders is that one day, they will unload their stash at a much higher price,definitely, higher than their buying price. So don't panic as it is not the end of btc, you are just experiencing the up and down movement.",

Bitcoin price is volatile because of the variation in the demand and supply quantity. If the demand of it becomes high then the price grows and if the supply increases then it falls in price. All this volatility affects the price assigned to it but not the bitcoin it self. If you buy a certain number of bitcoin say 1 bitcoin, it will remain as 1 bitcoin in your wallet and only the price assigned to it will varies due to the demand and supply chain explained above.Due to the volatility nature of bitcoin it is always advice to invest an amount that you can lose to avoid getting impatience with the price fall. One easy way to gain profits from bitcoin is to hold it for a very long time because the price has proven to increase as time and its adoption rates increases. So invest an amount you can afford to lose, so that it will be easy to hold on to for a long time and also use a wallet that is secure to safe your funds and not exchanges.

That is called volatility 105. You probably have read that bitcoin is volatile and probably it didn't make much sense to you until you actually had a Bitcoin which brings the concept of volatility to reality.From what you said, your only bought your first bitcoin some few days ago and you shouldn't be in a serious haste to experience or getting worried about the any fluctuations you are experiencing at the moment.

Did you want to make quick gains and liquidate fast? then you were gambling rather than investing.About your second question, the only way you can freeze the value of your BTC is selling them. You can do it for fiat or you can buy stablecoins which are pegged to USD: it is not completely safe as liquidity of stablecoins is not guaranteed, but it can be interesting if you din't want to abandon the crypto circuit.Of course, chances are that after \"freezing\" the value, the price pumps and you miss the train. But again, that's because you're gambling, not investing (hodling). If you only invest what you can afford to lose, you should never be worried about short term fluctuations.",

It will automatically reflect as live price APIs are integrated into the wallets you are using to hold your BTC. I think you are new to crypto and maybe panicking or your feelings might be telling you, creating suspense in you that hey look your money is getting lower you should avoid BTC or book your capital at the current price while you can.I don't know how much you have invested but don't panic and before investing in BTC try to learn a few things like how BTC works, and what is blockchain because trading or investing in BTC with no knowledge of it can cause you to become a prey to market sentiments which you should avoid. I have linked a topic that you should lead to know more about market sentiments. In short, your btc price will remain the same all you can do is avoid looking at them because you are holding it, and in holding we invest our money for a longer time so you have to stop looking at the price again and again, or it will make you to take some action on which you might regret later but I hope you will not have to.",

We're glad to see your topic. It's great that you've started the journey of buying and investing in Bitcoin. You're at the beginning of your trip, and we hope you achieve the profits you aspire to with patience and perseverance. Don't let market volatility and FUD affect you someday. Of course, Bitcoin, like any other cryptocurrency, experiences sharp market fluctuations. You bought Bitcoin at $43,943, and the price was high. When there was a correction in the price, and it dropped to $41,000, the price of the amount you bought undoubtedly decreased, but the amount of Bitcoin in your wallet remains constant. If Bitcoin rises again to the previous price level, you'll find that the price of your amount has returned to the purchase price. Don't worry at all, and always increase your amount at different low price levels and invest what you can afford to lose. If you don't want the price of the Bitcoin you invested in to be affected if the price drops, it won't happen in Bitcoin investment unless you exchange Bitcoin into any of the stablecoins that freeze your capital from price fluctuations, as these coins are not affected by increases or decrease at all.",
