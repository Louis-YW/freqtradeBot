You must create that wallet offline, copy and save the public address for receiving to burn. Delete the wallet file, uninstall the wallet software application.If you create your wallet when your computer is online, maybe someone can get the private key. It is not commonly but might happen when your device is infected.Create Taproot address for your Bitcoin",

If it will be some correctly encoded x-value of your public key, then those coins could be unlocked. If not, then it will be some trap address (hard to reach public key) or burn address (unspendable, invalid public key).To decode those addresses, just use Bitcoin Core, even offline without any chain, if you want. Then, put \"decodescript 5120\" in the console window, and add hex-encoded 32 bytes you want to decode. It could be anything, for example 0xbadc0ded, repeated eight times:Code:decodescript 5120badc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0ded{  \"asm\": \"1 badc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0ded\",  \"desc\": \"addr(bc1phtwqmmd6msx7mwkuphkm4hqdakadcr0dhtwqmmd6msx7mwkuphksrqz6ct)#dy9h0w9z\",  \"address\": \"bc1phtwqmmd6msx7mwkuphkm4hqdakadcr0dhtwqmmd6msx7mwkuphksrqz6ct\",  \"type\": \"witness_v1_taproot\"}And then, you can check if your public key is reachable or not:Code:importpubkey \"02badc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0dedbadc0ded\" \"badc0ded\"Pubkey is not a valid public key (code -5)Then you know that such address is unspendable. But for example you can see that x=1 address is potentially spendable, but hard to break:Code:importpubkey \"020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\" \"one\"null",

Then, no additional UTXO is ever created, no additional output with OP_RETURN is made, instead just some 64-bit number is lower than it could be, so it is the cleanest way of burning coins (but of course, only miners can do so in such a clean way).",
