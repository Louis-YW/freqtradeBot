And apparently this never gets old.",

But for a tweet or whatsoever it is that they posted in the internet ? No i don't think so.. Unless if all people who sees their post are literally investing on the project itself..",

Anyone can tweet something, but if it's someone who has a significant following, then it's more likely to be noticed and can get a lot more attention. If people see something on their timeline that they agree with or find interesting, they'll share it with their own followers. If enough people do this, then the tweet becomes more popular and is seen by even more people. Projects that otherwise no one would have heard of can now enjoy a burst of interest just because of a celebrity endorsement. It's a symbiotic relationship, benefiting both parties.",

Sometimes they are buying early then do some kind of shill tweets to hype there blind followers to purchased the token that they are shilling. They didn't control directly the price but rather they just mind condition there followers to push them purchased in impulse using there hype tweets. Billionaires can easily manipulate the people thoughts since they have the money and people think that they can pump the price by there own money while reality peoples money is what makes the price pump including the traders that riding the waves just to feed whales when they are ready to take profit.",

The era for such thing already passed. This time people didn't care anymore with BS tweet. if that's about a big update from developers or things that have relationship with the token and it may create a pump. You shall se what happened with doge coin after elon was taking over twitter. There are so many rumours about doge being used as micropayment in twitter. The acquisition of twitter by elon has been increasing the chance for this rumour to be come true. This is why the pump has been triggered. I think that there would always be a reason why a coin got pumped so hard. it's safe as long as you understood how it works like buy in rumour sell for the news",

We have seen this on the last bull market when Elon Must tweets about DOGE, the price will suddenly went up and I think it is cause by massive number of people buying it because of that tweet. I've also seen this on NFT market where NFT influencers are shilling and suddenly floor price are also going up. NFT influencer also do project partnerships which somehow people are buying NFT because of some influencer being part of it. I believe that it can be manipulated but it will not last long and will not be effective compared to the first shill that these influencers do. Everyone wants to ride the wave.",

A while back when elon musk made his first tweet about dogecoin, it did not only make dogecoin itself pump like crazy it also started the whole shit coin hype wave, which has brought us literally hundreds new shit coins each and every day for at least a few months. Now 99% of those shit coins are already dead again. Of couse big news like aquisation of Twitter still have an impact.",

Yes it's true we have seen several times Elon Musk tweeting about DOGE & SHIB since he has millions of followers and from there many invested in DOGE Coins.  So Doge Coin pumped a lot at one time.  But it didn't last long.  Its price has once again fallen far from its ATH.  At that time DOGE pumped high because this was Elon's first tweet about altcoins.  But now none of the coins pump much for Elon's tweets. So on this basis it does not imply that billionaires can control the crypto market",

Because he does such mischief mostly as far as I know.No worries, people/his followers have stopped paying much attention to his tweets and I am sure one day, no one will buy or sell on his tweet.The answer to your question is. No, he does not control the market, if he had control over the market, his company tesla wouldn't have sold their bitcoin at loss.",

And they're getting that crowd attention when they tell something good which is making the crowd and the community active. It's just the reaction of many that wants to be like that.But when these influential people realizes that, they're using their fame to manipulate the market into their favor and advantage.",

They will just follow whatever crap those influencers tweet/say in social media which makes everything run that is not supposed to see at that day. It's so easy to be manipulated these days by those big person especially when the subject is involved with money and investment, they will for sure follow it.",

Elon for example shilling other projects, many will take advantage of that to create another hype and probably the public will follow many will make profit while many will suffer a loss.",

So when those billionaires say something about a particular coin, their followers immediately think that the coin will be able to get a pump. But the followers drive the price because they think that way and the billionaires, in the end, just wait at the peak price and close the trade by earning huge profits over their followers. If his followers could think long about what the billionaires said, they would not think short but would analyze further and act calmly.",

Lure the investors who can easily fall into their trap. Remember when Elon pumped DOGE. Yes, many made money because of it but I still believe that many lost their money more than the number of people who gained profit to it. The project sometimes starts to pump because of investors believe that when they state a particular coin, they believe that they are supporting that coin and they believe that it will pump because of that thus, they will start to buy and as more people buy, the price increases.Whether it is a billionaire or an influencer or a Youtuber, don't follow what they are saying and just follow your strategy.",
