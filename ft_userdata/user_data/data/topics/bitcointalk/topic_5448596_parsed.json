In fact, there are many incentives that make members enjoy spending time here. This depends on the preferences of each person and what goals he intends to reach by spending time on the forum.Personally, I find the forum a very interesting space, and am a follower of some preferred boards and some profiles as well. There are many profiles that you will enjoy getting to know and reading their posts in addition to the richness of the content.Quote from: Zoomic on April 12, 2023, 09:50:45 PMI do not have much skills but I can do the following;1.

I can assure you that most of the permanent members on the forum do not have half the skills that you have. You can launch a service thread in a few minutes, and it is certain that someone will need you one day to help him. good luck",

I can work as visual assistant If you are very sure you could do any of the above mentioned skills, I will like to suggest how about you create a thread on the \"SERVICE\" board to advertise your skill, so that if in case anybody happens to be in need of a website builder or visual assistant, such individual can contact you. And you can also have a look at this Service ANN, whereby this forum member is also a website builder who specialize on building crypto faucet, as you can equally take some examples to create your perfect service thread, while showcasing your previous jobs.Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422868.0",

Though you may post your services and create a thread for it, other than that, you should focus on other spaces as well.As someone who currently participates in a campaign signature, it is my duty to at least engage in fruitful discussions about a certain topic. I spend around 2-5 hours daily browsing through threads and reading comments in order to keep myself engaged to the topic.I do recommend that you aim on contributing to the forum by joining into discussions in order to increase your forum rank in this journey. If you are able to participate in campaign signatures, then that is one reason to keep you being active in discussions here in this forum.",

That's enough to keep you out but, owning an account here means, you really should be getting involved. If you believe in cryptocurrency or think it has got something to offer in the nearest future, then you've got reasons to gather knowledge about it so as to better prepare yourself for tomorrow. It would be awful to let this chance of learning and getting on the cryptocurrency network early enough. Find reasons and know that, you are the one stopping you from coming here regularly.",

I am surprised that none of the above responses mentioned signature campaigns. You will have to wait until you are at least a Full Member, and then you can apply to join the signature campaigns that you can see advertised in the Services section. To do so, continue to use the forum responsibly and gradually increase your knowledge. You will have to be more active on the forum and post regularly. If not every day, then a minimum of 5 days a week I would say.If you notice, almost all of us who have responded wear a signature because we participate in signature campaigns.",

The forum is full of information; this is what is valuable; your knowledge is typical; and what you offer is typical.You can correct your thinking by saying that if you are here, if you read, learn new information, and become more informed about new technologies, it is this knowledge that will help you become the most in demand.But if you are looking for a job here, then again, you need to make your resume more attractive, and it is advisable to connect it with the specifics of the forum.",

Bitcoin knowledge to me is the highest knowledge one can have in the is forum because it will safe you from financial problems,if you invest in bitcoin and learn the movement of bitcoin in a cyclic pattern. You will also know how to keep your wallet safe. So don't wait until you have a job based on your skill in the forum before,you will be active here.

So for someone like you with such skills you would rather be doing yourself a disservice to think you can't use them actively in the forum. You can monetize your skills by advertising it in the forum service board which will make you active in the forum by those that would seek for it.
