Republicans think abortion is \"baby murder\", and would do anything to stop it, including voting for somebody who would ban Bitcoin that's what it took.Democrats see the abortion criminalization Republicans want as a fundamental attack on their bodily autonomy, and more practically speaking, the end of safe sex in the United States because there's no recourse if one's birth control fails--so every act of sex in the country Republicans want must necessarily consider the possibility of there being a baby. And most people aren't in the position to have (another) baby. So hence Republicans are basically trying to... outlaw sex.So it's \"baby murder\" versus the end of sex. Compared to those stakes, Bitcoin isn't even remotely on any voter's radar.",

A big percentage of US voters are crypto users so there's that which is like Trump securing his win. The social media people are just streaming Trump. There are many versions of the story about her invitation and later decline. But if she had accepted the invitation at first, it might indicate that she might not be as strict as Joe Biden. I believe she was advised not to attend because sharing the same podium with Donald Trump can harm her reputation the way it happened to Joe Biden. She knows little about Bitcoin, so she might end up speaking ignorantly which will not be too good. It could also be that she doesn't want to mend fences with the crypto community because she is not a supporter of the technology. If this was the case, then the crypto industry should be prepared for harsher policies if she eventually wins. It will be nice to hear what Trump wants to say in the conference.",

I don't have the chance to attend but I'll be watching on the internet and I am hoping that everything he says be something worth believing in and gains alot of supporters for him Trump isn't going to throw saw this opportunity of him becoming a US president again. They didn't allow him to finish his last tenor and he probably will have some unfinished business that he will have to handle.",

This looks like a money grab by the organizers. They want to kiss everyone's asses so much only to get their names on the list. Since inviting Trump paid off, why not invite Kamala, right? While we're at it, let's invite Brad Sherman and Elizabeth Warren. There's freedom of speech. If people like that want to attend and speak their mind they should be allowed to do so, but I wouldn't invite them.I like politics, but I feel like we could use less politics in bitcoin.",

Bitcoin have come a long way in the last 4 years, withstanding plenty of attacks even though the policies have been terrible to say the least. I know politicians usually lie during their campaigns and flip upon winning but it's worth noting that among all recent US president, Trump has been the most informed about crypto.

However, with the endorsement of the next US President would create further demand and so the increase of price is imminent. Trump may be pro-crypto but once he is elected, do you really think it would be easy to pass a crypto-related bill? At the end of the day, whether the leader is pro-crypto or not, you are the one shaping your life and so it is still on you how you will deal with your everyday life to improve your economic status.",
