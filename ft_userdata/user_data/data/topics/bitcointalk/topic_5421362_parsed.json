  "content": "Gemini has posted that their Earn program partner Genesis Global Capital LLC has paused withdrawals. This seems like the latest domino to fall. Make sure to get your funds off of exchanges. Here’s their tweet thread on the situation. https://twitter.com/gemini/status/1592873279232278532Gemini has been saying everything was fine right up until this pausing of withdrawals, showing once again that when the exchange says everything is fine, get your money out ASAP! Don’t wait around for the next exchange to “pause” withdrawals.",

Gemini is fine also as far as I’m aware. The problem was their partner Genesis which ran their Earn program. Genesis doesn’t have the liquidity to pay out earn users, so that’s where the problem lies. Funds held on Gemini are safe (supposedly) but any funds given to Genesis to lend out for interest are frozen while Genesis looks for someone to bail them out. Hopefully this is a true delay scenario and not a precursor to bankruptcy but we’ll have to wait and hear what news comes out.",

      "body": "Maybe Gemini paused the withdrawal from their exchange because it fears panic and doesn't want users to withdraw their money, which means that the exchange will not receive any profit? In any case, this is a wake-up call for users of exchanges, because their funds are either already frozen indefinitely, or this will happen in the near future. In the first case, there is nothing left but to wait, and in the second, on the contrary, to hurry. Hurry up to get yours. The fact that \"not your keys-not your coins\" was repeated by many for many many years and until the problem arose, no one cared about it. Now, when this incident happened, everyone ran sharply in the hope of picking up their crypto. The unpleasant fact is that it was necessary to foresee this earlier and prepare, having secured their money.",

I also had a small amount of ETH staked and they are telling me they won’t do anything about and I can contact them when it can be unstaked on the network. I can only imagine how difficult that is going to be or if I’ll even remember. Seems shady. The worst part is I wasn’t given a reason.",
