This type of service is not for mining and is not prepared for this level of use.Of course, if there were a few cases, it is bearable, but if it starts to escalate, everything becomes more complicated and alarms go off in the system. I believe that because of the devaluation of currencies and the rising cost of energy, many have remembered to test/use these services to continue mining.",

For ordinary users, standards for equipment have been established, this is only server equipment for installation in special PC racks. Buying such equipment for mining is not always profitable. And very old equipment may not be accepted.",

Mining sometimes consumes less power and generates less heat than normal workloads such as rendering, AI calculations, or general archiving. Microsoft, Amazon are very cunning and want to rent a server to as many customers as possible.",

Microsoft, Amazon are very cunning and want to rent a server to as many customers as possible.Yes, it is true, but this is the objective of these companies to obtain the best possible performance with the equipment they have available.I didn't mean that mining uses more energy resources than other tasks. It all depends on what you are mining. The question what is the time used, where mining uses 100% of the time, no matter the number of resources used. As it is being used at 100% nothing else can be done.These companies set up their business in such a way that the servers serve several clients around the world, at the same time, according to the use of each one. That's why they manage to do low prices. It's not a matter of being smarter or not, it's their business model.",
