  "content": "Hello, after the venom testnet guide, I found something wonderful today when scrolling down Twitter. That is iZUMi Finance. So I keep searching for it more and more then I found that they have confirmed an airdrop. My previous venom airdrop guide was based on testnet. But today this IZUMi Finance is based on Mainnet. So you need to have real money to start this. So please DYOR. First of all, iZUMi Finance is a multi-chain DeFi protocol providing one-stop LAAS. LAAS means Liquidity as a Service. They  already raised $27,6M from Bella Protocol, MEXC, HashKey Capital and some other companies as well. RoadmapThis year Q3 they focus on adding more trading tools on iZiSwap and Building iZUMi partner ecosystem. Q4 iZUMi planned to start ZUMi DAO governance. TokenomicsiZUMI finance native token known as iZi. It is an ERC-20 Token with 2 Billion in total supply.In the project tokenomics, I found that 1% of the tokens will be allocated for airdrop. Also, they will distribute 50% of the tokens that will be received from zkSync. The airdrop has no vesting period as they mentioned in their tokenomics. So that is impressive. Not that all Izumi also launched the second part of their Ultra Evolution campaign, which will include rewards of $1,150,000 iZi and tokens from partner projects also. If you are interested more you can check their whitepaper from here: https://docs.izumi.finance/So let's start the main net task.Step 1You need to top up real money in your wallet. ETH is ok. Step 2Go to https://izumi.finance/home and do some token swaps and add liquidity. Step 3Track the number of points that you earned and view the list of tasks from here: https://zksync.izumi.finance/iPointsThat's all for right now. I recommend having at least 25 transactions with more than 5000$ volume if you can. At this time I'm writing this guide as per ETH gas you need to waste around 50- 60$ as the gas fee for 25 TXs. So mind that before you jump into this. Also, don't do multiple transactions in one day or do five 1000$ swaps and rest your head thinking you are all done.I hope that you enjoy my guide. Also, I used Grammarly to correct my mistakes. So English people please feel mercy on me if my English are wrong. If you guys know more about this topic please share your knowledge in this topic. Goodbye, all...",
