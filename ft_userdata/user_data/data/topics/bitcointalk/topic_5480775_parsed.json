  "content": "Less than two years after adopting bitcoin as BTC legal tender, Prospera, a special economic zone in Roatan, Honduras, has officially recognized bitcoin as a unit of account — meaning it can now be used to measure the market value of goods and services.This development means that BTC can be used as a monetary unit to measure the market value of various goods and services in the Prospera region. Colindres, however, said it could not implement a \"final BTC tax payment system\" at the moment, citing technical limitations of its e-governance system in addition to some external regulatory issues.For now, the tax liabilities of bitcoin-electing companies will be determined with reference to BTC for internal accounting purposes but will be reported in US dollars Próspera ZEDE or Honduras lempira.Once the issues are resolved, the companies will report the tax liability (and pay the corresponding amount) to Prospera ZE in BTC, Colindres noted.Those interested in uniting BTC accounts must file a notice with the Prospera Tax Commission within 30 days of the relevant tax periodhonduras-special-economic-zone-",

We only have to see that it is not a unit of account in a practical way even in this forum.I have the same view that any news about Bitcoin promotion and adoption is a positive addition to the Bitcoin community. The government identified that the reason for making this policy is to give the people of Próspera the freedom to choose the currency they find convenient when engaging in business dealings. Businesses and individuals will also be able to pay taxes using Bitcoin shortly. Considering the small population of this economic zone, the impact on the price of Bitcoin will not be noticed but at least it will help when I am promoting Bitcoin. It is simple to promote Bitcoin by giving examples of big corporations, regions or countries that have adopted it. People will always want to hear these kind of positive news for them to begin to see Bitcoin as a globally recognized currency. Quote from: wallet4bitcoin on January 08, 2024, 04:31:58 AMThis is Honduras taking it a little bit higher than EL Salvador has.

I commend the move by the Hnduras goveernment but I also advice that proper sensitization be carried out before going fullscale with this policy as it may cause some inbalances in their financial records, especially in cases where blockchain technology and education is yet to find its feet.Honduras has a literacy rate of about 88.51% which is considerably suitable for Bitcoin education. It is the responsibility of the government in partnership with other organizations to engage in massive awareness of this project. The policy might face some hitches at this infant stage but the system will keep improving with time.",

It seems that they still managed to keep Bitcoin on the island, and regardless of the fact that it is a project that probably won't have a global impact, it is still something positive for Bitcoin.

Since El Salvador has found no problem in making their country one of the bitcoin-friendly in the world, I was waiting for others will follow in their footsteps but as we can see, there are lots of things have been happening and now we know that they have different approach when it comes to adopting bitcoins in their countries.",

This whole story is about a place called Prospera and it is located on the island of Roatan, and it is actually an autonomous zone, something similar to Hong Kong when it comes to China. Prospera still falls under the laws of Honduras especially when it comes to the constitution and criminal laws.Source",

I hope that they're able to manage the volatility of Bitcoin in their small economy. What will be a big boost for Bitcoin will be when a country with a very large population will adopt it, although I don't see that happening anytime soon.",

This is how bitcoin spreads. Not from the topdown, but growing from the ground up organically. Small towns and villages all around the world clustering around bitcoin. A couple more decades of that and bitcoin will be accepted many places around the world.",

Also it is good to know that it is not Honduras that made bitcoin a legal tender but an island called Prospera in Honduras which is full of tourists. What that is most important is not about countries to legalize bitcoin as a legal tender, but to be a friendly bitcoin nation.",

It's relatively new, it attracts a lot of attention, and it's something many people want to experiment with. So it's just a natural match to make BTC adoption easy in places that exist specifically to focus on financial innovation, to let people experience the joy of relatively low taxes and an easier way of doing business than in many other places around the world.This special zone alone isn't much, but if others follow suit, it can have significant impact.",

And the adoption we looking out for the expansiveness of bitcoin blockchain technology isn't just about a larger populated country but one with a high rate of literacy for ease and fast adoption.It should rather be appreciable to see that the setting of bitcoin in the global economy is starting with the smaller populated countries  and in due time the larger nations will join in giving bitcoin a wider acceptance all over the world. but this i think will come with a cost, a situation where centralization will try to override and distort the tenets of decentralization.",
