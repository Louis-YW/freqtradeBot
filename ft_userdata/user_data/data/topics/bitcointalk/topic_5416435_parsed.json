I don't see why it should.Quote from: jnano on October 08, 2022, 09:29:55 PMIf just one, what are the implications?The implication of the command is that it marks a block as 'to be reconsidered', e.g. if it was marked invalid through violating a consensus rule. It will thus be checked again.Quote from: jnano on October 08, 2022, 09:29:55 PMCore crashed during catching up due to being out of space for the UTXO db.
