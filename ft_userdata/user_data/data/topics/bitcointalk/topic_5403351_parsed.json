  "content": "So exciting time this week as we get to the draft.  Lots of trades with personel moving and top draft picks getting their teams.  As a knick fan, dream scenario is moving Julius Randle to try and get the 4th pick.  They need ivey so bad on that roster.  And let obi get some playing time to see if he can make the leap.Not expecting much but there is always hope.What is everyone else hoping for in the draft for your favorite teams?",

Barrett was the one who shine at the season while Randle is having a contagious off night. I'd do that if I were the Knicks management. Looking at the mock draft by different analyst I see the Knicks picking Duren. I was confused first as they have Mitchell Robinson but to my shock that's because he is entering free agency so they need a new center.",

Yeah big mitch is a free agent and will get paid more than the Knicks can give him.  If they hold the 11 spot I'd rather them take mark Williams than duren. Julius is good but needs to go.  Knicks are real young with rj, IQ, obi, q grimes, etc. Julius and obi play the same spot.  Drafted obi in the early 1st he needs a shot otherwise it's a wasted pick.  And yeah Knicks haven't been set at pg for years.  Something ivey can do, I see a little Allen iverson in ivey.  Couldn't just be that as the salaries need to matchup so either a third team or a package around Randle and around that pick would be my guess if they could pull it off.",

We know the previous draft and deals, and seriously he is not that good so better to get off the hands here or maybe something is going on with his team. Anyway, there’s a lot of interesting players on the draft list, honestly I’m hoping for our native player Kai Sotto to get drafted and have the chance to play in NBA, we’re still hoping for this.",

      "body": "As far as my favorite team is concerned, Dallas Mavericks look like they will focus on getting a big man in this upcoming NBA Draft. They are expecting that some good big men prospects are still selective since they will have the 26th pick and it's considered late picks as most top prospects are being picked for at least 15 picks. But who knows there will be a rising star at that pick.I will follow the progress of this. Although every team is now playing small, getting a big man is a good move for me by the Dallas Mavericks as there are already lots of backcourt gunners for this team especially when Tim Hardaway Jr. is now back in action. Maxi Kleber is also not a defensive type even though he's playing 4 or 5.",

Don't think he slips but if the bulls can snag mark Williams that would be optimal for them.  Hoping the Knicks actually take him 11th.  He's great on the pick and roll.  Cleans up anything around the rim.  AND he can hit foul shots so you can't just hack the dude.  Wingspan is unreal and is a worker amd great teammate.  Checks all the big man boxes for me.  I hate 7 footers standing 30 feet away from the bucket.  Gimme a 1990s big man any day.",

The Chicago Bulls went through health problems and their stars have no one to cover for them while they are at rest. What they need is a strong bench that could facilitate in their worst times. Perhaps this season they will be doing more trades to fill that problem in their roster. If they cannot find a big man then perhaps a quality shooter will do them good. They have DeMar and LaVine covering the mid-range and paint attacks with their athleticism but they have none who can space the floor. Someone who is scary enough to be left in the 3-point line. How about Nikola Jovic? Versatile with shooting capabilities at 6'10.",

But we do hope that his private workouts from different NBA team works very well because if that one gives different taste and one of the scouts would find him helpful to his team then it will be a huge honor that there is one native Filipino player that can hop on NBA.",
