  "content": "Let me just say that the guys from bitcoin.com were less than helpful so far, hence me searching for ideas here. Thanks in advance.In a nutshell, I have the bitcoin.com app on my PC (v3.5.6). It is not updating anymore, apparently the Windows version has been discontinued. However it shows the wallet id, name, BTC.I've installed the bitcoin.com android app and followed the import wallet procedure. Importing from passphrase or the QR scan, both failed. What happens is that the app reports the wallet as being imported, BUT it is basically another wallet - different ID, no BTC, different name etc.I was thinking about a virus maybe, that might have drained my PC wallet. But it doesn't make much sense because the importing it to android has different ID. The IDs should be the same, don't they? What I've tried was to scan for missing transactions, reinstall the app, restart the phone, basically anything I could think of or was suggested by the bitcoin.com operators. Nothing worked.Any ideas?",

Look at this guide below- https://support.bitcoin.com/en/articles/3542814-restore-my-walletI'm not sure what you are doing when restoring your wallet from your PC to the app but what you only need is the backup seed phrase to restore your wallet. If it did ask for KYC name and ID then I suggest you bring your backup to another wallet and try to import your 12 words seed like Electrum wallet and then let Electrum wallet find the right derivation path where your wallet with balance is located.",

      "body": "I found an old thread Bitcoin.com wallet - Error: Could not import: Wallet recovery phrase is invalid where OP had a problem similar to yours, namely he couldn't import his desktop Bitcoin.com wallet into a mobile version via standard methods such as seed phrase. He claims the only way that worked was by copying some text (perhaps, a JSON file) from his computer and pasting it directly into a mobile wallet:Quote from: ilvstranger on September 06, 2017, 12:21:52 AMHmm... ok i'm a newbie... but saw the option File/Text.Remembered that i saved a file on local disk... Went there, copied only the text, sent it to phone and paste it in the app.Voila... it worked... hmm.The reason you may see a \"different\" wallet after a successful import is probably due to the poor design of the wallet itself. See this reply from HCP:Quote from: HCP on September 06, 2017, 05:16:25 AM<…>It does indeed START with a different \"receive\" address. HOWEVER, they are indeed the same wallet... with the same addresses. It appears that the two apps are sharing information somehow (possibly via a bitcoin.com server?) that keeps track of what addresses have already been \"generated\"... so every time you request a new address, it finds the next \"unused\" address and gives you that.However, if you go into: \"Settings -> 'Personal Wallet' -> More Options -> Wallet Addresses\" you will see that the addresses for both wallets are the same (assuming you have used the same seed and same passphrase).<…>Hopefully, this information will help you to regain access to your funds, but I'd recommend you avoid everything that contains \"bitcoin.com\" in the name.",

Thanks in advance.-snip-What were the previously discussed options and possible solutions with their support?That's so we won't be repeating those questions to you again.Anyways for now, changing the wallet service URL of the specific wallet should be able you to use the PC version (But it'll use Bitpay's API as the backend)You can also set it as your restore the wallet by expanding \"Show Advanced options\".For the Android app, I've tested it with my test backup phrase and it works without issue.It has different Wallet ID but it restored the correct addresses.",

      "body": "@OP,  seeing that you've been a member of this forum since 2013, already is a good pointer that you just a forum newbie and not a Bitcoin newbie.Quote from: wattaman on August 10, 2022, 07:54:15 PMI was thinking about a virus maybe, that might have drained my PC wallet. But it doesn't make much sense because the importing it to android has different ID. The IDs should be the same, don't they? By \"ID\", I want to believe you mean \"Address\",  if I am right in my assumptions,  then Yes,  your bitcoin address on your bitcoin.com pc wallet should be the same as that you've just imported to your android device, if the address is different, then that a pointer to -Seed phrase or private key error - this is means you might be making a mistake while typing in your seed phrase or mistake with the private key you saved.But in the case where the address are the same but no bitcoin in your wallet, you have two possible issues here, but first, you need to check the address on block explorer to verify if the address actually holds bitcoins ~1. If there are no bitcoin in the address, then maybe like you said, you wallet has been hacked and your bitcoins drained, try checking the transaction history in tht block explorer,  maybe you will see the address where your coins were sent to. 2. If the address still holds your bitcoins based on information on the block explorer,  then my guess is that, the problem might be a syncing issue on the Android wallet,  some wallets (most especially bitcoin wallet) takes some time to sync with the blockchain, this process can also take alot of time if you have a bad network, so my advice is that you give the wallet time to sync with the bitcoin blockchain, and also check your network to make sure it's strong and fast enough.",

Wow, thanks for this correction,  I've never used bitcoin.com wallet before,  so I thought the ID he was referring to was his wallet address.

This is highly possible too,  great observation.Let's hope op will be back to let us know the final result of the situation.",

We can only make bareless speculation, because you're using a closed-source wallet on a closed-source environment. Following the thread witcher_sense might help you make some sense, but there's little hope. Quote from: mk4 on August 12, 2022, 07:20:19 AMThe Bitcoin.com wallet is definitely not the most reputable ones out there to say the least..It's probably one of the less reputable, to be more precise, as the owners of Bitcoin.com are known for being strongly opposed to bitcoin and for shilling their hard-forked version of it. There's also no reason to use a closed-source software when there are open-source alternatives.",
