Obviously emotionally I agree that we cannot stop gambling if it is supported by funds and given a winning stimulus. But when my condition didn't have the funds to bet and the desire to gamble seemed to be fulfilled then what I did was switched to playing demo racing with my closest friends to collect as many wins as possible (at that time I thought I was struggling with real balances). Keep in mind this is only part of the trick so I can control my emotions. Personally, there are plenty of alternatives and people will have different options.",

I agree that when someone can't stop himself to gamble even if he's already on a losing streak, it's because that he has let his feelings and emotions conquer his control. When you've allowed your emotion to control over you, you'll forget about everything and you're all set to think that it's all going to be recovery of your losses. But you also understand that it won't do no good anymore and you're like throwing your money in every place you gamble because that's how adrenaline works.",

Partly yes, gambling has played our emotions to the maximum, give us that satisfaction, but when we lose, we want to recover and make a comeback. And that usually happens, so it's really hard to control and then we become addicted to it.That's why most of the time it's really hard to quit, as we want to get that feeling again, specially if we win big. We want to experience that same feeling and again. And so if we want to quit gambling, it's going to be a fight inside of us and it's not going to be easy.",

I have a passion for gambling but I have limits to which I gamble once the amount set aside for my gambling is reached, I can not gamble again and I don't think about my losses once am done.",

I agree with all of these feelings. I also experience every emotion when I gamble. But mainly for me; gambling means adrenaline. This is where the basis for experiencing every emotion in the body comes from when gambling. You get excited when you gamble. It's just like doing extreme sports. If you win, your excitement turns into happiness. If you lose, it'll be like a car accident. I wish everyone an accident-free ride",

When losing you become eager and desperate to recover your lost this leads to more losing. Winning big makes you happy and you feel like winning more gambles which makes you keep playing before you know it,you might lose all the funds you won. It is good we can control our emotions when gambling by having limits and a certain amount we spend on gambling,stopping at the right time shows how discipline gambler and can also help in controlling your emotion. I have seen a girl that steals to gamble in other to win back her lost this shows she can't control her emotion.",

And don't make gambling a lifestyle because you don't know how much money you can use, especially if you suffer that loss. This can also trigger you to experience depression due to the defeat, so you cannot think clearly. I don't have any other feelings when I gamble because I only want to enjoy my time by playing gambling.",

They might be feeling excited when they are chasing their losses and they might feel happy when they win a big jackpot, so in that way, we could conclude that without emotions, it is not gambling anymore but just a game which will not have any meaning for the player anymore.But for me, the main reason why I gamble every day is to get away from my daily life and all the stress that comes with it. I like to gamble because it makes me feel that I am living in the moment and not thinking about anything else but just focusing on playing. I am not a professional gambler and I have no intention of becoming one in the future, but gambling gives me a lot of fun and pleasure, and I think it's the reason why I keep coming back to it.",

I have heard people say they turn to gambling after a stressful day as a way to relax. If truly all this emotions are experienced and attached every time they gamble, that can be stressful to experience and very unhealthy and a danger to someone who is prone to hypertension or depression. I also think if as an individual that gambles and then experience these emotions, and you know they are too much for you to deal with, do yourself a favor and try to quit.",

I do agree. Excitement always makes you come back for more. The joy gambling brings whenever you are winning and the feeling of being triumphant against the house or you predicted it right when it comes to sports gambling.  I don't feel excited though when I am chasing losses, maybe we have different emotions when in that zone. It's a mixed feeling of being depressed and eagerness to take back what should've been mine.",
