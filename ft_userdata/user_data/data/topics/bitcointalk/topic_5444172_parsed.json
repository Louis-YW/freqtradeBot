I always try to bet on simple victories, some matches I bet on the number of goals, and once in a while I make some multiple bets (I'm trying to make multiples on the Portuguese championship, it's still in tests).But I've been getting something like 70% of won bets, approximately, so far I have a small profit in my bankroll.",

There are also those bets that were put in advance only to find out before the game starts that some key players will be missing on the team that you bet on (looking at you, Giannis). While the attitude that you can get the win the next time around seems positive, telling yourself that the previous bet you lost isn't a waste isn't really doing anything for you.",

You’ll know the teams, the players, the refs better. You’ll get more experienced with what you do and that means you will potentially make less mistakes in the future. Less mistakes mean you’ll lose less money and make more.Don’t even try this if you are casual player like me though. This is for the hardcore gamblers that want to make a job out of gambling.

However, the probability of winning $20,000 from a $0.5k bet is exceedingly improbable. It is feasible to lose $20,000 by betting $0.5 on 40 occasions, as the probability of winning such an amount is remote. It is highly possible to lose all of one's bets after 40 or 50 attempts, given the slim odds of winning such a sum.",
