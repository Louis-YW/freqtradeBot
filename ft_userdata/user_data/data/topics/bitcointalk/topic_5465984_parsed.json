With bitcoin spot ETF people in the stock market will be able to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin price is expected to go up. But I am more thinking about bitcoin halving which would be enough to cause FOMO and bull run that can take bitcoin to $100000.With bitcoin ETF, I am expecting $170000.",

I assume by cryptocurrency you mean bitcoin?It is quite possible that this will happen, only I think that all this should happen in 2024 - 2025, I also mean Black Rock, and this will be possible not only due to the approval of the ETF, I assume that at some point, regarding bitcoin, there will be a lot of positive news coming, this will mark the beginning of the bull market and then bitcoin will reach 100k and possibly even exceed this price.Since the beginning of the year, even without \"big\" news, bitcoin has been able to rise from 16k to 30k, so if anything significant, like the ETF be able to have an even more significant impact.",

Bitcoin price depends on demand and supply, and if Bitcoin ETF is approved,this is indeed a big news for bitcoin because many people will adopt bitcoin,which will bring a significant in the price of bitcoin. There are some people who can't buy bitcoin presently due to some reasons, they will be free to buy then and also many will people who are scared of buying bitcoin due to the inefficiency of keeping their coins safe will be encouraged to buy too. It will be a big blow for bitcoin price because the higher the demand,the lower the supply. If it is launched before the halving, I expect to see bitcoin price above 100k+.",

The price will pump hard on the news & coupled with the halving we should see a massive cycle top at some stage of 2025.",

Provably it will happen but to make the chance more higher it should be backed up with halving since by this two events happened for sure we can see bitcoin reached for $100k+ or even more. For now let see the updates regarding on the news they created since what they do is somehow good development for bitcoin since this can generate demands for people always seek for good news. Positive news now starting to come so maybe accumulation stage is slowly starting.",

Depends on the timing of the approval though, if this happens in after the block halving or at least we are in the bull run cycle, possible that this could be the biggest catalyst for a prediction of 6 digits in the next bull run resulting in a new all time high.We for now we can't say for certain though, it's really one of the biggest news in the next coming years as we all know that BlackRock has the reputation to back their application up.

How would this positively affect BTC in the long term?I guess so, we can just take a look back on 2021 where many institutions have jumped to the bandwagon of Bitcoin and that's likely to repeat. And for the long term effect of it is like we're going to have a new all time low. Yes, new lower price which seems to be higher than the bottom that we've seen.Quote from: Abiky on September 07, 2023, 11:42:27 AMDo you think it's possible the cryptocurrency will reach $100k if ETFs are approved by the US regulatory agency (SEC) before the halving of 2024? I hope so. It was like the prediction on 2021 but it didn't happened way back then. So, with another push and some reasons and force to push the price of Bitcoin higher and that's going to be likely that we'll see Bitcoin once again reaches another ATH and for the first time of hitting a 6 digits price.",

Winning the lawsuit doesn't grant a permission to launch an ETF without the SEC's approval, and I don't think a big company like that will risk it. They still need an approval, just like BlackRock, but the SEC is now in trouble and needs to either up its argumentation or start approving ETF applications. I don't know which option they'll choose, but until the first SEC approval is granted, I don't think there will be Bitcoin ETFs in the US or impact on Bitcoin's price. If the SEC finally budges, I think it's reasonable to assume that it might be enough to trigger a bull market, and a $100k price at the next bull market sounds very reasonable as well.",

The bitcoin spot ETF are for the people who want to own bitcoin but do not want to own bitcoin.  That is bitcoin spot ETFs gives them lower risks than investing directly in bitcoin. The is room for a increase in percentage of bitcoin price due to it. Aside the halving which many people are already talking about and getting set, there are other factors in addition to the ETFs that will take bitcoin to $100k soon.",

There's a little and more likely possibilities that bitcoin can surge if their application got approved by SEC, but should we consider thus as a major push on the bitcoin network markets, i don't think the major reason why we should experience a bull is on this because if you can recall on the previous days, something like this source out and suddenly pump the market to #27,000 before it gradually comes down to $25,600 where we are today, something far bigger and more anticipated for is in bitcoin market demand and supply as we are getting closer to halving.",

Breaking a current all time high and making a new one before a Bitcoin halving, is unprecedented. I don't think it will happen because I believe in history and also believe that a first Bitcoin Spot ETF approval in the USA will happen in a bull run, after the halving.My thinking is like above but I won't be shocked if what you ask will happen before the halving. We already witnessed a first time, Bitcoin dropped deeper than its previous all time high, during this 2021 to 2023 bear market.

If the conditions in the economy change, then there is a chance to reach the prices you mentioned.We all want the price of Bitcoin to increase, but this increase needs to be based on logical reasons. We cannot think of Bitcoin independently of the world economy, so the price of Bitcoin will not increase unless the country's economies recover. Even if the price increases, it will not be permanent. Halving will have an effect on increasing the price, but the course of the world economy at that time will also significantly affect the price.",

I don't expect bitcoin for $100.000 before the halving. Most likely it will happen later than this event, as it happened in previous cycles.Even if bitcoin ETF could push bitcoin's price to $100.000, it would only be a short-lived event. After which there would inevitably be a strong decline. All the same, I would like to see the price of bitcoin to $100.000 a little more stable. To keep the plus or minus at this level, as it is happening now in the range of $25-30.000.It seems to me that the hype around bitcoin ETF is overrated and it will not have a strong impact in the long run, but it will make a small contribution to the popularity of bitcoin, which, in general, is already good.",

We have such ETFs all over the world and generally there is very little interest in such investments, but apparently the US market is the only one on which most people expect to behave in the complete opposite way.There should be no doubt that the news of the first approved BTC ETF in the US will resonate in the media space, because we saw the effect of the news that the court ruled in favor of Grayscale recently. Therefore, I think that the news will be sold very successfully, but the real question is how much the clients of these companies will actually be interested in such an ETF, and how will these same companies buy BTC on the market, given that it is an ETF that will have to buy BTC and store it in custodial wallets in order to be able to sell shares in the fund.If these companies do these transactions via OTC, it is possible that the effect on the price will not be as strong as some think, and considering that BlackRock has signed a contract with Coinbase regarding the custody service - we already know from the past that the same company performed the purchase service for MicroStrategy via OTC.",
