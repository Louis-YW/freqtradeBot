  "content": "Tokenization has become the \"current thing\", and many of them have market valuations of more than $100,000,000, a combined market valuation of more than $1,000,000,000, AND MANY are all secured by the Ethereum POS algorithm. But how large is the probability that Ethereum POS is not secure enough to be the global base layer for tokens? What are the probabilities that Ethereum, in time, will need Bitcoin's security?",

No, the topic is about needing the required security through Bitcoin's POW.QuoteQuote from: Wind_FURY on December 12, 2022, 08:07:44 AMEthereum POS is not secure enough to be the global base layer for tokens? What are the probabilities that Ethereum, in time, will need Bitcoin's security?All I know is that PoW is MORE secure than PoS, but Bitcoin and Ethereum are completely two different coins that has nothing to do with each other.Obviously YES, and that's how I will be proceeding with my shower-thoughts in this topic, and believe me, it's about Bitcoin, and POW, and the network's incentive structure. I was merely using Ethereum as an example because it's currently the most popular POS blockchain.",
