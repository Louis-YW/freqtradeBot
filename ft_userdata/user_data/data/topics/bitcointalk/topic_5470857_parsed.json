If the present government wants to stop subsidizing the naira against dollar, which I agree should have been stopped long time ago, they should provide an enabling mechanism to make sure everyone gets access to it freely. If they can’t then we might have to revert back to the old reforms pending when we have the industrial infrastructure to export more as this is the only way to make it get grounds against top currencies.The parallel market will surely continue to push the dollar up because they are seriously holding much of it than they should",

The direction towards “de-dollarization of the economy”, adopted unexpectedly, and having become a victim of the populism of some countries/politicians, is highly likely to lead to such a result. Drawing BRICS and de-dollarization, and essentially into the yuanization of the economy, is the path to the global economic bottom...

And I really want to understand something about the whole this whole things because when our ex-president were there we are like trying to question him on how the economy is not moving fine and how we lacking of employment..I want to know why the price keeps increasing, or could it be that we are more consumers and not a producer or what because most at times I can't find the main reason why dollars keeps pressing over Naira, with how I have seen our economy and country whatever that has inflated in price always takes time to decreased just as we do have fuel price increase since from the first day he was made President, and we have been finding it difficult to cope with whole situation and now again we are talking of increase in dollars rate this shows the low export rate from our country to other countries, if we were high in exportation of products believe me we could had a kind of balance rate whereby Naira would keep surpassing Dollars or a kind of equilibrium in price.",

As a matter of fact, they can save their money in Bitcoin. From my calculation, if $1 was about ₦750, then you would spend about ₦22,500,000 to purchase 1 bitcoin (that's if 1 Bitcoin was $30k+). But as of the time of writing this comment, I checked on Binance, and $1 is about ₦1,156, which means to buy one bitcoin now, you will spend ₦33,004,956. Whereas, even when the price of Bitcoin is high and the value of Nair was not this bad, you will spend less naira to buy it. I believe that before the second quarter of next year, $1 might be worth $1,500 or more, so it's better that citizens prefer to keep their money in Bitcoin; if they also want to hold Fiat, then let them hold USDT or any other fiate that will not loss value like the naira.",

His ideas are weak and careless at best. I will not be surprised if he buys the idea of taking the loan. Is this where they need Bitcoin or has he got a plan for the naira?",

The bad thing is that he is not the only one, and it always happens in the same way, some leaders are determined to avoid history by repeating it. At present we have Argentina and Cuba, which are very similar cases: an official exchange rate is established by the government that nobody pays attention to and it is sold for a different one that is much more expensive on the black market. But there are many historical examples of this. In the end they will end up in bankruptcy and pure dollarisation or something similar.",

The difference is the official market is protected under the watch of central bank, it's the Import and export(I and I windows) market you can officially buy USD but there is challenge of getting it quickly due to protocols and rules, so the only place to get it faster is unofficial (parallel) market where the price is slightly higher than the I and E windows.Naira and dollar relationship has been finance by the fiscal and monetary policy where the government and the central banks have to intervene to fix an official price for the dollar to a naira which has been the traditional thing over the years but there is a new government in town that don't want to do that anymore because the government is the one funding the Forex and many loans have been taken over the years just to protect dollar to naira price. They decide to put an end to it and now allow everyone to go source their dollar by themselves, it's no longer the responsibility of the government to subsidies the price of dollar to a naira.If they have allowed naira and dollar to be traded by the forces of demand and supply, it will probably have been or more than these price but the past government didn't allow that to happen and it's now that we are feeling the negative impact. I love how the government has stopped funding of dollars because it has allow the country to be in debts, even in US, they don't subsidized dollar to other currencies, they allow demand and supply to do his thing.Naira has always been weaker to dollar, if really they have allowed the I and E windows all this while, problems like insecurities, low production would have been seen even from our currency but the government has been protecting it. If the current government are serious about devaluing naira, they need to equally increase security accross the north, they need to fix the roads in all the 36 states in the country so that transportation of foods can be easy, they need to support local production, encourage export so that the country will also earn more dollars. It is going to be an advantage if the country fix exportation to get more dollars and reduce importation to increase the value of their own currency.",
