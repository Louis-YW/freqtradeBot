Abnormal betting and arbitragingFor example Quote from: torkens on February 10, 2023, 11:59:35 PMthey are just scammer same story with me they forefitted my balance of 600usdt. reasoning Multiaccounting and arbitrage betting, i didnt do any of those thing first account and play 100 usdt per bet.

Follow the format listed in this thread. Emphasis on the emails you exchange, transaction IDs of the deposits and screenshots of the wins. Blur off all the sensitive information.Someone else had a scam accusation against them last year Esportsbet.io",

      "body": "OP I too am trying to figure out what really transpired from the mail you received as a response from the casino. It is laughable that they want to degrade their reputation because of $1000. It is funny though but there is more to this. They banned your account permanently without telling you the abnormal behavior you are being accused of.I checked to see the popularity of the casino here but none. I believe these are amongst the tricks they use to abscond with peoples' fund. OP this is a lesson learnt. I will advise you to next time do a due diligence before getting onboard any casino. There are lots of genuine casinos here which could have been better but they say experience is a teacher and I believe you have learnt your lesson and thanks for bringing it here do that other members could know about the nefarious act of this casino and be wary of them.",

If it was a deposit, did you withdraw before, or was it your first time?If you were able to withdraw your money before, it is better to contact the support team, as they may have frozen your money by mistake, but if it was the first time, then most likely they are fraudsters, and in this case you lost the deposit amount and your time because it mostly made you win $ 1000 is to make you think several times before withdrawing thus more time for them to continue to scam you or others.I have reviewed their terms of use https://esportsbet.io/terms/, and there are cases of closing your account, for example, withdrawing to a suspicious Bitcoin address, or exceeding the deposit or withdrawal amount of $ 3000, so do any of the two conditions make sense in your case?You can read all terms of withdrawal from that page and search by the name of withdrawal.Quotewhere the associated wallet address indicates that the user or the userâ€™s funds are located in such a prohibited jurisdiction.QuoteESPORTSBET WILL ALSO REQUEST SUPPORTING KYC DOCUMENTATION FROM USERS WHEN THE USER REACHES USDT$3,000 OF DEPOSITS OR WITHDRAWALS.QuoteWithdrawal Threshold KYC.

      "body": "They could have suspended your account without even asking for a KYC. But I have seen many cases like this one where casinos ask for a KYC before they suspend/close players' accounts. Not only Esportsbet but almost every KYC casino doing this practice. Do you know why they do it? Because they will have all your documents that they can use against you, you won't be able to do anything. Moreover, If you create another account, they may request KYC again. The same person cannot submit the same document twice. You may submit it, but they will catch you once you submit the documents. QuoteI dont have problem if they close my account but to cinfiscated my earnings is preety unfair not to use more negative word. While you are accusing them of scamming you and claiming you did not do any abnormal betting, Why don't you have a problem if they ban you? Why it's just because they confiscated your balance? I smell something fishy here. Be honest, Are you guilty of arbitrage betting or violating their Terms and conditions? If you are not guilty of wrongdoing, You should have a problem if they ban you without any reason. While I am KYC verified and I know I did nothing. Why would a casino ban me? At least I would ask them what rules were violated. I need further explanation.",

Casinos are good at ignoring the question of those users they banned giving general message and will always repeat the same message when you're going to talk to them, its both reputable and/or less reputable (or newly established) casino.
