      "body": "Quote from: fennic on November 21, 2022, 11:36:46 AMHi guys in my opinion that btc is in Bear market right nowBTC is in bear market for 370 days. 580 days if we skip fake new ATH in Now 2021. Fear greed index show extreme fear for last whole year if we skip few days of fear and neutral. 1 year of extreme fear man. Every investor emotions are ragged. Its good time to look for the bottom rather than call \"in my opinion that btc is in Bear market\". You should call it 300 days ago and predict 15k bottom, when price was at 45k. Not predict 13.5k bottom at a price of 16k when ATH was at 69k. No one should care about this 2.5k$ delta when we already dumped 53k$.Quote from: fennic on November 21, 2022, 11:36:46 AMBtc is currently running in 16000 dollars range and it might crash if some bad news might happen. FTX, second largest exchange, just go bust. Leaving all investors, milions of people, without penny. What can be worse than that? Not many things. After this news BTC dumped only 20% because its extreamly oversold. 13500 is possible but its much better to look for longs here for potential 2-10x rather than hope for black swan event to profit 10-20% from shorts.",

So what are your speculations and I will be more curious to know about this.Your predictions might come true, might not. But the fact is that if also BTC falls to 12k usd, we shouldn’t lose hope from it. Bitcoins are very valuable and have already proved that previously. So yes if we don’t care about it and just panic sell, then definitely we will make a big mistake and this will definitely hamper your profits that you might have made, if you would have hold it for a little longer. Bitcoins marketcap is enough to prove that, what’s Bitcoins are capable of. So yes if also BTC falls down in price, don’t sell it. Just hold and enjoy profits later.",

We cannot predict what other bad news we will see next that could cause bitcoin to drop even more. No one knows if we've hit bottom or not, but I know for sure that bitcoin will rise again in the near future.If you are trying to find a bottom to start buying then I think you should stop thinking that, buy now and always use DCA during bear season to accumulate as many bitcoins as possible.",

Especially if there is spare cash every month, you can make good profits in the future with such purchases. As for 13500, we are now close to that mark. I think that if such a price happens, we should make the most of this opportunity.",

I know that people have been saying that it will go down more and more, and so far I have said that it won't and each time it did, so I always looked wrong and they always looked right, so I accept defeat there. But this time, I am drawing a red line and saying that anything under 15k is looking impossible unless some major thing happens.This new under 16k is also a brand new shocking thing all because of FTX as well, we were doing fine above 20k and looking like maybe even recovering, and then suddenly the FTX thing happened, which is why I doubt anything similar at that size would happen again to make it go under 15k at this point.",

So what are your speculations and I will be more curious to know about this.Seeing that Bitcoin is still experiencing a decline in price to date, which has even been below the price of $ 16K, it feels very lazy to speculate because I personally am not very enthusiastic when I see Bitcoin is still being corrected in the market. Because I'm just waiting for an increase in Bitcoin and an improvement in market conditions before the new year arrives. And for the closing level of the Bitcoin price in this year, I think it will still be under $ 20K.",

Consider it like it could be this low never again, and if you buy here then you should profit a ton later on. Of course this is just a thought, and I believe we shouldn't really be focusing on anything else at all, anything lower from here on out would be just way too low and I wouldn't have it, I won't believe it, and I think it won't happen.",

To think that all the effects of FTX is not yet fully absorbed by the market, it is indeed possible that $13,500 will happen within the year. I am considering the possible bankruptcy of other crypto companies because of what happened to FTX. They're not yet factored in. So the price of Bitcoin might still have a bigger room to fall. I just hope that the failure of centralized platforms is not interpreted as a failure of Bitcoin. Because it isn't.",

I think, it will be difficult for the Bitcoin price to reach $13,500 in this bearish season, because there are some green light the price of Bitcoin is demonstrating in the market,  showed that the bottom price is $15,000 before bullish will take over the crypto market for both long term investors and short term investors to embrace the opportunity.",
