  "content": "Internet is very famous now since it was developed and many people are using it every day. But where Light is also Shadow and hackers are very active to take advantages from security holes and internet infrastructure misconceptions. Our security is improved, when we use a VPN because a VPN will prevent your location of being leaked to a hacker or a website possibly hacked later by an hacker. Hackers are targeting infrastructure deliberately, especially now because Putin has invaded Ukraine and Putin has employed state hackers to target EU and USA people. When I signed up for Bitcointalk, it was a question of security how we can get more of it and a VPN was very effective against a leak of data. Bitcointalk suffered many hacks already because it seems to be based on an outdated layout from when Bitcoin was launched by Satoshi. Satoshi created Bitcointalk himself. Of course, a VPN was a good option for signing up and it will improve our security A LOT. If in doubt, a VPN is always a good idea. Not only for Bitcointalk but also generally. For Bitcoin, we need to have a safe Laptop / PC, where we can access our Bitcoin. Don't trust middleman and foreign fabricateurs. A Bitcoin is too valuable to lose because only 21 M BTC exist, making Bitcoin a hugely effective store of value. VPN is a small step but each step is important. I'm not a coder but I can recommend a VPN for internet, like Bitcointalk.",

VPN does not improve online security, and it won't protect you from all online theft plots but it's a safe way to browse the internet because it protects your online activity and give you privacy since your IP will be protected. However, Tor appears to be better than VPN since your virtual private network provider can leak your IP and internet activity information to the government, etc at some point.Online security required more effort.",

Emails, passwords, addresses if provided - yes, but IP?",

It is not an anti-malware tool.Also, the theory that Bitcointalk was more vulnerable to hacks because of old UI layout is wrong. Theymos (administrator) has hardened the software against most vulnerabillities. On the other hand, most new layouts have subtle loopholes somewhere deep inside the Javascript that are hard to find.",
