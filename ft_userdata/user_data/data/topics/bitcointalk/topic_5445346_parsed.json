The message appeared on the official website of the court on March 17. In addition, a warrant was issued for the children's rights commissioner in Russia, Maria Lvova-Belova.The ICC suspects both of committing war crimes - forced deportations and displacement of the population, in particular children, from the occupied territories of Ukraine. International law can regard this as genocide. The court's website states that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Putin is personally responsible for the alleged crimes. Now the Russian president has the official status of a suspect in an international crime - the illegal forced transfer of Ukrainian children.This means that according to this warrant, the local authorities of the countries that have ratified the Rome Statute and recognize the jurisdiction of the court, in the event of Putin's visit to them, must arrest him. This number includes 123 states, including all the countries of Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of South America (including Russia's ally Venezuela), as well as a large part of the countries of Africa and Asia, including Japan, South Korea and other leaders of the region . In addition, if necessary and if there is political will, the criminal Putin can be brought to trial and other countries that have not ratified the Rome Statute. The leading countries of the world that do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ISS include, first of all, China, India, Turkey, and Russia itself withdrew its signature in 2016.The Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine previously handed over to the ICC more than 40 volumes of materials – more than 1,000 pages.

Ukraine has so far managed to return home 308 children.Now world leaders will think thrice before shaking his hand or sitting down at the negotiating table with him. The world has received a signal that the Russian regime is criminal and its leadership and henchmen will be held accountable.However, this is only one of the first proceedings of this international court.

History knows only 3 precedents when the so-called. presidents (in reality, totalitarian ghouls) were given such a \"black mark\". Now putin is an international CRIMINAL. Moreover, the first article of the accusation, which means that it has an evidence base, is one of the most heinous crimes - the abduction of civilians during a terrorist war. I am sure that there will be an article for war crimes and much more that this scum really arranged both in Russia and in other countries.Now a meeting with putin is an open position \"I support murder, violence, terrorism, illegality, sadism\"",

Even United States and China don't also recognize the International Criminal Court which means that the citizens of these nations cannot be prosecuted by the ICC. The ICC is a toothless bulldog when it comes to persecuting past Presidents of developed nations, while they become a lion when it is dealing with developing nations especially in Africa. Majority of the past leaders tried by the ICC are African leaders.Since the war began in Ukraine, Putin have restricted his travelling, visiting only friendly nations. I don't think any country apart from the US and NATO nations will be able to arrest Putin. There will be a massive protest if my country wants to arrest Putin because we know the consequences. I am not a supporter of the invasion of Ukraine because it was unnecessary. This war has led to the loss of precious lives and expensive properties but I also think that George Bush should first be sent to Hague before Putin.",

This is another empty informational occasion, not worth much attention, in a politically biased topic that has nothing to do with the economy.Yes, Russia has not ratified the Rome Statute and will not do so under the Putin regime, and therefore does not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Putin and his current entourage also do not recognize the established international norms of law, the rules and customs of the war that they unleashed in Ukraine, and generally spit on any public opinion, and also demonstrate that no rules of human behavior apply to them. But still, they will be prosecuted and will suffer a well-deserved punishment.After the issuance of an ICC warrant for Putin's arrest, despite the fact that Russia does not recognize the jurisdiction of this court, any state from 123 countries that acceded to its jurisdiction is obliged to arrest Putin and bring him to the prison of this court in The Hague if he is on their territories.But this is only the beginning. Now Ukraine has initiated the creation of a separate international tribunal. It is created by general agreement. An agreement on the creation has already been written, there is a preliminary agreement of about eleven countries that they are ready to join, including very serious states. This special tribunal will begin to consider whether the highest political leadership is guilty of war crimes and aggression against Ukraine, and the recognition of its jurisdiction by Putin or other suspects, as well as by Russia as a whole, will not matter, just as the norms of human civilization do not matter now for these criminals.If proven guilty, they will receive from 30 years in prison to life imprisonment simply for starting a war.https://www.currenttime.tv/a/mnenie-rossii-uzhe-absolyutno-ne-vazhno-v-gaage-sozdayut-spetsialnyy-tribunal-dlya-suda-nad-putinym-za-prestuplenie-agressii-protiv- ukrainy-/32076126.html",

What is helping the world to witness a somewhat balance is the western power ideology, but with a tyrannical country leader that Russia has, they shouldn't have veto power anymore, particularly with what they did to Ukraine.Let's see how this plays out, the court verdict stands, but it could be arguably baseless because they don't have the power to enforce such. I doubt if any country could be helpful too.And if you noticed, Putin has not been travelling often, that's the price he has to pay. If not, aside from the court ruling, he might be assassinated. He now has enemies everywhere, the war is not worth it.",

The RF government were also expecting to terrorise others into submission, but that failed.Regarding the ICC, I think they have to rule against Putin because there is so much evidence of war crimes that they do not really have an option not to do it. I do not think is a good idea because it does not get anyone any closer to peace. It is much more difficult to agree the terms of the RF withdrawal from all Ukrainian territories, the return of all the forced deportees and the payment of reparations if the government of Ukraine has to do so with a now convicted international criminal. Politically, much more difficult to be accepted.I hope they do not decide to condemn Lavrov as well. You have to keep the phone line open, even if you are talking to criminals.",

And I'll tell you what will happen - nothing. Because the ICC is a cheap horror story for self-proclaimed black dictators from African banana republics. The US didn't give a damn about the authority of the ICC, there is even a law that prohibits the extradition of Americans at the request of the ICC (which was adopted after attempts to prosecute several US citizens for war crimes in Iraq). If the United States considers itself above the jurisdiction of the ICC, then this court is not so international.

It is not the state that finances, but quite a lot of people both from Ukraine and from other countries affected by Russian terror, and many other organizations and people who want to \"drive an aspen stake into the coffin of rashism.\"",

The RF government were also expecting to terrorise others into submission, but that failed.Regarding the ICC, I think they have to rule against Putin because there is so much evidence of war crimes that they do not really have an option not to do it. I do not think is a good idea because it does not get anyone any closer to peace. It is much more difficult to agree the terms of the RF withdrawal from all Ukrainian territories, the return of all the forced deportees and the payment of reparations if the government of Ukraine has to do so with a now convicted international criminal. Politically, much more difficult to be accepted.I hope they do not decide to condemn Lavrov as well. You have to keep the phone line open, even if you are talking to criminals.You may not quite understand the \"game\" with Putin's well-deserved criminal status!Of course, it would be nice to detain this bastard, and lead him in a cage through the ruined cities of Ukraine, through huge fields with graves, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are buried - women, children, old people, tortured and killed by his order. And then in The Hague to pronounce a verdict and hang indicatively. BUT... most likely it won't. But what is it for then?This is, in fact, a go-ahead from the West to Putin's inner circle, which has not stained itself with crimes against Ukraine, which is ready to take power in Russia into its own hands, and be negotiable, to agree on many issues - from the liberation of the territory of Ukraine, to the borders of 1991 to payments reparations and demilitarization and denazification of Russia.And for one thing, this is a hint \"Putin's carcass in The Hague, dead or alive = your indulgence\"  And given the already very high degree of tension in Putin's immediate environment, such an outcome is very likely!PS Although it seems to me that since Russia is so hysterical about \"historical justice\", then the borders of Ukraine should be returned to 1919. I strongly recommend studying the maps of the Ukrainian Independent Republic of 1919-1921!",

It was stated that he has renovated the place as it was the base of Ukraine troop before it was captured by Russian troops.Puttin thinks he can try to fix things back to make people see that he is not what the ICC called him but the Ukrainians are not happy with his visit because that was a place where he commited genocide and he has also adopted Ukrainians children to Russia,which is a big crime.",
