As long as there is still a chance of you losing and not being in control of your predictions it will never be suitable for a career and unlike trading where you can improve your knowledge and skills and eventually helps you perform more trades efficiently gambling is not like that since 90% of it is based on luck. And rather than waste your time looking for means to make gambling a means to earn passively (which would make some results into using some unethical means to achieve it) I’d advise you look for a skills that can later be monetized that’s far more better than betting on luck.",

I do not know how this can be achieved but I feel it is possible. Making gambling a full time job might be seen as risky but I still feel one can make gambling full time job and a career. What do you all think? In my personal opinion, maybe it is true, but are you ready for the big risks of gambling and not to mention the bad effects of gambling that can happen to yourself or even your family and close relatives? There is little chance in my opinion that I can make a career out of gambling, I suggest not to be careless in matters like this. Unless you have money that can't run out.It's not possible, in fact I think this is very risky if you make gambling your main livelihood or full time job, will you always win at gambling? Of course not, people who win or win jackpots only occasionally don't always win, and in my opinion the winnings they get are not equivalent to the money that has been lost due to gambling, expenses and income in gambling will not be equal in my opinion, the greater the expenses we will feel it. If you gamble and always lose but you keep gambling, it means you are a rich person who is willing to waste your money. Even though there are people who gamble with unhealthy physical conditions, for example in a casino I have seen a gambling player who is disabled and uses a wheelchair to help him walk but he still gambles, maybe he has a lot of wealth and spends his money on gambling.",

What do you all think? I think it's pretty obvious that there's no way that you can make a career out of gambling, maybe except you become a pro poker player. But even then you need to have some kind of money to join tournaments and sharpen your skills to become one of the best poker player in the world. So it is still very difficult and the risk is still there that you won't make in the next couple of years.So how can you bring food in the table for your family then? So I guess for the majority of gamblers that are dreaming to make it their job, I guess they have to think twice about it because of so many factors that you need to consider.",

What do you all think? Continuous gambling? Heck no! There’s no such career that will exist that you can lose everything with just one emotional meltdown that will makes you bet recklessly.I believe if there will be a gambling career then it’s more on the casino side such as dealer, support and other jobs that related on casino operations. Direct playing gambling will never be a career except on some gambling games that is skill based such as poker. But with regular gambling games, creating a career is very hard to do because it’s an everyday gamble and no one can ever be successful with that.",

What do you all think? While there are professional gamblers out there, I don't think they'd consider gambling as a full-time job. It's a career, but it's rather similar to how professional eSports players work. They don't necessarily rely only on the game itself, rather they use other methods to earn money, in most cases streaming. Now it's understandable for eSports players to do that, gamblers though? I don't think they'd have that much audience for gambling. I don't think even sponsorships could cut it. So yea, while it can be a career, I don't think it's something you do in a daily basis or rely on it full-time for your money. You can compete professionally, but that's about it I think.",

What do you all think? What!  You will stay single if you are still single and will be a lonely person, that's the first part of the emotional challenge, secondly, you will be mentally down at some points because I don't understand how you will handle all you have all in gambling, it is not even advisable to use 50/50 chances as a source of income. How many successful gamblers have you seen come publicly to say they are into gambling full time and they make a living full time, or perhaps you haven't been there yet otherwise I don't think we will be having this conversation about gambling as a career, only a lazy man will have that thought in the first place.Have you considered where you will be sourcing funds from? What ae you going to do the day you have nothing to use to wager or stake, will you go and look for a side hustle or will take a loan to finance your gambling, too many impossibility in gambling career and opportunities, it's better you remove that while its still fresh and look for good thing to do with life.

Much of gambling streaming is in fact done with funded accounts where the person playing doesn't in fact keep the earnings but is rather paid a stable salary. So while career gambling exists, we ought to recognize that it's just a fallacy. The money comes from other sources. You can't just keep winning reliably in gambling as the odds are always stacked against you. Otherwise games wouldn't be sustained.",

LOl, sorry to say this but I personally think that you are delusional, and the earlier you snap out of it, the better.Yes, you are indeed right about the gambling industry evolving due to growth and advancement in technology globally, but I personally think we have not reached that stage where any body can make a successful career in gambling. To be actually honest with you, I personally do not think that we can ever arrive at the time when a person can make a successful career out of gambling, simply because, most games in gambling has almost everything to do with how lucky a person is, career like we know it is mostly all about skill, something one is good at skillfully, not based on luck or anything like that.So based on my input above, I would say that, nobody can ever make a successful career from gambling outside of luck, without luck, it is ultimately impossible.This is my personal opinion.",

People we are seing making a gambling platform who are the developers are doing so for making business, they are spending so as to earn, if you're working under them also is another means to earn from gambling for a living, but an average gambler who only bet in gambling platforms may not make gambling as a successful source of income because he will often loose more than he can win, moreso, gambling is not a business or an enterprise, we should go for doing business or other things that can fetch in money for us if we really want money in gambling sector but not by playing bets, most of those we may be comparing ourselves to already have their money and don't care winning or loosing each time they gamble.",

A relationship with a person like that will rob you of your peace, and mental balance because they will most of the time be frustrated and will come to you for recovery. These people may also put you in a financial mess from constantly demanding money from you for different reasons, but their main plan will be to be able to fund their gambling when they run out of personal finance from losing.

It is true that the funds they play are not officially from their personal money but it has been provided by the casino that has given them a job to promote the site.
