I mean to me it's rather see through at this point, I don't see people like Ver taking a chance on some alt-coin .And why is it when you go on core dev Twitter page you don't see then addressing SegWit2x, am I wrong for not thinking these forks will do more than be a dead alt coin I'M NOT A DEV, OR A MINER JUST AN ENTHUSIASTS",

      "body": "There will probably be another fork, the real problem we have to look at is whether or not they will set default relay protection because if they dont, they risk messing up peoples holdings on the main chain. Unlike bitcoin cash, if they dont put relay protection I am not 100% sure any exchanges will support it. This whole debate is stupid anyway, the deal was made in an attempt to avoid a fork, but people went off and forked anyway, so this thing shouldnt even be debated. I can do a segwit transaction right now for a quarter and have it confirmed in less than an hour.",
