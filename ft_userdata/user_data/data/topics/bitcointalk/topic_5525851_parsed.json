  "content": "Does anyone have any information about the owners of Bhex and Hbtc exchange who are both the same people and their possible relationship with other exchanges like Huobi now known as HTX?There seems to be a case where both Bhex/Bluehelix and Hbtc fly by night operations have closed up quickly and taken huge amounts of customers funds with them in what appears to be a case of exit fraud.Who are the actual people behind these exchanges and where are they now?",

Never tried to take a test to find the identities of such people, however, I would think it would need lots of resources / help from the specialists/people who are good with OSINT too.",

He is talking about the owner of Bhex exchange aka Bluehelix & HBTC. What I know the exchange as is HBTC which I have found them as on Playstore when I used the exchange 2 or 3 years ago. It is a different exchange entirely. But OP asked if the founder of HTX is also the founder of the HBTC exchange.",

On another note Heco chain bridge, the bridge connects the HTX exchange (formerly Huobi) and Ethereum was exploited for approximately $87 million in crypto assets. Large quantities of ETH, USDT and a wrapped version of bitcoin (HBTC) were seen leaving the bridge for a previously unused Ethereum wallet.Also all these exchanges mentioned seem to use the same colour scheme.There are just so many coincidences but this of course proves nothing except the fact many people have lost their money with these people and they seem to have done quite well.Also some people were never contacted to withdraw from HBTC before they disappeared with their money and even if they were and did not meet the timeout there should still be a segregated wallet for those peoples funds.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on January 09, 2025, 01:30:56 PMI haven't been able to find much, but there was this individual looking into them last year:https://x.com/efforceaction/status/1725448939581693984Maybe you can try to reach out to him (it seems like he's still active) to see if he has more information on the subject.Much appreciated, thanks.",
