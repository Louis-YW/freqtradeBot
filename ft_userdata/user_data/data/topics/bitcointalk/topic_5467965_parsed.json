  "content": "I took this screenshot from my recent merit list. I was merited in this topic: Scammers are getting innovative. But when i checked in my recent merit history it shows (Deleted/Off-limits/Ignored). The topic is still there so it is not deleted. It's not off-limits as well. The only option remains is Ignored. So ignored by who? Moderators? I am sorry if this topic has been posted before to the forum.",

If you are seeing that from your end, it's possible that you have ignored that topic and not the moderator ignoring them. Sometime we can mistakenly click on ignore user without realising it, or you might have tried to create an ignore board and you included the topic you receive your merit from.

Sometime we can mistakenly click on ignore user without realising it, or you might have tried to create an ignore board and you included the topic you receive your merit from. Those are just the possible explanations I can think of.You are right. I put that specific board in my ignore list recently, perhaps by mistake. I thought that post was removed or deleted by moderators, but I wasn't sure why that post was still accessible. Thanks for pointing out the real reasons, and it's silly that sometimes we fail to notice small changes and get confused about what just happens.The problem has been resolved, but I will keep this post open so that interested people can continue their discussions.",
