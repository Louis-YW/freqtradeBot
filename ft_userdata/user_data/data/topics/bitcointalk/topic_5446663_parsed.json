  "content": "Have a look at this:So as far as I know, these stars are redeemable for money. Seems like the silliest idea, until you see some people are already using it. In the screen cap example, it's a model / singer who gets stars from fans and can redeem these for money. The person actually running that page is themother of the singer, and I imagine she's the one cashing in on her daughter's popularity. But if this works country to country ( model singer is from Asia, fans are from Europe / US ) could this be a sneaky way to transfer money ?",

Not saying this is a way to make money but I saw one particular page where the monthly subscription fee was something like $120 ! Can you believe it ? I guess it could be an attempt from Facebook to steal back some of those Tik Tok influencers they lost a while ago.",
