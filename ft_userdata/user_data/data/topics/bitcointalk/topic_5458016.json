I study Bitcoin for free with so many resources most of which are free or require just a little payment. Their interest is good but it is still very early to decide on what direction they would go as the bill is only for studying the possibilities. If it is positive they would have to pass another one to actually acquire it.- Jay -",

Does not looks like a good comparison in specific property of volatility but if they compare them in terms of hedge against inflation, scarcity, demand, supply, profit and loss ratio them I am sure they will find BTC a winner.But things can change if BTC will go down in coming days and what if they went into loss, like will they ban Crypto fully in their state. Like in the month of March 2023, there were several restriction on crypto. It would also result as a good factor to increase the BTC price too in future if BTC win the battle against gold in their organized competition.",

The gold isn't that much volatile and that's why it many not lose or gain a lot of value in short period. This type of experiment will favor gold if the crypto market dumps, and it will only favor Bitcoin if crypto market pumps.  Such type of studies will most probably favor gold as a less volatile and secure asset. The result will most probably be in favor of gold because if this study is for short period, and unfortunately Bitcoin gets another dump in coming days then the value of their holdings that are in Bitcoin will be way lower than the ones they have in gold. Let's say if they have allocated $25k for gold and $25k for Bitcoin, and if an unsudden market crash takes place, and the value of Bitcoin goes back to $27k then the value of their holdings in Bitcoin will be $22,140, and that would be very low as compare to the holdings they have in gold.",

Not a lot of government entities want their people to get educated in investments and all that stuff, because if they do, they'd surely put some initiatives that tackle about investments and how to be financially literate in schools. I say that this bill is actually quite helpful if anything, especially if it's taught in schools as the kids are growing up.",

Science is definitely not going to make a bad call on Bitcoin holding since history shows us only positive things. I have never heard of a bad holding experience. Only when people sell at a loss or when centralized crypto exchanges are concerned, does Bitcoin seem to have a negative look in the news and social media. But thats all superficial and has no effect on the value of Bitcoin, long term.",

However, the volume has not been the same since 2021, creating a significant market momentum. And I believe that now is the moment to invest in Bitcoin. If the bill gets approved, I believe it will attract more investors, causing the price of Bitcoin to rise and possibly reach a new high potentially hit $37k.
