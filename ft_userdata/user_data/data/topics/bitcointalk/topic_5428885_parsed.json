The creators of the project also try to eliminate its biggest disadvantages, such as huge fees. It may be too slow, but it does work. However, you need to realize that both ETH and the entire crypto market are now in a completely different place than 6-7 years ago and it will be very hard to get such profits as presented above.Quote from: Blawpaw on December 15, 2022, 06:29:48 PMI wouldnt put my money on eth in any way.

Now that eth abandoned POW and is now fully POS it will become less and less attractive, and soon it may be replaced by something better and decentralized. I don't quite understand why you think that the transition from POW to POS is a mistake. I believe that in the face of the growing energy crisis in the world, this is a positive change for the entire project in the long run.",

Buying ETH will always be my priority because its very consistent on being the top altcoins despite of many issues before and beside, its pretty cheap right now and you might be able to get more profit once the market recovers. The only problem with ETH is their network, its still expensive though and slower compare to other network, but despite of that issue it remains profitable over the past years and that could be enough reason for me to have some ETH.",

And past performance is not the best indicator.True, it's no guarantee for us to make money in the future.But the fact that it can still make investors money then for sure ETH is a good investment as compare to other altcoins right now. So I would say maybe putting like $500 is not that bad this year for ETH and then simply hold and see how it goes.Instead of putting it on some altcoins and believed that it can make you instant million in the future or in the next bull run. The risk is less on ETH to collapse or go to 0 as compare to other altcoins, just saying.",

We've seen many altcoins went up reaching new ATH and then going down on a bear market and when the bull market comes again, it didn't even reach its past ATH. That does mean, what happened in the past might not happen in the present or in the future as well.Even I didn't read that post that you've made OP, I will slowly accumulate Ethereum until to a point where I think is enough and will focus on Bitcoin more after that. On the other hand, though it seems that its transitioning into POS might affect its popularity as people want a decentralized coin like Bitcoin but nevertheless, it's a good long-term coin to hold still.",

Now that eth abandoned POW and is now fully POS it will become less and less attractive, and soon it may be replaced by something better and decentralized. Apart from bitcoin, there will be no altcoins using POW anymore, simply because the current goals of the projects are scalability, fast transaction speeds, and as cheap gas fees as possible. People wouldn't care too much about privacy if it wasn't profitable, and if ETH was still POW, I think people would leave it sooner because of the troubles it got into. I firmly believe that ETH is still the king of altcoins, and no new altcoin can replace it, if investing in altcoins, then ETH is a perfect choice.",
