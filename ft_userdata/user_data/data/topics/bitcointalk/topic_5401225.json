  "content": "Hi guys.I recently created are couple of paper wallets on bitaddress.org.I know that the wallet details section can provide the public BTC address associated with a given private key.the function works perfectly when I import / checks private keys created via other wallet generators.however, problems arise when I impot / check the details of the private keys generated by bitaddress.org itself, a different public address than the one I have been given is stated....what is the explanation for this?Have I missed something very obvious?",

      "body": "Hope you use https://bitaddress.org? That is the correct URL. I have just generated a paper wallet on bitaddress and import it on Electrum and it works perfectly. Check the wallet details very well, there are two addresses, one is uncompressed and beside it is a compressed address, one should be the same with the one you generated, either compressed or uncompressed.If the private key starts from 5, it is uncompressed, if the private key starts from K or L, it is compressed.",

      "body": "I would also add that using online wallet generators is highly unsafe (I hope that you at least downloaded the git repo and used it on an offline environment).Even more, javascript based wallet generators are unsafe too.However, I've done a test for OP and I've got the same result as @Charles-Tim : the private key was imported correctly into Electrum.So, OP, please tell in more words:1. what you do exactly (what setup you have to generating the addresses)2. where you want to try the addresses (what wallet, what OS)3. how you transfer the information (direct QR from the web page or paper wallet, or copy-paste maybe?) whether you do other steps too?",

You could effectively generate a paper wallet via using Electrum offline or Bitcoin Core. Obviously, verifying the download of them, and then generating the private key offline. In my opinion, there's not much use in using bitaddress if you have access to Electrum or Bitcoin Core. There's just additional risks depending on how you generated it via bitaddress.  Quote from: king_cobra on June 03, 2022, 12:20:38 PMthe function works perfectly when I import / checks private keys created via other wallet generators.however, problems arise when I impot / check the details of the private keys generated by bitaddress.org itself, a different public address than the one I have been given is stated....What other wallet generators are you using? They could be unsafe or compromised, which could effectively steal your private key, and output a completely different address. It's best to import it via Electrum/Bitcoin Core which has been verified. That way, you know you've got the correct software, and aren't trusting a unknown source.",

Or it could be that walletgenerator is a known scam as Loyce has pointed out and is therefore showing you a completely unrelated address which is actually controlled by the malicious owner of that website who will steal any coins you deposit to that address.If you want another trustworthy site to verify what bitaddress is showing you, then use this one instead: https://iancoleman.io/bitcoin-key-compression/",
