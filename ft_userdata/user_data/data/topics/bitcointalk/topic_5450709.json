I didn't use 2GB pruning options in the wallet qt. I didn't want to use C drive appdata folder so I've added 54.7MB in the SSD in the Bitcoin folder with daemon & qt there.

The plan's always been 1TB SSD. The 500GB SSD route was curiosity for capture percentage download along the way. I'll transfer the bitcoin folder from 500GB SSD to 1TB SSD.

They've got the best reputations it's a stellar performer I didn't have any problems with it. It isn't confirmed when I'll buy a 1TB SSD Samsung for continuing download. In later days I'd like to hot swap the SSD to test on more devices.",

[edit] because the amount of Bitcoin itself has not yet reached the maximum limit (20,999,999.9769 bitcoins), so there are still many blocks that have not been mined.As of 2023-04-29, the number of Bitcoin Blocks reached 787500 blocks and estimated Blocks up to 1207500 (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply)and Bitcoin Blockchain Size reaches 476.80 GB for Apr 29 2023 (https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size)So the estimated Total Bitcoin Blockchain size up to the last BTC is= (1207500 Blocks x 476.8 GB) : 787500 Blocks= 731.0933 GBIn other words, the Percentage of the number of Bitcoin Blocks as of 2023-04-29= (787500 : 1207500) x 100%= 65.21739 %Correct me if I'm wrong.",

Regardless of what you have discussed above, some future upgrades or soft forks might change the size of each Block.What is clear, the percentage of download progress of the Bitcoin blockchain on a 500GB SSD a few years ago could reach 100%, but the rate for now and in the next few years will be different.",

After that, a successful miner would be rewarded by transaction fees only.Quote from: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.html-snip-Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.  It'll be distributedto network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in halfevery 4 years.first 4 years: 10,500,000 coinsnext 4 years: 5,250,000 coinsnext 4 years: 2,625,000 coinsnext 4 years: 1,312,500 coinsetc...When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees ifneeded.  It's based on open market competition, and there willprobably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.Satoshi Nakamoto",
