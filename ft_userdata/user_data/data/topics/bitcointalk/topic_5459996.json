However my point are, give the general public what they needs to know about your speeches and point of learning from your audience as I believe no one cares to see your beard rather wanting to grasped every little opportunities that could possibly leads them to success and how to go about with their bitcoin and cryptocurrency journey.I can't wait to learn and hear from your videos.SmartGold01 cares!",

I am surprised you want to do this. I have always imagined you to be a hardcore privacy advocate.When you say \"general videos first,\" what exactly do you mean with that and why would it not fit in any of the bitcoin boards?Educational content is always appreciated. Just imagine an audience that knows nothing and needs everything explained in an easy to understand way. I would stay away from too much technical jargon unless it's really vital to the content. And please announce your YouTube channel somewhere. I would be interested to watch the stuff you release.",

Do you think this is the best approach?Well, I think you are doing a great job to educate others with such an amazing YouTube channel, and I will definitely subscribe to your channel without any doubt. I always thought that there should be a channel specific to Bitcoin from someone who has enough knowledge about it, and I truly believe that you're among those people who understand a lot about Bitcoin and that's why you can educate others very well about Bitcoin without any doubt. Regarding help, it would be a pleasure for me to help you in any way I possibly can. And, it's the first step because in start of a channel we always feel some kind of fear, but after 1-4 successful video then we get used to it. I'm not sure about others, but I'm ready to help such channel launch and grow because such channel will be a really nice source of information for many users who want to learn about Bitcoin. I must say that you should take the first step, and after that things will be very normal and easy for you.",

I don't think anyone will really care about the bearded face; they might even not notice it if they are getting what they want from the video. So just be you and do you. Why do your video compromise your beliefs? It's not an option, and even if you don't want to show your face, there are also possible ways of sharing videos without showing one's face. Only the voice and illustration of what's being discussed will be visible.",

But you have always wanted to use every opportunity to contribute positively to your society. You are an inspiration to me.I will want you to use this channel and dispute the lies that Bitcoin mining is one of the major destroyers of the environment. Some unfair environmentalists have been brainwashing the people that bitcoin mining is highly unfriendly to the environment. And they have refused to speak the truth about the main polluters of the environment. We will never hear how electric cars and other acclaimed green energy products cause harm to our world. So it will not be a bad idea to have an episode to expose these lies.Quote from: Jet Cash on July 16, 2023, 11:34:22 AMAs I have already posted, I'm in the throes of creating a new YouTube channel, and I want to include a variety of topics in this.

      "body": "Well thanks for all the positive encouragement. The UK gov thinks that statistically I've got about another 8 years to go, but that I have a 2.8% chance of living to be over 100. Personally I think I've just entered middle age, but aybe I'm delusional.I did think of having a Bitcoin specific channel, but I decided that would probably be preaching to the converted. I've spent quite a lot of time looking at Channel Makers and other YouTube educators, and I decided to focus on my less common characteristics. The core of this would seem to be my age - there isn't much for or about people over 60 or 70, and my decidsion to adopt the van life and Bitcoin. I'm also interested in preserving the environment, and the quality of life and health for the bulk of the population. That's why I decided to hang my chanel around the offgrid camper theme, with special emphasis on the advantages of being over 80. I scrub up well, so I've never been overly concerned about general appearance, but I used toi be concerned about detail. For example, did you know that traditionally gentlemen had 4 buttons on the cuffs of their suits, and servants had 3. However, I have had to adapt to current social norms where very few men wear suits any more. In fact about the only time I wear a suit is when I'm attending court, and I've had a load of civil actions in my life. Fortunately I've managed to avoid any criminal court appearances except as a juror. My thoughts on the beard were really based on the consideration of placing emphasis on my age. Apparently I look younger without it.I'm not sure that I'm qualified to start a Bitcoin specific channel, as there are many in this forum with a far greater knowledge of Bitcoin and its ooperation than me. I do think that I may have a good knowledge iof the way Bitcoin is adapting to the current banking and investment changes. Foe example, many people would rank the security of some assets in the fiollowing order - Property ( real estate ), fiat currency, and Bitcoin. With Bitcoin in a distant 3rd position. In fact I would reverse that order, and in justification, I would remind people that in the UK, the crown is the legal ownner of all property in the UK.Right now I'm experimenting with a Blue Yeti microphone attached to a Huawei core i5 matebook, and using OBS studiio to create videos. It's a pretty simple and basic setup, and it will allow me to get started. Getting started seems to be the most important first step.  I'm in Sainsbury's cafe, and I've decided that I need a pop filter, so I'm getting pretty close to submitting something foir general comment.",

The mindset of coming with this great idea is a already a sign that you’re going to do great when you kickstart your YouTube channel. Should i call this procrastination or not? The more you drop a message about this idea, the more I feel you’re a step closer to starting. It is better you don’t relent on this, we can’t wait to see your channel come live to enlighten people about bitcoin, and yours will no doubt be a reputable source to get information from. About the age, there’s no age that should restrict you from getting what you want to achieve done, that shouldn’t discourage you but should serve as an encouragement to make a difference.",

Make a roadmap so you don't get confused when making a new video4. Look for references and analyze competitor channels, what are their weaknesses5. Set a target, is your target to create a YouTube channel to make money or to fill your spare time6. Do it now.

Even less of them will be living in campers.The population above 80 years is about 5%. The percentage of people that own Bitcoin isn't that large either. That makes your target audience a niche within a niche within a niche (although I realize some of the niches can overlap).If you want to appeal to a wide audience, you'll have to make it interesting to watch even for the people who will never do it by themselves. Many people seem to be interested in off-grid life:3 days solo survival: 28 million views.Winter survival shelter: 23 million views.Building off grid cabin in the woods: 24 million views.Most people will never do it, but it's nice to watch for people stuck in city life.

But if you want to rank faster, focusing on bitcoin contents alone will help you achieve the goal. Can you do this for 5 years non stop? Chasing a long term goal pays off indeed. If you must add other topics always find a means to initiate bitcoin into the video, it'll help indicate to your audience that, at your old age, you're fully into bitcoin.

My feeling that adding a Bitcoin hashtag would allow people interested in Bitcoin to be selective. Other videos may not be of interest to them, especially the quirky ones. I'm going to interview my friend's Rottweiler/Staffie cross dog for example, and that won't appeal to everyone. I've just repaired the hissing brakes on my van at no cost, and that may be of general interest, and not just for owners of old LDV Convoy vans. I own the domain name Save Old Cars and this is another stream that I intend to include. This is a 1990 Volvo 740 that I own. I call it \"The Hoe\" because of the last 3 letters in its registration number. I plan to bring that up to show condition so that I can attend some classic car meets.With regards to the Bitcoin stream, I'm going to split the videos into a number of micro topics such as Blockchain, decentralisation/permissionless transfers, wallets, virtual assets as hard assets etc. I'd like to create initial videos, and have them peer reviewed in this forum. I can create updated videos with more authority. This is something that is/should be done in the medical profession, but it doesn't seem to be done with crypto. I'd be happy to give Bitcoin Talk the credit if that is within the rules here.I keep hitting setups, so I'm sorry for the delay in this project. I'm currently in the Morrison's cafe, and I'm trying to activate an old dash cam I bought some time ago. I'm having problems with the memory card. It wants a TD micro SD card, and I didn't realise that the TF format was used on the early cards. I've got loads of SD cards, but I'm not sure how to tell which are TF format. I may just buy a new dash cam, as this one uses the early USB cable with the V-shaped sides, and I've only got one suitable cable which I use on the Blue Yeti.",
