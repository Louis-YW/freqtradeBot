Based on some orientation I gave to him in the flight made him to return the money I paid for flight when will got to our destination because, he gained some ideas from me in the flight that made me to bring this topic, Is there any way someone can survive only in money in a particular investment without acquire idea? Because I know that idea and money are very important to investors.If you have idea on a particular investment, it will help you to follow the straight way that will lead you to some stage that will make you to believe that you are close to your destination of greatness, and if you have money and idea, very easy for you to grow higher in your investment which the two are very important to investors because, you will know the type of business to invest your money which you have the idea that it will bring a good profits to you in the future.

Then there's also passive income, which can also be inherited in a way. Someone might have started a very successful company and given shares to relatives. The relatives don't need any new ideas, they can simply enjoy what they're getting this way.Then there's an option of a wealthy's person bright idea to be hiring smart people who will figure out how to generate new ideas and accumulate more wealth for them.",

Do you believe idea and money are very important in investment? Or can you succeed with money without idea in that investment.A business plan is basically a document that elaborates on the idea you have to make money through rendering a service or offering goods for sale. Irrespective of how wealthy you are, your business must be built on an idea or sets of ideas. That's why companies have vision and mission statements.Consequently, I may not have the idea but I have the money and choose to invest in someone else's idea for a piece of equity on the business.",

And the name of the result depends on a process, and a good process, it does not guarantee that we will get good results too. But even so, it should not make you become desperate and resigned to the situation. So keep trying all possible ways that can lead you to the gate of success, never mind how many times you fall, but make sure you can always get up more. If you fall 10 times then make sure that you will get up 11 times.Likewise in investing, if you often get losses, then immediately go to evaluate yourself and and continue to try to improve the ability as well as knowledge in making investments. So that you will always be able to increase the possibility of getting profits in the investment you do. Experiencing losses in investing is something that is natural, because after all in investment there is a risk and so that you can get profit in investing, then you must be able to take a risk.",

I would love you to re-read what you wrote! But in the main time, for anyone to make investment it doesn't matter the independence of the person but what is really required is the goal or the bigger picture, as far as there is an urge for wealth increment then the capital and the idea must come based on what I said earlier you don't need to have the capital before you start or you don't need to have the idea yourself before you make an investment. From what I have learnt from @franky1 investment can only be made to an already existing idea or business so for anyone to invest you do need an already existing plan. Developing a new idea is equally not investing but generating Capital.",

It is not because there are some better options on investment.

The world resolves around business and money, but you don't necessarily need an original idea to be profitable. In some markets if you're able to reach a certain scale and undercut your competitors price, then you can potentially squeeze enough profit out of it to sustain a business. Ideas are often worth nothing however, until they are transformed into practice - so your friend does not owe you anything and many other people could have thought of the same concepts as you. If you think your ideas are so genius, then put them into practice instead of moaning and pretending they made someone else rich, it was the action that made the person rich, not simply the thought.",

After a while this idea becomes a irrelevant and they forget about or lack the zeal to do it anymore. As someone who wants to go into Investment looking for a good job that could help you save money for your investment plans should be a criteria.
