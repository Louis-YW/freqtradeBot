      "body": "For me, I am only using XRP for some reason like choosing it before I send my funds to our local wallet because of the low transaction fees and also one of the fastest transactions you could ever have especially when you tried the other altcoins in their congestion moments where the transactions stuck for hours and sometimes days before sent success. I don't think this reason why the price is increasing maybe there is some more valid reason for it to increase these days, maybe people are just preparing for bull runs which when the price of BTC will drastically increase, the price of XRP is increase as well. In other words, they prefer XRP to bitcoins because of the more profits it can bring.",

Unlike BTC or ETH that people think when the price increase $1000, it's only up for few % and the profit wouldn't satisfy them.Don't forget most people doesn't care with decentralized, centralized or privacy stuffs.",

Am really curious as to know why.This is one coin among the top 100 coins on cmc that i don't take a glance at, i don't know why but i just don't pay attention to it or try to. Who knows why people buy what they buy, you would think after all the lawsuit saga many people will lost interest in it, but instead people keep buying to support the project. I think xrp is just basking on past glory, the so heavily discussed banking system being the main backbone of the project is definitely one of it, some people still hold on to that info about xrp and bank but till now we have not actually seen which of the bank(S) are in connection with the project and have express their connection with the project.",

Who? Which ones? Its tech has to be really outdated by this point. It was always centralized and lacked poor distribution.Anyone here buying XRP or even holding it? Am really curious as to know why.During the hype of 2017, I succumbed to this phenomenon and also bought xrp. Quite a bit, like a few hundred coins. At that moment, I knew absolutely nothing about all the shortcomings of the xrp, and in general, my knowledge of the cryptocurrency was also extremely superficial. My choice in favor of xrp was due to the fact that the project \"has potential\" or something like that, as such shitcoins are usually praised. Now, this all seems very naive to me and I would never buy a xrp. I have no idea why the xrp price has risen this week. One thing is clear to me, it means that someone has shown interest in this coin and is buying. The reasons for their behavior are not clear to me, for I am not one of them. And I wouldn't want to be one of them.",

It's more like a bridge because of the low transaction fees but I am not holding. I quickly sell it again for something else right after I receive it. It doesn't even take 5 minutes being an XRP.   I haven't got a clue if that helps with the demands to increase in value but I know many does the same thing.",

The hype surrounding xrp is almost gone, after the lawsuit with the SEC I hardly see anything attractive about xrp anymore, xrp has long been out of my portfolio. People still use them probably because their transaction fees are cheaper than other coins. In the same way, even though I don't hold doge, I always use doge as a means of payment for my clients because doge's transaction fees are also cheap and transactions are fast.",

So I became curious about the people who hold it for the long term. is there a specific reason that I don't know. so lately even XRP is showing a fairly stable and measurable increase. shows the level of buying continues to increase slowly and the holding back is also increasing slowly.although I've actually read pretty good stuff about XRP too. but I'm not sure.I will quote a little here from the source directly. and please read in full from the sources I listedQuoteAn eight-year dumping spree has come to a long-overdue end.Just days ago, on-chain data showed that Jed McCaleb’s wallet held around 2.77 million XRP tokens. However, his ‘tacostand’ wallet currently shows just 46.7 XRP worth circa $20 left.The former founder of Ripple sent out his final transfer of 1.1 million XRP, worth $394,742.18, at 6:31 AM UTC on Sunday, according to blockchain explorer XRP Scan.
