It seems like a casual hang out, not too strict and stuffy and maybe intimidating but it seems really fun and enjoyable. The atmosphere seems amazing and I wish I could go here as well. It is always nice to see events about crypto and bitcoin being held in all around the world as it just proves how globally well known and well accepted bitcoin is by almost everyone. I wish that a similar event, organized with almost the same vibes here, here in my country where I can finally attend and anyone interested can go and take a peek if they would like.",

      "body": "Knowing that the event is free and strictly about Bitcoin makes it interesting. The topics to be discussed are also very interesting and I would have loved to be in such a gathering where like minds discuss Bitcoin. It could also be a time to enjoy the rural attractions of the location. It would have been great to hear the Libertarian Party's discussion on Bitcoin Policy in Australia. I am not also close to Australia but it is good to see such an event happening which shows that Bitcoin awareness is spreading fast.",
