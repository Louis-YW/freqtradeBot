We had recently lowered our withdrawal limits, however $50 was hardcoded into the system from a long time ago and it overrode the manual lowering change. This has now been fixed and won't be an issue for next week. Unlucky with the retired tennis player !!Â  Settlement efficiency has been worked on this week and will continued to be worked on in future weeks to ensure matches are settled in a much more timely fashion, with minimal delay. With good improvements in ability to pinpoint games that require manual settlement. T&Cs on specific sport rulings will be released once we have additional markets incorporated and once Live Betting is incorporated. Both are near highest tasks on current priority list !",

We have many other deposit options available to switch on, we only started with these 4 to initially reduce risk. Any in particular you would like to see more than others?Yes good point - we have a task planned to add popular competitions on the slider, and to be able to search via the homepage.. as currently it is a bit of hassle for people to need to use the hamburger menu each time, so this needs to be improvedRe: support, you can always reach us at support@betkudos.com, but you will be pleased to know we are working on a chat function, so that you can resolve most issues without needing to leave the site",

Thanks for the feedback.We have most of those Casino providers integrated, just initially disabled for soft launch to reduce any risk. These will be gradually turned on over timeGreat feedback on the coins, we were thinking very similar ourselves. Those with low transaction cost and speed.VIP is definetely something on our radar, we know that cashback and rakeback are very popular at the moment. We hope to combine this along with free bets and entries to our social sports competitions (more news on this soon)",
