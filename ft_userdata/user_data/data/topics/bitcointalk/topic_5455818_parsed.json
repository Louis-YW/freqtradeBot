  "content": "So once again QNT jumps to the top of my portfolio with 100 QNT . I suspect most of you know about what Quant is trying to do, so I will just outline a few reasons:First of all, as far as Altcoins are concerned... we're still in a Bear Market. Maybe even AT THE BOTTOM of the Bear Market ( or near the bottom )This could go on for another 6 to 9 months for Alts as Bitcoin's Market Cap dominance is still high.So rather than putting my money in a risky, extremely volatile Alt like FLUX or SFUND ( both of which I absolutely love, and are near the lowest they have been during this bear market ), I decided to invest in something relatively low risk. I didn't choose any of the top 10 as I believe the upside potential is low ( 4X or less for most of them ).So Quant being outside of the top 30 gives me just the right balance of risk and upside potential.Here's a few other reasons:Quant offers a Gateway to the world of Finance: Banks, Institutions, Corporate and CDBCs.Interoperability is at the core of this offering.Huge partnerships, strong leadership and highly disruptive.Low token supply, high utility, potentially high demand.Battle tested during previous markets and one of the best performers during the last Bull Run.While the current price is disappointing, I did the numbers and QNT is up 160% from the absolute bottom of the bear market nearly a year ago.I compared this with many other leading projects ( Matic, XRP, Cardano, LINK, Solana, Avalanche, IMX, BNB, ALGO and a few others ) and QNT has outperformed all of them ( during this Bear Market ). A few other tokens like INJ and Render have better numbers , but also more volatility on the way down. If for some reason BTC goes back to 21K or 20K I'd hate to be holding too many of those.Incidentally, token performance is not just how fast the gains are when things are going well, it's also how strong a token is when BTC is crashing... and I have noticed that QNT has managed to outperform giants like BTC, ETH and MATIC on the way down at least a few times.So for me QNT is a low risk, strong performer with huge potential upside... which is why it currently sits at the top of my portfolio stack.",

      "body": "You do realize that you are buying startup without use case, without userbase evaluated above $1B? I know it dumped hard from ATH but I think most of altcoin investors don't know how much money is 1 billion. \"Huge partnerships, strong leadership and highly disruptive.Low token supply, high utility, potentially high demand.\"May not be enough to justify 1 billion $ marketcap. The timing might be good. The amount of fud is enormous but it's just one out of 20000 projects listed on CMC. And it's tech is worthless without huge userbase because it's open source and can be copy/paste and implemented into market leaders such as BNB or eth. Just be carrefour. There are high chances for a short term bounce but it can also continue to dump another 99%. Real value is much lower.",

You know the supply is just a number that developer sets at its own will while creating coin? You know that there are coins with supply of 1? 1 coin as a max supply of a project? People trade fractions of this coin just like 1 bitcoin can be devided into 100 000 000 sats.42-coin has a max supply of 42 and is not on top. Its out of top 1000.Lint has a supply of 1 coin. Out of top 2000.@Op and @Rampagoe004 - name one thing that QNT have that can't be stolen, implemented and monetized by market leader using their huge usebase.",

      "body": "In fact, right now it is risky to be in any altcoin at all. Bitcoin's dominance is growing, and many altcoins are rapidly losing value. There is uncertainty in the market right now, a lot of FUD, and the first thing that will depreciate rapidly in your portfolio is altcoins. Anything within the top 100 ranking, outside the top 100 ranking, doesn't matter. Right now, the most ideal portfolio for an investor is a set of bitcoin and stablecoins. Anything else will be unprofitable until the market really recovers.",

That means, the deep network connections Quant has to large Institutions and the Financial sector in general. You obviously have no idea how well connected Quant is, it's got partnerships with Oracle, LACChain, UST, Nexi, Alliance Block, Bank of England, SIA\"SIA has not only partnered with the European Central Bank connecting all central banks in Europe to the ESMIG, but also provide networks for other Central Banks such as Bank of Canada, Nordic Central Banks and over 100+ Tier 1 Banks.\"  ( Medium article )https://cryptoseq.medium.com/why-quant-has-the-potential-to-be-an-incredible-long-term-investment-89b86d1921fdOracle and UST are as big as they come, and they are huge corporate players outside of crypto. \" Oracle designated Quant Network as an interoperability solution for their Oracle Blockchain Platform. \" ( Seeking Alpha article )https://seekingalpha.com/article/4534332-quant-network-believes-blockchain-needs-an-operating-systemYou can copy and paste a code, but that won't do you any good if you're lacking all the network connections and partnerships that Quant has. Plus they have years of development and experience forging these connections.",
