If it does not have these two points, it will not have much value. If there is a digital currency that can be used in a specific way  If it becomes a currency in circulation, its value will be very high.  Do you guys have any recommendations for this type of currency?",

In operation, it actually assumes the role similar to the central bank of legal tender! Moreover, it is pseudo-anonymous, and the digital currency management center will disclose it regularly, so you are not afraid of account loss or theft!",

Most of the shitcoins don't solve a problem but stack up on existing list of shit coins as just another coin fuled by the hype and craze of the market. You would be safer with bitcoin because it actually solved a problem than any altcoin.Of course we might get more coins that are actually useful but this is still a waiting game and the niche market here gets much less recognition from the mainstream media than what is necessary to grab investors into paying for it. For now bitcoin is the only coin that meets these points.",

Ethereum is a good choice but IMO only as an asset right now because the fees are damn high even when they changed to POS. I don't doubt BNB too, Binance coin even if they are being cornered by SEC. Soon the truth will come out and it might boost the value of that coin more if they can overcome this challenge that had been fired to them. I also bought CRO before, Crypto.com cryptocurrency Cronos. I think they will stay for a long time and based on how they market their business it will surely be one of the important coins in the market as time flies by.
