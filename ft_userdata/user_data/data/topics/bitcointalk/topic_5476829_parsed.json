Then why is it necessary to give an email and pass it to your Telegram channel? What is this? Is it mandatory? because if you tell me yes, it will immediately be a red flag to most people, for sure.",

DYOR folks, this doesn't sound like it's a good idea.Yep, probably a bunch of credit card theft scammers, that'll load in the chips from stolen CC. Which will get flagged sooner or later, most likely. Who even buys them anyways? when you could play for free. Or, just play with real money/crypto.",
