Seems to be working good, except once every 24-26 hours or so, it disconnects from my WIFI, and I have to manually reconnect it (it won't automatically reconnect like other devices in my house). Any thoughts on how to fix this?",

      "body": "I guess it's due to a weak signal or there are many people connected on the same Wifi, most of the wifi modem(If it was from an internet provider) only allows 3 devices. So if you don't want to keep disconnected then a direct connection through an Ethernet cable is the best. Or maybe buying a router can improve your wifi connection in your house.",
