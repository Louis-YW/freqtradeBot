Yo can use the link provided by Charles-Tim to set it up. But make sure the keys to the multi sig are not stored on online device and most importantly not on just one device. Also aside using multi sig if the intention is for you to have all the keys to your self and not share with someone I will advise a single sig setup on an airgapped device. This way you have less keys to save or protect rather than storing 2 to 3 keys and seeds yourself",

Also if you don't have a proper backup of your seed phrases and master public keys, you can either lock yourself out of your funds or lose the funds easily if your backup is compromised.Let's say you want to set up a 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet, for strong security it should be stored in a hardware wallet, airgapped device and maybe an online wallet. Take note that in a multi-sig set up you need all your master pub keys to recover your wallet, so this is a great way to back it up:- Seed phrase 1 and Master public key 2- Seed phrase 2 and Master public key 3- Seed phrase 3 and Master public key 1So if you lose one back up, you can still recover the wallet, and if an attacker compromises one backup, they can't spend the funds because they have just one key and you'll be able to move your funds to a safe wallet. Setting up a multi-sig wallet is kind of complicated, and if you don't know what you are doing, you may want to get a hardware wallet and add a passphrase to it as an extra layer of protection.",

Having a multisig wallet on two devices defeats the purpose of multisig and that will render the wallet vulnerable. Also it is good to backup the seed phrase properly as you have mentioned, but having your multisig wallet online on different devices is safe and secure as long as you avoid malware. Although, cold storage will make multisig wallet safer, but having it online does not mean it is not safe and secure, and also it does not mean it is vulnerable like single key wallets.",

The seed phrase or backup phrase is what can be written down and stored safely and not the keys which is a combination of different characters including numbers and alphabets.An airgapped device is an alternative to a hardware wallet or a multi sig wallet and is not as complicated to set up while providing same level of security.- Jay -",

But, it is not that easy to configure if you plan to use it on two different devices.A multi-sig wallet ought to be on different devices, not on a single device which will defeat its purpose. A multi-sig set up provides more security to your funds, and the main purpose of setting it up is that it is difficult for an attacker to compromise more than one device to get the required number of keys to spend the funds, it is even more secure when some of the devices are airgapped or offline.Quote from: Bureau on August 21, 2023, 09:38:47 AMIt is better to follow the old ways wherein you keep your backup phrases and Private key somewhere safe.

You can have the wallet setup on different devices and which increases its security. But as for passphrase, it is most helpful against offline attack. There are many wallets that their seed phrase and passphrase can be seen on the wallet and this makes the passphrase not to be that helpful online as an attacker that compromised such wallet already can know both the seed phrase and passphrase.",

What I said was clear and concise. I don't want a multisignature wallet with all its configuration mumbo jumbo. I would rather have a hardware wallet and use my online wallet for trading purposes. I understand that wouldn't suffice for my security. Then it is better to have more than one wallet and use it according to my personal needs. I am not a businessman. I am a user who is not disclosing his identity and does constantly change his wallet address.",

Surely it is a secure set up if you do everything correctly, a mix of a good hardware wallet and an online wallet is good enough, the hardware wallet which hold your keys offline will store your main funds, and you'll use your online wallet to hold trading and spending funds. A multi-sig wallet isn't the only secure method of storing your funds, a single hardware wallet with an additional passphrase if you want, is also very secure.",

It all depends what wallets you are using for multisig setup and how many devices you are using, but there is no universal instruction for everything.I would avoid using ledger and trezor wallets in any multisig setup, as they can have issues that is not allowing construction of multisig or it can't be verified or it's not secure.If you are doing this for a first time maybe it's best to first try creating multisig with bitcoin testnet coins before you switch to mainnet.Here is one good multisig step-by-step instruction from Bitbox hardware wallet blog:https://bitbox.swiss/blog/bitbox02-electrum-bitcoin-multisig/There is a list I made with most wallets that curtently support multisig:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5324749",
