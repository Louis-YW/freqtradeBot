However, by 9:40 a.m. EDT on Thursday, fees had dropped to 625 sat/vB or $53.26 per transaction.A day like today is likely a breath of fresh air for the mining community as they can collect more fees than usual. https://news.bitcoin.com/babylon-staking-sparks-bitcoin-fee-surge-transfers-hit-105-before-plummeting/you asked for it you got it. don't like high transaction fees then maybe you're not using the right crypto. lets stop trying to \"time\" our transactions and just pay the fee...you want proof of work, you got it!",

High transaction fee, or a volatile fee market is quite common for cryptos that are popular and shouldn't come at a surprise.I wouldn't want to try to pay extra just to 'subsidise' miners when the halving comes along.

As a matter of fact, I'm paying exactly what's required for a high priority transaction to get through. Like it or not, that's what the network requires. Bitcoin isn't a charity. It's a payment system. If there is a need for users to be charitable to miners, paying more than enough, in order for the system to continue running, then something must be wrong with it. It might not be sustainable at all. Fortunately, it isn't the case. The price of Bitcoin is more than $60,000 right now and just a few weeks ago, difficulty reaches another ATH which means the mining environment remains robust and highly competitive.You're not bothered, but what about those who prefer to use Bitcoin on a daily basis, the very people Bitcoin is primarily created for? If you recommend for them to use centralized platforms or second layers instead, isn't it the same as not supporting Bitcoin miners since they aren't paying network fees anymore?

Many people are using options and that's not cheating. Are there rules to cheat on, to begin with? If LTC is cheaper than Bitcoin, then anybody is free to use LTC instead. In the same manner that if Monero is more private than Bitcoin then anybody is also free to prefer Monero instead. There is no rule and it's not necessary to be exclusive, to be religiously loyal. Humanity won't move forward if we stick to something merely for the sake of sticking to it. Your logic is quite off once again. It doesn't follow that since a medium is good for moving value it is automatically a medium good for storing it.",
