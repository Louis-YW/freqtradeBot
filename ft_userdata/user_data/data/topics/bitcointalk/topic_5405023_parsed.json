      "body": "LTC is a dead fork, it failed to make a new ATH in the last bull run, and chances are, it will continue to perform very poor for the rest of it's remaining lifespan, besides, difficulty of those small-cap coins can double in 1 week where in BTC you can be almost certain that difficulty won't double in a year, I would say mine only BTC.But paying the money now and having to wait till next year is stupid IMO, just get yourself some S19 pro which are not very different from the XP version and you can get them at spot.",

I currently have 22 S9J's and a whatsminer M20S so my plugs are 12 with 20amps circuit breakers. L7's seems more profitable but you never know what's going on with scrypt algo so i assume i'll stick with 140XP's.",
