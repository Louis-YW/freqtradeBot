      "body": "What I always miss with most proxy providers is:- The option to get fewer IPs. I donâ€™t need 500 mixed IPs, more like 50 (max).- Trials, I canâ€™t pay $50/month without knowing if the IPs on the pool will work for what I have in mind.In my case I would like to start with ~5 proxies and scale as needed and only if they work. Anything like that possible?Edit: Just for some context, I do some scraping of flight tickets with some airways (i.e Tap Portugal and Latam), they donâ€™t like many consecutive requests, so it all starts to fail after some time. Iâ€™ve tried proxy providers that just are blocked from the first request. Not good.",
