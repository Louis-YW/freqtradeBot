Hal is a smarter genius who would have planned all these ahead before time, have you even come about related topics on what happens to the bitcoin if the bearer dies? you can get more recommendations from the discussions from this thread What Happens to Our Bitcoin and Other Assets If We Die? this should be a lesson for you also to adequately plan the future well because no one knows tomorrow, make your stance known today and give it a time to think about what may comes in after tomorrow.",

I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.You can read his post here: Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)",

I mean there is no need to be worried about hacking or something because nobody could hack a stopped account, a wallet is not an easy thing to hack into. All the \"hacking\" so far in crypto required participation from the hacked person, when that person is dead there is no way.If anyone could ever did that, they would have hacked accounts that are idle since satoshi time, or satoshis wallet itself. Which means it was someone from the inside that did it. I believe that wife is a good response, kids if he had any would work, friends who helped the family could be another response, these are all valid.",

I read a book about the first bitcoin transition just now.Just curious. No offense. Thank you. I'll read this topic.Bitcoin is a personal asset and one needs to allow some close family members access to the Bitcoin in case of any incidents they can access the wallet and use the Bitcoin in them, what I do that my wife has the private keys to my wallet and she can access it at any time am no longer in control a lot available for whatever reason. So the dude may have done the same thing in this situation if there is coin movement in the wallet then you should be sure someone close to the deceased has the password or keys to the wallet.",
