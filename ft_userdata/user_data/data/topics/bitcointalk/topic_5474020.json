  "content": "In bitcoin investment and cryptocurrency generally, One thing I have been hearing since I came on board is Bear season and bull season. Sometimes I get confused about how these things works. I went into research to know exactly what the bear and the bull season was. Initially I was thinking it was a special time each year where the bull and the bear will be put in a cage to fight each other. But after my research I understand their meaning and what they represent. But one question has been left unanswered, maybe I am missing something here. The question is how exactly does bitcoin obey the bear and the bull seasons. Because I have come to realize that after some certain number of years bear season will take over and same goes to bull season. Does it mean the same people that has been investing in bitcoin in the bull season take a break from the bitcoin investments and this makes the prices goes down for the bear to return or is there something that is build in the bitcoin blockchain that makes it obey these two seasons naturally?",

So I believe that the bull season and the bear season is being controlled by people's sentiment.",

People may be having positivity or negativity on the market depending on the factors influencing the market. Its the investors reaction to the market that determine if bitcoin will be bullish or bearish currently there is positivity in the market and we see it as a bullish season.Quote from: Justbillywitt on November 14, 2023, 08:16:29 AM Does it mean the same people that has been investing in bitcoin in the bull season take a break from the bitcoin investments and this makes the prices goes down for the bear to returnIt's not like they take a break from bitcoin investment, it more like the factors influencing the market is giving the investors negative sentiment and so they will sell more than buy and that will be the bearish market season. Quote from: Justbillywitt on November 14, 2023, 08:16:29 AMor is there something that is build in the bitcoin blockchain that makes it obey these two seasons naturally?No not at all the bearish and bullish season is just from the market sentiments from investors",

Some will sell some of their coins while will some sell all in a way if most people sell, the price of the coins will start decreasing and later decreased significantly.

Both bull and bear seasons apply to Bitcoin and simply mean the market condition for a particular period of time. When we say a bull season, it means for that period of time, the bulls (buyers) dominate the market and the price will continue to go higher. On the other hand, bear season means that sellers dominate the market and price continues to go lower as time passes. If at any point within any of the period, market reverses and continue to move significantly in the opposite direction to the prevailing direction,  then we have a reversal or transition from bull market to bear market and vice versa. The key point to note is that it is the state of Bitcoin that determines what season we are in. The season does not exist independent of Bitcoin but Bitcoin price movement will make us call a particular period bull or bear season. There is also a period of consolidation in which the market moves within a range. Such range market is where the market build the momentum to start a bull or bear season. We experienced this ranging market few months ago when price lingered between $25k and $29k. In conclusion, Bitcoin does not have to obey these market season because they are not like the conventional season where we have to change our dressing code in obedience to the demands of the season... It is the price moment of Bitcoin that we call the season. I hope this make some sense to you",

The question is how exactly does bitcoin obey the bear and the bull seasons.Quite funny and you make me laugh small. The bear season na when the market dey red, e no dey favourable to sell, so people dey use this particular period to buy Bitcoin and hold while bull season na when the market don turn green and na better time to sell your bitcoin. Every 210,000 blocks or four years, the miners reward dey become half and na wetin dem dey call Bitcoin halving. So after the halving the bull season go start and go last for a period of time before the bear season go take over again. The next Bitcoin halving na April next year and from there market go begin to dey turn green small small.Bitcoin halving dates & history",

      "body": "@Charles-Tim, I respect your explanation, and I also have a question to ask. It's said that a market pump comes right after a great dump in the market—that's to say, after a drastic drop in the bitcoin price. Let's assum the price dropped from the $36,000 that it is right now to below $30k and down to $26,000, which we can both agree is a great fall in the market and can be classified as a dump. Now, after a few weeks and months, the market starts regaining its value back, and there is a quick market spark, and the price goes back above the $36,000 that it was before the fall. I guess this could be considered market pumping. If the above is correct, this now brings me to my question: if such a market pump continues for a very long period of time, could it also be considered a bull season? Or do we only experience the bull season during or after bitcoin halving, which happens every 4 years? Is the word bull run only expected to be used and active at a particular time of the year? And can't we have a bull run each year if the opportunity for such positive change in the market presents itself?",

      "body": "@OrpichukwuYes, it can be considered as a bull season. But like this year that bitcoin was $16000 at the beginning of January and at $36500 as of today, this year has been a bull season with just little bear time just as it was predicted. Unlike last year, 2022 when bitcoin fell from $50000 to $15500. But just that people talk more about halving and bull run because the time for price increase will be more and the extent of the increase is greater during many months after halving than any other time.",

      "body": "Great question, OP.The reason why you would often hear people talk about bull and bear season is obvious because there is a season for everyone. Like the saying from the Bible — \"A season for every activity under the heavens\" . In crypto, we've had different seasons and it's largely categorized into bull and bear season.- Bull season: Everything goes up, often called the UpONLY season. This is because at that time everybody is a permabull and the price just goes parabolic. There's no way to know the exact time it starts or end but over the years, it has often started a couple of months after a bitcoin halving since less mining rewards come into the circulation after each halving event.- Bear season: Some people have taken profits and the price spiral down. When this start happening, other traders and investors might join the parade to dump their crypto leading to a full blown bear market. Things don't just go up forever; even in crypto.",

      "body": "OP, just like others have said already, Bitcoin halving takes place after every four years of the previous halving. What happens in the halving period of Bitcoin is that the rewards of miners get divided into two, and it is usually before or after the halving period that the bull market kicks in and can last for an interval of months before the bear market starts. The bull market is mostly a period when investors keep selling their coins, and even some whales (those that have a large quantity of Bitcoin) sell off their lareg holdings, which can contribute to the fall of the market.",

The bull market starts mainly after the halving so you can say it was pre programmed into the Bitcoin blockchain already. The next cycle starts again from 2026 as the market begin to crash again due to people taking profits that they have made from the previous bull cycle. It's the having that stands as a symbol of the bull market but if you want make better profits, you no suppose wait until the halving dun happen before you buy. You supposed buy when the market dey in its bear season. Also know say the market no dey always move in this exact way (to get the same track record monthwise) as sometimes some economically or world problems fit delay some of the normal routine but e go always maintain that 4years cycle as na wetin dey programmed into the blockchain already. The halving go always attract people to make investments in Bitcoin and that one dey push the price up and as people see the price dey increase dem go fomo and the price go continues dey increase, bringing about a bull market.",

      "body": "My own take on the reason why Bitcoin obeys the bear and bull season is on the fact that in every 4 years interval there is always a Bitcoin halving that happens so before the halving takes place most Bitcoin owners sees it as the right time to sell of their Bitcoin, as due to the influence of the halving, Bitcoin tends to reach a maximum price than it has ever been. Why these investors keep selling, with the heavy supply to sell off Bitcoin and a lesser demand to accumulate Bitcoin will lead to a drastic fall in the price of Bitcoin.During the period where the investors keep selling, they take their  profits and use their capital to buy during the DIP and Hold for a long term against the upcoming halving by then the price will retain its value and even reach an All Time High. This process keep rotating, that is the reason the market experience the bear and bull run.",

After so many investment into bitcoin, this is at the time of bull season that many investors buy bitcoin in order to prepare for its massive bull run which some people say is triggered by the halving that has taken place. In order to balance between profit and loss for miners, this is usually initiated. I don’t totally believe in this since the network can’t be controlled by just a group of people (miners). Then why bear season comes to play is that those investors now start to take their profits out, which will trigger the market for less demand which will then lead to drop in price from time to time as they sell their assets out.",
