  "content": "For those that don't know. Silicon Bank was 1 of 6 banks which held 25% of Circle's USDC reserves. 75% were held in short term treasuries but 25% in actual banks. The problem is Circle doesn't want to state how much they have in SVB and there is panic ongoing.Currently looking at their redemptions looks like 9-10 figures worth is getting redeemed for fiat.https://etherscan.io/tokentxns?a=0x55fe002aeff02f77364de339a1292923a15844b8Looking at various exchanges, you can now buy USDC for 0.96 on Gemini and other exchanges, it wicked 0.95 a few times. Going to get worse and worse as the weekend goes on and the SVB situation is not resolved. Even some Defi platforms have people dumping USDC / DAI for USDT. Not looking good.",

      "body": "Quote from: yat97 on March 11, 2023, 05:28:25 PM~It is because USDC is one of the DAI reserves. The reason why algorithmic stablecoin works is because another token or coin backs its value. Since USDC got a hit, it is expected DAI will go down.As of now, MakerDAO who governs USDC make new proposal to limit USDC exposures within its reserves and make a new changes to their protocol to limit other reserve that might get a hit if the current Silicon Valey Bank and Silvergate contagion spiraling out of control. You can take a look at the proposal here: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/emergency-proposal-risk-and-governance-parameter-changes-11-march-2023/20125.",

And now we see that even if you have a centralized backed stablecoin you are still then just relying on the banking system to not falter.",

There are also rumors of many liberal celebrities like Harry and Meghan along with Oprah losing millions of dollars as a result of Silicon Bank’s collapse. I don’t know how true that is but it’s interesting that they would have their money in such an under collateralized bank.",

I look at the whole stablecoins in the market I can't seem to trust anyone of them, it is sad there is no stablecoin that is actually backed 1:1 to USD with a solid reserve for sustainability.  All seem to have their baggage which is not known to the public.",

Plus the \"news\" of it made it a bigger thing than what it actually was, I knew that it would recover at least a bit, and it is obvious that the peg wasn't broken but even if it was, not at a %10 rate without a doubt. I think people are a bit reactionary when it comes to their money and can't act in a pragmatic way, which causes them to lose it. If you could be a bit more robotic, then you would be able to see the picture a bit more clearer.",

I will try to dig it up and find it, later. I don't think they will be bailed out. The FDIC will do its best and perhaps when the assets are liquidated people might get 80-90% of their funds back. The issue is if a larger bank such as Schwab gets close to defaulted and then the fed will have no reason but to bail them out AND cut interest rates at the same time since the markets obviously cannot handle it.Even SVB was large, it wasn't large enough on the fed radar to make it signiicant. Most likely by Monday we might get news that its taken over by one of the larger banks.",

The US Fed chairman will appear to apologize for raising rates, cut them to 0 and restart QE so we can all become greedy again  but hard to trust these guys. but if you want to bet on this, you can buy a lot of USDC so you can see your profit in case it goes up again. otherwise, just observe how this situation will pan out in the coming days. this scenario is a very good example that even top platforms can go down without a warning. not all stable coin can maintain the price where they are pegged at. even backed by top and reputable companies. they are not immune to some type of catastrophe.",

So far, it seems to be moving towards the road of recovery, as it has climbed to $0.96 compared to $0.90 in the morning. It's concerning that such a stablecoin is yet to return to its $1 peg, but eventually it will, and the incident will be long forgotten. We'll see how things go in the next 24 hours before we can make any further assumptions.",
