Because to do that that word should be agreed upon by all universe. (It should be in universal set if unit hehe) just kidding. I think CEXs p2p and DEXs p2p is enough for now to differentiate between them.Otherwise we and newbies all know that there p2p is not only p2p there is third person involved too to manage the funds. So they must not be confused instead they must be aware of such thing.",

If any part of the network has more privilege than others (eg. the server that everyone relies on) that stops being P2P.Otherwise if we start bending the definition we start calling a lot of other things P2P that aren't P2P for example CEX like Coinbase since you are technically trading with other people not with the company!!!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer",

As well as how to differentiate between real moderators and impersonators, how to file a dispute with solid evidence for your trade. Many things but initially, don't let the high margin of profit attracts you because such too good to to be true offer should come from scammers.Trade Peer-to-Peer via marketplaces, trading platforms will help you avoid risk with Escrow from a single person you know in life. He can scam you and your trade partner too so don't trust any middle man as an Escrow.",

Just because you don't like it make it less P2P, it's your opinion. But it's still a P2P transaction since the exchange has no say over your transaction. They however has control over your coin in case of deviancy and that's a measure to minimize scam during P2P transaction. That intermediary is very necessary to ensure smooth and secure transaction and does not completely make the transaction less of P2P. You can decide to call it another thing but you should know that it will hardly impact what's already established and people already use and familiar with.

Having your coins on centralized exchanges is the opposite of what bitcoin is. The centralized exchanges have more control and they are the middle man because you have your coins with them and they have the complete control to your coins. That is not P2P.

Binance did only was set up the place or a hub for people to conduct transactions on which people are relax to know that they are dealing with some legit people. P2p is also good not using cex if you trusted someone your dealing with but isnt it take time to deal with someone first without knowing him but with the Binance set up which require users to be liable when they scam is something good isnt it?Anyway Id did both and theres really an advantage of cex p2p to dex p2p for me since the money can be encash easily on your remittance app if you dont like bank transactions.",

I know what I went through to get used to some popular words here in this forum before I became familiar with them, and I can now easily flow with them when I come across them being used to make a comment, which shows that I have been learning and adopting. P2P is an already-known word, and it's been used for years now to represent transactions that concern two parties exchanging goods or products, irrespective of which platform is being used.To someone who knows the true purpose and meaning of decentralization, You know what your own definition of P2P should be; using the name for both exchanges, P2P, does not change your beliefs. We can give those P2P exchanges a personal name that best describes how we view them, but making it a thing of being generally accepted or suddenly replaced over night is what I don't see happening.",
