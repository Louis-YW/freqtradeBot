  "content": "Hello allI have an old Ethereum classic wallet 42 character public ID. I have most of the public address except a few missing letters from the public ID in the middle (2-3). Is there an Ethereum classic database I can check and run a query on to find the full address? I remember having about 150 ETC on it from many years ago but wish to confirm this is the case but cant as I dont have the full address and dont want to spend a fortune repairing the machine the private key was saved on.Best regardsDave",
