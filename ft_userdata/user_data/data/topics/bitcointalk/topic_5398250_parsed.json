But I accept the fact that soon Elon Musk would make a comment on this global crypto price drop. It wont have much effect, but, it will give hope for those who are new or came to crypto by Elon Musk's referral tweets As to Bitcoin, it will be saved by itself. Like it usually does. How many times people buried Bitcoin ? This price drop will just +1 to current bury counter.",

This is just one of those phases and my only regret is not having loads of money to Buy Bitcoin now    cos we can only go up afterward.",

The crypto market is potentially a bubble, sure, but I don't think that Bitcoin isn't worth anything or that it's overvalued. I believe what we're seeing now is not the explosion of the bubble, but a temporary bear market. After Bitcoin recovered from the 2018 fall, I think it proved that recovery is a matter of time. And now the price is low, sure, but it's still way higher than the 2017 ATH point.",

Maybe if he has something behind his sleeves, then maybe he could somehow influence again the market, basically the people. He is always on the news with all the plans that he has so it's not surprising if he would be able to plan something and make something happen.Quote from: virtualdn on May 12, 2022, 06:20:12 AMAs for Doge, it turned to a s*itcoin anyway thanks to Mr. Musk.Doge has always been a shitcoin because it was made to be one. To be accurate, a meme coin. Isn't Elon the reason why Doge raised in value? So how can you say that?",

A lot has already happened to the world that affected bitcoin big time both positively and negatively. And despite these, bitcoin never died. Instead, it came out stronger as time pass by. Which is why I don't worry that much, I never bought on peaks anyway so I'm just gon go and wait this storm out as I slowly accumulate whenever I have extra funds just like what I always do.",

But in cryptocurrency has a big effect by him, and that is to destabilize the market.
