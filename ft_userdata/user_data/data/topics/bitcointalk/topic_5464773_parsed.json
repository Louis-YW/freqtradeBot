The article did mention MFA but why bother adding SMS/phone number? and who knows what is included in their MFA.Quote from: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kroll-data-breach-exposes-info-of-ftx-blockfi-genesis-creditors/Kroll, who is facilitating claims for insolvent companies FTX, BlockFi, and Genesis Global Holdco, has confirmed that one of its employees was the victim of a SIM-swapping attack.Hackers stole the Kroll employee's phone number and used it to gain access to some files with personal data of bankruptcy claimants.Of course, the employee in question was a T-mobile user. If you're a T-mobile user, I suggest looking into all the sim swap accidents they've been in lolQuote from: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kroll-data-breach-exposes-info-of-ftx-blockfi-genesis-creditors/In a statement today, Kroll says that a threat actor on August 19 targeted a T-Mobile account belonging to a Kroll employee and managed to steal the phone number of a Kroll employee.Genesis affected users has had the following leaked: full names, physical addresses, email addresses, and debtor claim details. FTX claims no-sensitive data has been compromised but I'm not sure I trust it.In any case, if you submitted a claim on kroll, be extra careful with phishing scams cause it's safe to assume perps are gonna attempt it a lot.",

Just hope it's not from the Kroll hacker this time.The ftx claims portal on Kroll is still under maintenance.",

All I hear from people is that: Let them have images of my document, what can they do? And how are you gonna fight against KYC when majority of people don't really care about their privacy and are willing to send their documents to anyone without hesitation? There are even scam call centers that ask people for their debit card numbers and people tell it to them.",

I suspected a planned sabotage on the claims of FTX and others is underway. Or they will use this self-inflicted breach in the future as an excuse over something they don't want to be held accountable. I wonder how Kroll, a risk solution company that has been operating for many decades, is this lax and complacent in terms of data security. How could they even passed the standard or audit, if there is, of this kind of business with this level of security? And they're catering large financial institutions. The reports just mentioned in passing that the \"attackers bypassed MFA.\" Don't they feel the extreme necessity to provide details how it all happened just like that?",

Why would any company keep online KYC data, despite all the security protocols?I would draw a parallel with the popular excuse for exchanges, where they went bankrupt as a result of the hack, and the truth is that they just wanted to leave with the money and declare bankruptcy.

This either indicates a lack of care, or that they wanted to leak that data (or lost it for some reason) and now they are blaming one of the employees.In any case, a lawsuit can easily be filed against them accusing them of negligence in saving user data, but it is better to try to reduce the data you give to any third party, especially if the servers are outside your country.I began to feel that hacking large institutions is becoming easier day after day, or that they do not care about that.",

Many of the big exchanges sell data too. Coinbase for example admitted they were selling sensitive user information to third parties without the users' knowledge or consent. Did it affect them in the slightest? Binance were hacked for thousands of users' worth of KYC data. Did it affect them in the slightest?
