It is also safe if you protect it from possible danger or hack. Cause even some might get compromise if not secured properly or been affected by virus.",

This person despises bitcoin because they are either uninformed or do not see Bitcoin's actual use case, which is the transfer of money without borders and with less intermediary concerns. I don't care about whatever issues or nonsense they have with bitcoin as long as I can do anything I want with my money without worrying about an entity freezing or cutting what I've earned and I can make transactions with people who I have no idea where they are in the world. Remind them that bitcoin is multifaceted asset that relates to different knowledge areas and not just some tool to grow their wealth in an instant.",

In my opinion, it totally depends from person to person and their way to use technology.In the end, Bitcoin is just a blockchain-based currency that provides the freedom of being your own bank rather than using the government money so-called dollar.I am sure as Simpson predicted, the dollar will not exist in the coming years... maybe paper money will for sure be gone in 10 years from now. I can be wrong too lol.People from African countries are using Bitcoin to save their money from inflation and people from America are using it as gold, as I mentioned earlier, depending on person to person and their current financial situation.If you have millions, you will see degen longing/shorting bitcoin worth millions and getting rekt so that also makes it a gambling currency.Â  The only issue with it is that it take ages to get a confirmation on your deposit or withdrawal, without taproot it will not be able to grow and currency like Ethereum with lower gas fee will be future just like how electric vehicles are replacing petrol cars.",

If we knew with certainty that Bitcoin would outperform any other financial asset it would make sense to invest 100% of our net worth in Bitcoin, and there are people on the forum who do, if not 100% then an approximate percentage.Being a little more cautious we can apply a principle of diversification and apart from investing in Bitcoin, have a house paid for or on the way to paying for it, having equity on it, and then you can invest a little in other sectors to taste, such as commodities, individual stocks or index funds such as the S&P 500.",

They're all down in terms of bitcoin.Well, it's the thought that counts but honestly I guess that the majority will agree to that because bitcoin is considered as the best performing asset within just a short range and period of time. But you'll never know if some tech stocks will skyrocket and more than the gain that bitcoin will and does.Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 14, 2023, 03:58:40 AM[..] I thought bitcoin wallet is best for storing long term investment, since no physical companies are to be trusted 100%, people uses bitcoin wallet to established good investment plans but seeing lead to ask questions of why and how true, which means no where is safe for life investment.Bitcoin wallet is for bitcoin and bitcoin is what we're considering as the best long term investment. And if the worry is all about the safety of the bitcoin that you're keeping, there are a lot of ways to protect yourself from such worries because all you need is to be educated and aware of the possible threats that may come to you.",

I don't know it is bad enough for those stocks but let's see their drops as abnormal and see how normal it is with Bitcoin in its past bear market. At today price ~ 30,000, Bitcoin is about a half of its all time high that is not worse than those big tech companies' stocks.Bitcoin historical corrections from all time highsQuoteMoving on to next question whether we can trust the bitcoin wallets for storing of bitcoin for years, of course you can since you are in complete control of your wallet unlike stocks which is in account of centralized platforms you only access via that third party.Don't store it on online accounts, on exchanges.
