  "content": "Because of the economic hardship and because many markets are either in red or very risky, there has been a lot of money going into the bonds crap governments keep selling (to borrow money out of the investors' pockets) or is just \"adrift\" and is waiting to be invested in something. The recent market manipulation with a fake news about SEC approving the BlackRock ETF showed the massive potential that exists in the bitcoin market to simply shoot to the moon and in a very short time too. In other words a lot of that money is waiting on bitcoin to make the first move to panic buy it \"violently\". What happened today is also one of the reasons I insist that currently bitcoin is undervalued (under its intrinsic value).",

I think it’s likely that will be the story for the next year. I look forward to waking up to big price jumps again.",

      "body": "I just wanted to add that the ETF is practically certain, and a normal investor has just seen what it will do with the price in the short term (+10% pump in 5 minutes). For an average investor isn't this a green light to buy? Isn't it logical to pack now? In my opinion, even though the news was fake, it showed that there is a lot to earn from it once it appears.And for the currently open trade, the price would have to fall like a rock, breaking through many supports, for this trade to fail because of +10% after the true news instant pump. Just don't lose more than 10% before the real news and you are on profit (not to mention further increases, just initial pump)",

The price plummeted as soon as it was revealed that the report was fake.  This is only a sample of how the price action will look in the next days, months, or next year once it is approved. I was offline, I missed seeing the pump, and I am expecting a rise shortly after this episode which just lasted for less than an hour today.",

This is all about fake Bitcoin ETF approval that we're talking and how much it will be if we see the actual news of SEC's approval for the actual thing and application.This is giving the idea for everyone that the potential is endless for Bitcoin. It's just like dumb money that's flowing right now and waiting for these news to come before they enter.Quote from: Doan9269 on October 16, 2023, 05:30:06 PMWill the spot ETF approval be the means to experience a surge in the market price for this time or we should rely only on Halving or bothI think it's safe to say that we should only rely on halving. But for the past halvings, we've seen that there's some push coming from other factors. Like in 2017 there goes the ICOs.In 2021, there goes the NFTs.In 2025, Bitcoin ETFs.... We shall see but it won't hurt to expect some help and reliance on both.",

The same thing would happen if the price did not reach $100,000 by the end of next year, or at least after 12 months after halving, all these psychological variables make people keep cash and wait until a certain event occurs, and then everyone pays the money. The reason for this is that you can get guaranteed profits from providing loans, so unless the rise in Bitcoin is rapid, they will not think about investing.Back to the technical analysis, the price is at the 200-Day SMA, which is $28,019, and we are still in the 26k-32k range, so nothing has changed.",

This recent pump is just as example of how much capital are available to be pushed into the Bitcoin network with the right amount of trigger.It felt good seeing a spike after a very long time of boring sideways movement and it's almost only a matter of time now before one ETF gets approved.",

I also think that the fair price right now should be at least 30000 but it stays below that because of the pressure from politicians. Doesn't matter in the long run though.

But what I do care about is the massive amount of money that is waiting on the sidelines, we got a small peek through the curtain and saw what it can do to the price even in a short period like yesterday.In other words we are only a \"spark\" away from reaching ATH. What's that spark? I can not tell. It can be ETF approval, it can be halving, it can be US decreasing interest rate, etc.",

But if this is the last low and those people don't buy Bitcoin immediately, they may regret not buying Bitcoin at this price range.That little spark will affect the Bitcoin price but I think it's about the ETF approval that will start to provide that spark. As for halving, it will still be a few months from now. And it also may not be able to directly influence the price of Bitcoin to immediately shoot up. Meanwhile, regarding the reduction in US interest rates, this is still a tug-of-war so it may not happen shortly.But whatever it is, I feel that the current price of Bitcoin is still being held down by \"them,\" but I don't know who they are. But no matter what, I'm still enjoying this Bitcoin journey while taking profits little by little and still waiting for the next ATH.But I could be wrong about this so I am sorry.",

I mean it's not like it can't happen, right? We've heard of a recent happenstance of FTX manipulating price to stay below $20k by authorizing Alameda to continue selling at that amount?
