Well I came across a pretty interesting scenario and I'm wondering what's going to happen if that were to be the case. Since Bitcoin is by definition, deflationary, because it has a limited supply, it will supposedly have more purchasing power over time (assuming good adoption and acceptance of bitcoin). Bitcoin is limited to 21mil forever. I quote from the course, QuoteMany economists argue that a deflationary economy is a disaster that should be avoided at all costs. That is because in a period of rapid deflation, people tend to hoard money instead of spending it, hoping that prices will fall. Such a phenomenon unfolded during Japan's \"Lost Decade,\" when a complete collapse of demand pushed the currency into a deflationary spiral.Deflation in bitcoin is not caused by a collapse in demand, but by a predictably constrained supply. Now what would happen if people did start suddenly hoarding? I mean HODL is just a huge meme at this point but what if EVERYONE actually did that? What would things look like then?",

Only that this time it gets worse because with the rising cost of prices, people just feel it would be safer to save more after sorting bills and spend less till the tides change. Hence why many HODL.Am sure it wouldn't get to the hoarding stage where people start looking for who to buy or trade crypto with because as long as basic bills need to be paid and with the more reliance of emerging entrepreneurs on Bitcoin, people will always find a way to make profit from the situation. I.e. if more persons hoard, those willing to sell will increase their price. When nothing is left to sell after a certain limit, those who hoarded will finally opt to sell with good prices at their own time. As hot as crypto currency is today I doubt it will feel a deflationary scenario as much as those who buy or sell petroleum products.",

Such a phenomenon unfolded during Japan's \"Lost Decade,\" when a complete collapse of demand pushed the currency into a deflationary spiral.Deflation in bitcoin is not caused by a collapse in demand, but by a predictably constrained supply. Now what would happen if people did start suddenly hoarding? I mean HODL is just a huge meme at this point but what if EVERYONE actually did that? What would things look like then?Generally a reduction in supply of something of value that is in high demand will drive the price up. Same would happen to Bitcoin when the demand is high while people are holding. They will likely sell/buy higher But when we talk about Bitcoin being deflationary we are mostly talking about the \"periodic\" reduction in the number of bitcoins that are produced at the code level,which also means the reduction in supply of bitcoins.The Japanese example was probably caused by low demand for goods (and services) which were probably high in supply (higher than is needed by the population) or the people decided to spend less money to save more, or were unable to buy what they needed. In that case the supply of goods will be higher than demand and the prices of the goods would fall against the national currency which is in high demand, demand higher than its supply.  You don't call that a disaster if prices of things are getting cheaper because people aren't buying things they don't need. Or maybe they decide to start producing those things themselves thereby increasing their supply which consequently makes their prices to decrease. The surplus could be exported (assuming they are of good quality) which can further increase the value of the national currency.A deflationary Bitcoin due to people producing more than they consume, based on hardwork(with its accompanying proof-of work) is more suitable for Bitcoin, and it's what Bitcoin is built for (Hardwork/PoW). I have seen fools trying that on Cryptos without hardwork/work or without producing much and they will completely fall apart.",

What would things look like then?There is no point to HODL bitcoin forever because there are alternatives and these alternatives are good too. Hoarding will only make sense if there is a demand on one product that everyone wants and chases but somehow there are no alternatives on the market. Since Bitcoin has alternatives, with diverse nature that will fulfill demand from people, hoarding will only kill it.Imagine, people buy and HODL Coca-Cola. What do you think, will it increase Coca-Cola's price? Or stock prices? People will actively seek for alternatives and there are tons of alternatives, including Pepsi, Dr Pepper and so on. People will start consuming of these products and easily forget Coca-Cola. Then, over time, these becomes habit and long-term, Coca-Cola is in a big lose.Absolutely the same applies to Bitcoin HODLing.",

There will for sure high call for its demand if the majority are hoarding it. But let's deal with the reality that not everyone is going to hold it forever.We'll eventually go to sell and even of how die-hard we are for bitcoin, it's inevitable that we'll all have our own pace of selling it for our own needs and goals for which we may be required of selling some or all that we have.",

Some persons are just holding for the temporary reason so that when the market goes up, they will swap there coin to stable that does not have volatility so the price will not decrease in price when the market eventually falls.Selling of your holding need  proper planing so that you will have something important to do with the fund.
