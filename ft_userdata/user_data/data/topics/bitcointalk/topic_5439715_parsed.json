      "body": "You need to make some findings about coins before investing at all, go for those that have market capitalization that is huge are the best (but taking note that altcoins are like gambling). Among all, bitcoin is the best, lesser volatility and most decentralized, unlike most altcoins that are not well decentralized or having some kind of central control in one way or the other.But that is not all, you need to have a better strategy like DCA, or DCA and investing like just one third or half of the money you spare to invest on bitcoin, while expecting bear market that you will invest the remaining, or getting to halving period and invest more after you DCA half or one third already. It depends on you, there are different ways you can start investing in bitcoin, get yourself a better investment strategy that you know it would work for you in long term.The greatest mistake beginners can make is by not accepting yet that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are speculative assets while other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are more dangerous. Try and know the years that bull run is likely and the years that bear market is also likely after bitcoin halving, although this may not continue to work at anytime, but I do not think next bitcoin halving would be the time it will not work again.",

Sometimes you don't know what you wanted being a newbie and instead of you to first take time to learn and understand the whole thing about cryptocurrency you hasten yourself to invest on a crutial rush and those altcoins invested on were most fake projects, we ourselves sometimes approach cryptocurrency with the view of a ponzi schemes and this makes people to always find it easy to fall a trap by investing on shady coins or tokens and later after some years they realizes the mistake they had done from the start, must we continue to learn from our mistakes, or we should learn from others' mistakes.",

      "body": "2021 is where the glory of the crypto market is happening a lot of hype like NFT is becoming a trend, IDO continues to peak because of lucrative profits, meme coins are coming a lot so that the price goes up many times more but you are too complacent with greed so you don't think about how to invest in bitcoin even though it's the end it's the same as falling in price from ATH but at least if your assets are in bitcoin it will come back one day but if it is focused on shitcoin then it will be your loss, even I don't believe altcoins or NFT types can recover like all because of their trend is up and people will not think of reinvesting.It was your fault for not doing research on what was invested, but it's clear that many people are trapped in shitcoin but you have to start over if there are some assets that are saved and transferred to bitcoin it will be better than continuing to stay on shitcoin that continues fall.this mistake will be a lesson, but you should be able to start off better not to believe in shitcoin.",

I think I am not for crypto . Everyone thinks that they are savvy investors while things go up. The fact that you admit that is already a big deal. Investing everything in one sector, not to mention investing everything in one asset, is a terrible idea. You should keep a balanced amount of money across various sectors, rather than concentrating it in just one, to reduce the risk of complete financial devastation in case of loss. You can still invest in crypto but only the amount that you handle to lose. Hopefully, your other investments will make up for the losses of your less successful investments.",

I think I am not for crypto .  Sometimes, too much confidence will never do good when investing. That is why it’s important to always invest with caution, otherwise you will be outsmart by the market and eventually see yourself at the losing end. But I believe this is something that is so easy to say but actually hard to be done since a lot of us will fall having the same mentality when we see ourselves already winning from the start. So never be too confident especially when we are dealing with risky investments.",

Investing is not about lifting your own ego and building too much confidence, it’s about being knowledgeable and mindful in everything that you do towards your investment. So if you only invest because you have high confidence that you will always win over the market, you have a wrong mindset. Investing is like gambling, you have to invest only what you can afford to lose. So if you think you only have confidence but never had the required knowledge and skills, then it’s better not to invest but gain knowledge first.",

I think I am not for crypto . Don't be too quick to think that you are not for crypto, because crypto is always open to everyone so everyone is strongly advised not to make a hasty decision when they want to buy something or when they want to invest in something. Maybe on occasion last year you were just a little misguided or down the path you took by liking shitcoins and airdrops whose futures were respectively very worrying. But at some point in the year, you still have the chance to see better Bitcoin and coins than you have ever bought before. So don't give up too soon if you still want success through crypto.",

Your are not only the one person who lost money for that reason . It's not only about the over confidence when one person will go for trading on his emotions they will always face loss, Some exceptions happen that are just for the good luck .  And here are many people who mistakenly think that luck is their skill and the they go for trading and endup with facing loss.  I'm guessing the same thing happened to you. So I would say bring your own mental self-control and get some proper knowledge about trading and well research before in every trading then go for trading. And always keep in mind that trading is always a combination of profit and loss.",

Then the bear market comes and it's better to pull of out crypto than to look for a coin that will perform well in bear market. But many market participants don't see this pattern, they naively expect a bull run only 6 months or a year after the ATH, they hold their bags in bear market waiting for the reversal any day now.",

With NFTs, P2E games, I think you got luck with them when you joined their projects very early. Because I think with Play to Earn tokenomics, the later you join, the more loss you will have and you will less likely get profit if you joined those Earn projects too late.When tokens unlocked by vesting schedules, people own those tokens will cause dumps on the market. I don't think joining NFT projects is good but if you join, watch their token vesting and unlock schedules.https://vestlab.io/Rug pulls are popular with shitcoins that only listed on decentralized exchanges. When their teams done to collect money, they removed all liquidity on DEX and you have lot of tokens with value is mostly zero.I hope you learned it and will only invest in Bitcoin.",

Investing in many ways is not careless, but before you invest in any coin, you should find out more about the coin you are investing in, and thinking that you are too smart and invested in any coins you see without being asked is not a good thing and a very risky idea to yourself, sharing your ideas with people will give you more confidence to invest in any coins that are very important and earn a lot of profits, I advise you to ask before you invest in any cryto coins.",
