  "content": "Hello my fellow countrymen and women, I carry one important discussion come our way today, and na concerning all this japa japa wey dey rein amongst the youths of Nigeria today possibly due to the current situation of the country.Believe it or not, travelling out of the country has become a major breakthrough for most people in Nigeria today, most especially, the youths, who has come to the believe that traveling out of the country is a, or have become a major achievement in life.But imagine that you finally secure everything required for a successful japa aside accommodation and work, and you finally japa to your country of choice believing that when you get there, you surely will find a comfortable place to stay or someone to gum body with, and from there, you sure will find something doing as a work to earn money, which probably is the primary season for traveling out in the first place.But unfortunately for you, on getting there, or maybe after spending some time there, what you initially expected or planed is not what is happening, you discover you can't even afford to rent a good living space due to the high cost of accommodation in the country you traveled to, and unluckily for you, you can't find anyone to share accomodation with, and because of this, you have no choice but to resort in living in the cemetery (burial ground-where they dey bury dead people), streets and other odd place, and all this is also because, you can't even afford money needed for flight, to come back to your country of residence.This is exactly the situation many Nigerians find themselves in Canada as we discuss on this thread, according to Businessday, many Nigerians in Canada are now living in cemetery and the streets due to the current rent crises in Canada which is as a result of low housing supply and affordability issues in the country.Here in Nigeria, even person wey dey make just $1 per day still no fit sleep for cemetery, matters come to worst, the person go go back to him papa house as long as he or she get family.This is only telling us one thing, and that is that \"The grass is greener on the other side, Na when you no water the side wey you dey\"",
