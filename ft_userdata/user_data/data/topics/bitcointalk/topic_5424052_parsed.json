  "content": "QuoteThe data is in a new report on EV use from Argonne National Lab.Electric vehicles have never been more popular. Just about every automaker is in the midst of an electrification effort, spurred on by impending government regulations around the world aimed at reducing our dependency on fossil fuels. But is the movement having an effect? Here in the US, plug-in vehicles are selling better than ever, despite supply chain shortages and frequent hefty dealership markups.According to Argonne National Lab, between 2010 and the end of 2021, the US had bought more than 2.1 million plug-in vehicles, including 1.3 million battery EVs. That sounds like a very impressive number, but bear in mind that's out of a total national vehicle pool of nearly 276 million cars and trucks. Argonne estimates that despite all these plug-ins, national gasoline consumption was reduced by just 0.54 percent in 2021.In total, Argonne calculates that US plug-in vehicles have driven nearly 70 billion miles since 2010, consuming 22 TWh of energy in the process. That's displaced the use of more than 2.5 billion gallons of gasoline and 19 million tons of greenhouse gases, Argonne reports, although for context, the US consumed about 369 million gallons of gasoline a day in 2021. For 2021 specifically, plug-in vehicles saved about 690 million gallons of gasoline—about two days of consumption—and reduced CO2 emissions by 5.4 million metric tons, consuming 6.1 TWh in the process.The biggest growth in plug-in sales occurred in 2021, more than doubling from the previous year from 308,000 vehicles to 634,000. That's probably not too surprising, given how many new EVs reached the market last year. In fact, BEV sales increased 92 percent to 457,000 vehicles, with plug-in hybrid EV sales increasing by 150 percent to 175,000.Argonne assumed that plug-in drivers behave much like their gasoline-powered counterparts but applied a utility factor to PHEVs based on battery size and a mileage adjustment factor based on EPA-estimated range for BEVs, with the baseline being an internal combustion engine vehicle driving 13,500 miles (21,727 km), with a mix of 57 percent highway driving and 43 percent city driving. Proportional reductions in annual mileage due to COVID-19 were applied for 2020 and 2021 as well.Given that plug-in vehicles represent almost 1 percent of all light vehicles on the road in the US, it's disappointing that the reduction in gasoline usage was just more than half a percent.However, Argonne provides evidence against naysayers who think EV adoption will crash the electrical grid—in 2021, charging EVs accounted for only 0.15 percent of all US electricity consumption. Interestingly, Argonne found that while BEV efficiency has decreased marginally since 2018, PHEV electrical range efficiency actually dropped dramatically between 2019 and 2021, which Argonne blames on the increasing size and weight of electrified SUVs.This report is not an argument against people buying EVs, of course; any gas saving is an improvement on turning that gasoline into atmospheric pollution that worsens climate change. But it should be clear now that EVs on their own are not a panacea to our transport-related climate problems, and the future will require many more people to walk, cycle, or take the bus to get to where they're going.https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/american-evs-reduced-gasoline-consumption-by-just-0-54-in-2021/....The following summarizes most of the article:QuoteAccording to Argonne National Lab, between 2010 and the end of 2021, the US had bought more than 2.1 million plug-in vehicles, including 1.3 million battery EVs. That sounds like a very impressive number, but bear in mind that's out of a total national vehicle pool of nearly 276 million cars and trucks.

The following could help to put things into perspective:QuoteTesla Inc.’s most recent quarterly vehicle production volume came to 365,900 units. Tesla's production level in the third quarter of 2022 increased by just over 41.5 percent quarter-on-quarter, and grew by approximately 53.9 percent year-on-year.https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/It seems that at current production levels, tesla would produce around 3.6 million EVs in 10 years. It would take decades for them to replace a significant number of fossil fuel burning vehicles on the road, without a significant increase in production.Given recent targets for replacing fossil fuels in global economies, it would be interesting to see how targets were calculated.",

It was an important step, because world is on fire right now and climate change is causing all kinds of trouble, which means every bit helps and even at %0.54 that is a huge help with 22 TWh, and we should keep that growing as much as possible and that will be great for all of us.",

      "body": "That clearly suggests us that we are not producing the EV's at faster rates and neither there is good adoption of the same. If you checkout the data then we only have around 6-7 million Electric Vehicles registered in the USA. If this data is compared with the conventional cars then it will blow your mind. The conventional cars that were registered by the year 2021 are around 289 million cars. I mean that is sort of ratio which tells us why gasoline consumption is reduced by only 0.54% The article does not take into consideration the actual figures such EV vs Conventional car ratio. Following is the data associated with conventional cars that were registered by the end of different years within America. That is obvious number considering the fact that EV's are brand new in the market and are not trend setter as of yet!SourceHowever, if you checkout the number of Electric Vehicles that were sold in USA then they are literally in thousands and not in millions if checked brand wise.With the current speed of production and also to achieve higher goals like selling more than 10 million EV's then they need to have more than 9 million EV charging ports spread across the country. This goal can be achieved by 2030 which is still far from the sunrise. Though following data is old, then also there is not much hike in the sales of EV's which could be considered as trend setter so as to show us remarkable numbers in reduction of the gasoline consumption. QuoteWith the expected boom of the Electric Vehicles market, various measures need to be set up. For instance, in order to support the 18.7 million EV estimate in 2030, automakers must install about 9.6 million charge ports at workplaces, homes, and public places. This is a major investment in terms of EV charging infrastructure.I dont think we should even expect to see reduction in the Gasoline Consumption with such tiny number of EV's running around the country as compared to the Conventional Cars.",

Because America has observed that gasoline supplies are starting to run low, supplies from countries that own oil are also decreasing due to internal conflicts that have damaged America's harmony with other major gasoline-producing countries such as Iraq, Canada, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. They also need long-term supply to be able to control the movement of petroleum in the future. This innovation makes us even more confident with the alternatives that have been provided for the next few years.This is not a negative for future transportation growth because evidence of such savings can motivate other countries to try new things. In several countries, they are starting to experiment because they also realize that the supplies of petroleum they have are also running low.",

However, let's look 5 to 10 years into the future to have a much more efficient alternative, and we can see the results. Various innovations that have emerged do have a purpose for the environment. It's just that is it worth it when compared to the use of other conventional cars?Quote from: hyudien on November 29, 2022, 08:10:43 PMWhat America is doing is reducing its dependence on gasoline, which portion cannot last for a long time.

This innovation makes us even more confident with the alternatives that have been provided for the next few years.Trying to motivate other countries that have the same perspective as the US on energy consumption within a year and the results are quite promising. As I said above, one year's difference is still not enough to prove whether it is worth extending to all countries with not very high electricity supply. There are still areas that are not covered by the new type of car. In terms of price, it's definitely quite expensive.",

If you have electric car that runs on electric created by burning coal lets say, is that clean? Like my nation doesn't have that many EV.Because, we do not have that much clean energy, like solar or wind, which means if you bought it, then the charging was done with some pollution creating method. Hence, it is not what you use, but how you fill it up that matters. Oil is still bad, gasoline that you use to fill up regular cars is still bad, just because EV is not enough, doesn't mean gas is fine, you still need to find an alternative.",
