  "content": "Bitcoin forks happen when there is some new change to the current protocol and it is used to add new features, and  also used to prevent any other thing that will allow bitcoin to be hacked. In these kinds of situations, consensus needs to be applied before the changes; if not, the blockchain may be permanently split, which may lead to the birth of new blockchains like bitcoin cash and bitcoinSV.Bitcoin cash , It also has bitcoin in its name , but it is not the same as the bitcoin that I am familiar with. Bitcoin cash is another type of cryptocurrency that was created by another group of people who wanted to increase the amount of transactions in each block to 32MB, and  speed up the transaction level to nearly 21 times, and lower the costs.Even though there are some minor differences between Bitcoin cash and original bitcoin, the prices of both tell a different story, and bitcoin cash has a small value when compared to original bitcoin, even though some users may consider using bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin, but it is centralized than the original bitcoin which goes against bitcoin decentralization ideas.Furthermore, the team behind Bitcoin cash has been identified, whereas the original bitcoin remains anonymous.While bitcoin cash struggles to handle 32MB per block, the original bitcoinSV has split the block to 128MB. Which is also another distinction between the two.The developers were far from finished with the process when BitcoinSV received the 'Qasar' protocol upgrade, which increased the block size from 128MB to 2GB.This is all I have to say about bitcoin cash and original bitcoin. I welcome any further discussion on the subject.",

      "body": "How Many Bitcoin Forks Are There? You will be surprised!!!You will be really surprised after reading that topic which helps you to know that there are many Bitcoin forks, not only Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. They are dead coins already or just nearly dead coins like walking-dead coins.Don't invest in forks because they were created to steal your bitcoins.",
