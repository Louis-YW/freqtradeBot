  "content": "This ebay member:is selling this:loaded onto which is this crazy-looking, never-seen-before software wallet:And it's ONLY $30!!  Ladies and gentlemen, I think this genius might just have put Ledger, Trezor, Keystone, and all the way down to Keepkey out of business.  Get 'em while they last.Sarcasm out.  Can you believe this crap?  The dude would only have to sell one of them to make a profit, since that USB drive was likely purchased in a pack of 100 for pennies.  I found his listing a week or so ago, and I'm happy to say that he doesn't seem to have gotten any bites....yet.  The seller is operating out of North Carolina.  Hey, Quickseller:  isn't that your neck of the woods?  I could swear Vod doxxed QS and he was from that state.  Or it could be S. Carolina.  In any case, that's not an accusation, just my rambling thoughts.In the very old days of ebay, you could leave any feedback you wanted for any member for any reason (sort of like the system here).  When I see scams like this, I wish I could just hand out a negative without having to buy someone's item.",

The strange thing is that 6 people have added this item in their watchlist, I'm quite sure that he/she is operating that 6 accounts just to grab the attention of the buyers. I don't really believe that this thing can be even of a little help to poor fellows who purchase it, and yes such devices can also have malware to steal the users Bitcoin. I'm quite sure that someone with basic knowledge of Bitcoin would avoid such wallets at any cost.",

      "body": "It sucks that we can not give a warning directly to scammers like this. But shouldn't eBay allow the buyers to get their money back if they found out that it is just a USB with an Electrum installed? Or do they assume that the buyer is aware since the seller is showing the whole screenshot, so technically he didn't lie? The seller doesn't accept returns too. Either way, hopefully, no one is stupid enough to buy this.",

      "body": "This ebay member has sold almost 50 of these devices exactly?It looks like a regular USB flash drive, on which Electrum wallet is preinstalled, judging by the picture. It also says \"Hardware wallet for Bitcoin\", which in principle is true.  Of course, for us it seems terrible, but purely technically, he sells exactly what is in the product description (I didn't see the profile of this product and the seller and all my reasoning is based on @The Sceptical Chymist 's post). I don't condone his actions and believe that it is not entirely ethical and correct to do so, but it falls short of being called a full-fledged fraud. It's just that the seller takes advantage of the low technical literacy of buyers.There is another point. Will this wallet already generate a ready-made seed-phrase, to which the seller has access or something similar, which allows access to the contents of buyers' wallets. Which can lead to theft. From this moment on, it becomes more curious and the status of the seller begins to fit the criterion of a fraudster.In order not to become a happy owner of such devices, it is necessary to increase your awareness and skills of bitcoin users.",

If this pseudo-bitcoin HW doesn't contain malicious programs, then the seller still abuses the ignorance and gullibility of his customers using the name hardware wallet, because this product has absolutely nothing to do with this class of devices. You understand all this very well (which the buyers of this seller from ebay don't understand) and there can be nothing in common between these devices, except perhaps the presence of a usb port and some general shape of the case. Ebay should have been told to rename \"hardware wallet for bitcoin\" to, for example, a \"flash drive with a pre-installed bitcoin-wallet\". To avoid misleading your customers. Is it even possible to make a report on a ebay of such a plan?",

To avoid misleading your customers. But I don't think they know the difference, that's the problem. The chances of their support agents understanding what a hardware wallet is and what it isn't is surely quite low. You would have to be really lucky to have the right person read your report. Anyways, it should be accompanied by information what a crypto hardware wallet is. And again, I don't see them studying that to learn how to deal with your report.Quote from: m2017 on August 18, 2023, 12:38:56 PMIs it even possible to make a report on a ebay of such a plan? Yeah, sure. You can complain to eBay about sellers and listings. https://www.ebay.com/help/buying/resolving-issues-sellers/reporting-item-issue-seller?id=4022https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/default/report-item-listing?id=4739These links are probably for the US site. I am not sure if each regional site has their own links or not.",
