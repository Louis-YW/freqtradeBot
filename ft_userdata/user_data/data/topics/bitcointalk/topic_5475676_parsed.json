      "body": "So you want somebody to sell your product?The same product which you yourself call risky due to it being in a grey area of the law (or so you claim) and I doubt you have consulted a lawyer about offering your product to customers, going by your relaxed business conduct. And you won't even disclose what your product actually is? Sorry but thats too many red flags. I doubt anyone will take on such a shady offer because they themselves will be made legally liable for selling it. Â Good luck.",
