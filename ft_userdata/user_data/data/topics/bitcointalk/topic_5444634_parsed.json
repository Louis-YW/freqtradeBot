  "content": "Sorry to raise this topic over here, it was too heavy for me to answer all alone so I decided to share here to see some reasonable answer from those that have been in such situations. An hour ago, I went out with a friend of mine and it happens to be a drinking hall (beer parlor) where he got drunk and as well trading.The question is, can you trade while you are already drunk?I was asked this question because I have never been in that mood before being drunk while trading and those who have been in that condition what was your actions and reaction while trading because I noticed something very hard for someone to be drunk and as well trade, do you make profits or keep losing maybe do you close your trade after being drunk.I have reason where this topic should be posted but if any of you think this topic is not at the right place then suggest me the proper place where I can moved it to I will be very grateful.The floor is always open for more discussions.",

It was too hard for me to answer that was why I shared here to see the best answer so that I can get ready for more question. Note that this post is made for me to get proper answer so that whenever I meet with him again I can give him a reasonable answer.",

This made me flash back during those days when I was told in driving school not to get drunk while driving.So can you drive very well while you already got drunk? Your answer here will surely solve your question.",

So choose what type of drunk you're experiencing and if it's the latter part then don't spend and waste your money doing trades if it's too easy for you to throw money on an instant. But you know what's the best drunk and crypto stories that I've heard? It's about the legendary \"I am HODLing\" by gamekyuubi. (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)",

Even your thought is right, maybe your body will cause you to make mistype, bad touch on the screen and there you go with a loss by trading.I never do this because trading is available for you every day so it sounds stupid to try trading after drinking lot of bear or wine.",

Also i do refrain doing this because for sure i cant control my emotions over a trade. It is like dont drive if you are drunk is same with dont trade when you are drunk as it cause you a lot (losses)",

I doubt you can decide when you are drunk or something. You made me remembered college, during my days at high school we were asked to segment ourselves in 5 equal parts and we did, along the line we were given some chances to chose a course (topic) which each groups can confidently present to the entire department. Reaching our group, the person who was chosen as group leader happens to the shy type and what he did, he told most of us that he can't stand speaking to everyone in the classroom that he needs something extraordinary to be able to represent the group; we asked what do you need then, he said of getting him alcohol so that he wouldn't mind anyone anymore before he could be able to present without feeling shy. So before his was called out we got him the drink he requested and he took it and represented very well. Have you experience anything like that was well?",

The question is that, can you still make a good decision while being drunk? I tried one time, but didn't enter a trade because I didn't see any entry points that I feel I'll be safe or gaining profits. I'm not totally drunk at that time, but I'm half drunk so I'm have a feeling where I want to sleep, but at the same time, I want to trade more. Kind of confusing, but that's what I felt at that time. Ending is I didn't trade and just waited for my dizziness to be gone, and then I proceeded in trading.I guess it isn't advisable to trade while drunk though you can still trade, but you might make decisions that will make you regret once you're not drunk anymore.",

I don't know much about trading while drunk, but it seems that some people drink alcohol to make themselves more relaxed in trading.

To trade while drunk will be a bad decision first before the errors follow with analysis from me. Do not trade with emotions, do not also trade while drunk unless you are a strong alcoholic that needs alcohol to function daily, like some unique people that are immune to the harsh effects of alcohol.  A pub is a place to drink and relax, not a place to drink and trade. A good trader knows when to trade and when not to trade, you should not trade everywhere even if you can, there is a time and a place for everything.",

That wasn't only limited to driving of course but we can also apply that on other aspects of our life. When we drink, we will get dizzy and we can not think properly but it helps people to become more confident so if you trade and bet, there is a chance that you will increase the amount that you are placing.We are lucky if the outcome is positive because we can also end up with a huge profit but still, you may not want to stop there and you can still bust all your capital at the end.
