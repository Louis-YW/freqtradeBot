Well, I have seen many blockchains grow faster and solve real problems. But every aspect of life has good and bad actors and the blockchain market also has both. So, those bad actors will always try to copycat some platform like fake exchanges, fake blockchain (which is almost difficult), etc. to lure newbies into scams. So, idk how you are going to solve this thing at an ideological level while it needs a solution at a technical level.",

Its narrative and core are the essence of its successI can't wait to see what ideological level you intend to employ to modify the narrative and of the blockchain network, as well as what you perceive in them as plagiarised with the idea of them not promoting their own ideas. It is fine to see things differently and try to implement your own ideas, but the blockchain network requires something technically inclined for you to change the prevailing narrative you deem unsatisfactory.",
