  "content": "I have been privy to a good bit of HiveOS, a little bit of Foreman.mn, and I have read a little about bixbit/Braiins,etc....My question is pretty simple, though I'm sure it's an iceberg of an answer.Is there an objectively superior firmware to be running on my M30S+'s in an immersion tank?Same question for the OS.I'm leaning towards HiveOS w/ the Hive firmware, but I'm wondering if I will be able to get away with it. It seems we are currently using Foreman.mn OS and firmware to limit the power consumption of the individual units.",

      "body": "I've never heard of any custom firmware for m30s+ but I heard Vnish is working on developing a custom firmware for whatsminer units they haven't released it yet because it is still under development.Other OS you mention above Foreman and Bixbit be careful this is not well-known ASIC firmware/OS here on the forum so there is a risk on using these OS. If you flash your unit with these OS, there is a possibility that the unit may become bricked, or the unit may get stuck with this firmware that can't able to revert back to stock firmware.If you are fine with the risk of using random firmware then check this one below how he flashed this unit for Immersion cooling.- https://youtu.be/PWQBLhRSgeA?si=gbFsIsoF7Fc-zqkM",
