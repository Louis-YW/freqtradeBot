I feel like there is really nothing that can be done here other than wait until came back(which I think is unlikely) or accept the loss and move on(which I am sure hard to do).anyway, you can visit this thread to see if there is an update going on. also, this might be a little insensitive but I saw TrustDice giving \"condolence bonuses\" to gamblers that have fallen victim to Betnomi's exit scam, you can check the thread here",

One cant say anything for sure about the future, but laying down is not an option.  Here is links to the eth and btc deposit:Sorry to hear about your losses but it's probably impossible to get return your deposits because when a gambling site get accused they can't bring their trusting reputation again though they pay them all. And in crypto there were many platforms been shut down and never came again. So I don't see any hope of getting your funds back as they already got several red tags so they aren't going to make all of them solved or transparent again. Either they will publish a new fresh gambling platform.Why you are posting too late? And why you joined a suspicious gambling site when they are already been accused? I am not blaming you actually and I am just asking some questions what you should observe before trusting a Centralized platform. And I saw many gambling sites are here who have a great reputation for several years. We should try them and obviously they must have no accusations or have a great customer support. You should invest as much as you can afford to lose or should cash out your principle asap. Sorry again to hear your story.",

Casinos should generate enough money to stay in business and not come to scamming innocent people who trust them with their money. Beside their exit they sold our informations so it’s annoying to receive spam emails and ruin my personal email. Next time we should consider using an alternative email when registering in any other casino to avoid this cenario again Lol.For me It's even more confusing that they recently organized poker competitions and gave away gifts like Ledgers to users here. What happened perhaps there was disagreement within the team or one of them scammed the others and ran away with the gamblers' money leading to their disappearance. wjatever the reason is it's more clear now that they won't return and users should raise red flags to warn others and bring attention to opening a case against them and catch these sc*mbags",
