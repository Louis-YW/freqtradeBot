  "content": "Hey, Not sure where best to post this really but I am working to open a Bitcoin Hub in the UK which will be based in Bury, Greater Manchester.Our goal is to Educate and onboard users into the Bitcoin space, of course we will be an actual business so will also be taking dirty fiat to pay the bills and suppliers! We’ll have weekly workshops, a lightning bar, a lightning arcade, art space (Yes NFTs!), a custom lightning drinks menu (Including Brave Bull, Minetini, Gold rush etc) and plenty more on the planning! Currently funding will cover us to open 3 days a week, probably 16:30/17:00 to 22:30 Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The workshop and event schedule will be added to our site (and updated here) once we are open. I’ve been screwed many times by the banks and expect to be again but my thought is that we’ll need this eventually so why not now! This is the website: https://satoshisplace.co.uk/This is the twitter: https://twitter.com/satoshisplaceukThe final parts to take place & complete before we can set an opening date: - Interviews, essential is Bar staff but we’d ideally hiring a chef aswell- Funding to buy some final equip, projector/screen & laptops are essential but TVs, custom beers & outdoor signage are ideal- Fibre install (Up to 28 day install time) Ideally we’d like the Fibre setup before opening as this is a USP for hot-desking, for visitors and we think a must for workshops.",
