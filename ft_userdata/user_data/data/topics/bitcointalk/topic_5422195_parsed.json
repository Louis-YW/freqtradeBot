  "content": "I am free from work this weekend, so I decided to make it useful. At first, I never knew what to do today to make my day fun, so I decided to do something I considered meaningful for myself, but I also wanted to hear the opinions of this community, which is why I created this thread.There's a meet-up program carried out in my nephew's school, and as the theme of the program implies, \"Catch them young.\" The program is carried out once every year. The purpose of the program is to identify the in-born talents of students, both children and teenagers, usually aged from 9 to 19.From the idea of that program, I came up with the idea to teach my nephew about Bitcoin this weekend. He is just 11 years old. Last year, in the \"catch them young\" program, he was identified as a kid with the zest and curiosity for research. He was given piles of books to read and feed his curiosity about science and some mechanical activities taking place around his environment.Â He spends his free time reading and watching lots of science videos on YouTube.Â If I had known about Bitcoin in 2010 or 2012, I may have had more than 1 or 2 bitcoins by now, but no regrets; gradually, I will accumulate more bitcoin over time.Â Giving my nephew the privilege of knowing about Bitcoin and blockchain technology is a really interesting thing I find myself doing today. He's still young, and even if he's not going to invest now, having knowledge of blockchain technology and Bitcoin is not as bad as I thought. Often times, children grow up knowing some important things they learned when they were young. If that knowledge was really good for them, they broadened it as they grew.Â I decided to teach him.1. What blockchain technology is and how it works2: define bitcoin and the inventor.3. Decentralization is important to Bitcoin investment.Â 4. The disadvantage of investing wrongly without full knowledgeI just gave him some primary knowledge, just like a class he would expect to have had in school. I will love to take him through the class some more times.Â Guys, I hope I was not wrong to think this knowledge was good for his age. I hope to hear your opinions.Â Dr.Bitcoin_strange ðŸ’Œ",

Knowledge about bitcoin does not take much time; you can explain everything to him when he gets older. But God, I see a blackboard and a teacher, and someone standing with a movie camera. Made me laugh. It is clear why these photos were taken. For an eleven-year-old child, it also takes practice to captivate him. Does the child have pocket money? My son usually spends them on his games, sweets, and other needs that are interesting to him at his age. Knowing from experience, children rarely agree to save for an extended period of time. But your nephew will eventually need to experience everything firsthand. Will he be able to buy himself a certain amount of bitcoins in order to fully feel like a young investor?",

Any younger than that, they would probably have a hard time understanding as they probably don't even have a slight idea on how traditional currencies work.",

The disadvantage of investing wrongly without full knowledgeWith any investment, it's important to understand how things work. For cryptocurrencies, it is very important and even more complex than for other investments, because there are many things that can affect its value.What you are doing is very interesting. Teaching them about the basics of investing can give them a more thorough knowledge of what it takes to get started. It will be interesting to see how Bitcoin changes over time. eventually they will see it applied to everyday life and become a way to pay for everyday items, which will make it important to follow.",

Your nephew will be bored with how you teach and explain what bitcoin is and its technology.Even I myself will get bored seeing a lot of foreign texts that I don't know about.If you changed the method of how to teach 11-year-olds maybe it would be better. There must be a little change so that he is interested and learning about bitcoin and blockchain technology will be captured and digested properly.Maybe it could be with some animated videos and not just text.",

The facination about the new monetrary standard and sound money came later.Â If someone had taught me bitcoin then, but only talked about how it could be the 'new monetrary standard', I would have pretty much zero interest.

Since he already has the habit of watching YouTube videos, it means that he can actually do well if you show him some youtube videos concerning bitcoin where bitcoins and cryptocurrency are explained in the simplest form. But as much, you should also encourage your little nephew to still be engaged and not neglect his childhood activities as those activities assist in mental development as well. You should also engage your nephew in other fun activities and games that he likes, so you don't become the relative that always wants to bore him.",

Iâ€™m not against trying to enlighten folks about bitcoin.man the pastor's story made me laugh for days, honestly I was imagining so many funny things that just made me laugh a lot, for example: \"the pastor receives 1000$ of donation in bitcoin\" and he is very happy and days later the price drops a lot and the 1000$ becomes 800$ and he gets very irritated, with that the guy who made the donation when he gets to the church will look at the pastor and see the pastor with a lot of sadness. well leaving jokes aside the truth is that 11 year olds don't want to know about investments, they want to play with friends so there's no point in forcing them to know about something they won't even use anytime soonyour gesture is very good, but it would be better used if you are teaching people over 18 years old, an 11 year old child doesn't even have a bank account, they can't get much money, so talking about bitcoin to a child I think it wouldn't be a good move, let him go have fun with kids his age, he still has school stuff to study, but talking to him about money can lead him astray, bitcoin and cash, the kind of thing that increases a lot in price , that in a child's head can be a bomb. i hope you analyze this",

Your effort good but in a wrong approach, in the sense that the learner is reluctant.I am always happy each time I see people make efforts to spread the good news of Bitcoin. You have done well OP. I don't think that little boy needs a pen because an 11year old boy might not be able to take notes during lessons. At this stage, children mostly learn through play and demonstration and not through the lecture method as OP did. You are also introducing the child to other complicated areas which I think would be above his cognitive level except if he is a gifted child. The Education head in my country complained during a recent meeting with education stakeholders that parents are forcing their children to become adults prematurely. They want their children to understand and do what adults do by force. This is negatively affecting children psychologically and emotionally.",

Yeah I actually don't buy the idea of children(below 16 years old) been thought how to invest so early. Rather they should be brought into or tutored about cryptography, thatâ€™s if its someone thats good and love numbers. A little grooming will give them life in programming. I feel this will actually lead them to cryptocurrency from cryptography.Because you can't learn cryptocurrency without investing in it and at tender age they don't have the money to invest in it.",
