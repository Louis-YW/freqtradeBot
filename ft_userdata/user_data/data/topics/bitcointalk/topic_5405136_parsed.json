  "content": "Hi, Have just bought £100 worth of Verasity (VRA) which got me 24500 total.I have just gone to withdraw this to stake elsewhere but noticed there is a fee of 1500 VRA. The APY for staking this crypto is 18.25% - is this worth doing or due to the fee am I just better off holding? I plan to hold for 18-24 months. If anyone could advise on the above or on staking in general if it is worth it. Thanks",

That service can be compromised, bankrupted and will no longer be able to pay staking reward to their users, including you. It's a first and biggest risk.Another risk is in theory, you will receive higher total coin by staking, and in the end of your staking but will its total value increase or be the same as initial one or worse, will be lower?Remember, we are in a bear market and price can fall more. Think of such risks before you join staking.",

But it has cons like mostly they mentioned it will be staked with certain period and almost same like time deposit but the value could go lower or worst way lower than its actual value unless you are staking a stablecoin which moves little frequently. Altcoins are very volatile its either you lose more than % yhan what you stake or eirher you gain a lot and will be basing on actual value of what you get.",

Staking in bear market is good for the growth of your portfolio imo. The market has given you the opportunity to buy your favorite tokens at a very cheap price and stake them for certain percentage in returns. imagine those that want to stake sol, dot, near or any other good top alts for so long but the high price hasn't make it easy for them to buy a good amount that will yield enough reward but with this bear market you are able to afford to buy more.  The good part is, you buy your coins cheap, stake them to get more while holding for the next bull season. This is a good decision if you ask me. Always look for reputable staking platform to stake, mycointainer also offers good apy for staking.",

      "body": "Obviously, your strategy is based on which coin at the lowest cost per coin will yield the most interest for the year. This strategy fails most of the time for two reasons. The first reason is that the coin may devalue greatly in the future and at best, the interest on the stake will only cover the losses from the lost value of your purchased coins. The second reason is that APY can become floating at any time and you will not get the claimed 18.25% that the service promised you. From this we can conclude that this steaking is an extremely risky business.",

      "body": "Staking is worth it if you are holding that token for mid to long term but short term, it's not and it would be better if you just trade it than to stake. Staking is worth it depending on different factors.Right now that we are in a bear market, I'm holding some staking coins and currently they are staked in a wallet that I have control with. Instead of selling it and panicking right now, I'd rather store it and let it grow thru staking rewards. They are my mid to long term holdings anyway so I have no problem with it. Staking has risk depending on the coin that you are holding. If you are holding a coin that has low market cap then it's prone to it getting abandoned as it is relatively new. If you will hold a coin that has a high market cap and existing for a longer time then you are safer.This site will help you pick a coin you want to stake with: https://www.stakingrewards.com/",

I do not know how about VRA but you should search for more information to know if that is worth it. It is better if staking VRA is not locked so you can sell it if the price increases, but if the coin is locked, you can not do anything if the term is not yet. And if Binance has VRA staking, you can use Binance to stake as I guess that is worth it.",

No lock up sounds good for me caused by you can take your token anytime. The vesting has become the main problem why staking is not so profitable caused by a chance to lose your capital due to the volatility. The must become your main concerna and it sounds like APY was good enough as well. Majority of people who have been losing their money caused by the lock period that happened with their tokens. I meant if people would not able to cut loss their investment caused by it was getting locked. That must become your main consideration when doing staking",

Can someone please confirm I have worked this out correctly ..35000 VRA staked @ 18.25% = 6387.5 VRA per year (122.5 VRA per week).If i have the above correct then I will get back my Kucoin withdrawal fee in 12 weeks which doesn't sound too bad.Is this worth doing?",

In general i would say that staking is usually always worth it if you are planning to hold for a long time anyway. Why just hold the coin in your wallet doing nothing when you can just stake it and get a nice APY on top. In your case that would be 18,25% which is quite a lot. A pretty high APY like that can always be harmful to the price.You are planning to hodl the coin anyway so i don't see any reason why you should not stake them, if you don't have to do a weird time lock or something on your tokens where you can not really react to the market anymore. You have to check that. There are protocols that only let you withdraw like 1 or 2% per day once you have locked them for staking.",
