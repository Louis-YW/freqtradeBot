On the other side, here in our country, we have storms coming like 2-3 every month, so the world is really changing.We are witnesses and participants of global climate change on our planet. Instead of uniting in front of the growing threat, humanity, as always, only strives to bring the catastrophe closer. First of all, I mean Russia's large-scale military invasion of Ukraine. Now environmentalists are sounding the alarm because of the constant explosions in Ukraine, which threatens the environment and can pollute the soil with heavy metals for a hundred years, and the air with harmful emissions.In addition, the Russians have seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, and are blackmailing the world with a nuclear threat. The United States and Great Britain have already officially warned Russia that if the threat of an accident and the release of radiation becomes real, they will take preventive measures and Russia will cease to exist. In any case, this will not add to the normalization of the climate. The threat of starvation is nothing compared to the madness of the Putin regime, which is also dragging the world into a nuclear aoina. I am surprised at the stupid calmness of the Russian people, who, it turns out, are indifferent to their future. After all, they put Putin's imperial ambitions above their own existence.",

I can't imagine that this is happening for real right now. Yeah, the world is 3/4 of water and yet, we're experiencing droughts.In some countries in Africa, I've read the news that it's around millions of people that are experiencing famine.

Agricultural products are raw materials for most industries. If this raw materials are not available, it will cause alot of issues to the world economy. This include:1. Famine 2. High standard of living: Less produce with high demand will lead to increase in price of goods.3. Unemployment: Since industries couldn't find raw materials to produce, they will definitely lay off some of their staffs. It is high time various Government leaders of each country go back to agriculture. Irrigation can be done to solve this problem. Although cost of irrigation may be high for most farmers in some countries. Government of each country have a key role to play here, these include:👉 Providing loan for citizen who which to invest into agriculture👉And also encourage citizen to invest more on agriculture.",

Strange world.Climate change as defined by the world can't be blamed for the problem. If you want your farm to do well move to somewhere else, possibly within your country but far away from people whose farms are failing... the issue is with the way of life of such people not the farms. Then you can gather people whose farms are doing well to live with you & let them guide you or possibly learn their good culture and never look back at the bad. Once you produce enough food you can give to the needy ones who can't produce enough/atall and make sure they learn your new way of life.  The new way of life has to be based on the Word of GOD which basically teaches Love for the CREATOR of all things and love for humans. If you love the CREATOR, you will not misuse/abuse HIS Creations, you will do things that pleases HIM and things will go well for you. Do you need nothing but theTruth?

Simply shows how world economy is being affected by the changes. If I would be asked for the reason, it is i guess over population. The minerals or raw materials we are harvesting from the nature or even to agricultural sectors are becoming limited and lacking to the number of consumers which yields to vast increase with the prices. What's sad is that, to some countries, inspite of shortage with daily needs, governments are still not giving enough attention to this problem. They are more focused with tourist spots and technology leaving behind the necessities.",

In particular, waterways, drilling, and factory waste are everywhere and now environmentalists, agricultural and so on, have nowhere to voice their opinions.Talking global is easy, but believe me, it is based on the environment in every region of the country that has sufficient agricultural land to grow wheat and corn.",

You can only abuse the world for so long before eventually you start to make in uninhabitable - in reality once these \"runaway train\" situations get going it might be past the point of no return. You'll see the North and South ice caps disappear, sea levels rising further and the most extreme ends of the weather occurring more frequently. If we continue to heat up the planet via all our activities, then it's possible that the atmosphere.. a few hundred years down the line will not support human life without assistance. Another tragedy is that all the plant life, insects and animals will also find it very hard to adapt fast enough to these changes so we will see vast drops in diversity.",

There are most other countries where there is no dry season that can produce abundant harvests. But unfortunately the global crisis occurred in its entirety, this was caused by the high price of fuel.We know the largest oil exporter is Russia, but because of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the Nato intervention, it is difficult to supply oil to other countries. Nonetheless, Russia remains in an advantageous position. Every day they spend 1 billion dollars on war costs, but get 6 billion dollars from the sale of oil. So they get a profit of 5 billion dollars per day. This they do by selling oil below the market price.",

Chopping down forests reduces global water evaporation and rainfall. Another element to it is rising human population. Which results in greater water consumption. These two trends combine to produce a double whammy of reduced rainfall and increased consumption. Which is also known as \"drought\". Reducing carbon emissions won't be enough to reverse the trend. Communal gardens are one option for famine. Government subsidized farming programs are another. The state typically holds many acres of land in trust. Some of which can be converted into farmland. Volunteer farming programs to teach food growing and farming for free could find corporate sponsors to fund them. There are steps which could be taken to address global famine.",
