But then also,Â  most business that uses Bitcoin also should become more aware of the ability of the Bitcoin tightening network,Â  to solve the current Bitcoin network connections,Â  so instead of looking for alternative coins,Â  why not get a lighlightningwork set up and receive transactions through that.",

This has been in my mind for sometimes so I decidedÂ  to ask it today. Have you heard of it because I have not heard of it. Or the congestion is for all the cryptocurrencies?This is simple to think of. Let's use road traffic congestion as it would be a better example. Traffic congestion will happen to any road irrespective of what city or country the road is in. Once any vehicles start using that route, the route gradually becomes slower. However, if the road was bigger (even though it isn't in a big city), it would accommodate more vehicles and the traffic would be either greatly reduced or may not even exist. So, it's not about Bitcoin as any blockchain can face it; it depends on the scalability of the blockchain.",

I remember in matic especially, due to some specific NFTs and shitcoins going on auction on-chain, the nodes would fail from how huge the mempool would become and their admins had to manually restore them. Many people ended up running their own nodes and front-running became a big issue too. Weirdly enough, coins with a higher TPS capability handle congestion even worse than BTC. Having a TPS of 7 or so, st least it's stable. ðŸ«¡",

Since Altcoins are depending on bitcoin on any necessary upward movement, does it mean that altcoins network also congesting to produce high transaction fees? Particular altcoin's congestion does not depend on bitcoin upward moment rather on the usage of altcoin itself and to answer to that, yes if it has more users than it can handle, it'll get congested. If you meant paying high transaction fees due to Bitcoin price increase (that causing altcoin price surge as well) then that's correct. Transaction fee you pay on particular altcoin network is based on altcoin itself rather than USD value, so if altcoin value increases in USD value then you pay more transaction fee, but this has nothing to do with congestion. This might be confusing so here is an example: if you pay 0.0001 ether for making transaction on ethereum network at 2000 USD ethereum price then it'll be 20 cents transaction fee while for the same transaction with ethereum being valued at 4000 USD, you will pay 40 cents transaction fee. QuoteOr the congestion is for all the cryptocurrencies?Cryptocurrencies includes token as well but tokens are based on coins (like Aave on Ethereum, solend on Solana) â€” here chains can get congested on which token is deployed on but token itself can't.",

Currently, you can still do a simple ETH transfer for less than $1. Transferring tokens and interacting with smart contracts can get expensive but it has been worse before. To get the lowest fees possible you will have to move to a second layer or choose a more centralized blockchain with can handle more transactions.",

That's why some networks have managed to solve that problem for having cheaper fees.",

Even if Bitcoin network had no congestion, as long as the network altcoins use had insane traffic, congestion would naturally happen. Yes, Bitcoin pumping can affect altcoin and it can pump it up, which may lead to congestion, but it's not the only and sole factor that can influence it. With or without a Bitcoin pump, an altcoin can get congested naturally, example cases were when NFT started booming. I myself experienced it when I was playing Axie Infinity. Fees were bloody insane back then. Idk about lately since I haven't really participated in anything similar of the sort, but that was one hell of an experience I don't want to go back to.",

Then, there's the Binance Network which was congested when the hype of DeFi games and applications came out, add the NFT using the Binance network for cheaper fees too. It can happen to any blockchain that is created especially if Bitcoin gets heavy traffic which makes users switch to another. I think the best performing of all during that time was XRP which never felt that heavy traffic despite many users switching to it. Then, the fees stayed cheap too and they are not taking advantage of what is happening. That's before the SEC issue.But right now, due to the wide options that we have, I doubt it can happen again unless there's a hype that would make users focus on just one altcoin which will probably create another traffic.",

This is what is happening these projects that solved the congestion and high transaction fee issues are gradually becoming more successful than Ethereum. It will take some time for them to become bigger than Ethereum and it won't stop as there a good projects coming up that are better than those in layer 2.",

So then Vitalik Buterin as Founder thought about changing the consensus on the Ethereum network.The next question is, does congestion cause high transaction fee? Of course, because adopters want to confirm their transactions as soon as possible by paying higher fees which results in transactions with low fees being de-prioritized.",
