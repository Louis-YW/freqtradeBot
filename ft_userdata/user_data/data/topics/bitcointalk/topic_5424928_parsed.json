Cz already warned about the risks involved in exchanges providing high apy products recently, but I guess that tweet is deleted now for some reason. However, I suggest you to keep very low funds on such exchanges (only which you require for trading), better safe than sorry!Yes, they can go bankrupt anytime .(even while you are asleep dreaming about your future fortune).",

I've got no problem even if they show high interest in their APY, it's going to be lower eventually when many takers are there.But the thing you've mentioned about holding your assets there and trusting them, even if you've been trading there for ages, that's not a good reason for you to leave your funds there. Always remember if you don't own any keys, you don't hold the coins there.",

      "body": "KuCoin had been doing well as well as FTX before they collapsed, so always caution with high returns, as it can be a trap to get people to put their assets on the exchange and use the available features.My advice is not to leave your funds there, indeed the exchange will not show clear signs when it will collapse, but as I have said before we will never know what they are doing there, withdraw immediately before it is too late and you lose your assets there.",

      "body": "Why did you hold your assets there in the first place? To make it easier to trade, or do you participate in their savings program or something similar? If it's the former, I suggest moving your funds regularly, it is better to pay for more transaction fees to keep your money safe instead of praying everything will go well when you log out. If it's the latter, try to look for alternatives such as staking with a smart contract, mining on your own, and so on. While it might not be the best for you, at least you can calculate the pros and cons in detail. But remember that everything has its risk, even if it does not involve centralized exchange. Assume the worst if possible.",
