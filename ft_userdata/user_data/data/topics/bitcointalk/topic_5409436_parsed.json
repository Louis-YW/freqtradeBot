I myself think that stable coins will be very beneficial for the development of the credit system in the economy. As transaction times and costs decrease, new opportunities arise for applications such as loans, lending money, remittances, and credit card networks. On the other hand, the introduction of a new digital currency can lead to a devaluation of the currency in other fiat currencies.CBDCs are a potential solution to many of the problems now plaguing fiat currencies. But they're not perfect, and there's no telling how they will affect economies around the world—especially in all the tiny countries out there. After all, it is clear that the new generation of digital stablecoins could have a huge impact on the future financial landscape.",

Not all stable coins are CBDCs. CBDCs are Central Bank issued Digital currencies. Focus on Central Bank. They don't even have to be cryptocurrencies.Quote from: Milan1009 on August 11, 2022, 04:11:50 AMRecently I was looking at some news about CBDCs implementation in Australia, and I was wondering if this is something that could cause trouble or confusion within a local economy as it moves forward. Countries like Canada have developed contingency plans for this system, although I'm not sure how small countries could be affected by this. What are your thoughts? CBDCs are just a (another) digital form of the local currency. So the big economic impact can be only over the card processing companies (like Visa/Mastercard) which, in case of CBDCs will no longer earn millions from fees (of course, the shops will earn by not spending for those fees). And, as said, it's expected CBDCs will have a massive negative impact on privacy of its users.",

Of course, there are drawbacks with the part where it's not regulated, but it is ideal for the ones that really don't have banks or easy access to it. I'm just worried that it's going to be out of control.",

If introduced, I believe it could give people the illusion of control over their own money. Aside from privacy problems, CBDCs will likely be just as easily frozen as regular bank accounts. Don't expect the permissionlessness of cryptocurrencies -- If physical cash wouldn't already exist, no way in hell governments would introduce it today.",

No need to spend money on cash control and replacement of worthless banknotes. Reduces the number of robberies because there is no cache. In such countries, the introduction of CBDC will not greatly affect the economy. In large countries, Russia, the United States, it is much more difficult to control the economy with the help of CBDC.",

Personally, I don't  believe big democracies like Europeans and USA will let perPeople own a lot of cbdc, specially due to the banking system lobby (they will be much affected)And no government want a financial crisis.Maybe in countries like China and Russia where rights are more restricted and there is a bigger control from the government over the economy it is possible there cbdc will grow faster.",

If the digital currency starts operating fully then more than before, more businesses will go online and those that couldn't will keep staying physical and may not get enough attention and patronage. It will be like source of living shifting from one person to another person. It will be easier to make payment for products or services done online with digital currency than fiat. Apart from banks income in fiat it will affect common business owners that won't be able to go digital and less attention and liquidity will go to fiat.",

Please get your understanding right! CBDC is a government released currency while stablecoins are cryptos. Both are structured in different ways. CBDCs are definitely beneficial for the issuing government in multiple ways. But for citizens, it's an issue for their privacy. They will have convenience obviously, but the financial privacy will be gone forever. Only time will tell how much successful they will become.",

I do not find any difference between paper cash and CBDC expect their appearance. You can touch paper cash it has a physical form and you can not touch CBDC it's a digital form of paper cash. As long as govt has full control to print money and increase money circulation, the main problem in our economy inflation will not be solved.",

Granted most banking is digital anyways, they'd just prefer to cement paper currency's fate. The appeal is to conflate CBDC's with crypto currency, and to the average consumer, they probably couldn't tell difference.Being able to control the money supply by merely generating new tokens is as dangerous as it gets.",

There've been several countries looking into them and a few experimenting with a CBDC trial over some area over some time, and it seems to be legal tender in Nigeria (eNaira), but that's probably it. I'm surprised, actually, that they didn't gain more attention.Overall, I think it can help with digitalization of the economy and empower the Central Bank of the state while possibly weakening private banks a bit. But it's neither good nor bad for economy on its own, as it's not a significant change: just a step up of fiat (but also a step away from privacy because there's no cash version and I think CBDCs probably require IDs of people, but I'm not sure).",

The one thing that really needs to be supported in the rollout is people who have poor ability to access the internet - whether that is the homeless or elderly people who might not be as knowledgeable on the subject, they will need the most support.
