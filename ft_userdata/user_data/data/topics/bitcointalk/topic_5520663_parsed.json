Bitcoin have been on the news for a while now and was among the focal point in the electioneering campaign of the president elect Donald Trump, so I don't know if the people listening to him have been able to spend few minutes into researching about Bitcoin as people who are interested in making the future better. Like I said before, I expected the numbers to be higher in favor of Bitcoin. From the Reddit post, the author was excited that we are early to Bitcoin and I agree with that because I can only imagine when the percentage will get to 50% in favor of Bitcoin , we would have been talking about Bitcoin price at over $500k. Therefore, I feel we are still very early to Bitcoin, the reason we should still persevere in buying and holding.",

Personally, nothing surprises me. Yes, people choose what has already stood the test of time and has proven its effectiveness and functionality. That's why they choose the dollar, not Bitcoin. No one believed that an alternative to the financial system could appear. Many were skeptical and still are the majority, if you believe the survey data. So what... Not everyone in this world can be far-sighted. Someone has to carry bags and do the dirty work, right?",

They are designed to let you think they have stable price, but in long term their value will continue to fall.

Because the majority here are all bitcoin investors and users, and there is no way we shoot ourselves on the foot by voting for fiat /watching fiat do better than our very own bitcoin.So, in conclusion, I don't trust the platform where the vote/poll was held to have enough or the same number of those who reallly understand bitcoin as much as they understood USD, else, the result would have been more competitive than this, it's clear that those who voted in that poll really do not know what bitcoin is or all about.",
