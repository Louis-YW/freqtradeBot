The first time they are listed, they will be more volatile as they deal with the real market interest. Early investors will mostly start selling some (or all) of their holdings, followed by buying at a new investor's exaggerated price expectations.Based on your desire description, you expect the minimum possible risk. Then why would you even bother considering an altcoin instead of bitcoin?",

Still I consider it risky to invest in altcoins other than Bitcoin. Especially the current market condition is very bad. In this bad situation altcoin are mostly turning into scam. People are making losses investing in altcoin. People are not showing much interest in investing in new altcoin now.So I would like to say that altcoin investment is very profitable but very risky at the moment. I consider investing in new altcoin completely risky. So avoid investing in new altcoin. Invest by understanding the type of token and checking the exchange listing if the market condition is good. But you can keep trying to trade.",

There have been many people who have become victims and many of them have invested using a lot of money even though it is not recommended at all. Maybe they can keep investing in new coins and tokens but only with money they can afford and don't exceed their budget limit.That way, they won't be too sorry if something happens to their coins or tokens. To avoid this, they can choose other coins or tokens that have had a good journey as an investment or if they are confused about a coin or token, they can choose bitcoin as their only investment coin.",

Most of the time, with new altcoins, it's all about hype in the communities to get potential investors.  But other tools can be used as a basis for us to somehow know if the project has the potential to bring you profit in the future, and one of them is perhaps the use of tokenomics, through which you can measure whether it is good or not. not the new coins or tokens.",

It can be 1% of your capital, but do not put it entirely in one token, and diversify your investments.",

And meme coin has the highest chance of losing your fund.  Moreover, most new coins are currently becoming scam at the end of the day. And now the market conditions is on high risky position so it will be prefer to not invest in altcoin now and if you wanna invest now then go for bitcoin and you could also select the top pairs of Alt coin like bnb, eth ,ltc , polygon etc",

There are still websites which we can use to track the coins performance throughout the time so following them from time to time isn't needed.It was also a waste of time especially if you will just sit there and watch, and you won't invest anything. Before we invest we shouldn't only based on the coins movement but the first thing that we must check is their details e.g the team members, tokenomics, road map and what is the project all about.If you think it was a red flag then it can be true that it's only built for a pump and dump purpose. There is no need to take risk on them even for a short time. It's always better to be safe than sorry.",

But, there will be arguably good thoughts about it for some prospect projects that are really considered to be good and one of it is being said as, invest while you're still early and you'll be one of the most profitable investors after wards. Well, that's applicable to all new projects but if you're going to look at that area. You'll see that many of these new projects were falling and it's a nonstop thing because investors these days are learning from the past.If it's not for those scammers that have been dwelling in the new projects, I guess that many will still be optimistic into buying them.",

Be sure to study the team creating the project. View their links on social networks, Facebook and Twitter. You also need to understand which exchanges the project will be released on. It is good if these are trusted exchanges. Be sure to read the white paper on the subject of when and what will be developed, or has already been created.",

New crypto is prone to dump so we need to outsmart the devs by selling first before them since scam devs usually wait for more people to buy their tokens at the peak and make their holders hope that thete will be more so we shouldn't for that to happen and secure when there's time and then decide if its worth then if not then find another new better project and repeat the same process for possible gaining.",
