  "content": "I was reading this, that bitcoin and other crypto were banned in India in 2018. The ban was lifted, but later 30% crypto tax was imposed on crypto users and this led to Indians preferring to exchange crypto and rupee within themselves which can be on decentralized exchanges or centralized exchanges.Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-p2p-scams-indiaHow the P2P scams happenOne way P2P scammers steal user data is with the help of fake crypto-centered channels on Telegram that promise high profits or airdrops. Many gullible users looking to make a quick profit often join these channels and share their personal banking information. In many other cases, the scammer simply buys or steals the user’s personal information.The stolen data is then used to create a P2P account on any popular P2P platform — Binance and WazriX are common in India.The scammer then initiates a buy order on the P2P platform looking for unsuspecting sellers. Once they match with a seller, they send the money to the seller using the victim’s account. Thus, they complete the P2P transaction on the platfrom where the buyer receives the cryptocurrency and the seller receives the money in their bank account.The buyer (scammer) then vanishes with the crypto and the victim whose bank account was used to send the money only realizes it after the money has been deducted from their bank account.The scammers will have the information to bank details and other necessary personal documents of the victim through fake airdrops and others means to lure the victims to provide their personal data. They will use the victims documents and necessary bank details to register on a centralized exchange. Create a centralized exchange P2P buy order, using the victims money that he has in bank to pay and receive crypto in return. And the scammer will transfer the coins out of the exchange.You can read about this in complete from https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-p2p-scams-indiaAvoid giving out your personal documents and personal data because it can be used to steal all your money.",

If you are the buyer, make sure you report the seller after you you have sent money if he does not want to release the coin from escrow.The case in your OP is different from the usual seller refusing to release funds from escrow or buyer not actually sending funds but marked the order as paid, etc. The source in your OP is talking about identity theft, scammers are buying and stealing people's banking details and using it to carry out peer to peer trades, i don't really know how much info you'd have to give away for a scammer to be able to send money out of your bank account without you knowing, (but i guess it has to be so much).Thus the warning has to be that users should protect their personal details, don't post it anywhere or inadvertently send it to scammers when looking for cheap buck. Once the scammer makes this anauthorized payment and receive the coins, there is no way to retrieve it or trace them because it was your details that was used for the registration process.",

I have edited the OP to make it perfect for people to understand. The people that submit their KYC documents to scammers unknowingly are the victims which are not even involved in the transaction between buyer and seller, but because their bank account details was known to the scammers, it was used to make transaction from the victims bank account. I see this as a way not to steal directly from the victims bank account, but instead, they use it to buy crypto from a centralized exchange.",

My banks use fingerprints, face id, phonecalls, email, in-app chat for extra verificiation, and they have risk assesment algorithms. When I make typical transactions, they can processed in an instant, but if something is off, they would do extra verifications to make sure it's really me doing the transaction. People should vote with their wallets and use modern digital banks with secure infrastructure.",

Now let say; normally when people got involved in airdrops campaign and possible they could asked for kyc to get verified on their platform or website as the case seems to be. Now how do they uses to verify their exchange account such as Binance main while before your identity could be used for verification on Binance p2p trade it should be that your bank name and your kyc details tally correctly before you could execute trade on binance, this same thing applicable to the buyer and the seller and if both details aren't complete Binace wouldn't allow such trade.  At this point where and how taking account number will lead to scam each other?Even though someone's account is being used Binance must request for kyc name to correspond with the account number and if that doesn't work there will be no trade, although I don't know if Binance changes the policy already. What we must be very careful of is our Documents they can easily used them to pass kyc in some exchange. The only scam that is common with p2p is for seller to mark paid while they haven't paid and when funds are being released to them and you didn't receive alert this shows such person has been scammed.",

Other platforms might only ask for bank statements and government-issued ID cards. If that's the case, those platforms should consider modifying their verification methods. However, we must remain cautious and avoid falling for the idea of easy money through Airdrops. Sharing documents for a small amount of money can be risky and potentially lead to scams.",

Only if you have such complete details can you hack into a person's bank account. Someone can easily or freely give out their bank account number and their full name, but with that, your account cannot be hacked without your notice because the bank will definitely send you a verification message.Anyway, crypto enthusiasts just have to be careful when handling their crypto assets and make security paramount.",

On the other hand,if the scammer can't get the OTP code, it is impossible for the scammer to have access to your funds. Another way is if you gave out your ATM card last four digits to the scammer or you lost your ATM card and the scammer then have access to it. In my country people are so careless that when they loss their phones or misplaced their sim cards,they feel reluctant to go and retrieve it,if a scammer sees the phone or was the one that stole the phone, he goes straight to your message to see if there is any message from your bank and he uses that message to get information to have access into your account and steal your funds. We just need to be very careful on handling our documents or devices that have our information on them not to be exposed to people either on the internet or offline.",

I had several withdrawal transactions that didn't even process. I contacted customer service and didn't get a serious response. Even the exchange telegram group was locked so that users could not send chats. In essence we are deadlocked on getting our funds back. Transactions can't even be canceled. So I gave up some of my money there.And speaking of p2p there are actually buyers or sellers on Binance who don't require us to use a bank account in our own name.
