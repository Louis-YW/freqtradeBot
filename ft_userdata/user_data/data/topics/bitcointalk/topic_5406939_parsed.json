It's that the market is really uncertain for now as we are in a bear market wherein the price is going down. But eventually there come a time that we will recover. And we are looking at around 2024-2025. So instead that bitcoin being dead around 2025, it will be a time that we might see the price going into the $100,000 or even more price.",

Bitcoin has gone a long way for someone to assume or think that it will come to an end so soon without a proper logical explanation. Bitcoin is above ten years of existence in case your brother doesn't know. Disregard your brother's words, he's just exaggerating without a reasonable fact.Since you do know that the bitcoin future has been discussed here severally why then would you allow your brother's words to bother you about the future fate of bitcoin by 2025. That means all the positive posts and replies you have been reading from the forum members about bitcoin's existence are not convincing to you at all to believe that bitcoin would keep existing than expected.",

There are a lot of loudmouths who take advantage of bear markets like this one to talk about the death of bitcoin, and we already know that bitcoin has died many times already:Bitcoin Obituaries - \"Bitcoin is Dead\" Declared 400+ Times",

It is a mix of misunderstanding and wrong information.Bitcoin block rewards will become 0 only in about 2140. And even then, mining should not stop since the miners also receive the transaction fees (they receive those now too!)So the year is wrong, the mining/block reward is misunderstood, hence 2025 is just a random date. And it's so close, the chances Bitcoin die off this fast are small.",

Bitcoin has always its uncertain future just like us because we even don't know what holds in the future. But one thing is certain, bitcoin will not die easily especially that bitcoin is already backed by big institutions and big countries. Although it has its own flaws that are always inevitable, but as long as the demand from the community is still there, bitcoin recovers and skyrocket again.",
