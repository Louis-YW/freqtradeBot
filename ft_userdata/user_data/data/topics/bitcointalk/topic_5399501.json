What I am also curious is which of them is the ones who start to dump then the other follows, it will be also a good signal but it seems they correlate and they move together at almost the same time.",

What I've noticed is that BTC has been following the price quite often like clockwork when it's the case that the S&P500/Nasdaq is up/down in good percentages at market open. It definitely sucks, but it is what it is.",

      "body": "Of course they are very related, because the reason why they dropped was very related as well. The resemblance comes from the fact that FED increased the interest rate, which means that all of the world got impacted from it and that was normal. I understand that there were situations where it is not a deal that impacts both of them the same in certain dates, but there are also situations where both of them are impacted the same as well.For example when pandemic hit, both of them went down because it impacts them both and terribly, but when money was printed a lot, then both went up a lot because it was beneficial for both. These are the situations, sometimes both got affected equally.",

      "body": "Quote from: Husires on May 20, 2022, 12:15:36 PMOr that what happened in the last pattern is a coincidenceIt both is coincidence and it isn't!It is a coincidence because there is simply no correlation between bitcoin and any market least of which US stock market. There has never been and there still isn't. Correlation shouldn't just happen when there is a dump. It should happen when there is rally too. For example you can't find any correlation when bitcoin price went from $30k to $70k while during most of that time stock market was still struggling!But it is also not completely a coincidence because over the past couple of years (started from pandemic era) a lot of bitcoin trades are brainwashed into accepting that this newfound correlation exists! Consequently all those who have believed in the lie (that are a considerable percentage of the market participants) started to also have an eye on US stock market and are very quick at panic selling their bitcoins whenever they see the US stock market is crashing.The more frequently this panic sell \"coincidence\" happens the more trades are going to join the bandwagon of panic selling hence creating an even bigger \"coincidence\".I don't think this trend is going to break unless people start looking at the whole 13 years worth of history or we see all these panic sellers lose a significant amount of money as bitcoin price goes up next time the US stocks come crumbling down.P.S. here is the lack of correlation I talked about and the reason why I call it an idiotic panic sell. This happened between July and November 2021",

If the stock market crashes, they might not have a choice but to cut the rate to prevent the stock market crash. This is what some people are speculating.Rates were only raised twice by 75bps and already we are in stock market bear territory. Inflation is still high. Most likely next print will either be higher or the same. They will need to still hike, if they hike what will happen to the stock market then? And crypto will also suffer.",

It is like halving where people think price is going to magically jump on the exact day that the block reward is cut in half so they buy bitcoin 2 months before the halving and sell a couple of days before the halving! Funny thing is that they always forget there was a hype right after the halving and price remains stable.I agree that we can't change it but we have to continue fighting superstitions",
