I am not sure how much time it will take to perform all this calculations by hand or whether if it is even possible, but I think if you succeed, it is going to be a very helpful didactic example.[1] https://gizmodo.com/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper-1640353309[2] https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/RIPEMD-160[3] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD[4] https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/base58[5] https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32",

      "body": "Mastering Bitcoin(Andreas Antonopoulos's book) should guide you about how you can generate your own private key by flipping a coin. Since you said you are planning to use pen and paper only you can write them in binary it means you can only use two characters 0 and 1 and write 256 characters randomly. Sample 1110 0101 0001 1001....... do this until you made 256 characters but I guess you will still need some tools to convert them from binary to hexadecimal you can use this tool https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/binary-to-hex-converter or follow their guide to convert binary manually into hexadecimal. Now, you have a 64 character hexadecimal you can use https://www.bitaddress.org/ under wallet details and paste it there to generate a public key and base58 wif key you can download the page and run it into offline machine if you don't want to expose private key in online device. Or get some idea from this thread \"Randomly Generated Private Key Outside of a Computer Environment\"",

Imagine I'm a teacher trying to explain the procedures on a white board, how can I?You can do it easily with pen and paper if you have set of regular or casino dices to generate random results.There are several instructions how you can do this for generation seed words and private key, but you will still need some calculations to make sure everything is ok.I ill post some instructions below and you can choose what you like the most:https://shiftcrypto.ch/blog/roll-the-dice-generate-your-own-seed/https://armantheparman.com/bitcoin-seed-with-dice/",

It wouldn't fit 'on a whiteboard', for sure.",

You won't even be able to complete half a round of SHA256 block compression without making mistakes and there are 64 rounds in one SHA256 computation of a 20-byte input (to compute checksum for base58 address). The rest is thousands and thousands of addition, multiplication, division, bit shifts and shuffles, bitwise operations, and a lot more all on 256-bit numbers, inputs and points (256-bit x and y).The best way to see all these steps if you want to see the details is to get a library that does this, write a code that calls the method that generates a new random address and use a debugger to step through the code and see each step and the intermediate values.",

It is almost guaranteed that you will make a mistake while doing the calculations manually (like I said, there are hundreds of them you have to do!) and thus this should only be seen as a learning exercise and not something to be used for any practical purpose.

To use it as analogy, the mathematical operations are essentially messing up the input in a similar manner, that you can't just redo them and get it back.",

You can absolutely 'extract' (debug print / log) every step of a hash function / one-way function. Just not after the fact, but you can do it while calculating the hash. That's also not the issue at hand here, though. The issue is not that it's a one-way-function but that generating a Bitcoin address has so many steps that you can't realistically do it using pen / paper.And even if you logged every step and intermediary result with a computer program, it wouldn't help the understanding whatsoever and take ages to go through. You'll also just be looking at numbers without obvious correlations to each other.You could show figures of some steps of some functions used in address generation, like here on Wikipedia's SHA256 page.Quote from: Critical_Thoughts on February 04, 2023, 10:13:26 AMI could only compare it to a black hole [...] speed could be achieved by a massive super computer, e.g. A quantum computerIf you prefer just not explaining one-way functions or address generation in detail (it is possible - just not by going through it step-by-step), I prefer BlackHatCoiner's description as a blender. Also do note that quantum =/= fast. They can only speed up certain specific computations and are as such not really comparable to a traditional supercomputer.",
