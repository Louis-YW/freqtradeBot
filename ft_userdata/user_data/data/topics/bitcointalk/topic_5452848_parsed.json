If we respect the Nigerian police force, they would in many instances be afraid to misbehave, but this case is more or less about Seun being bigger than the force, and it was even captured on camera for the world to see. I know say police get their own for body too, but if you know say you no wear uniform or never wear am before or no get who don wear am and get big position, abeg try calm down for them, the highest they would do is extort you and let you go.",

If he no dey on uniform you fit run am anyhow e no matter but that uniform stands as a sign of respect wey we supposed get for the law. I also know say our security personnel, not just the police but even army no dey use their head and them dey abuse this small power wey them get but we go still at least show them small respect. Make we say for instance na soldier he go slap, na that place then for deliver am go meet him ancestors but since na police, he no dey fear at all.

The ever first mistake one could do this time is to allow the public see the dirty secret of what you've done in the past being exposed to them, they will take advantage of it and further expose you in some areas you least expect, add more additional allegations on your case just in other to shame your disgrace in the public, the police inbthe country cannot be trusted in making the right and necessary action as required, their personnels have been found lagging in this area of their behavioral conduct, this was part of what led to the police brutality saga on END SARS nationwide protest 2020Quote from: Davidvictorson on May 23, 2023, 06:21:53 AMSeun na big man pikin and had it been say dem nor record am, him family for use their influence sweep everything under the carpet.
