Did you invest in one of these tokens in 2022/23?I read the article about it earlier today. Bitget really have stepped up this year so no surprise to see $BGB performing so well. Thanks to the many solid partnerships and promotions they've initiated over these past few months, they've been able to garner attention frm many more users nd investors. Pretty impressive stuff.",
