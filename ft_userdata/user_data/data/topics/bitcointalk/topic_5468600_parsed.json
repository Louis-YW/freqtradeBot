      "body": "From my own experience: try a few, and see which one you like. I tend to switch once in a while, for instance when Ubuntu went nuts with their Unity interface. Totally designed for Newbies, but I didn't like it.I've also switched between Gnome and KDE a few times. They all tend to get more demanding and animating. Try Knoppix (boot from DVD without installation) to see how crazy animations can get: the last one I downloaded had \"magic lamp minimize\" and \"wobbly windows\" by default.After this, I'm down to Linux Mint now. With adjusted Appearance: I want my active window to have a clear blue border. The default is dark and barely shows which window is active. Clearlooks is a good start for Appearance, but I've customized it further.Good luck  It's all about taste",

But, for something like this. If you install one and it does not work for you, just move to the next. You don't have to live with any particular distro if it's not working the way you want it to.-Dave",

It is also more stable that any Ubuntu-based distro.",
