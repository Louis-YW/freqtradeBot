  "content": "I believe that most of you will know by now that some well known casino’s here are seen on premier league club shirts, but it looks like that they’ll have to look elsewhere to spend their marketing budget as  premier league  has asked clubs to take a voluntary ban on gambling sites that are seen on their shirts. Furthermore the clubs have been given up to 2024 - 2025 to end such deals under this voluntary ban, however it’s yet not official but if 14 clubs accept it then it’ll be applicable with immediate effect, so what are your thoughts on this is the rule bit too harsh or it’s justified?.",

If English Premier League clubs do not allowed betting sites to endorse them again, it may slightly affect the betting site to see increasing new customers, but there should be other ways they can advertise their products like livescores sites and many others. According to the news, if 14 clubs can support the ban, that it would be adopted immediately. Top clubs like Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur are not sponsoring any gambling site, such clubs may be in support of this.",

Premier League is the most watched league in the world football and the reason why TV rights etc are so expensive and also the reason why EPL teams manage to have better transfer budgets than the others. Tough on the crypto community as well. Since Stake etc have been doing a great job promoting crypto and crypto gambling to the world.",

In the 90's you will see tons of it, new brands and old brands. From red, lights up to menthols.  Are this really affecting the community or the kids these days? They are not allowed to access the gambling sites if their parents knows how to forbid it in their computer or smartphones. This will surely hurt the gambling industry and worse thing that happens is if other leagues following the same ban.",

As mentioned in the article, the ban only affects revenue of smaller clubs sponsored by these gambling platforms. If they cannot find replacements or come to a compromise, it will be tougher to bring in quality players to their team.UK has very strict rules when it comes to gambling regulations and I'm wondering if part of the decision was related to advertising of unregistered companies in the country.",

They are considering if it's permanent or not still though, so that's a plus I guess..? ;",

I'd say the clubs will lose huge amount money since partnering with a club will cost a lot, it's not small money even they partnered with small clubs.",

That would be a blow to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large, because Sportsbet is definitely one of the leading crypto oriented platform making waves and bringing huge positive publicity to BTCI'm not sure as to how that'll be for the greater good, I mean there are several ways kids get exposed to stuffs and I'm not sure ending gambling deals will eliminate such risks, if there are still tons of billboards around that promotes it. I agree that it might be reduce the risk and might be a morally accepted standard. However, I'm sure all gambling sites i.e. ethical ones, not the outright scamming ones often make sure that their customers are of the appropriate age to use their service hence the request of age during registration and KYC after there is some reason to believe otherwise.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 05, 2022, 08:59:51 AMTop clubs like Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur are not sponsoring any gambling site, such clubs may be in support of this.I think currently most of the mentioned teams are not being sponsored or in partnership with gambling platform, but a few ago Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea were all in partnership with 1xbet which they all later suspend due several illegal contents according to the UK laws on the websites. However, Arsenal if I'm not mistaken is still very well into a partnership deal with sportsbets.io",

I think that even if this implementation decision eventually occurs, the English league authorities must be able to find the best or alternative way so that English league football clubs can get new sponsors, because so far I see it is difficult for small teams to get sponsors who are ready to pay big enough for the team except gambling house.",

Just as it was pointed out that there formerly used to be advertisements about cigarettes but not anymore, other new companies will quickly take advantage of the opportunity to advertise with premier League clubs. Maybe the british government has intentions to see to it that there is a reduction in underage gambling perhaps, but gambling casinos do not only  have sponsorship with premier League teams, some also sponsor cricket which is one of the sports in England as well, i'd like to know if they will affected as well.",

So I don't think it's fully official yet, if I'm not mistaken it was proposed by the League. Even the League has sought support from Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, but there seems to be no input. It was done because they had no gambling sponsors. It doesn't seem effective, but if it's because of a law from the government then they should comply. Although I'm actually worried about their financial condition after their sponsor is gone. Because if I'm not mistaken some gambling sponsors are the club's main source of funds.

If we look at it, clubs needs this sponsorships to meet up on there ends in the management of there teams and calling the sponsorship off is sure to have some major effect on club funding.However, I loo at this news right now and it's hilarious how they call such a mandatory order VOLUNTARY. There is nothing voluntary about giving a certain period for all deals on going site sponsorship of a club to be halt. So uncool on this one and I think they should do a review on what they really want because this isn't for the best.",
