      "body": "There are several suggestions to handle losses in technical and emotional termsHandling gambling losses in emotional term:Acknowledge your feelings: It's important to acknowledge and accept your feelings of disappointment or frustration after a gambling loss. Ignoring or suppressing your emotions will only prolong the healing process.Talk to someone: Talking to a friend or family member about your feelings can help you process your emotions and gain a different perspective on the situation.Seek professional help: If your gambling losses are causing emotional distress, it may be helpful to seek the help of a therapist or counselor. They can provide support and guidance to help you cope with your feelings and develop strategies to prevent future emotional distress.Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself physically and mentally can help improve your emotional well-being. This can include things like exercise, meditation, yoga, or other stress-relieving activities.Set boundaries: Setting limits on your gambling can help prevent future emotional distress. This might include setting a budget, setting a time limit on your gambling, or avoiding certain triggers that lead to excessive gambling.Find a healthy distraction: Finding a healthy and fun distraction can be a great way to take your mind off your losses and improve your mood. This could include hobbies, sports, reading, or spending time with friends and family.Learn from the loss: Instead of dwelling on the losses, try to learn from the experience, reflect on what went wrong, and think about how you can improve your strategy for the future.Handling gambling losses in technical term:Keep records: Keeping detailed records of your gambling activities can help you understand your patterns of behavior and identify any potential problem areas. This includes noting down the date, time, amount, and outcome of each bet you make.Set a budget: One of the most important things you can do to handle gambling losses technically is to set a budget and stick to it. This will help you avoid overspending and losing more money than you can afford.Use a stop-loss: A stop-loss is a predetermined point at which you will stop gambling for the day or week. It's a great way to control your spending and avoid losing more than you can afford.Use a staking plan: A staking plan is a method of managing your bankroll that helps you make informed decisions about how much to bet on each outcome. This can help you avoid losing more than you can afford.Take a break: If you're feeling down about your losses, it's important to take a break from gambling. This will give you time to clear your head and reassess your approach.Seek professional help: If you feel like you have a gambling problem and that your losses are affecting your personal and professional life, it's important to seek professional help. There are many organizations that can provide support and resources to help you overcome your addiction.Use responsible gambling tools: Many online gambling platforms offer tools that help players limit their deposits, set time limits, or even self-exclude from the platform. These tools can help you control your gambling behavior and avoid excessive losses.Usually whenever I experience gambling losses, I'll just take a deep breath and accept the fact that I lost, I never chase losses and I reflect on what to do next to avoid such kind of huge losses.  It is easier to accept if we gamble money that we can afford to lose since it has no impact in our daily budget and finances.sources:https://www.algamus.org/blog/how-to-get-over-gambling-losshttps://www.quora.com/What-a-person-should-do-if-he-lost-his-money-in-gamblinghttps://800gambler.org/how-to-mentally-cope-with-a-big-gambling-loss/",

If you stick to a fixed bankroll, you don't have to worry, because once that money is lost, you know your gambling session ended and you will start a new one only next week, with another limited fixed budget. For gamblers having difficult to stop playing, it's better to never deposit more than the amount they set to use for the week, otherwise they will feel tempted to continue wagering with extra funds, even after losing the pre-determined amount. I know Stake casino has a \"vault\", where gamblers can store their money, so it won't display on their balance. It can reduce the temptation a little bit, but if it's still not enough, it's really advisable to deposit only the amount which is going to be wagered on the week.",

This is the ultimate way to deal with your losses, you focus on getting entertainment and don't really care about the losses. As long as you use small money and it is limited money, you won't feel so hurt when you get losses. The complicated problem only rises when we use big money, even worse it is loan money. That's why only use the extra money and it must be money that can afford to lose.",

I handle losses the way I take the same response as when I experience big disappointments and regrets.The losing amount is also a significant consideration. If that's a huge amount involved, then moving on might take time but on the other hand, if the loss amount is quite small and can be handled, then just a bit of taking a break from gambling will do the trick of how to move on.Don't focus too much on ways how to handle losses but instead, try our best to build a good winning streak on every of our gambling sessions.",

Handling losses has been already part of my life and I'm sure that everyone does like being rejected and having a failure. It's not a different thing to majority of us because we know that it's something normal in life and mostly in gambling. It is to be expected that when we gamble, we know that there are only two things for its results, either you win or lose and having that mindset that you're expecting to loss is already a good sign that you're going to handle it well because the result isn't going to favor you.",

The most important thing is not to play for sensitive amounts of money and to be distracted from gambling in time. When we get too deeply involved in something, it basically carries destructive tendencies, so we need to pause.In fact, I even like pauses when, after bad betting sessions, I quit betting completely and my head is free to think about the odds and how which team will play their game.",

It can result in handing back all the money that you smartly made at the start. There can be many reasons for dropping the quality of your play, assuming you are in a skill based game not random, like not properly eating which cause your energy levels to drop or having tiredness/intoxication start to creep into your mind.",

It doesn't matter if you win at some point, you will keep playing because you'll think why not win more? then you will lose your winnings first then you will lose your savings.If you make a budget first though, that won't happen to you.",
