For example if you had just one machine with an Intel  i9-10900K CPU @ 3.70GHz  The Hash rate for mining Monero (XMR) would be   5145.04 H/s = 0.02535993 XMR  which is around  3.19 USD  per month from just one PC .XMR is not the most profitable coin to mine right now this is just an example i have on hand .",
