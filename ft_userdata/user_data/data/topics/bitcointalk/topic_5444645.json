  "content": "On the eve of yet another possible bank bailout I introduce the Cryptops project.Cryptops is a decentralized exchange (DEX) created to make it easy for users to trade cryptocurrency option derivatives directly on the blockchain order book using tokenized traditional financial derivative assets. Cryptops uses asset tokens to represent real world cryptocurrency option derivatives that are issued on a direct access blockchain order book. Some of the unique benefits of the Cryptops implementation of asset tokenization include the following. * The most censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX available. * The most secure and convenient staking model that does not involve any kind of obscure lending, lockup periods or needing run your own node. * The asset token derivatives are exercisable to tokens that reference the underlying which is pegged in value and directly transferable to real world native coins on their blockchains.A unique benefit of Cryptops is being a censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX. Just download the CryptopsTerm trade wallet to your computer or tablet to self host and run your own Cryptops core node to directly access all coins and other assets in your wallet using only a secret key. There are no potentially harmful browser plugins that need to \"connect\" to a hybrid off-chain order book that could easily be IP blocked and censored.Derivatives trading on Cryptops is done using the native COE utility coin. The public native COE coin is not available on any CEX or through any VC bank and currently can only be purchased using the unique innovative self hosted ICO that uses a direct Bitcoin BTC to Cryptops COE bridge.The Cryptops project wants to be like an Ethereum for disperse layer 1 blockchains bridging out directly to native coins while also providing a derivatives exchange for each of the bridged coins.",
