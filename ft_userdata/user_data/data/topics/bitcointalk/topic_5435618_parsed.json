  "content": "Women from 84 countries participated in the Miss Universe 2023 pageant. But great attention was when Alejandra Guajardo from El Salvador appeared on stage wearing a Bitcoin suit for the cryptocurrency sector.  Alejandra Guajardo shows the evolution of her country's currency through the clothes she wears. She came on stage with a golden bitcoin outfit, holding a scepter with a BTC logo. Guajardo's Bitcoin dressing quickly became the talk of the cryptoworld  within moments. El Salvador's President Nayeb Bukel wants to go forward with cryptocurrency. He has already launched a national bitcoin office in his country. The purpose of which is to coordinate various initiatives related to cryptocurrency in the country as well as around the world. They have committed to buy one Bitcoin each day to profit from the dip. This has been widely appreciated by crypto fans all over the world.Bitcoin now gained worldwide recognition once again through this event. The positive sign towards Bitcoin has increased among all kinds of people. I think Miss Universe 2023 is a green message for Bitcoin. What do you think about it?",

El Salvador's President Nayeb Bukel bought at the wrong time and thus wasted a lot of money that his people paid and then continued to buy, which means that either he does not have economic advisors and this is a disaster, or he has and the disaster is greater.In general, the fame was gained by Alejandra Guajardo by wearing the Bitcoin suit more than any other suit, and therefore perhaps she wanted to achieve fame with that, and the goal is not awareness.",

It's probably the last place I would expect to see any bitcoin references. That being said, I have a mixed feelings about N. Bukele using his position and the taxpayers money to prop up Bitcoin. I'd much rather see it growing from a grass-roots initiatives.I wonder if that was her choice and does she even understands what Bitcoin is and how it works.",

I cringe at the idea of a national Bitcoin office to coordinate initiatives. Bitcoin has survived do far without any centralized or indeed physical space, it doesn't need one now.I understand that this is part of adoption and countries would need something more tangible if they are going to invest in it, to make it more real to them, but it's still cringe regardless. And they could just adopt it for what it is.The outfit from the representative of El Salvador did what it was designed to be - attract attention.This could either be a desperate attempt to get some traffic going on their now, not so sensational move to adopt Bitcoin or a sign of actual adoption. I'll go for the former.",

Saylor has never complained about the negative effect it may have had on Micro strategy.  President Bukel was too hasty, he was doing too much at the same time. He was concerned about making history and didn’t make proper analysis of the country’s economy and how buying bitcoin at the time would affect the economy in short and long term. While the crypto community applauded his bravery, the IMF were firmly against his decisions and were waiting for him to fail. I hope President Bukel sees the fruit of his labor before his term ends. A new President may not like bitcoin.",

For the candidates, they also got people behind them that manages what outfit they're going to wear and it's like a lot of clothes to represent them and their country.On this case, I think we all know that this is like a suggestion made by Nayib so that it will represent not just their country that has adopted bitcoin as a legal tender, their bitcoin beach but also to represent bitcoin alone. I'm guessing that the candidate is aware of bitcoin but probably don't wholly understand how it works.",

We should be thankful for a country like this that will help Bitcoin promote nationwide and might other countries are now aware and also other people of what Guajardo's wearing.",

Whether it brings them a win or not is secondary, but this portrays their stand to the world. Even the fashion industry people who hasn't heard of it might have looked for it. El Salvador being the country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender is under critics, but they are making themselves strong amidst the market situation.",

Awareness is not a problem, most of the people in the world know about Bitcoin, Bitcoin bull runs is something that was extensively covered in mainstream media. But people don't want to use Bitcoin instead of their bank cards, because they are quite satisfied with the service they get, while seeing downsides to using Bitcoin as a currency due to problems like volatility, key management, lack of adoption by merchants, occasional high fees and so on.",
