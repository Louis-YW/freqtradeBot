  "content": "Hello my people I greet all of una, I know many of us go done see that BBC interview of emdee the YouTuber who just made his way to the UK not too long ago, I don't know how una feel about they interview but from my opinion that was a Nigerian painting the image of Nigeria to the world poorly.Firstly I am still yet to understand why he who isn't an ambassador of Nigeria to the UK get such an interview on the BBC station e real shock me, although the news on Twitter is that due to the interview the UK has stopped Nigerian from coming into the US paying attention to those who are coming with student visa.I don't think the interview cause that one, the UK must have been nursing the idea and that interview can just increase their desire to do so, regardless for a Nigerian to speak about Nigerian like that is really embarrassing.I believe we all expect everyone who goes out of the country should try to uplift the image of Nigeria but we can't assure that, this is another story of a Nigerian polluting the image of the country.",
