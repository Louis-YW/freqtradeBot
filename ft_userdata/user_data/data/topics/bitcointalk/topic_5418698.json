  "content": "If you have been following the news about COVID-19 recently, you would know about a story about how some researchers from Boston university were fucking around with Sars-Cov-2 viruses to make them more and less pathogenic against mice. Their modified version Omi-S of Sars-Cov-2 killed about 80% of all mice in their study (these mice had human ACE-2 receptors, so they were humanized mice). Such research is very risky because pathogens can leak from laboratories and cause all kinds of mayhem. Here is a video about this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WTZo9ieBKYOr you can read the original paper for yourself here:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.13.512134v1.full.pdfThere should be a requirement for all biological laboratories to post cryptographic timestamps of all their records on blockchains including the Bitcoin blockchain. More specifically, the hash or Merkle root of the data and records collected from the labs needs to be posted on the Bitcoin blockchain as often as possible. Since nobody is able to change the hashes or Merkle roots after they have been posted on blockchains, the laboratories will not be able to edit or delete anything without being caught. This will greatly aid any investigations in case a pathogen leaks from one of these laboratories and there is a global pandemic.I suggest for the US military to take swift action against these laboratories unless they shut down immediately and set everything up for posting timestamps. The US military needs to treat these laboratories and the institutions that the laboratories belong to as extremely dangerous terrorist organizations unless they immediately equip themselves for posting timestamps of everything on blockchains like the Bitcoin blockchain.I do not any medical or biological expertise required to judge what biological laboratories should or should not be able to do (if I did have the expertise, then I would be against this sort of research), but if they do not post timestamps on blockchains, then they are extremely irresponsible, and I have no choice but to see these laboratories as the worst of the worst.Don't forget how we still do not know the origin of the original Sars-Cov-2 virus. Did it come from a lab? Probably? We don't know because the Bio-safety level 4 lab in Wuhan knows nothing about proof-of-work blockchains. Yes. They would rather have another fucking pandemic than read the fucking Bitcoin whitepaper. We are all fucked.Added 10.31.2022Here is the report from the US senate saying that the Sars-Cov-2 virus most likely originally came form a lab.https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/report_an_analysis_of_the_origins_of_covid-19_102722.pdfAdded 11.30.2022I have just been aware of the e-mails between Dr Fauci, Dr Collins, and other people discussing the origin of Sars-Cov-2 from January 31,2022 to about February 9,2022. They clearly saw plenty of evidence that 2019-NCov came from a laboratory, but they instead decided that it was best if we did not have any 'conspiracy theories' and they therefore ignored that evidence and published a paper that declared that 2019-NCov was of a natural origin for purely political reasons. They simply did not want to get caught murdering millions of people. People are so stupid that they bought into the lies and they do not even want to do the proper investigation. This is a case where there is 100% murder and 0% investigation.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Creator of Circcash, you can also post timestamps of all records from the labs on the Circcash blockchain as well. After all, I am the only one speaking up about this issue.",
