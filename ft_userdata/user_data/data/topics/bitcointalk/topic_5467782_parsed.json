It's a good way of introducing to the newbies and giving them some opportunity to earn a bit from the specific cryptos that will sponsor this feature.I also think that websites like CMC and coingecko have this feature and if you're into grinding of earning from these, they're not really that much but it is a good way to spend your free time if you don't have a lot of things to do. Anyway, can also consider earning for free when you're like working actually and getting paid with crypto from the work that you do.",

In fact, there is another way to generate more but yes, you also need to risk more. Well, we can take these ways as OP had mentioned but buying potential coins seems to be the best way of earning a profit in the crypto market.",

There have been series of bounties that launches every single day but doesn't meet up their target if a participant keep doing bounty's without any earning at least $10 to $50 they could get discouraged since no payment is forth coming. Likewise to the ambassadorial program most project pays with their native tokens to their ambassadors, but if talks about mods they are being paid in usdt for their services at least is actually good work on some projects doesn't accept people because of trust issues.",

Projects are paying way way low compared before where bounty managers receives more than the bounty hunters. Though being a bounty manager today is better than being a bounty hunter since being a bounty manager assures you that you can get something like a pay for your work. It's a good thing that more and more bounty managers are requiring bounty projects to give another coin that has a value, even if it is small, atleast bounty hunters still has an assurance that they can get something from their work.",

Yeah thanks to list that as well I didn't even mention that, I think nowadays becoming a bounty manager is becoming more competitive whereby for one to secure a project is very difficult and even successful secured one I m not sure they really get some decent pay out. Watch now those that was well known then hardly manage campaign now although some of them are being selective as they don't want to promote scamming project whereby it will tarnished their image and reputation so they avoid managing such project, and even those that manages now doesn't really used their main profile rather will request the project to make account and the upgrade it to copper member then they can use it to launch the bounty just to secure their real profile.",

Though, I guess its already outdated as the airdrop today most of them requires some fees and some investment first before you actually qualified. Signature campaign remains free though, you just need to do your task and you can be good every week as long as you are in the campaign.
