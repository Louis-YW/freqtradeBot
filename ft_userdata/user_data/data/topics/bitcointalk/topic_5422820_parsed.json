The past is not the best indicator that some things will happen in the future, but Bitcoin has followed a certain pattern so far in that the biggest bull runs have happened in the post-halving period, and I see no reason why that pattern will not repeat itself in 2024. Of course, this cannot be a solid basis for investment, but given that we know how most people think and that they are only interested in profit in the short term, they should pay special attention to halving.Of course, it is best to invest only as much as we are ready to lose and not be burdened by some kind of time limit in which something must happen, but that is much easier said than done.",

If you want to be successful in investing, it is necessary for you to predict the future market trends and make decisions based on those predictions.I'm trying to collect the information from everywhere and from different sources and then try to put them together to make a prediction. It is not easy, but it's not impossible. There are many factors that can affect the price of any cryptocurrency and we cannot predict those factors with 100% accuracy. But we can make an educated guess. The key here is to stay updated with the latest news, research and trends so that you can avoid making any wrong decisions. It is very important to make the right prediction in order to invest successfully. If you don't know about the market or you don't have any idea about what kind of coin you want to invest, then it's better to stay away from it. Don't think that you can get rich overnight just because a friend of yours has made some money with cryptocurrencies. It doesn't work like that and if you don't know anything about the market, then it would be better if you stayed away from it.",

Investing in Crypto-currency mostly frustrate short period investors, investing in Crypto-currency (Altcoin) for a short time trying to maximize the buy low and sell high in a short period theory does not work all the time rather you may sell them some dollars lower than you purchases.I am in no position in advising on Altcoin especially those low market cap ones because I don’t believe in them. But a good strategy in Crypto-currency investment is long term, but it would work specially if you have considered other essential strategies.",
