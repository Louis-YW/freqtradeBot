Here is a specific board which is Exchanges to post any discussion or ask something related to exchanges.By the way, You will get your answer if you click on that link in a separate browser to find out if the website is real or not. But you have to be careful before login and recheck their website if name is authentic and try to use a new browser to check that.  Receiving Emails from exchanges to verify KYC are pretty common but safety is the first priority. I didn't use this exchange for a single time but as far I know LocalBitcoins require KYC to use their exchange and here is their article about KYC :",

I believe this was as a result of them checking their system and noticing some unclaimed balances after they sent out a warning mail to their customers to withdraw their funds. All they have to do is just auto-send mail to all their customers who have previously funded their accounts; it's now left for anyone who has a balance to go and claim it. And the KYC requirements will be for them to verify if the person who wants to claim it is the real owner of the account. Or it could all be a scam mail from people trying to scam you.",

It all sounds too suspicious.Since you don't remember having any bitcoin left at the LocalBitcoins, then most likely you don't have anything there and there is no need to click on the link in the email. I would not recommend clicking on links that you don't expect (unless, for example, it is a link to verify mail - but in this case you shouldn't do that anyway).The reasons for sending this email may be different, but with a high degree of probability it is directed against your interests. This is most likely a phishing attack. If I were you, I wouldn't take the risk and delete this letter. In general, my position on this matter is not at all original - ignore this email.",

I'm not saying you should trust the email tho, it's just the reason would make sense. I could also imagine them sending out email notice to every user or smth.In any case, you can try checking by logging in to your LBC account the typical way - key in the URL on your browser and login -. I advise not clicking any links on the email since malicious actors could still spoof emails where it would appear as if the email came from localbitcoins.com.Binance talked about this in one of their articles:Quote from: https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/examples-of-phishing-emails-360020817051All emails can be spoofed.

Op, not remembering if you had any BTC may mean you once had an account with them and probably discarded the platform once there was the news about them closing their service. If you did move your coins back then, I don't think the email you got should really concern you much, because it was maybe a bulk mail sent out to their old customers from their log address.I think you should inquire or rather trace back your footsteps to the account and try if you can login. Or check your old read email messages, if you are the type who receives notification of transactions.",

      "body": "The sender's address in an email message can be spoofed. Email spoofing is possible because the SMTP protocol used for sending emails does not have built-in mechanisms to verify the authenticity of the sender's address. When an email is sent, the sender can freely specify the \"From\" field in the email header, which means they can input any email address they want, including addresses that do not belong to them. Even with a careful analysis of the raw email header, it is still possible for skilled attackers to obfuscate their tracks and make the email appear legitimate.OP, you should carefully check the URL addresses that the buttons in the email message are trying to take you to before clicking on them. If something appears suspicious, refrain from clicking. It is better to use a legitimate URL to log into the service and check if you have any resources there that would be worth the effort.",

It's gonna be a good share if you can make a thread about it.It's been ages since that happened. I once placed an order on Binance's P2P platform, using a local mobile banking service, let's call it XYZ, as my payment method. Shortly after, I received an SMS stating that I had received a certain amount of money, let's say \"ABC\"Surprisingly, the SMS displayed my actual account balance, which led me to believe it was accurate, and without cross-checking on the app, I released USDT. However, later on, I discovered that the money hadn't actually been received. I'm still puzzled as to how they managed to display my real balance in that SMS.",
