I hope RVN, ETC, ERGO and another coins stay strong and I hope for new POW coins.With more support, maybe RVN can attract more attention and have some good functionalities in a near future.",

Yes the one that started this bear market is also pumping.I am guessing its because Summer is over and there is more liquidity in the markets. So there are many active traders now compared to a few weeks ago. And many coins are pumping left and right this week, including these POW coins.",

Miners are probably going to do trial and error to some POW coins until they find something that is worth their energy and could also pay their bills while the coins are also worth holding. But weren't there an ETH POW coming too? If there isn't a split I guess ETC will likely be the best option. But like Ravencoin, people will doubt its usecase.",
