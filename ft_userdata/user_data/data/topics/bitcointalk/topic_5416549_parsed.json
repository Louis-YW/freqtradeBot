  "content": "It looks like Elon Musk is going to proceed with the $44B deal to buy Twitter as he has originally planned. The recent news of Elon Musk changing its mind again had a short pump in DOGE's price. If the deal goes through, that would mean Elon Musk will become the new owner of one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Knowing that the billionaire is a huge fan of Dogecoin, it's possible he will integrate the cryptocurrency into the platform for micropayments (micro-tipping).I'm wondering what effect will this have into DOGE's price if successfully implemented? Will DOGE be able to finally get past $1 per coin? Or will it never happen? Also, I fail to see how DOGE would be used massively on Twitter when the cryptocurrency doesn't have enough transaction capacity to serve millions of users around the world. There's no LN or on-chain scaling solution yet, so developers are going to have to work on something if they want DOGE to be widely adopted worldwide. What are your thoughts?",

There will also be a big dump once they cannot service everyone due to heavy traffic. Happened to BNB due to the NFT's that was using the Binance Smart Chain. They didn't expect a large amount will come and they didn't handle it well. I just hope Dogecoin is ready for that wave before EM applies it or it will just be a disappointment.",

And if such an offer was rejected earlier, now the chances of realizing it will increase very much after Musk becomes the rightful owner of this social network. And this will undoubtedly affect the value of the coin, as it will add even more utility to it.",

That rumor has already been spread when he tries to buy Twitter for the first time and now resurfaced again because of his desire to buy Twitter again after choosing not too months ago. Musk has been pumping and dumping DOGE for quite some time and we know that DOGE almost reached a dollar because of him. We also saw that his desire of buying twitter again made DOGE pump a bit. Now with regards to him adding DOGE into twitter if he successfully buys it, I guess it's possible since DOGE has been made to tip those people. I'm thinking, if he will integrate it, there might be a point where people will tip other people with DOGE if they see that their tweet or comment is good. Now with DOGE going to $1, it's possible but the chance of it to happen are low to close to zero for me. With that enormous supply and it being inflationary, it will be hard but it's still possible knowing how many people are using twitter around the world. I'm thinking it's not only DOGE that will be added but there will be some coins that will be added for other use.",

It may even be possible that he's going to run an advertisement of sorts for it when he gets the platform early on though I don't think it's going to last long though or heck I don't think a lot of people are even going to use it, a lot of people still don't even know what crypto is (not to mention most buyers of Doge are probably just hodling it for him and not to use it). There are probably a few better options tbh, but it is Elon we are talking about.   On another note wasn't there a lawsuit about Elon and Doge? Wondering how he's going to handle that (or maybe it was handled already?)  if Doge was going to be introduced to the platform.",

We are talking about knowing the intentions of a billionaire, by his past actions and to be fair I am pretty sure that he is not going to be held responsible for them neither. He did pumped doge once, but then he also made it crash as well by saying he is no longer interested. It means he could say whatever he wants and nobody is there to stop him. This is why I personally believe that it would be wiser if we could just ignore what he has said so far or done so far and assume that he has absolutely no interest in doge, because if we assume him wanting to, and then turns out he won't, we would lose a lot of money.",

I only believe it though once it is really a done deal because his first attempt of buying twitter was kind of a weird drama.If he is successful then it is a possibility that Dogecoin could be accepted as a payment at twitter.
