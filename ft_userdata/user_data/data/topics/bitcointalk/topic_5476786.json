      "body": "Fiat has given the government so much power over its citizens, that they manipulate the hard work of people with inflation, which can be as another form of paying taxes. Because it doesn't add in any way to the economy of the nation. That's why the government is against bitcoin and tries its best to control the whole bitcoin transactions. Do you wonder why people still respect the government, despite the troubles it inflicts on the world, using fiat? Purchasing weapons, building bioweapons, and destroying life and cities, to curtail their freedom and to prove superiority to an opposing side. Not every human can hate or distrust the government. They get paid and managed by the government. Moving away from the authorities and commands of the government seems like the end of the world to many citizens. The government control soldiers, banks, schools, and even religious organization to convince citizens to think that their brain is deeply rooted in capitalism. Cryptocurrency is more attributed to libertarians who wish to escape from the super-powerful control the government uses fiat in controlling the world.The journey will only get difficult if the rich begin to lose their wealth, as they'll have a high rate of unemployment. Which still serves as a tool for the government to manipulate the mental health of citizens. Channeling their thoughts in the direction of taking loans and depending on government grants for survival. One funny thing, once people depend on those grants, they won't be forthcoming, endangering the lives of people. Then the working class serves as collateral damage for the damages the government is causing using inflation. After saving up a huge amount of money for years, you won't be able to purchase your dream house or car because the price just went high, and the value of the saved money reduced drastically, with no interest. Don't know much about the improvement of the compound interest in banks, yet it doesn't help the working class, due to the theft the government is achieving in the name of inflation. We all accept whatever they say because the brain is almost configured from scratch to obey the authorities. Hence, if the whole world goes to become libertarian, the government won't have much say in society. However, the only tool for achieving such a goal, bitcoin, has been fought tooth and nail by the government. Although not completely, just a few crypto services accept the KYC terms of the government, and the emplacement of taxes on bitcoin transactions in some countries. It's quite impossible to regulate bitcoin, yet the government is not stopping in its fight to bring bad publicity to bitcoin and ban the currency. I suspect their moves of adopting the technology, as a ploy of understanding or working to figure out a method of destabilizing the technology to their favor. However, their plans won't work, Satoshi thought it all through before releasing bitcoin. They would fear that bitcoin users won't fall for their wickedness and the manipulations they impose on the world using fiat inflation. Aside from the economic aspect in terms of money. The world still suffers for the pains war brings to us, whether as a libertarian or a capitalist.",

Something like 2008 crisis has to happen first. Besides, cryptocurrencies have their own issues too. We have centralized altcoins that are worse than centralized fiat.We have loads of shitcoins that are useless.We have bitcoin that is too volatile for people to do a full migration from fiat to bitcoin now.",

When Russia has destroyed muslim nation Syria by siding with dictator and changed the tide? On the other hand Muslims from Syria and Chechnya are fighting alongside Ukraine to avenge the Russian involvement in their internal affairs and installing a puppet in Chechnya and crushing the revolt in Syria?Quote from: Fullbear2222 on December 06, 2023, 03:47:56 PMAnd a lot people hate now Fiat currency the fiat has become obsolote and many people will openly welcome crypto and USDT to get freedom on their Hands.Don't consider USDT as a crypto currency as there has been so many conflicting news about them and Tether can fall anytime as they are yet to prove that they hold the reserve equals to the supply and they are publishing their own audit report to fool people wherein it should be done through a 3rd party.

Only bitcoin is the viable option.Yes, you are right about that, There is no Financial freedom by using centralized coins like USDT or even other stablecoins.A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency created to offer price stability reserved based on Fiat Currencies.But it's centralized and not really decentralized like Bitcoin.Seeing many Altcoins that use POS such as ETH which moved to POS to become semi-decentralized.Unlike Bitcoin, which still uses POW and it is completely Decentralized.",

No. We have to keep on living and moving on because we're still alive and that's why with the next years to come, there could be some more interesting retrieval and redeem that shall come.",

They get angry at the fact. They rant about how their money has lost so much value in so quick a time. They normally direct their anger at the government. Sometimes, they also direct the same at the capitalists. But seldom do I hear angry remarks particularly directed at fiat money itself. News about hyperinflation are highlighting more the government's failure to maintain a good economy. I haven't heard of similar news questioning the fundamental structure of the fiat system which paved the way for these problems. The fiat system necessitates these problems. For as long as money is tied to the government, abuses and problems continue to exist.",

The old system and the new system raise different problems and we should be able to adapt them so that we can face normal life like many people.Talking about the old and new systems it's affected by age and modernization. Democracy has been around for years and has not evolved, like the days of plutocracy, tyranny etc. With the effect of socio-economy in the life of the society or a nation. Politicians use it as a means of melting the hearts of citizens to vote for them and put them into power. Then these political parties fight against themselves using rivalry to sugarcoat the reason for the disputes occurring in the country or nation. Since their goal is to commit atrocities on citizens, no political party will be happy or stay silent when a ruling party is oppressing and killing the economy of their country. It shouldn't be envy, but they're insatiable. When an opposing political party clashes with the ruling party, the economy of the nation suffers deeply. The people frown at the ruling party, relaying different allegations on them, blaming the problem in the country on the ruling party, and even vow not to vote them in on the next election. The evil plots of the opposing party on the ruling party work, and during the next election they'll use the economic meltdown, war, unemployment, and inflation, to assassinate the reputation of the ruling political party, such that the masses will vote them into the next administration. When the changes from one political party to another occur, the system of government changes too, just like the Americans have Democrats and republican parties with two different objectives. One cares for the livelihood of citizens while the other is more concerned about free-market capitalism, low taxes, etc. You'd notice that when the democrats are in power, the problem they promised to solve for the citizens of America can be altered by the Republicans, to curtail all their promises, which put them into power. On the other hand, the system of government changes according to the individual objective of the political party in the nation. Hence, the atmosphere of the world is controlled by the different political parties ruling a country. And most often, the opposing sides work strides ahead to cause chaos in the nation, so they can be elected in the next election. Aside from the fact people don't get to experience the achievements of the promises and objectives of the current government, if the nation's economy is balanced and the opposing party allows for peace, the citizens can easily get fed off one objective and go for another. Still giving the next political party a chance to rule again in the country. But, like I said, greediness has eaten deep into the political powers, they can't survive 8 years of no political power.",

Or the fact that those who come out see the problem of fiat restrictions, express dissatisfaction with them, and also do not change the difference because it will still continue and operate in the way it currently governs. I strongly support crypto, but that doesn't mean I deny the fact that solutions are still not fully applicable in the current world, and fiat is still the main tool to connect us together. Rather, one should not use the negative of one thing in conjunction with the positive of another, even if the problems in current society are not too harsh, people will still have to do other research together to bring specific solutions to life.The current chaos cannot be entirely blamed on the financial and economic system, it includes many problems that have been around for too long, either benefit or hatred. And it's not really clear that the move to fiat is the target here, I think the reason some people hate fiat is that they don't get the benefits from it, and those who do get the benefits or feel that material things are not too heavy feel comfortable in the face of current instability.",

It shouldn't be envy, but they're insatiable. When an opposing political party clashes with the ruling party, the economy of the nation suffers deeply. The people frown at the ruling party, relaying different allegations on them, blaming the problem in the country on the ruling party, and even vow not to vote them in on the next election. The evil plots of the opposing party on the ruling party work, and during the next election they'll use the economic meltdown, war, unemployment, and inflation, to assassinate the reputation of the ruling political party, such that the masses will vote them into the next administration.  I don't want to talk too much about the corrupt power exercised by the government through any party because the conditions that occur actually make people apathetic towards it. Political power has a good impact on a country and if it is able to run a good system then the country will also be good. But unfortunately the power that exists today is actually used by a handful of people who are involved in politics to destroy the truth for the sake of their group's interests. This problem is increasingly spreading to many sectors so that people increasingly distrust the government system and the greed shown by them causes the emergence of many problems that cannot be resolved.Banks lose trust in the eyes of the public and money increasingly loses value over time, the problem becomes more complete where people begin to have difficulty finding work to make money. Bitcoin offers a different solution, apart from hierarchical freedom and bitcoin can also be run individually without the need for other parties. This freedom makes people open to getting involved in bitcoin because there is hope that bitcoin can provide the best solution to the old system with its advantages.",

Fiat is still king and people still trust in the government that's why they're still standing tall and operating. Your Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency that you own still has to be converted into flats of your country before you can use them so throwing away fiats out of the window isn't an option yet.Inflation is making fiats worthless and the government is making matters worst but just because we see the fiats we have as worthless doesn't mean others see it the same way. People are still killing themselves working tirelessly to get those fiats because they need them to live. No matter what the governments does, people will still trust in the fiats and that's the reason they're still a medium of exchanges up to this day that they're basically worthless than they were in the past years. The best thing to do is to invest fiats in assets like Bitcoin and other valuable assets that can add value or retain the value of your fiats because keeping (saving fiats) aren't worth it anymore since fiats can be printed without limit making them not to have much significant as there's more supply coming into circulation regularly.",

      "body": "Even if we say we prefer crypto over fiat, no one will listen to us, especially the government, because they hold the power. They are in a position of authority, so they are the ones to be followed in the decisions within their jurisdiction. We may lose trust in fiat due to our situations, but we cannot deny that it is still the dominant form of financial exchange globally. Cryptocurrencies are gaining traction, and we know that there are many opposing views, especially from some governments and institutions, because it is still relatively new and unproven for them. Instead of focusing on the negative, let's be hopeful and proactive, like learning to manage finances wisely and investing strategically to help ourselves weather economic storms and even thrive during difficult times.",
