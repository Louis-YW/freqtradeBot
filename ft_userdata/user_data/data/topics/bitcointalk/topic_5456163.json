  "content": "umbara ardian has been posting content generated by AI on this forum. AI generated content is not acceptable here.I want to keep this simple. So.Here are some proof that he is using AI to write post reply. [ChatGPT]    Here's his recent posts. You be the judge of it. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=533996;sa=showPostsI did run some of his post through AI detector. But if I share all of them here, then this thread will be too long. Take some time to run them on your own and then decide. Tools are used from this post : Re: AI-generated post discussion thread: how to identify & report Thank you nutildah.",

Next time, report to mods or you post in the plagiarism thread and if the user is in a signature campaign, you may decide to report to the manager of the campaign. It seems that the campaign managers are the only people that have a rule on AI posting. The last time I checked, theymos is yet to come up with something.",

      "body": "I remembered the thread made by Royse777 regarding a particular campaign participant being accused of using AI to create quality posts.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454810.0In the end, no one can prove if the accused user is using AI or not because these AI-detecting tools are not accurate, and not reliable at all like @KingsDen said as well. TBH, it will be hard to detect which of the posts here are being created by AI or not, and knowing that these AI detecting tools aren't reliable, it will take time before we know which posts are created by AI or not with high accuracy.Maybe the best thing that you OP can do has been said by the users above already. Report it to the moderators if you believe that the users is using AI (but it will be hard to judge if it's an AI generated post or not). Either way, the accused user has been tagged with negative trust already, and I don't know what is the punishment of the user that has been proven to be using AI to post here.",

Another one that I can think of is trying to find if there's an emotion in the post, it's kind of weird but I think an AI generated post will sound more logical compared to someone who has written their own post, there's emotion in the latter because it's personal.",

I won't say he is not using an AI to reply. He is using it very comfortably and the mods should look into his post for further investigation. All AI written replies have a very similar writing patterns if you check them thoroughly.",
