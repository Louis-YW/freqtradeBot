I have concluded that I won't quickly put myself in doubt about what am being told or hear over the news but I will rather have a deep think over the information I absorb in my daily life. I will always take my time to think about everything QuoteDon't jump to the conclusion that something is false or that the Bible forbids it if someone claims that death and aging may be prevented. Make some research and give the subject some serious thought.If somebody claims that cryptocurrency is the future. Do not immediately label it a scam. Spend some time learning about the technology behind crypto.If you don't understand what is been said to you, don't make blind arguments or conclude fast. Just make research on it for better understanding and exposure. With that methods, you will be able to sharpen your intelligence on what can be possible or not.",

Crypto investment is one delicate investment so been extremely careful both in risking the funds and doing the research goes a long way to reduce chances of losing funds. Just like a wise proverb goes \"look before you leap\".Not all information on the internet are genuine verifying the authenticity of the site, how many visitors it receives within a particular time frame can give a clue of how others rate the project.",

      "body": "A problem would be this, once there's one crypto that will scam people, it will damage the entire cryptocurrencies and one of the major get affected is Bitcoin.  Because they didn't understand yet first how it will work, another factors also these, there are too many victims of Bitcoin double scams or in a cloud mining investment, and once they get failed, they called Bitcoin a scam. So I tend to agree with the OP, have deep research before jumping into Bitcoin investment.  I don't know about altcoins but it seems 1 or 2 of them are potentially good IMO.However, there's always progress that I've seen which keeps spreading awareness, and this might be the reason Bitcoin adoption also spread faster than before.",

I will always take my time to think about everything Agreed on the first part, but I am curious how do you get time to think about everything you heard on the news? I researched only something when that news interests me, otherwise, I don't give a damn about any opinions of people about the news or topic. Quote from: sheenshane on January 17, 2023, 10:59:31 PMSo I tend to agree with the OP, have deep research before jumping into Bitcoin investment.For me it was a quick involvement in bitcoin, my research was like- what is bitcoin and how can I sell my bitcoin? What is the current price of bitcoin and the bitcoin price chart? But now I don't call them a deep research",

In the foreseeable future fiat will remain the future of money (the same fiat that is not even money). Cryptocurrencies will remain an alternative.Fiat will still be Fiat and Crypto will still be crypto, and Crypto is always alternative or only optional. The main payments are still controlled by Fiat. It is still quite difficult to replace Fiat as the main means of payment, because in other parts of the world, Crypto is not allowed, while in other parts of the world, it is allowed with quite strict rules.Quote from: pooya87 on January 18, 2023, 05:38:30 AMBesides, majority of altcoins are indeed scams and they have no future to begin with.

Some of them survive and can compete in the crypto market, but many will just be forgotten and have no future. it will keep repeatingThe technology behind crypto, which is said to be sophisticated, also needs to be questioned. Do they deserve to be said to be the future of payments by claiming to be the best? In fact, it would only be useless trash. The argument that blindly arises may be because too much crypto has come up with the scam label.",

      "body": "Having a critical thinking about what is and what is not is a very essential factor to consider when making any form of decision, making assumptions is not quite advisable in making an opinion. You choose your choice rightly especially when selecting any form of coin apart from BTC. Other coins have their own values in one way or other while some are not advisable to settle for at all. That is why it is good to make our findings right and trust no one when investing on any form of coin, anyone can mislead you while you even know better than them. There are other articles and legends that can put you through any dark corners you think you ain’t getting right and once you get your facts right, you can proceed with your choice making.",

In the age of social media and instant gratification, it's easy to get caught up in the hype and jump to conclusions without fully understanding the facts. For me, It's also important to keep an open mind and not dismiss something just because it's new or unfamiliar. As the world changes and new technologies emerge, like a natural to feel a bit skeptical or uncertain. In other hand, instead of immediately labeling something as a scam or false, it's better to take the time to learn about it and understand the underlying technology or principles behind it.",
