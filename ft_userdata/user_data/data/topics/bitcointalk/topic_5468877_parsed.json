They instead call me 'grammar Nazi' which is incredibly offensive and also anti-intellectual. From this, I have concluded that we deserve another pandemic. In the past, I have advocated for biological laboratories to implement an inexpensive procedure that may prevent the accidental release of a pathogen that will infect everyone and make them really fat. Oh. You don't believe me? What about ADENOVIRUS 36? That is a virus that makes people fat. If you are fat, you may be able to blame ADENOVIRUS 36. Now I don't advocate for this anymore because people have been ungrateful and people have tried very hard to convince me that we all deserve another pandemic. And in the next pandemic, the vaccine will be in the ass.When you refuse to speak correctly in any language, I will not be able to understand what you are trying to communicate. You are no different than a hippo grunting in the jungle. Oh wait. The hippo is much stronger than you, and those grunts mean \"I'm gunna fukk u upp, n***a.\"-Fuck you-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

There is people who do not speak a language just perfect like you do but they still can be good people.I think it is more about what they are trying to say. Not just how it may look to someone with better English skills then you. And I do not wish for there to be another pandemic.",

You also should have put a comma between your dependent clause and your independent clause. I must have read your 'sentence' about 50 times, but I still cannot decipher its meaning. Hopefully someone will be able to decipher your 'sentence' in the comments to help me understand it.mich-So I just picked up a random book which is in Spanish. And in that book, the sentences begin with capital letters and end with periods too. There are plenty of reasons why people make grammatical errors (pure accident, non-native English speaker, lower level of education, low ability), but if you intend to convey a complete sentence, you should begin that sentence with a capital letter and end it with proper punctuation which is usually a period. The failure to capitalize and punctuate is usually the result of pure laziness.People seem to want a pandemic very much since they have been terribly ungrateful for my efforts to make sure that biological laboratories apply adequate safety standards. I have been the only entity advocating for biological laboratories to implement a specific safety standard, and since people have been ungrateful for that, those labs are not going to implement such a safety standard, so they will release a bug, and we will get another pandemic.",

I do not see why more people do not recognize this problem and what we can do about this. Or maybe you think I am the super-villian.
