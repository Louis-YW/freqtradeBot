If you're looking for a fresh approach to maximize your crypto profits, there are some strategies you might be ignoring1. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):DCA, as mentioned earlier, involves regularly investing a fixed dollar amount into a cryptocurrency regardless of its price.

Arbitrage Trading:Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences for the same cryptocurrency on different exchanges.

However, I personally prefer Copy-trading. It is a valuable tool in the world of investing, offering a way for individuals to access the expertise of seasoned traders and potentially enhance their investment outcomes. It doesn't matter if you are a trading expert or a newbie; it will do the work for you without any harassment or waste of time.",

It's not DCA obviously, I won't go for Arbitrage trading and most people don't, and as I don't recommend it, others as well don't, so mostly shortcuts in trading cause serious damages, they burn your portfolio and aren't reliable.Copy trading is also one of those trading strategies I really don't prefer, but as for the information purpose and educational motive, I do consider the strategies learning from seniors and top performers to create my own more efficiently. DCA is close to my heart, highly recommended for investors, part-time traders, and Newbies. To be a good trader I would say avoid the bottom 2 strategies.OP considers a better section selection before creating a topic and before posting as well, as this really belongs to to the Trading Section.",

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):DCA, as mentioned earlier, involves regularly investing a fixed dollar amount into a cryptocurrency regardless of its price. This strategy mitigates market volatility and encourages disciplined, stress-free investing.I will not count DCA as a trading strategy because it is used for holding purposes, and you will get good results in holding by following DCA while getting lesser returns in trading. Holding and trading are two different things. In trading, sometimes you have to break your discipline because the market is not following any, so why will we follow ours? We have to move and modify ourselves with the market. But in holding, we know the consequences, or at least have some idea, near 100%.Quote from: VicManton on September 29, 2023, 03:13:50 PM4.

By choosing a skilled trader to follow, you can benefit from their expertise without actively managing your portfolio.I will not do copy trading at all cost, but might get an idea of what type of strategy and tool people are using to make trades, I will only follow them to enhance my experience. But never will do copy trading by following an expert who might be trading with $1 Mil and I have only $100. That's not a good thing and newbies should know that. Overall, you have mentioned some good but pretty basic terms which I think almost every member of this platform must be aware of.",

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):DCA, as mentioned earlier, involves regularly investing a fixed dollar amount into a cryptocurrency regardless of its price. This strategy mitigates market volatility and encourages disciplined, stress-free investing.I think DCA doesn't fall into trading because with the DCA strategy you'll be buying each week or month some amount of an asset in crypto-currencies case we will be buying Bitcoin. It's a very successful method to increase your portfolio and with it you can have half or a full Bitcoin. Quote from: VicManton on September 29, 2023, 03:13:50 PM2. Swing Trading:Swing trading involves capitalizing on short- to medium-term price movements in the crypto market. Traders seek to profit from price swings by entering and exiting positions at strategic points. It's a more active approach than DCA but can yield significant returns for those who study market trends.This type of trading takes place a lot in crypto world and most of the traders are swing traders. The swing traders mostly focus on altcoins in order to earn a lot of profit per trade  due to the pumps that take place. Such traders are opportunity seekers and sometimes they can have losses if they trade wrong coins.Quote from: VicManton on September 29, 2023, 03:13:50 PM3. Arbitrage Trading:Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences for the same cryptocurrency on different exchanges. Traders buy low on one exchange and sell high on another to capture the price gap. While it requires speed and efficiency, arbitrage can be a profitable strategy for those who have access to multiple exchanges and can execute trades quickly.You remind me of Sam Bankman-Fried as that guy claimed that he use arbitrage trading to make a lot of profit during his early days in crypto world. I think this type of trading doesn't take place a lot these days because most of the exchange have bots that will check other exchanges price as soon as possible and will stop arbitrage trading.Quote from: VicManton on September 29, 2023, 03:13:50 PM4.

This strategy involves replicating the trades of experienced traders automatically. By choosing a skilled trader to follow, you can benefit from their expertise without actively managing your portfolio.Copy-trading is the worst form of trading because the trader isn't doing anything himself and is copying someone else for his trades. The copy-traders doesn't know trading and they only copy others and think that they'll earn profits with that action. These type of traders should not be called as traders because they don't really understand trading themselves and rely on someone else's trades which can sometime be the cause of huge losses.",

DCA would be everyone choice especially when you are not the so called \"professional traders\" which is very difficult because I don't think anyone actually achieved that height in a short period and you have to read and learn alot of article when it comes to trading but with the DCA strategy is pretty much easy, just buy with a little percentage of your earnings and hold for the price or coins to reach your specific target.",

Those newbies who are having a fresh start shouldn't do it when they're not aware of how this strategy goes especially with the unmentioned margin trading. It looks easy but it's not really because of how people are portraying that this type of trading is gonna make them lots of money. That's not the case and the problem starts when they start with having the hope that it is the strategy that will make them rich. No, it's not because they're likely to lose with every single trade that will do from it.

There is simply no reason or incentive to do so. Anybody who does, is a scammer and their incentive to share their so called strategies is somewhere else, for example a pumper who wants to artificially pump a shitcoin they are bag holding would tell others to buy that shitcoin so that they can make profit.Besides, even in best case scenario if you could find what the expert is buying you still wouldn't be able to do in different scenarios. For example an expert may buy a shitcoin but they know when to dump it and they will act quickly. But since you have no clue what to do, you will end up bag holding and lose money.",

And I know Bitget often display the traders success rates over time, which can enable you to pick right. You can also use a trader's strategy as an insight to build yours.",

Apart from that, don't invest all your savings in cryptocurrencies unless the fundamentals are guaranteed in Bitcoin. because diversity is the best hedge to spread it, stock market, property, precious metals, business, etc. because one day cryptocurrencies might crash massively and never return to their highs, who knows (but for bitcoin I don't doubt it)! if you have spread your Investments, you will still come out ahead! diversity, diversity is the key!",

If they use DCA with trading, it should be used only if their second entry price is about 30% lower than their initial one. DCA trading should be used only, again, with their own money, no loan, no leverage.If a trader already makes mistake by using leverage, don't apply DCA because it will cause bigger loss.
