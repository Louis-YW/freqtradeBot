The reference from your trust score that require you to speak in detail about every offer you will make, none other than knowing the level of risk in the distribution of business profits. It's fine if you choose privately, just reminding the Hungarians here (if any), if necessary it has to be verified by some people for the sake of transparency.",

Although I am living in Hungry for past 10 years - but there are so many scams around that I have lost all trust in people Have you lost faith in yourself? I ask because it is somewhat ironic that you talk about so many scams, and you promote one of them in your signature.Quote from: decodx on October 02, 2022, 06:57:43 PMIf you're really serious, why don't you tell us what it is you really want, then maybe we can get down to business, and maybe I'll tell you if I'm from Hungary or not.I don't know what it is about, but if the OP doesn't want to publicly define what it is about, then we can assume that it's not exactly something completely legal. He probably needs some documents for verification, payment to a bank account in Hungary or something similar.",
