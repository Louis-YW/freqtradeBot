For me, I prefer moving averages, BB and RSI which is enough for me.

Have a business you are doing. Trading is too risky to be taken as a business.

However, you did not seem to emphasise management which is the soul of the success and the safety of the account of any trader.And if I would advise, traders should be more technical in strategy than fundamental.",
