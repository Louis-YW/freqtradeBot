Especially the performance on kaspa is needed. Only if you think Turing are still good. They were old when they were released.You might get better response if you put more specifics in the subject if you're only interested in kaspa performance with CMP.",

Especially the performance on kaspa is needed. It is necessary to assess the condition of the video cards and the purchase price and the cost of your electricity are very important.https://hashrate.no/gpus/cmp90I am looking at buying only new video cards in order to mine them for at least 3 years. If you have ideas how to quickly pay for these video cards, then you can buy them. But it's easier to sell a regular video card.",

Especially the performance on kaspa is needed. It is a relatively old card but as long as it can provide you like the hash rate of over 500 Mhsh and if you are in for the long run but not for the quick buck,then it is not that bad of a card.It was released in the year 2021 and is a relatively good card for mining but you will have problems selling it as most people do not buy these type of cards and favor other type of cards.In my opinion if you get these cards cheap enough and if you want to accumulate much KAS then go ahead and buy them as even the power consumption is not that bad.",

As far as I know, these cards use the GA102 chip, it's the same as used in 3080 and 3090Here you can see the list of all gpus using this chip (CMP 90hx included): https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/nvidia-ga102.g930It's not too old, but it's the generation of 3xxx, and it's not an easy gpu to resell like any other standard GPU.If the price is very good and the electricity is cheap, maybe it's worth it, but you have to do the math with your friend.In general, I think there are video cards that can be better these days. Like the Nvidia 4070 that will be released in a few days.",

They tend to havehigher end chips, single slot with blower for denser installation, better drivers, but louder and need some coolingassist as you would expect to have in a data centre. A series are generally clocked lower for better reliability.Oh, and they're more expensive.",

But you can´t overclock this cards.The CMP cards was dead on arrival in my opinion. I never saw a real usecase - i mean they cost so much and you get no benefits from this extra cost.",

In the middle of a supply crunch where did they find all these chips to build them?Obviously they were picking through their garbage. It's not the first time they've used miners to unload their junk by branding it as \"mining GPUs\".",
