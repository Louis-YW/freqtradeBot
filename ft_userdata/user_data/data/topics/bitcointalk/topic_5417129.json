  "content": "We live in a modern world, and it is the responsibility of those who are educated to educate those around them, because not everything in this life is learned in school. Aside from attending school, there are numerous ways to learn. We wake up each day and see new things, so learning is all around us.In 2016, a friend of mine suggested that I come and invest in Bitcoin; I was shocked, and I told him that I would not. I thought it was all a scam, and I don't like online stuff because I don't believe in it, so I told my friend, \"Okay, since you said it's not a scam, teach me about bitcoin.\" I did some folder research on it and discovered that it is true. My friend introduced me to bitcoin. I began learning how to trade it, and from there I began investing in Bitcoin. My investment gradually grew in my favor, and I began to enjoy the fruits of my labor. I was so surprised when my people transferred the thought I had for my friend before I joined to me. I started spreading the word about bitcoin, and while not everyone believes in it, it has made me less suspicious. Even now, most people believe it is a scam. I noticed that some of us here are raising awareness. No, charity starts at home.",

And then some members who had businesses online and offline accepting bitcoin as well to raise awareness.So there is a lot of effort that we can do, we can even talk to our friends around or even have small talks. Not necessarily about the benefit and what not, but just introducing bitcoin to them and wake up their curiosity about it is enough, in my opinion.",

From hosting an educational event to helping with a charitable bitcoin-related project, there's no shortage of ways for you to get involved. Here are a few ideas: Host a meetup, throw a party in your home, have bitcoin giveaways on social media or advertise locally. And who knows â€“ perhaps you'll even help a few people discover the digital currency that could change their lives!However, I don't really like to entice people to invest. I believe bitcoin is valuable and will continue to become more so. However, I don't like to try to coerce people into it, because ultimately they should choose their own investments.",

And with time, those who get interested will stay.",

I have no responsibility to tell them what bitcoin is, why I like bitcoin and how bitcoin works as an investment asset or currency. They are responsible for themselves and their knowledge unless they approach me and start asking questions.My uncle knows that I have invested in bitcoin or crypto assets, he asked me to do it for him but until now I haven't told much about how this works. I haven't had enough time to explain to him about the risks, but I'm glad he's interested in investing even if not in the actual use case.",

But I never invited anyone to join the crypto world, it's not our responsibility. My family and friends know that I am a part of crypto world, but I have no intention to invite them. I will let them have their own will, \"no coercion and no excessive lure\". I believe that everyone has their own interest, we only have the responsibility to help those who are interested in crypto. Since crypto investment or trading has a high risk, not each person wants to join it. For example my family members, they prefer to focus on a relatively safer investment such as gold, land, or property.",

Telling a friend use bitcoin is not community building.We live in beautiful times of information, bitcoin is available to everyone, for its use and its corresponding training. Actually if more disclosure is needed, obviously it is not easy as everything requires common sense,on this board there are several examples of users join action in that sense.One can get involved with their community and try to spread the idea, I repeat the idea, it is not necessary to use the adjective \"teach\" or set up a little school, that is in a certain way the best way, but there is not even one for Fiat money, speaking in simple neighborhood terms, from day to day.It's a myth after 13 years to think and want to live in \"I don't talk about bitcoin\" it's dangerous, etc. It's not like you're going to wear a badge that says \"I have bitcoin, ask me how I did it\"...The silent discourse grows day by day despite the fact that there are still people who think that talking about bitcoin is dangerous, shit! ... yeah of course it is like talking about fiat money or having a $500 iphone in your pocket, a rolex or having a nice car.In our condo someone suggested pay with USDT, is not bitcoin!, but the jargon is beginning to spread, so it will be so common, that then we will understand the true utility Â of the process to get involved and do something.We have in our local board a thread that deals with neighborhood businesses that accept bitcoin and it is incredible to see communities where there are bars and people meet to talk about bitcoin and pay with bitcoin, there are not many but they exist, let's say that every time this grows and grow more.Many users think why I have to do it, it does not matter, there is a part that does try and sometimes they are truly passionate about the premises of bitcoin.Bitcoin is revolutionary but the truth is that it has few soldiers to divulge its premises, that is if it has many \"five star generals\".",

For, crypto is still considered a debatable matter here. So, better to avoid the situation and only focus on what we are doing. In another case, I only ever do it to my family only, it is also if they are asking me at first about cryptocurrency and they want to learn about it. SO, I will not tell them at first or get them into this crypto world if they don't ask me at first.This is because not all people can accept cryptocurrency, not all people can accept the risks of crypto investment, and many people around me only focus on what they can hold and look to earn the money, so most of them will not risk their money into this kind of digital inevstment. This sis till hard here, but at least, if they are asking, we can tell and exlain them as possible aswe can without forcing them to invest.",

This is exactly the kind of testimonies I read all over the forum.Are there no people that discovered bitcoin not because of the profit they will have in it maybe because of the privacy, because of your ability to control your money by yourself without a third party and because of trying out a new method of finance?Â  If bitcoin stop producing profits are we all going to leave the cryptocurrency market?

      "body": "Honestly, I'm very hesitant to encourage people to invest in Bitcoin. I literally got asked the question today by someone in the family. I basically said I wouldn't advise so. Since, I believe it requires a lot of knowledge to actually learn about Bitcoin, and by the time you've learned about Bitcoin, you don't need to be asking that question. So, my default is I wouldn't advise it. Ideally, I should be telling them only with the right knowledge, but the questions I get asked are usually off the cuff, and not a great deal of thought put into it. I'd love to educate others on Bitcoin, but I don't think my base level of knowledge is good enough to do that. Bitcoin is complex, there's no way around it. Fiat is also complex, but at a consumer level it's relatively straight forward because we're introduced to it from a relatively young age, and there's a massive effort by companies to streamline it. Currently, Bitcoin doesn't have any of those things, and therefore it's a new concept to everyone, whereas fiat is basically second nature. So, yeah I definitely don't grasp a few concepts, and I wouldn't be comfortable teaching anyone about Bitcoin, when I don't fully understand it myself. Don't get me wrong, I have a fairly good grasp. I've been here nearly 10 years now, should I should do. However, there's a few concepts which I might understand from a consumer point of view, but teaching that in a comprehensible way to someone else, I don't think I'd be very good at. Teaching is a skill, we aren't all teachers when it comes to the technical side of things. As much as I want to advocate its use, I also don't want to be the person to advise someone wrongly.",
