  "content": "I say make I update our people as Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) Don approve the same short codes for all networks wey dey our country. As e be now, you no need to cram plenty codes for head again for the multiple sim cards wey you get. Once you know the NCC harmonized codes, everything Don set for you. Whether na MTN, GLO, AIRTEL, 9 MOBILE (Etisalat) the code na the same now for recharge, check balance, share airtime, borrow money, buy data and also to communicate with the customer services. The image below contains the short codes.How una take see this move by NCC? As for me the thing make sense die. No more asking about in case you buy another network sim wey you no dey familiar with their codes. NCC Don cover you already with this new development.Note: the previous codes for each network still dey active and working fine. You fit use the former code or the new approved code.",

Like this I been get GLO and Airtel omo these lines dey worry me to use because of how them get different codes but I believe say as them put am one place like this e go easy for us to use, but needs to be very careful while recharging or network because any slight mistake you fit recharged give another person using same line in another network.",

      "body": "This one na great idea and I really like am wella. Thinking and cramming plenty codes of different services wey you wan do for different sim dey very frustrating, with this life will become more easier in that aspect. One tin I go like make naija do for all this sim matter na for everybody to dey use one phone number for all network provider. Once you don get your registered phone number, you for use am for any network and can load recharge card from any network and use. This will help solve issue of network failure and can help minimize theft that mostly takes place using this method of sim swap, one user operating many sims at the same time.",

And I don try all the harmonized short codes above using my mtn line and I can confirm say all of them dey work very well.Â  E go take small time sha for person to get used to this harmonized short codes, I for really like am say them give us one particular code wey go dey link to all these harmonized short codes, so that if person press am any time e go get this harmonized short codes for all networks.",

Sometimes I go just vex because to get easy access to wetin u won do na problem until u use google search.NCC don do well to think and see all these network providers with different code say na big problem to their customers. I remove cap for them for this new initiative wey dem come up with. I don save am sharply so that I go fit dey use am before the code to enter my brain.",
