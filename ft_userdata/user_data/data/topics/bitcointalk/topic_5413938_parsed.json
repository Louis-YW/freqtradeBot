      "body": "We use whois guard for security concerns and to protect the website against hackers and attacks, that is why the information is redacted. However, you can access our information in the about us section on paypax.io. In order to gain more satisfaction and trust from users like you, we will refer your feedback to the security department to provide users with the information of the domain owner while maintaining security through alternative solutions. It worth noting that many popular exchanges such as FTX.com use whois guard to protect website and this does not mean that the business activity is not transparent. It would be a great pleasure if you share your feedback or questions about any of our services since we are here to answer.",
