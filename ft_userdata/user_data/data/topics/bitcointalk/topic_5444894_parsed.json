Don't exit into a centralized bank, but all of these options are better than exiting into a stable coin. Stable coins have no benefits, unless you're trading and have to pay tax for every transaction. Everything is better than a stable coin for an average bitcoiner who doesn't care about making a few bucks by peddling bitcoin back and forth every day. Those who are worried about the future of USDC can stop using it and go back to uisng other options like cash, fiat money, and so on.",

What about the uninsured creditors? Their money is completely gone and there isn't any indication that they'll have remedy with the federal government (not that I think they should). The issue this creates is that there's a lot of companies out there that don't have liquidity who need it. If the economy's in major stagnation, so is Bitcoin. The immediate price increase of BTC over the last few days is a response to the banking crisis and people not knowing where to put their funds I'd imagine. But long term the consequences are negative for the overall economy.",

So it's hard to tell were the price will be when this drama is over.I think there are reasons to be concerned, because Bitcoin market is very reliant on banks and centralized exchanges to provide liquidity. So a failure of a bank that has ties to crypto market can not be good. But maybe the narrative \"banks are falling, plan B!!!\" can push the price upwards to compensate for that. Time will tell which force is stronger.Bottom line is, now is not the time to panic sell, nothing about Bitcoin is being fundamentally challenged.",

However it's what these banks were actually offering in the background which might be harder to replace. Few \"traditional\" banks want to go anywhere near cryptocurrency because they've been stung by all sorts of money laundering accusations in the past. Silvergate, more so than SVB, tried to gear up their whole client base around cryptocurrency solutions and it was working in fairness. However they bought a lot of bonds that paid small amounts which means they are much harder to sell when governments are selling new bonds with much higher returns connected to them. Just like the 2008 financial crisis, nobody knows quite if the contagion will spread or where damage will pop up next.",

Its simple yet very true  if you guys don't like it just stay away. yeah trading futures is usually using stablecoin but there is centralized exchange that use altcoin as collateral. and SVB collapse has an impact to crypto even this only small if you notice almost all stablecoin is de-peg from 1$ when SVB collapse. and bitcoin had little shock too.",

Your case has strengthened my reservations regarding secure coins as a cryptocurrency supporter. \"Stable coins\" are a simple, dangerous alternative to Bitcoin. They're only as useful as their value. They are not decentralized and not as safe as cryptocurrencies, one of their main selling features.

I wasn't that so little was covered.I suppose that makes the dynamics of a bail out more interesting because the Biden administration has an interest in making sure the economy doesn't prolong into a greater recession than it already is. It was his economy that resulted in federal interest rate hikes after all.Of course the moral dilemma of bailing out the banking industry after their own bad calls is another story. IMO, no bail outs to the unsecured creditors.",

Due to this fact, we are going to have crypto people reacting as if we are dealing with something that will be killing fiat so they will all go into crypto instead.
