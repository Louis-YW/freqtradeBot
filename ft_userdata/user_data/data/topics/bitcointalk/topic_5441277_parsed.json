I don't expect big movements up or down, although something can always happen that we don't foresee now that will make the price move a lot. As we get closer to the halving, I would expect to gradually move upwards and above the $30,000 barrier, although the bull run does not usually happen until a year later, but this price is very cheap and most of the bad leverage has already been liquidated, so the medium to long term trend that I expect is upwards. In short, I think we are likely to stay between 20 and 30 thousand for this month.",

Its almost 50% price difference between 20k and 30k  Its already a sort of bull run if price goes to 30k from here.Quote from: CageMabok on February 26, 2023, 07:14:13 AMThen what about you, is there another understanding of the recent Recession and Correction of Bitcoin prices?I agree with your points. Price started to behave differently starting this year. It seems like majority of the ppl sold everything and the bots are helping to build most of the PA now. And for the recession part, I believe this will go up slowly upto 32k and then a flash dump like covid ?! (upto 15k again), followed by a full strong bull run thereafter to new ATHs.This is the most probable and deadly situation which arises in my mind  But this is not what is going to happen in march imo, maybe will take another 6-7 months?",

Then what about you, is there another understanding of the recent Recession and Correction of Bitcoin prices?Spring has more often than not been positive for cryptocurrency. I don't pay attention to the weekly death cross, it seems to me that these are fears for crypto investors. I think the current price correction of all cryptocurrencies will continue in early March, but in general I think the bottom is already passed and we will see new growth in cryptocurrency. Especially until China allows crypto buying again this summer.",

I thought when the Feds say that they are going to increased again that's why the prices goes down hard from $25k to ~$23.In any case, I think i March we might see some flash of $25k and maybe we will try to attempt another to get over that price and then maintain.However in the 4th week of the month, the price might reacted to price future expirations.",

Do you still believe in the word recession?We are in the midst of it still but market has their own cycle. Yes the bps rate really plummeted the price but it does show how scared some people for a lower level but turns out it did rally up to 23k. Not sure about the month of March but probably another rally again, cause reaching 30k is quite hard at the moment. Ive seen the price of btc being held up at 25k and from there we didnt break any levels means still too early. Maybe when we are close to halving we can feel the effect of a hurry run for btc price like the old historical information when bull run always on the go.",

Suddenly from 19k usd Bitcoins went to 25k usd, and gave us a big hope for the year. But last week, it’s really hard for Bitcoins. The price is fluctuating and Bitcoins trying really hard to break the 25k usd resistance and come out. If Bitcoins anyhow manages to cross 25k usd this month and touch 26k usd, then definitely next month we will see high graphs and green charts. I am expecting in March Bitcoins will at least come to 40k price range. Let’s hope for the best.",

For example S&P 500 has been dumping all through February, that's even despite the market makers' attempts at reviving the market with pumps in January.If this trend continues we could start seeing bigger bitcoin price rises in the coming months and possibly even going back closer to more realistic values for bitcoin than the current undervalued state that got stuck.",

Many people consider inflation and other things before making their investment decision, but that hasn't deterred some from jumping in and buying at every dips. A fair consequence is to remain optimistic about bitcoin, it will only improve over time and maybe we will miss the train if we doubt its potential.Sooner or later $23K will just be support for the bitcoin price which will jump up - and it's only matter of time before most people believe the bearishness has passed.",

A doji candle on a monthly timeframe always results to a change of thread which is bullish to bearish base on the current price condition.TA wise, March will be another bloodbath but the CPI results is a wild card to change the direction of the trend since FA is more powerful than TA in time like this that the price is currently in sideways.",

In the current period, the price may fall to it in order to consolidate, after which it will certainly go up, and this is even worse if there is some very negative news. Therefore, keep in mind that you can buy somewhere for $ 17,000. I really do not recommend selling Bitcoin now. And I want to note that this forecast is just for familiarization.

Do you still believe in the word recession?Recession might still play a significant determinant of the bitcoin price movement in the coming month. So I wouldn’t be surprised if it affects the price this coming month. But my guess is that since it could still maintain this level despite the bad CPI data from US, holding on to the 22-25K range, then recession effects on the price movement will significantly and continue reducing overtime. If it holds this range, I foresee a price movement to about 30K next month.",
