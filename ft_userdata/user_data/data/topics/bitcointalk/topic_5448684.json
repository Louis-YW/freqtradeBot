  "content": "Crypto Greeting Cards Warehouse Clear-out AuctionCrypto Greeting Cards were the OG of uniquely design Bitcoin-themed greeting cards, and even included a wallet for BTC gift transference. The wallet assembly including a private key, a scratch-off layer protecting the PK, and the Public Address QR on top w/ serialization (Note: Early cards did not have the serialization).These two lots represent the remaining batch of cards. Production was stopped c. 2017 and there are no plans to ever resurrect the brand. VIEW HIGH-RES IMAGES HERES: https://imgur.com/a/gKMIGE5LOT 1- QTY: 250+ sealed cards - 19+ different designs- WALLET ASSEMBLY INCLUDED (SEALED)- INCLUDES ENVELOPE AND PROTECTIVE WRAPPINGLOT 2- QTY: 500+ cards- Approximately more unique designs than Lot 1 (i.e. 20+)- NO ENVELOPE OR PROTECTIVE WRAPPING- NO WALLET ASSEMBLY / BLANKSIMPORTANT NOTESThese lots are sold as-is without any warranty expressed or implied. Crypto Greeting Cards no longer exists and support cannot be provided. That said, they are pretty self explanatory! Also, I obtained QTY counts by hand counting, which you can imagine took a while. It is possible I was \"off\" in my counts, although I did my best to be conservative here in this post to ensure you are getting what you expect (i.e I counted 253+ cards but the listing shows 250+).AUCTION INFORMATIONStarting Price:Lot 1: .01 BTCLot 2: .005 BTCIF YOU WIN BOTH LOTS YOU WILL GET 30% OFF THE COMBINED AUCTION PRICEMinimum Increments:.0025 BTCSniping Rule:Bids in the last 15 minutes extends auction to a maximum of 15 minutes after the last bid.Auction End:Thursday, April 20th, 5:00 PM (New York time)https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20230420T17&p0=179&msg=End+of+Aucton&font=cursive&csz=1Shipping:Price varies based on location.

I’ll reply here as soon as I can take a picture, likely won’t be until tomorrow. Essentially the assembly is a Public Address QR with “peel here” designation and the serialization. You peel off that layer and there’s a scratch off layer. Scratch that off and you’ve got the private key QR. Aside from that, the backside has the Crypto Greetings URL/Name, and if the art was not done in-house then it has the “Designed by” designation as well.The assembled cards include an envelope which is placed on the backside of the card, all in the protective wrapping, which hides the Public QR info.Again thanks for the bid and I’ll take a pic as soon as possible.",
