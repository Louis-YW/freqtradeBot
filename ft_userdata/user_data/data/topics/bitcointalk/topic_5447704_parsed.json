      "body": "Signed message is something else - it's a simple and plain text plus a signature plus an address it was signed with. This will prove the message's authenticity, you can check in this thread if you're curious.OP_RETURN is nice, but the length of the data is very limited (80 bytes). Of course, you can add multiple OP_RETURN to one transaction.Another option I've seen was to create a bunch of burn addresses (addresses that together can build a long sentence and since they're burn addresses they're easy to obtain) and send some (few!!) sats to those addresses in a transaction carefully created to have those outputs in the correct order. Keep in mind that any money sent to burn addresses are lost forever.",

(7 if you're lucky)You can make vanity address using this tool: VanitySearch (Yet another address prefix finder)Then send bitcoins to that address and spend it as input of the transaction to the recipient of the message. Hopefully, the recipient will notice that the sender's address has a message.",
