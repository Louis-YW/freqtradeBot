Don't just be tempted by low MC and low supply. It has even become a law that tokens with a low MC will be very easy to pump or dump. There are tons of coins/tokens that have a clearer utility than Fan Tokens, so it's better to invest your money there than Fan Tokens.",

      "body": "I never invested in fan tokens but I guess those are almost the same as other altcoins. What makes them a bit different is probably their fundamental based on the club issues. Not really sure they will be secure enough to invest since the hype of most fan tokens are only in the launching of the tokens (first-time listing). After launching the tokens on an exchange for several months, then the prices of the fan tokens drop drastically. Honestly, I am worried to invest in fan tokens.*Please do some research first on them before buying: https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/fan-token",

But in fact, there is nothing to trust them all. I have invested in PSG and LAZIO, but I think that I made some mistakes on investing in them. But I am still holding the tokens because of no choice but to sell them for big losses. I still hope that the tokens can survive during this bear era and will have certain increasing development and price in the future. In fact, although they are fan tokens of big clubs, it doesn't guarantee that the adoption will be high and valuable enough. So, I think that you should do more research on them before investing.",

Investment in cryptocurrency has higher risk. Higher risk, higher potential profit.Nevertheless, there is potentially higher profit, there is higher risk so make sure investors do due diligent research before any decision, any investment. Furthermore, don't make decision to invest in any project with any promising utility. Because utility is written in White paper, in Protocol but to turn it into real products and have products work well since a main net launch to hype on a chain are different and very challenging.Bitcoin, Ethereum network had serious issues in 2017. In this 2020 bull run, we had Solana and what happened since 2022 shows that even they are a good project, backed by FTX exchange, there are big issues that are not easy to handle. Especially issues relate to protocol and technical drawbacks.Fan tokens are funny and even they have utilities, I don't put too much belief and capital into fan tokens.",

I wouldn't suggest you to invest even a single dime into any fan tokens. These are mainly NFTs and not coins in reality. So these coins don't have any utility unless you want to buy some official merchandise from the issuers. So these are bad choice for investment and holding. I am not sure what do you mean by - backed by Binance? none of these coins are \"backed\" by Binance. They are just using Binance chain and Binance doesn't take responsibility of the value of these tokens. There are thousands of token using ETH chain, does that mean ETH backs these tokens? Nope! So if you really want to invest, use the pioneer coins like Bitcoin, ETH etc. Not these fan tokens which don't have any utility.",
