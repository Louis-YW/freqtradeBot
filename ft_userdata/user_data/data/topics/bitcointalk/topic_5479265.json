Instead, make use of the forum url element to embed them .Also Most time forum members are not much of fans of topics of this nature due to the fact that most topics like this are just either some random news , or some kind of blog article.ETF to me seems to be stock traders scared of trading with Bitcoin. They hodl just for the benefits they get from using investment schemes just to gain from the Bitcoin ecosystem without actually investing in it.The article has a section which to be some sort of quote saying Bitcoin is an asset. Which I would presume true due to the fact that Bitcoin is gradually losing its P2P adoption especially because of frequent mempool conjestions.",

In fact, we have the opposite problem. People already complain about block space being too limited today (just look at any one of the hundreds of complaining threads started this year on tx fees) while Bitcoin adoption is still very early. When Bitcoin adoption is 10x or 20x what it is today, and bitcoin actual usage is 100x or 1000x what it is today, a million or even a few million bitcoin held in ETFs doesn't change anything to alleviate the block space crunch, and its laughable to say it would actually reverse the problem creating the opposite problem.Most transactions in the future will be done off-chain / on L2s, not because people will just be using bitcoin as a TradFi investment vehicle through ETFs (though obviously there will eventually be trillions of dollars of bitcoin held in ETFs), but because people will be forced off-chain due to transaction costs, which is precisely how Bitcoin was designed.Hayes is literally worried about the opposite of reality haha, doesn't make any sense.",

I just hope 95% of people in the crypto community won't sell their BTC to them. I believe Arthur made the demise statement because the CEX will be hugely affected",

Checkout the link: https://cointelegraph.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-could-completely-destroy-bitcoin-arthur-hayesAnd let me hear your thoughts  I disagree with the thought that EPF will destroy Bitcoin. There is no way Bitcoin can be destroyed just because a centralised ETF is available in the market. Every precious metal has multiple ETFs, did it destroy the physical precious metal market? Not at all! Rather the most concerning issue is the height transaction fees. If that isn't fixed soon enough, Bitcoin will surely suffer from decreasing adoption rate. Bitcoin is mainly used as an investment but some people definitely use it as a payment method. The transaction fees is a pain right now. That needs to be fixed on priority by expelling the ordinals from the network.",

Those who are interested in buying ETF are only those who wanted to buy but were legally denied the ability to do so, like some pension funds, but how many of them will decide to do it after that one fund lost money on FTX?So, this is a valid point by you and total fear mongering by Hayes.

How many small retail investors who want to buy their first $1k worth of bitcoin will pay 5% of the transaction to move it to a private wallet? Not many, but Hayes doesn't care.

In my opinion, what would be the demise of Bitcoin are ordinals.Bitcoin NFTs should never have been allowed to happen on the same network as Bitcoin. It has made things so difficult for the average Bitcoin user to use Bitcoin. This discourages people from Bitcoin because transactions because expensive and take more time.
