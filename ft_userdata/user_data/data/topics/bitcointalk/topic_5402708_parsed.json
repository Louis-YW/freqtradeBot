Not listed on anywhere and i guess if that was a new coin. This unpopular coin doesn't seem to have a good future. I consider from the popularity as the main thing to attract the hype to come and this coin doesn't have. You shall not expect something big to happen with this coin after listing. The future is bad. Quote from: tokyohd on June 15, 2022, 10:23:50 AMOJA Coin (OJX) listing on Coinstore exchange in 17th may. Coinstore was a small exchange site with low volume. Can you expect something big to happen after coinstore listing? I can't even expect this token has a good price after trade.",

OJA Coin (OJX) listing on Coinstore exchange in 17th may. Is it 17th May or 17th June? OJA Coin Blockchain future is \"goor\" or bad? I think correct spelling will be good.We have been waiting for a long time for the listing of OJX. However, I think OJA has delayed the coin listing. Because it's a new blockchain. Now investors are busy managing their portfolio. Because the downfall of the market does not seem to stop. Doing well in this situation will be very challenging for OJX Blockchain.",

When opportunity comes of course I will swap, but I won't get too excited about it though. Yes they do have their own blockchain, but they're still far away from impressing the big communities there in the crypto and blockchain space.",

We didn't even know how good or bad the performance of this coin and you guys called that as huge potential which is not even make sense. people rarely known about this coin as well. It's too early to say that if this coin has no potential at all. Another coin in the market is far better rather than this coin. I think that oja was not a good coin even if it was using its blockchain.",

But this does not guarantee future success, because there are many such projects on the market. I've scoured some analytical sites and there is little information about this coin. It is not known where it is traded and who invests in it. As long as this project does not get proper attention from funds and large investors, no one will be interested in it, even if it is a million times more technologically advanced than its most popular counterparts.",

But just like what they said if you want to risk on investment you should have to do your research and base on the replies above this just proves that they aren't worthy yet.Better seek a profitable one that will give you a good result in a long term time just like Bitcoin. Enough with the altcoins that's just good at the start because of the hype and consider to invest only on a profitable one that has proven itself for a long time.",

But I was wrong with those choices that I've made and that's why, research and analysis for projects is important so that you get the worth of your buck.You just can't be a believer this time without any supporting basis but you need to have strong reasons for you to tell that this and that are good projects with such potentials.",
