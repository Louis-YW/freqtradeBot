I've heard about this but I don't know so much about it..Yes, if you want your transaction to be confirmed as soon as possible, you have to pay higher fees. See here[1]. I'm not sure which wallet you're using, but not all wallets support LN. If you want to experiment with it, I suggest you go with Bluewallet. It's pretty simple to use.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on January 11, 2023, 09:06:22 AMApart from Bitcoin is it fine to add other coins as a means of payment in your local business? Is this fine or it's better to stay with Bitcoin only. It's up to you what you want to accept. If you're planning to use a payment processor and automatically convert your crypto to fiat, then the more the better I guess... otherwise, you should probably focus on what you're interested in holding. Here's a list of payment processors[2].[1] https://mempool.space/[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5259548.20",

We don't talk about gas fees in relation to bitcoin (we just talk about \"fees\" or \"transaction fees\").But to answer your question: as a \"normal\" user, you can pay a sufficiently high fee, so the miners put your transaction into the block they're trying to solve instead of someone else's...  If you don't you'll have to wait untill all transactions with a higher fee (in sats/vbyte of transaction data) are gone from the mempool (or at least untill a miner decides to add your transaction to the block he/she is trying to solve). If you pay to little fee, there are ways to solve this... For example: by paying a miner directly to include your transaction, by executing a CPFP or by bumping the fee (in case you opted in RBF).The rest of your questions were answered by OmegaStarScream",

When the mempool gets congested the higher the fee the more enticing it get picked. Other than that you can just use the RBF method although not all wallets have it.

Is this fine or it's better to stay with Bitcoin only. You just raised a topic of concern as regards transaction fee. This is what most people do not understand. Some are yet to get it clear how transaction fee works and why does most  transactions take much time to scale through. As you have said that is how it works. The higher the transaction fee, the faster the transaction scales through. It depends on the fee request from your application from which you are carrying out the transaction but if you want to set the fee in the higher side for your transaction to speed up very fast it is your decision and will to do so.The issue of adding other networks to your acceptable means of of payment is up to you. But if you are choosing, note that bitcoin has a strong base compared to others and also the most popular amongst other coin you hear about. There are other stable coin out there but for me, I will prefer to go with bitcoin as my own means of accepting payment for services rendered.Quote from: Plaguedeath on January 11, 2023, 09:30:03 AMIf you want to learn about lightning network, you can read in this thread Table All Lightning Network Threads In One Place.You can as well check the above Link as being posted by the other poster to know more on the lightning network.",

This time around with a higher fee so it get picked fast? Very simplified, this is the basic mechanism behind RBF... It's basically a flag that's located inside your transaction that indicates that it's fine for a node to kick the transaction from it's mempool if it receives a transaction double spending the same unspent output... It's a little more complex than this, but this is what it basically boils down to",

Bitcoin blockchain has its block time in average about 10 minutes per block. Sometimes it can be seconds or a little bit shorter or longer than 10 minutes. You only can increase your transaction fee by fee rate (bump your fee with Replace-by-Fee) or use Child Pay for Parents in rare cases.

Is this fine or it's better to stay with Bitcoin only. About the first question, it has been asked and answered many times on the forum, and to avoid repeating what has been explained many times, you should just get the seeking knowledge from this link of a thread created by @Charles-Tim: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422456.msg61326135#msg61326135And for the second question, this depends solely on you as a business owner. You might use Bitcoin or altcoins depending on your take on the speed and transaction cost of the coins. But in all you do, make sure that you accept only the popular coins that would be easily exchanged for other coins or fiat.",
