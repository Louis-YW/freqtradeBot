For me, it's to stick with 2-4x leverage with which I tend to do good, don't allow greed to enter. 2x leverage is a safe one to use and 4x leverage is starting to be very risky. The bottom line is when a trader touches leverage trading, initially he will use low leverage like 2x but later he will come to a point of uncontrollable greediness so that he will use higher leverages like 4x or 10x or maybe 25x.You are an example of uncontrollable leverage taking because of the market volatility when a trader sees chance, takes higher risk, bad ending will come.My advice always is, don't touch Leverage if you want to be safe.",

But for altcoins, I go for 2x which I am still afraid of at times, especially if I want to open the position for a long period of time. Sometimes I prefer to just use 0.5x to 1x and not going beyond that.",

You’re right on the fact that it's a good lesson for anyone involved in crypto trading, particularly the significance of dealing with risk and not giving in to impulsiveness.While the recent market dip might seem discouraging, it actually presents an excellent opportunity to invest. Especially in altcoins and bitcoins. With many cryptocurrencies currently undervalued, this is a chance to accumulate assets at lower prices.That’s what I do via  diversifying and rebalancing my portfolio. It’s a way to accumulate while keeping your initial investment while DCA bitcoin gradually.If you have any questions you can contact me via my Discord: https://discord.gg/2TFSrzunK3",

That's sad you were also liquidated, actually millions of dollars were liquidated due to that quick dump, which you can see in the pic below, when I woke up today, and I read the news on a telegram channel that BTC made a downtrend move (unexpected one) then I was shocked because it should not occur in the first place, till now I did not see any legit reason behind it.Well, the point is this was so quick and almost $377.98 million were liquidated. The crash happened on 1-hour candle and it really made people sick, you must be frustrated too, I will say it was not your mistake to go for 10X it was just that luck was not on your side and now you think this was your mistake but it is good to find mistakes in yourself so when unexpected things like this will occur you can manage risk so your money can't be lost.",

Well market is really a traitor and we must deal with it. Usually market trnd to correct at a least time we dont expect it. Like today the market crash that instantly without any sign of it and many got liquidated even the bull seems knocking already. Anyway leverage trading is risky and dont really do what you cant deal with cause it will hurt you that much.",

Is it really greed though?I mean, he followed his analysis and rightly so, it just turned out to be wrong. If you saw him making that decision yesterday would you have stopped him? Because to be frank, it wasn't a very stupid thing to do. Bitcoin price kept pumping, one would think it was chasing $50k before the end of the year, and then all of a sudden. So can you blame him for that and call it greed?Quote from: pawanjain on December 11, 2023, 05:07:13 PMStick to your strategy because that's what you have planned and you shouldn't change it out of emotions.Good advice, but how long do you stick to your strategy even though changing strategies may take you higher? \"The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward\" isn't it? So how's he going to get a big reward if he doesn't want to take a big risk? I know he should not go beyond what he's ready to lose but isn't there a thin line between taking calculated risk and investing more than you're able to lose?",

Not only just that making use of higher leverage but also you should really be watching out on not make yourself that get easily dragged when FOMO hits. Well, we cant really tell if its already  that a bullish run or having that positive rally but always wise to assume that there would really be neither a fake out or simply having those normal corrections as always. The most common human being behavior is that they would really be just that buying on the time that the market is really making out those big long green candles and not into those dumping moments or red ones on which on the time that there would really be some reversal then they would really be finding themselves who get caught on the peak on which it would really be ending up for some people to whine along the way and mostly be ending up on making some cut-losses.When you are dealing up into this market then it would really be just that normal that corrections do happen and same goes with those FOMO and FUD which these things had always been that a normalthing for you to encounter. Thing here is that you should really know on how to deal with it because if you dont then you would really be that prone into lots or tons of mistakes.",

We recommend that the margin and leverage used in futures trading also be adjusted so that the liquidation value remains low. It is also important to note that even though we are in a bullish trend, there are several possibilities for a flash dump to occur, even if prices quickly recover and then increase again.

Sorry about your bad trading experience, well, you are at fault as well. You can't just assume that we are in a bullish season and start playing with futures trading anyhow, you get to be wasting money easily like that. Whether or not the market is bullish, you have to know that there will always be retracement/correction. This is why we should not only listen to what people say but also work with our brains and analyse the market often. Yesterday when you claimed you opened this position was even the worst day anyone should place a buy bet. This is evident in the overall market boards and I do not believe that the candlesticks of Chainlink could be bullish at that time, so why did you take the trade, why gamble?Also, you should not blame the leverage you used, blame yourself and the wrong analysis you made. Did you even analyse the market at all? Because if you do, you will know the right risk for the particular trade you are taking and know you are following the wrong path. And for a day that the daily candlestick was still bearish, you needed a very low leverage to try your luck, this is how you manage your account. It's until that time that you are so sure and the market is plainly in the direction of choice that you can increase your leverage so as to maximize your earning opportunity.",

And if you do not get the gist properly, even as I blamed you for believing in the prevailing sentiment and not analysing as you ought to, I still wanted you to realize that high leverage is still good and that you should not be discouraged by the initial failure but just be sure of what you are doing.Additionally, both low and high leverages are good and have their time of usage, and if you use the high leverage at the right time with the right analysis, you can be very happy with the result.I hope you get it now.QuoteIt's until that time that you are so sure and the market is plainly in the direction of choice that you can increase your leverage so as to maximize your earning opportunity.QuoteI think it's easy to say from hindsight.
