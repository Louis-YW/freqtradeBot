  "content": "1. My little darlings, I am lucky and honored to once again have a quality sponsor for this fun competition. I'm just making the rules so there's no dispute. Of course Bitmover will simplify the draw for us. While waiting to have the complete rules and the presentation of the prices (it's because I'm a little slow, but it's OK now, you can have a look at the the rules), I'm already giving you one so get ahead: you will need to make a quote from a well-known character about bitcoin (this can of course be an absurd assertion, a predictive or amusing quote, in short whatever you want). Once the quote has been written by another participant, you do not have the right to copy. If you really can't find one, look for one on this forum that you like. And if you really can't find it, give free rein to your creativity.I enter the names of the participants into the Bitmover magic tool only when they have given me a quote. => https://bitcoindata.science/giveaway-manager/Et merci à notre sponsor !!!!2.

Big deal.You know, there's a reason in business, why it's usually not the code-monkeys who get to make strategic decisions.Are you this annoying in person, or just online?I spent last week talking to some of the largest Bitcoin businesses (much bigger than Paymium/Bitcoin-Central or anything anybody in #bitcoin-assets is involved with), and they all want the maximum block size to increase.The poll in this thread says people support it by a three-to-one margin.It is going to happen sooner or later. I want it to happen sooner because Very Bad Things will happen if we get to 100% full 1MB blocks:QuoteAt 100% we're up at a huge 7744 seconds (more than 2 hours)! If the network were ever to reach this 100% level, though, the problems would be much worse as 10% of all transactions would still not have received a confirmation after 22800 seconds (6.3 hours). http://hashingit.com/analysis/34-bitcoin-traffic-bulletinI'm busy writing benchmarks, finding bugs in current code, and generally making sure nothing will break when we increase the maximum block size. If you want to be helpful instead of being an annoying troll, I have a TODO list you could help out with. Although the last time you agreed to help out, Dave, you didn't follow through on your promises (do you remember when you agreed to help with the testnet?).25. Quote from: F2b on December 10, 2023, 07:32:31 PMQuote from: Andreas M. Antonopoulos, The Internet of Money Vol. 2Bitcoin is not simply a system of accounting; it is the first digital artifact that provides forever-history, that provides true digital immutability. [...] It is a planetary-scale, thermodynamically-guaranteed, self-evident system of immutability. ​​Planetary-scale, because in order to do it you need to marshal resources that only exist in a planetary-scale effort.Thermodynamically-guaranteed, because you can calculate the exact amount of energy it took to create it and there is no shortcut. [...]Self-evident, because the number that is produced as proof-of-work tells you exactly how much work has been done cumulatively.It really is a monument.26.

As you are players I'll give you a hint (I don't know if it's good though). QuoteYou may have found yourself using the words “hint” and “clue” interchangeably, but did you know there is a difference between the two? The proper word to use depends on the context, but generally speaking, a hint is a subtle suggestion or indication, while a clue is a piece of evidence or information that can help solve a problem or mystery.Well I don't know if it's a clue or a hint",
