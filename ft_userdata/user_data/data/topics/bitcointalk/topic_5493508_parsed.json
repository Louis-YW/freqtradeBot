In terms of brute forcing, its almost impossible for someone to guess the combination of your seed phrase out of the 2048 words in the mnemonic word list, where the problem lays is arranging them in the right order so it's currently considered impossible for now. For now, you have nothing to worry about on how secured your seed phrase is but all you have to take responsibility of is keeping them safe yourself, hence it safe to a great extent.",

It is when like 8 words are known, and some letters in the other four words are known that the it might be bruteforce. So you have nothing to fear about anyone being able to bruteforce your seed phrase. Any seed phrase that have been generated cannot be generated again by 100 computers put together.

      "body": "Your seed phrases are safe just as you wish it to be safe. As long as the words as saved in a secure place without any word from the list been known, it is impossible for any brute force to actually crack it down. The seed phrase is said to be an encoding of 256 bits entropy that is there is 2^256 available seed phrases and at the moment nobody can brute force such thing. Watch this video to see how large the probability is,  https://piped.video/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unYThe only thing brute force does is to disc ramble the words with some of the words know. Quote from: karusell22 on April 19, 2024, 09:25:46 PMi have some wallets with 12 seeds and im a bit uncertain if its really safeIf you’re looking at maybe since it’s a 12 seed phrase, then a 24 seed phrase might be safer then you’re not entirely wrong because the 12 seed phrase provides 128 bits of security while 24 seed phrase provides 256 bits of security, which makes it assume more safe. But since the private key also provides a 128bits security then the 12 word seed phrase is just as safe as the 24 word seed phrase",

It means they are not connected to the Internet when you are using them to make transaction. But Ledgers wallets is one of the hardware wallets that I can not buy. You can go for the open source Trezor.Edit: not all hardware wallets are offline wallets. Read what LoyceV said about it. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5493508.msg63969475#msg63969475",

Even if you connect it to an online device, it will not reveal your seed/private keys.Ledger generates the wallet seed and signs transactions locally. Ledger live or whatever supported wallet software you connect your ledger device to can't see your seed, it doesn't need it.It's safe because the seed does never leave your ledger device.edit: after reading LoyceV's reply bellow, I don't believe it's appropriate to classify Ledger as a cold wallet.",
