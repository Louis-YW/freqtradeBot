It shouldn't take more than a few clicks with a CEX.5. You've got a few options:- BitOasis (local one that has been running for a few years)- CoinMENA (launched not a long time ago).- Rain.bh (Bahraini platform, licensed by the central bank of bahrain but supports UAE residents as well).I know that Kraken also started to support AED transactions at some point, but stopped like a month ago.",

      "body": "Anyone correct me if i'm wrong..1. Is holding & trading or both an offence?- Holding and trading cryptocurrencies was not illegal in Dubai. However, it is important to note that regulations can change, and it is always best to stay informed about any updates2. Do they tax or restrict on buying/selling of crypto?- No, there were no specific regulations on taxing or restricting the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies in Dubai3. Are there any DEX that support BTC/AED transaction globally or vice-versa? and5. If DEX are not available then which CEX should I use?- I am not sure about the availability of decentralized exchanges (DEX) that support BTC/AED transactions globally. However, it is possible to use centralized exchanges (CEX) that support BTC/AED trading pairs, such as BitOasis, Kraken, and Binance.4. How long does it takes to buy/sell Bitcoin in AED on a DEX or CEX?- The time it takes to buy or sell Bitcoin in AED on a DEX or CEX can vary depending on the exchange and market conditions. but i'm pretty sure it won't be much different with btc/usdt",

Otherwise you'll just end up using your trading profit to pay off house rent.Keep in mind that there are two sections in Dubai:- The foreigners' areas, usually concentrated around the free zones- and the rest of the city, where all the immigrants from e.g. nepal, bangladesh, and 3rd world countries with small pockets & try to earn a quick buck. You might find it hard to use your crypto there and it is not glamorous like the first section. Crime is also very real there, so keep your coins close to yourself.",

Dubai seems to be the most friendly bitcoin nation in the middle east. Although it is an Islamic nation it seems to be open to western culture and investment. The country has a zero percent crypto corporate tax policy because it wanted to attract more crypto investment to its economic space. The country is a host to over 400 crypto businesses and there is the presence of some of the best exchanges in the world. And this friendly polices have attracted many investment that has turned the country into a crypto hub. Moving to Dubai can be a good decision for any crypto enthusiast because there might be many employment and investment opportunities. But note that you need to do a lot of planning before relocatingÂ  because it is very challenging.",

If you are buying or selling on a centralized exchange, how long does it take for your order to be filled will depend on some of following contributorsTrading volume on that exchange, big or small. If it it too small, you will have to wait a little bit long to see your order to be filled if you don't want to buy or sell directly to available orders of others. If it is big, your order likely will be filled quickly.I think more about withdrawal waiting time on centralized exchange, it can be quick or long depends on each exchange.If you are buying and selling on decentralized exchange and if liquidity pool for that coin is big enough you will get good slippage and your order will be filled instantly.
