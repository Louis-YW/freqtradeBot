They didn't convince me fully, but made me no longer be too harsh on NFT per se.Then you come discussing exactly about such NFTs. My opinion about those? There's an image expressing it very good:Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 20, 2022, 03:58:57 PMPS. I have a feeling that this topic should be in the Altcoins section. Maybe you move it there...",

So I guess it depends on how the individual will look at it, for some this is just a hype, for others they can expressed themselves and who knows, their art might be good to be worth thousands of dollars.",

Not that I don't like NFT because of people who are taking advantage of it but because you can also earn profit but I think the hype will stop sooner or later.",

This is an overhyped project, and that’s why its value right now continues to suffer. If you want a good investment, I suggest not to buy any NFT for now and just get the good coins. I do have some and I can tell that its pretty useless, though I didn’t regret buying it but hopefully I can still sell this in the future at a profit.",

They are worthless now. However even though current state of NFTs seems absurd, tech is already being used elsewhere then just in collectables. To me laughing to nfts is same as to laugh erc20 tokens. Both can be pointless depending what you are building or if you are building anything. Personally i think that those monkeys and cryptopunks will become even more valuable as time goes on as they are part of culture history now. It doesn't matter if we like them or not.",

Please join the discussion. Tell me what you think about it! I'm really interested.For example - The bored monkey for 300 thousand dollars and Pixel cat for 531 thousand dollarsYes, NFT is very popular in the market and has a huge audience, and there are those who support investing in it and there are those who warn against going into it, but in my opinion, I see that it is a good investment through which you can earn double the price at which you bought the NFT after reselling it, but not all NFTs are promising and worth it you buy for exorbitant amounts, I see that any NFT acquires its value because of its characteristics and features that distinguish it from others, so it cannot have an equal, and whoever buys it remains the sole owner of it. Financial transactions in our days have witnessed great developments, and with time this new market that is buzzing with creativity and innovation will grow.",

Nothing beats the physical form of stuff, memorabilia, and collections. There is only one NFT that catches my attention and that's the special edition of NFT of the Golden State Warriors in the basketball league, NBA. But I didn't purchase any of it as I don't find it worth spending decent money on.Honestly, with those big NFT buys you have mentioned, I don't understand why some people are spending that much on something that we can't even consider as valuable or worth holding as a collection \"online\". I can't even think if those NFTs can make profits by doing buy and selling.",

There are some NFTs that are quality, it's just like having you own something physical item in the real world where that physical item is rare, with limited supply. We can use an example of some trading cards, like sports trading cards, and also some art that is made by some great artists in history.And on NFT, some of these NFT projects are doing it. But it seems we are still early for NFT, I believe later on, some people will change their mind about NFT.",
