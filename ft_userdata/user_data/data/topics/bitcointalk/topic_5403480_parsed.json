But the companies you meant, like Chainanalysis, also have more special tools they develop that they are using to make tracking more easy for them.Example is the use of wallet explorer, https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch09.asciidoc to know if a bitcoin address belong to an exchange.Another example is the use of blockchain explorer to check the transaction history of an address. Another is the use of central server to link many addresses belonging to the same wallet together and also link it to IP address used for connection.On-chain analysis organizations even run their own node for this purpose and also developing special tools to make more analysis possible and also make it easy for them.",

It has a higher metric data that you can use among them all like possible Bitcoin movement organically or even if that's manipulated by the whales or even mining difficulties such as high fees. There's a free and paid subscriptions but I think it's better if you'll try all the free and paid subscriptions.",

Like other block explorers, the service lets anyone view the history of public cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Chainalysis figures that bad actors would use its site to check transactions without fear of “leaving a ‘footprint’” on crypto exchanges, the documents said.But where the exchanges – and presumably most block explorers – have no eyes, Chainalysis has set its sights. It “‘scrapes’ the IP addresses of suspicious” users that fall into the honeypot of walletexplorer.com according to the documents.",

Most importantly is, this isn't the one the OP wants to learn but he is more concerned of trading or investing. If he have some cash with him, he can just pay some coders to gather the data's for him. That should save him from the hassle.Blockchain data's are free though and anyone can see it. If you have a basic understanding on how crypto works, I am sure that you can analyze the data that you see in the blockchain on your own but it was still up to you if you want to complicate things further. I rarely heard this on-chain analysis but we can add it on the current analysis that we are using (e.g technical and fundamental) in order to have a better winning rate.",
