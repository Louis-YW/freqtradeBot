I'll definitively put some ads there It is not enough to publish service ads only on freelancer sites, you must develop a marketing plan for your services, and you must engage in communities that are specific to your field (such as web development), such as specialized groups on social media sites, forums, etc. will help you gain experience from professionals in your field and get good work opportunities. It is better, as Shasan mentioned, to create a Portfolio or a personal website that contains your previous works, and my advice to you as a former Freelancer is to deal only with trusted clients. A contract in which the terms, the agreed amount, and everything are written must be concluded.Good luck to you, and I hope you find people interested in your services here on the forum.",
