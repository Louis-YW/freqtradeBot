They send a block template full of transactions right afterward, but a full block template is a bigger data transfer and takes slightly longer to reach miners.In this intervening time, which is usually no more than 1-2 seconds, miners sometimes get lucky and find a new block using the empty block template.",

Others will wait for a certain number of their nodes to agree. Do you give up the fees or risk the block? There is no proper answer, just an opinion.-Dave",

      "body": "Quote from: Baofeng on November 17, 2023, 11:29:15 PMAnd as per mempoolThat explanation is wrong. In general, mining pools do not send the entire block to miners, since that is unnecessary and wasteful. They only send the block header, which is the same size regardless of whether the block is empty or full. That is all the information the miners need in order to attempt to mine the block. The delay comes from the mining pool verifying the previous block, removing all the now confirmed transactions from their mempool, creating a new candidate block, and calculating the Merkle root for this new block.You can read my post in the thread apogio has linked above for a more complete explanation.",

If you have the option of earning a guaranteed $5, or the possibility that you will win $10 or $0 , it is wise to take the guaranteed $5.If we assume that the average fee is 4 BTC, then no one will risk the possibility of earning 6.25 BTC in exchange for earning 10 BTC or zero BTC.If the average fee rises significantly above 6.25 then we may see fewer empty blocks.",

It's not a case of a guaranteed 6.25 or gambling for either 10 or 0. Rather, they can earn 6.25 and still have the exact same chance to earn 10 from a full block next.They still have the exact same proportion of the hashrate and the exact same chance at mining the next full block, regardless of whether or not they broadcast their empty block.",

      "body": "I have also discussed this before but if done properly there is a lot of security hardware between the internet and your nodes and even between your nodes themselves.With minimal security you can get the information from the public internet to your node very quickly. With DPI and some other security in place you can add fractions of a second to it in both directions which when relaying between your own nodes can add actual seconds to the time needed. For 99% of the things out there you will not notice. When mining BTC you will occasionally have an empty block like this. Still better then not securing your network and getting hacked.....-Dave",
