  "content": "Hey. What's your pro's & con's with Windows 11? When I woke up today I noticed my computer had automatic updated and installed Win 11 from last night when I just clicked \"Download and update then shut down the computer\"-button.First I was like \"Oh no..\" I have been pushed this forwards a long time, but the omputer seems to run much smoother and faster, it's actually a quite big difference. So I am very pleased and I don't have a super good computer only 16GB RAM on my Windows computer.Pro's - Windows 11 is faster than Windows 10. However, some users is experiencing slow performance issue due to low disk storage or outdated drivers. Don't worry. It can be fixed easily- Windows 11 has better optimization and lower memory usage compared to Windows 10, with fewer system errors and no critical errors on either system.Con's - Windows 11 has fewer customization options compared to Windows 10. This may not be suitable for users who prefer a more personalized operating system. Windows 11 has removed the Control Panel, which was present in Windows 10. This may be frustrating for users who prefer the Control Panel over the Settings app.I am sure.. I missed a bunch of other's pro's and con's, whats your pro's and con's regarding Win 11?",

And most of the people that have years of potato PC won't upgrade to 11 because of this. It is not just fit and compatible to the hardware that we've got and it's not just all about having low disk space and drivers.But also the compatibility of the hardware itself like MOBO. It's nice if you can upgrade to that because all of us will eventually go there somewhere in the future because there's nowhere to go but to adopt the new version of windows.",

      "body": "I've only ever used Windows 11 in my VirtualMachine to play around with it. My current Windows PC apparently doesn't meet the requirements for upgrading. Being inside a VM and not a dedicated PC, this probably affects the performance quality quite a bit. But, incidentally, I've noticed Windows 10 is pretty fast too provided you kill all the unnecessary baggage that starts on boot in the task manager. The fact Windows 11 is better by default might suggest it's shipping with less bloat. My most major con though is the fact it's just a \"black box\" operating system. I prefer running Open Source wherever and whenever possible.",

You lost me there bro. NFW is right about the meaning of MOBO.There are MOBO's that don't support the Windows 11 and that might cause a problem when someone don't read what are the supported chips of the update with the MOBO they use.That will cause some hang, lag or other errors prior to upgrade from 10 to 11.",
