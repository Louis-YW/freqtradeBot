  "content": "These few days or even these few months it is certain that many bitcoin lovers have their hearts beating fast considering that the decline is always happening and the Bear Market is still being felt so many people who don't like bitcoin talk more than ever and people who are starting out in Crypto feel that their choice to be here was a big mistake.This is indeed very reasonable because the decline continues to occur which automatically makes our Portopolio decrease in terms of Fiat but actually this is not a real decrease in bitcoin, only the value has changed which makes a lot of people panic now.Early 2022 actually a lot of people hoped that bitcoin would become something very viable even many people speculated from the end of 2021 bitcoin will break through the $100k price but in this case everything seems to have to wait because indeed speculation can be right and not and now Bitcoin is corrected quite deeply because there are several reasons that exist in various parts of the world such as Fud, war, inflation etc. which makes bitcoin affected and continues to experience corrections there so that a lot of people, especially beginners, are willing to sell their assets out of panic even though it is certain that they have suffered losses.But actually if we look at the history in bitcoin's decade of journey, this has indeed happened several times and if we think rationally, selling panic at the current price is definitely not the right choice because so many people say \"Hodler is a Winner\" It is true.Noted several times bitcoin also experienced corrections like this even if compared to more severe than now but they bounced again and again which made many people especially long-time holders realize that this coin is more than Expectations.Apart from today, I will summarize some of the events that previously happened related to Bearish so that many people realize that Bearish is not the end of everything.1. 2011If talking about Percentage maybe this is one of bitcoin's most severe drops because indeed this year bitcoin which originally cost $31-32 they shot down only $0.01 on the MtGox exchange with bitcoin trading around $ 2 in the previous few months which means they fell drastically of 99% which is certain this is a large percentage.2. 2013This year I saw several sources who said that bitcoin fell 2 times and could be called severe in its decline and indeed this happened when there were indeed many investors who were attracting crowds and this is also still happening in Mt.Gox which at that time bitcoin had to down 83%.On the other hand, in the same year China began to act by banning its banks from handling transactions involving the virtual currency Bitcoin.this decision arose because at that time Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve said that bitcoin's rise was too fast and this was like a bubble which worried them because bitcoin was not supported by any state or authority.Even though this only applies to banks and individuals, they can still trade bitcoins by being aware of the risks, but clearly with prohibitions and regulations like this, bitcoin has decreased by approximately 50% there.3. 2017For 2011 and 2013 maybe not many people experienced this but for the year 2017-2018 it is clear that in this case it is certain that many have felt this downfall and here they did achieve ATH at that time but because there were so many people who reaped the benefits there which made them corrected back quite large and long enough that indeed a lot of people here have shared their memories here in several threads which makes this a worthwhile experience.4.2021This year bitcoin has become one of the most discussed topics, it seems because there has been a lot of talk from 2020 even because there are indeed many people who have been affected by Covid who have had to lose their jobs and livelihoods and have to stay at home due to a prolonged lockdown but on the other hand had to be demanded to get money so that their needs were fulfilled and bitcoin became one of the choices at that time so it did make bitcoin reach ATH only at that time, but after that happened not long ago a lot of FUD appeared like a frying pan. Environmental impact because there are many people who said bitcoin was not environmentally friendly and some FUD and Chinese news at that time made them plummet again and this is the first time I have felt such a tremendous downfall because indeed I have been in bitcoin since 2020 so I just felt like this.From all the things that I have written, of course, we come to know that bitcoin is not something that is safe because there are indeed a lot of certain obstacles that have occurred that make their volatility cannot be called a safe investment material here, but on the other hand, when you already know such risks and we have seen some falls now of course we are aware that this kind of thing is bound to happen because every time there is a bull there must be a bearish and we are aware of that. So, indeed, for those who have bought at a high price, there is no harm in becoming Hodlers, if they do not know how to take advantage of opportunities and are still confused about reading the situation and doing research, then there is no need to panic and sell because Hodlers are not something to be despised.As for those who still want to be here and who can take advantage of opportunities and have their own research, this also has an advantage because indeed this is another big discount and of course this must be used as best as possible so that we can taste something sweet at the end because of course investing is not There is an instant and current economic concept is to buy at the lowest possible price and sell at the highest possible price. isn't it like that?",

I just thought that maybe Bitcoin is mature enough to lose, say, 50% of its value, but not more than that. Apparently, it's not. The lows are of course getting higher after each ATH, but the percentage loss is still way too high. It just keeps falling down, and while sometimes a movement like this can be followed by a big jump towards recovery, I'm not sure it's happening soon. It doesn't seem like the bottom was reached because the price just keeps falling. And I really don't see any good reason for what's going on. But, well, we'll survive through this.",

I've been there before so i totally understand all this things  .So to conclude, if only investors can learn to only invest as much as they can afford to look away from for a long time, there wouldn't be a lot of panic and panic selling anytime there is a retrace in the price of Bitcoin or any other crypto asset.",

With the institutional investors that have come in, the price has only made a high of 3.5 times the previous ath, and all predictions fell short, including very sophisticated models like S2F.If we have bottomed out in terms of price, this is not going to be one of the worst bear market cycles, but it is another matter if for some event we drop sharply downwards and break down the lows again.",

It would be a very good discount entry and in next bull run, many new Bitcoin 'investors' will hope that they can time-traveling to buy it in this bear market.By believing, I mean truly believing based on comprehensive knowledge in Bitcoin and good experience with the market.",

Every time there was a bear market in bitcoin some people said bitcoin was dead which never actually happened. If one can invest in Bitcoin now and hold it until the market improves, one can profit.But there is no specific time when the market will be good. But I think you will not get such opportunity to invest in Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is down a lot right now which will go up very soon.

We can't deny it. That is why only certain people who already exactly know the value of Bitcoin that can survive due to this condition. Additionally, there are still so many FUDs that will never end. We cannot blame new people who are coming to crypto and feel failed because their Bitcoin rate to the dollar has dropped during this bearish era. They think that they lost their money. However, in fact, we don't lose money if we don't sell the BTC, because if we are holding the BTC, we can keep them and hold them until the bullish era. We are sure because we beleive that BTC will always rise up in the next bullish and we trust the value of Bitcoin.

But at least, if we keep holding the Bitcoin and wait for the Bullrun or a certain rate of the price, we will meet the rate as we expect.
