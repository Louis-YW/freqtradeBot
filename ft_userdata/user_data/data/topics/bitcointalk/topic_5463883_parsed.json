  "content": "Isn't it stressful when we spend more than expected, right? especially if we follow a budget, having a smart spending habit is a good way to avoid such situations or events.1. Make a realistic budget           In budgeting it is important that we consider everything. It should be realistic and achievable, It cannot be said that the budget is only 20$ for a week for food if you are 8 people who will eat at home. Plan what to eat every day and budget for it. Write down all the ingredients or how much to buy and how much it will cost in pmashae or gasoline if there is a car. Do everything with consideration and do it consistently.Stop yourself from buying things you don't need, like buying coffee at starbucks when you can just buy 3 in 1 sachet coffee that just tastes like coffee. Because if we cannot prevent such expenses, include them in the budget.2. Find out what triggers the cost            It's important that we know this if it's stress, boredom, pressure from friends, need to follow the trend and so on. It is important that we have discipline in these things if you want to avoid overspending. For example, if you're bored, you hang out online shopping at Lazada, Amazon, and others, this habit should be replaced with something more productive, such as cleaning the house and others where you can avoid it and do something good.3. Break down luxury expenses             Try to list the things you have spent and separate the luxury and the things you have spent. It is important that you know what is really needed and the word I deserve it.4. Make the 24 hour rule             This rule helped me when I was building in this way. Because when I want to buy something, I put it off for 24 hours, and during this time I learn how to assess these things. Usually the excitement we experience disappears immediately after a few hours. You imagine the sacrifices you will make when you accomplish them. Like the small savings you have or sometimes we will even borrow the money we will use here. At least in this way we can avoid impulsive buying or bursts of emotion.5. Set a budget            Allocate a limit on expenses, know all areas of expenses from food, rent, electricity, water, shopping and other things related to spending. Once you set all of your spending limits, make sure to follow them and do it because everything will be ignored if you don't do it.I hope this somehow helped us and the community here on the forum.Other source:https://www.incharge.org/financial-literacy/budgeting-saving/how-to-cut-your-expenses/https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/blog/how-to-stop-spending-money-7-tips.html",

      "body": "If people knew how many rich people use a budget and follow it, it would be something people would do more of. Many would be surprised because they think that rich people have too much money and therefore do not control their income and expenses. On the contrary, they tend to control them to the millimetre. There will be exceptions, of course, and if they're cradle rich they probably won't use it. Anyway, middle and working class people would do well to use a budget.

It's to track your expenses and find out what is happening and where your money goes. I would say that for people who don't use a budget, the first thing to do is to track expenses and then budget for the next month. Normally the first month you do it you will have mistakes and inaccuracies but if you keep doing it for three months you will have it pretty tight.",

This is very necessary and important insight especially for those who are impulse buyers. Sometimes we find ourselves swiping the card for goods we don't really have a use for but because at the moment the product displayed may look fancy and the price just fits. In economics, there are wants and needs and as such learning to use the 24hour rules helps to place our priorities right. Quote5.

But just to add, it's also important to set aside funds that can be used as miscellaneous Incase things go south as this prepares you for unforseen circumstances.

Later after running the PSU for a week it killed one of my GPU, I don't even know that the GPU was dead, until I went out and bought a better brand new PSU.I spent more money trying to save money.I still end up killing a GPU that's worth 300+ in dollars.If I don't cheap out on these I would save a GPU from death and still have the best PSU. If you can't afford quality things, solve your income problem, don't go around looking for cheap things because you want to save money, there is original and fake items out there and people who are hell-bent on saving every penny will become more attractive to cheap things.",

So many people dread or hate budgeting because we have been taught about budgeting the wrong way. When we write our budgets we do it like it is a document that restricts us from having fun or enjoying our lives. Therefore, defaulting on the budget is inevitable. When budgeting we should add nice stuff we need to get for ourselves and not make it look like some boring list of financial obligations to meet. If we plan right, we can throw in one or two of our guilty pleasures that despite being in there, our expenses remains on track. It is more than just being disciplined.

No matter how difficult it is, we have to do it if we don't want to be eliminated from this world because if we fall into a deadlock, no one will help us. Everyone is in the same situation, so we must save ourselves before we expect others to save us. But in addition to saving, we should find other sources of income to improve our lives better. We should not be too lazy and only know how to save to cope with the difficulties in life. Because at some point when inflation gets out of control, our savings also become useless.",

If someone does not have a lifestyle that can be adjusted and cannot manage their financial sources properly, then don't expect them to discipline themselves about financing money out and money in. The fact is that not all reality can be carried out with hope and we often see people fail to manage lifestyles well, finally all problems are left without a solution and there is no resolution formula that is trying to do and continues without a more directed concept of life.Back to each individual and how they can discipline themselves about expenditure, avoid expenses that are not needed and increase all aspects that can produce financial benefits. Making lifestyle is very important and the journey process can change and not the same, but in the end everyone hopes to be able to make financial conditions better and this is where it requires discipline.",

The logic is how he can avoid excessive spending and try to apply discipline to all that is expected.I don't mean to argue with the concept that you find from the source, but sometimes a tip that is made must do research on all people with their economic level.For me, these tips apply to people with middle and upper economic class and the authors of these tips rarely see how they apply to people with lower economic class.Never mind planning to save and avoid big expenses, sometimes they can't afford to eat 2 times a day.",
