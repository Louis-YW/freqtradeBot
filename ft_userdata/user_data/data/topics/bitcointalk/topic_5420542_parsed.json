It will unblock a corridor for civilian vessels that carry grain for the whole world.Ukrainians, together with donors from 110 countries, are creating the world's first \"fleet of marine drones\". Our first task is to assemble a fleet of 100 such vessels. One naval drone is worth - 250,000 USD\". Join in! https://u24.gov.ua/navaldrones",

Even their Army of Drones page has a crypto option. I hope the fleet page will get this button as well.",

Moreover it’s amusing to see that how various countries are already coming together to give a light to this project. I am not sure how successful it is going to be after seeing the aftermath of current math but just check the incredible technology that they have built. The detailing has been done very nicely. Hope so donations come by pretty well.",

I think that the developers will make changes in the near future. Nevertheless, according to Mikhail Fedorov, who is the minister of digital transformation of Ukraine, enough funds have already been collected for the first marine drone. It will be called Kherson - https://t.me/zedigital/2615.",

But besides the fact that they are Iranian, there are still a lot of questions. For example, how did microelectronics (including US companies) get to Iran? This problem of smuggling, or non-enforcement of the sanction, has been standing for a long time. I personally was at the disassembly of the Russian drone this year. Technologically and from the point of view of execution, this is true primitivism, but they also help terrorists to kill people. But inside there were also elements made in France. And Israeli modules.It is precisely because of their fake \"greatness\" and the animated \"achievements\" of the defense industry of the Russian Federation that they are not only miserable, but also really technologically backward. But this does not nullify the problem of violating, and systemic, sanctions, especially for such bastard terrorist regimes. It is probably worth taking penalties on manufacturers of components for dual or purely military use, whose components will be found in the products of rogue countries or terrorist countries. I think they will find ways to enforce the restrictions. Or will they pay...",
