Many people know that Monsanto saturates its grain with chemicals that are poisonous.Slovakian authorities to destroy 1,500-ton grain shipment from Ukraine due to toxic levels of pesticide contaminationhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-04-16-slovakia-destroy-grain-shipment-ukraine-pesticide-contamination.htmlSlovakian authorities are planning to destroy a 1,500-ton shipment of grain from Ukraine after discovering banned pesticides in the shipment.Slovakian Minister of Agriculture Samuel Vlcan announced on Thursday, April 13, that inspections have discovered high amounts of chlorpyrifos in the Ukrainian grain while it was being processed by one of the largest grain mills in Slovakia.Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate pesticide subject to a European Union-wide ban. (Related: Russia-Ukraine war could contribute to more severe food shortages, mass starvation for years to come, warns UN.)Vlcan noted that he first sounded the alarm over the issue of potentially tainted Ukrainian grain as early as July 2022, when he ordered Slovakia to tighten controls over grain imports coming from the country.“Even before we started placing seals on all transit trucks with Ukrainian grain, a relatively big sample of Ukrainian grain had been intercepted, and three independently accredited laboratories confirmed the presence of the increased content of pesticide residue in it,” said Vlcan.He added in another statement that the extent of the contamination of the grain was so severe that the entire shipment had to be burned. He also pledged that the government will ramp up the process of reviewing agricultural products from Ukraine for potential pesticides and other toxic substances.Slovakia to halt Ukrainian grain imports as other EU members pass similar bansFollowing the discovery of a contaminated batch of Ukrainian grain, the Slovakian Agriculture Ministry announced that it temporarily banned the processing and sale of grain from Ukraine due to the possible presence of pesticides banned by the EU.Brighteon.TV“The decision was taken after a pesticide was confirmed in a batch of wheat from Ukraine weighing 1,500 tons, which is not authorized in the EU and has a negative impact on human health,” the ministry noted in a statement emphasizing that it will collect samples of all Ukrainian grain and flour that is already in the country....",

Local farmers in these countries are having bad days because Ukraine grains are cheaper than theirs. So, the countries affected are seeking redress to settle their domestic situation and encourage local farmers.",

I don't support food or economic embargoes on any country so I am not also a fan of the United States and its allies. My reason is that these sanctions and restrictions affects the common man on the street more than the political class. The ruling class and their cronies will alway afford their wants irrespective of these sanctions but when the economy begins to suffer it is the masses that bear the negative consequences.

The rich aren't affected, some already have stored foods that can last them for 3 months. Like it's commonly said, when two elephants fight, the grass suffer. The war would have ended a more than a year ago with almost zero loss of life had NATO not stepped in. By the time that placed too many trade restrictions on Russia, Putin's choices were limited. It's peace I pray for daily.",
