      "body": "Whatever is more convenient for you, use it. It's better to have it and at the same time, save the private keys. That will serve as your backup but still keep it in places where they're safe so that when you want to access it and you've forgotten any of them, you still got a backup for recovery.At the same time, keeping Keystore or any type of recovery option for your wallet that's been kept on a smartphone, I don't think it's the safest option that you can ever have. It's possible that your phone might be snatched and all important files are there and that's why backups are important.",

This is one of the trusted Ethereum Storage wallet with minimum withdrawl fee.A transaction fee within a wallet should be adjustable by feature, so, things like a wallet that has a cheap withdrawal fee are non-existent. Seems it is widely known that some newbies are asking about such cheap fee wallets which is a wrong question to be asked and a wrong assumption about the cryptocurrencies wallet feature.The way it works is, a fee for a transaction is based on some particular network condition, not set by the wallet itself. If there is a wallet that does not let the user adjust its own transaction fee, you are choosing the wrong wallet.",

Although you've back up your 12 words, password and the keystore file, but there's no safe when you create your wallet in online. It's only used for holding small amount or short term.",

It's caused by mycrypto gives me more ability to create a wallet even when i were in offline mode. Keystore was good but you shall need to back up your password to make sure you will able to recover your wallet sometime when you lose your password. People in here already known about MEW since a few years ago. There are so many ways that already offered to sign in your wallet but the most popular one must be through the private keys. It's caused by you didn't need password but this less secure compared with keystore. The thing that i didn't like from mew if i shall go online to access it",

Not saying you should use it, but you can also use MEW offline. Read more here. I think MEW and MyCrypto are more or less at the same grade. Not the best choice if you're looking for long-term storage and security.Quote from: asriloni on December 07, 2022, 01:15:52 AMThere are so many ways that already offered to sign in your wallet but the most popular one must be through the private keys. It's caused by you didn't need password but this less secure compared with keystore. You should look for alternatives since inputting private keys or uploading keystore is prone to a phishing attack. Using an open-source hot wallet should be a bit better. You can also try using a hardware wallet/cold-gapped device for long term purpose. It might cost you some money, but it is worth the money as long as you choose the right one. Avoid closed-source or centralized wallet even if they claimed that they open source some of their apps.Quote from: albon on December 09, 2022, 09:40:08 PMOP, if you created a wallet through the MEW website through software methods, so keep the Keystore file on an external hard drive, and never forget the password that you entered after creating the wallet. Make sure to never store it on cloud too. Some people lose money because they store their file on cloud (things like Drive, or even Telegram saved messages). It is better if OP move from a risky tools like keystore in the first place, especially if they are newbies and can't prepare the appropriate security measures to protect their wallet.",

Additionally, you could consider using a multi-signature wallet, which requires multiple approvals before any transaction can be made, adding an extra layer of security.",
