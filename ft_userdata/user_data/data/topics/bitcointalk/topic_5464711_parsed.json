If I am not wrong most streaming platforms in China is not available for example youtube, google maps even the TikTok they have separated one for China alone then Google and apple pay almost everything so CHina is keen on building their own ecosystem which is completely controlled and censored by the government so don't expect them to be a democratic country where freedom of speech is allowed.",

But as far as what the negative impact will be, we don't really know because this is probably still new news that has yet to spread so widely so it might still take time to see what kind of impact it will have. But if you look at what happened in the crypto market when China banned crypto, it did have a negative impact that was immediately felt on the crypto market even though it is gradually recovering. At least we have seen the impact on the crypto market.But hopefully, the negative impact that has occurred in the gambling industry will not significantly impact the crypto market and will only impact the gambling industry in China and not spread to other places. At the very least, we already know how people from all over the world will react if China makes its decision. And China is smart to use every moment to shake the industry and market.",

This isn't a novel development, as China often makes significant headlines—such as banning Bitcoin and other attention-grabbing investor-related actions. Despite their actions, consider the market's current status; even with such measures, we're still flourishing. The outcomes may lead to revenue decreases for some, but the global landscape is expansive. It might be wiser to concentrate on countries that have a more favorable stance towards gambling.",

So this crackdown doesn't involve Twitch or youtube streamers.",

Illegal gambling sites can also harm the players because illegal gambling sites are very vulnerable to cases of fraud.And it is true that if these illegal gambling sites continue to run rampant, then this will be the biggest loss for the leading gambling platforms that already have permits from the government.",

The chinese government has made its stance on cross-border gambling crackdowns important to the nation, and china is clearly pointing the finger at Manila, saying it hosts a large number of online casinos targeting china. This is affecting china's interests and undermining their financial supervision and security. The government is asking smaller countries to be part of or support the crackdown efforts it has initiated. But it's more of a loss for china that citizens can never thrive without entertainment.",

Also China ban bitcoin and other crypto, but the price of the cryptocurrencies dropped and increased back. But what will happen to gambling? If there is no more gambling in China (but which is not possible), only what would happen is for the gambling platforms to move elsewhere. Although some gambling platforms that solely depend or mostly depend on Chinese people may collapse, but nothing would happen to online gambling.

I do not know much about this but first thing that I know is that Taiwan is not part of China as of now. Only Hong Kong and Macau can be regarded as part of China and they allow gambling because they are like countries on their own but China still control them. Also that as China ban gambling, gambling is still well established in China.",

That is yet to be seen.on this subject, I have been reading for years that gambling is prohibited in china, but that there are some areas that are an exception, but this prohibition is for physical casinos, as far as I know and I could be wrong online casinos are not completely prohibited, but they have some restrictions, now if this is really true it does not mean that a person who lives in china can play in some crypto casino, that's because china has banned cryptocurrencies, although according to the newspapers that I have been reading the Chinese still trade cryptocurrencies on exchanges, so I assume they also use crypto casinosI don't know if China is on the list of restricted countries in all casinos, in case they are not then the Chinese will continue to use the casinos, and about the Chinese government banning gambling streaming, honestly this will not create a disaster in this industry because the Chinese will continue to play and there are many other gambling streaming from other countries that will continue with their gambling streaming and in their countries, so the casinos will continue to pay the guys who live in the countries where their governments allow gambling streaming. that is, the market does not depend on China for anything",

I honestly do not know about this in depth. But I personally think that when gambling is allowed in a country, the money sometimes gets laundered between different channels and gambling houses and casinos can actually invade the tax. Probably that’s why the decision was taken. But I am just assuming it, but this is a bold decision taken by the Chinese government. Of course, the Chinese government must have a plan in mind for which they have taken this decision. But my opinion is they could set limitations or license systems rather than shutting down totally.",

This is kind of the idea I had that countries who ban gambling should do instead of, well, banning it. How big of an effect it has though, idrk. It might be too big to the point casinos might just close down, but finding that sweet spot would take a lot of time. I doubt this would have a global effect though. Some countries just naturally have a positive attitude towards gambling since it's part of their culture/history, I reckon it'd take a LONG time before they even start making big changes like China did.
