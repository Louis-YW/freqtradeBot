      "body": "Going to the manager and giving him the idea of accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment was a bold step. This move might lead to the publicity of Bitcoin. There is no harm in trial, it is possible that some customers might decide to use Bitcoin for payments. But you cannot conclude or like you said \"prove beyond reasonable doubt\" that accepting Bitcoin will lead to increase in sales. The number of customers your supermarket would attract depends on how popular Bitcoin is on your area. Your boss must also be aware that the price of Bitcoin can change at anytime which might affect the business either positively or negatively. Good luck Mate.",

Let that time of informing your customers see the result of that survey you're doing if many of them will respond positively. Not just because you've announced that you'll accept bitcoin, many customers will be on it already. That's not how it goes but not that much also will change if you adopt that as you've given the customers more payment method choices.",

The outcome of this will definitely affect your relationship with him. The risk involved in it at the moment is too much to handle for a business owner. I hope you actually told him about the phases of bitcoin (bear period and bull period) because most at times people that lure others into bitcoin only talk about how the price increases with time and not the price fall aspect of it. This has made some new investors panicky when ever a bear period suffices. You need to tell your boss everything most importantly the security aspect of it.",

Most especially because of the inflation rate and the cashless policy introduced by some government, and btc seem to be the right choice. It wasn't a bad idea to convince your employer to have an alternative means of payment. In fact, the earlier this type of service is introduced the better it will be for happy day supermarket. By the type others are trying to get in, this supermarket already far ahead.It is important you and your boss understand the btc network and the exchange rate against fiat.",

And secondly, you also claim you accept Bitcoin without any written sign to show that your supermarket truly accepts Bitcoin, because how are customers suppose to know that your store accepts Bitcoin without any written notice pasted indoor or neither outdoor, so as to enable Bitcoin lovers buy goods during your current scarcity of currency. So in conclusion, I will suggest you go get a piece of paper and write to everyone's notice that your store accepts Bitcoin.",

I think bitcoin payment has potential in OP's locality which is why they are going to think about this. OP I don't know what advice you are seeking here, but if you want to know about the idea of implementing bitcoin as a payment in your store, I would say it is a great move if only people want to pay with bitcoin. But I have checked the pictures and I don't think people will have any interest to pay with bitcoin for small transactions. But you can always test it.",

Apart from that, there is need of more awareness so that your business will get transaction in the form of bitcoin. The initiative taken through your director is good, but the execution needs to be done in the right way. Even small mistakes would cause you big loss. So, handle it well with the right wallet usage.It looks like bitcoin is getting to be more common in your locality. This is an advantage against other locations that doesn't have much of people using bitcoin. Maybe you don't get good business at the beginning, with time things will change and you need the patience to experience good business.",

That being said, the major issues that immediately come to my mind are the time it takes for a transaction to get confirmed (which would make queues even longer and waiting time not worth it) and transaction fees (which aren't that high in general but are pretty high if your receipt at the supermarket isn't big). I've seen the photos, but I don't see anything Bitcoin-related in them. How are you planning to accept Bitcoin? What will the waiting time be, what will the fees be like?",

You can give an update whenever your owner angry with you or he's happy with your idea.If one must accept Bitcoin as a means of payment in their stores they must be the rightful owner of the business, if not, there will be problem when Bitcoin declines in value. Whenever I accept Bitcoin payment I do not hold all the Bitcoin, I respect the volatility and swap the major part to get goods back in store for other customers,  I only hold some part of the Bitcoin for long term holding. I believe the best solution is to be the rightful owner and also understand that Bitcoin is not a stable digital currency,  be prepared for any decline in price after accepting payment in Bitcoin.",
