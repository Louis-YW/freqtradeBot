Most of them, if not all are pure guess work with not even a hint of TA. Even with people who have good track record of getting things right don't get necessarily get future projections right, because it's just a matter of probability, and that includes them being from from time to time. You are one of the good ones if that's over 50% of your ta overall.Also, btc will have dumps while climbing up and bounces while going down, correction is not a bear or bull run so you might not want to pay attention to those if you are not heavily in high leverage day trading. To me those numbers are all noise and we definitely are in bull run that started long ago and i haven't seen any top signals ahead, just bullish. Market is not reacting negatively even to bad news anymore.However this thread is in in wrong section (this is for bitcoin speculation, not an altcoin speculation).You can move it by clicking at this on the left side of the bottom of the page",

This is very unfortunate, but it is true, there are a lot of people who end up with wrong moves that convinced enough people that they are doing the right thing, I have no idea how they manage to convince that many people, but they do manage to do it and that's a big deal, I think it should be remembered that if anyone ends up being good enough, then I think it should be something that will benefit everyone.I hope that we could get to a point where it could make sense to people that if they are asking you for money, just avoid them. No decent enough person end up with something like this, it should be something that could be free to do by anyone so do not believe them at all.",

That's really possible but what can someone get wrong is about the accuracy. Not every \"expert\" is going to be accurate at all times. There can be that's close to their calls but not at most times.Anyway, you want to be an expert? Put some image of charts, do some bit of explanation and put some lines on it and then people will see that you're an expert.By the way, we've got real experts here that does that and analyzes the charts pretty well.",

There will be more and more things people would say about Bitcoin price movement this period but your choice and execution all falls down to your own conviction. One thing you should know is that there is no certified expert although one can be very good at looking at the market and predicting what may come to pass but it is not certain that the prediction would be correct. Every time is a perfect time to buy because you will never when to wait for the dip. This is the reason why people advise not to time the  market if you are Bitcoin investor.",

Like a person who is always right about his/her speculations even if it takes sometime to be confirmed.Sorry to burst the bubble for you but there's no so called experts here as far as prediction goes. Everyone can make his or her wild and educated guess, so even you can make your own prediction. However, there are some guys that based everything on technical analysis, but still it can go either way, a hit or miss.Of course, even in a bull run, everyone will still speculate that the price will dip, it's human nature. What I mean is that there are investors who missed the boat, and so they wanted to buy at least when the price goes down so that they can buy.So that's how everything works here, you will have a lot of opportunity to buy it's up to you whether you will take that opportunity or not. Or wait because you think that it will go down further. So for me, there's no such thing as wrong buy, really up to you when to buy and then just hold on it till you make profits.",

I don't think anyone can accurately predict the market or Bitcoin price and usually they will just keep making dozens of pump and dump predictions and it's obvious that market will either pump or dump before getting stabilized and they will be ready to take the credit and coast about it when this happens stating that their prediction was correct.

Price speculation will always exist in all cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin which is generally always monitored by many people around the world. So don't be surprised when you find words from other people about the price drop in Bitcoin even though Bitcoin has increased rapidly over the last month, because those who keep saying about the price drop in Bitcoin are people who are always afraid of owning Bitcoin or afraid of holding Bitcoin for a long time. So there's no need to be surprised by this because if your mind continues to be disturbed by words like that, maybe you will also be afraid to buy Bitcoin repeatedly.QuoteDuring the Bullish Trend$36k -- btc will dump$38k -- btc will dump$40k -- btc will dump$42k -- btc will dump$44k -- btc will dumpIf by any chance bitcoin goes below 36k or further they would say they were right  about this.

Because if there are more people who are skilled enough to predict the price of Bitcoin more accurately, of course they themselves will also find it easier to become rich because they know when to wait and buy Bitcoin as they want. So don't think too much about what other people say as long as you have your own personal thoughts to make your own analysis and belief stronger in Bitcoin.",

We would be having that kind of expert feeling on the time that the price had fell down into the level that you had predictedand we cant really be able to deny that we do have that kind of feeling that were too good at this.  As long we are really that dealing with this market then all of us would really be that speculators. The ones i do consider out to be professionals are the ones who could really be able to present some technical analysis and some  mix of of some fundamentals. Yes, it isnt a solid indication but you can really be able to notice on how they do deliver their analysis.You would be able to recognized on whats a noob kind of approach and to those who are experienced ones.",
