  "content": "lightlord has personal issues (likely with his health) as he revealed one year ago and he is very little actively on the forum. His last active day is October 07, 2022.Quote from: lightlord on January 26, 2022, 02:16:46 PMThings have been very difficult after the second vaccination shot, affected in ways that were unforeseen. With continued weight loss all the way to Dec. I've since gained 10 pounds, more strength, and health.Recently I saw many posters made many posts in Bitvest.io thread and I think those posts are like spamming. If possible, I'd ask admins or moderators to temporarily lock that thread with a note for lightlord that if he is active again, DM admins to unlock the thread.If any poster want to discuss about it, create a discussion thread in Gambling discussion child board.If admin approves my proposal, please consider to lock 777coin thread too.",

Make it a fair playground to play not because lightlord said something some times ago.Even if it is not out of business, if lightlord is the only administrator and he has openly stated that he is facing issues that would prevent him from managing the business, then this is enough cause for concern to add a note and lock the thread before issues start to arise. Ideally, lightlord himself should quickly come online (if he is able to) and post a note of temporary closure on both the thread and website with a method for existing balances to withdraw to relieve himself of his responsibilities without any damage until his health improves enough for him to be comfortable to continue running the business.",

There are other threads that do not have an active casino representative on the forum. Why should we treat Bitvest thread differently? I think it is important to have consistency in how moderatos manage different threads, and spam should be treated on a post-by-post basis.Regarding LightLord's health, it is important to respect people's privacy and not discuss personal matters unless they directly affect the operation of the service. While he may have declared an illness in the past, he resumed posting on the forum months later, so it is reasonable to assume that his health has improved since then. And, apart from that, there is also Zodiac1233.",

So lightlord may be still fighting for his life but can't able to reply to anyone here due to his sickness.@tranthidungHave you tried to report those spam and spammers to moderators? The report button should work to tell exactly what you want about Bitvest thread and 777coin then let moderators decide but I guess they won't lock them unless lightlord is verified that he won't come back again.",

Let's not treat it different from other casinoe even though the forum account for the casino is not active and I agree with the recommendation about reporting the post of those forum members who posted in the thread then if that doesn't work then I guess locking the thread temporarily is a good idea and unlock the thread once lightlord is okaynor back in business.",

Gambling discussion is mostly used for sports discussion or the game, not about the casino in general.Anyway, there are a lot announcement thread on gambling board where the representatives are inactive, not only lightlord.If you see someone is spamming, report to the moderators, if you're the campaign manager, kick him.

Their hot wallet is still not empty and can proceed payouts for users.I believe it's not relevant to discuss about lightlord's health issues or his personal problems if there are no problems with payouts from Bitvest.io.I respect him and don't want to discuss about those things, in this topic too. I believe others should not too. It's kind of minimal respect for him and is part of my objectives by opening this thread.If admins or moderators disagree with my proposal, it's fine but I still not think it's good to let that thread opened and just reporting spam posts. It's time to lock the thread to stop more derailing discussions. Thanks.",
