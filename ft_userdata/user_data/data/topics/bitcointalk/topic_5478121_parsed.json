Really new to this and thanks for stopping by and the tip this will be good for those who wanna farm through these airdrops. Yeah, INJ has been in a good run and already did a 6x and for me that's a huge indicator that it would be good in this bull run as well.",

Well, there's the thing with inscriptions as well and it was likely the cause that there has been a pause on withdrawal on some CEX with INJ, TIA, etc., and wallet like Keplr has recent issues because of it. Not familiar yet with coinhall and likely with these stuffs, they're new but I think they're worth exploring.",

The TVL already grows to around 80M and the number is still growing. There are so many new project that have recently been added to manta's ecosystem and there is a ecosystem incentive in manta network as well. That means users will also get an airdrop if they interact with manta's ecosystem project as well. You need real money to do that so that eliminates all the airdrop farmer bots which can lead to massive airdrop for the real users of the ecosystem.",

Yeah I agree there are thousands of sibyls for big airdrops like this its so easy to create multiple wallets to farm airdrops the only problem if you did have enough money to take risk, some whales are doing this they are spending a lot of money like thousands of dollars I saw this movements from Arbitrum airdrops, they are profiting really huge amount.",

Even before we know it, the project is already ahead of us. They know that airdrops are hot now, so maybe this is one of their ways to earn more profit? Even though I know that whales has a bigger budget, it was still my first time to know that they also farm airdrops lol.I guess because I think it's too time-consuming, because you know, you are going to create multiple wallets and put in different information. I really thought they are only good at manipulating crypto prices. But they deserved their huge earnings because they took a huge risk there. No need to be jealous at them  .",

Secure your funds in new wallet, but keep using your oldest one to hunt for airdrops, using new wallets to interact is easies way to get disqualified.",
