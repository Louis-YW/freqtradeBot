      "body": "So just now a question popped to my mind after thinking  about it by looking at small numbers, what if we could reverse the equation exactly the same way it is calculated mod p? We'd still need to find the G's mystery to see if reversing it could be possible, correct?Edit: when we use 0x1 as x and 0x2 as y for secp256k1, only the even private keys generate a valid x for the actual secp256k1 but y coordinates are all invalid of course, I just tried with pvk 3, 5, 7, 9, all invalid x, but 2, 4, 6, 8 as well as lambda, all valid. Second edit: did you know if we select x= 7 and y= 8 then using lambda as private key we can get invalid x but y would be 8? I tried different y's and the results were not the same as y = 8 resulting in y = 8 when x is 7 and y is 8.Also note that I used the first character of Gx, and last character of Gy which is x= 7, y= 8.Third edit:If we set x and y asCode:x = 0x5c61e72fc664317304bdf556b56d72634a92023384b6c3184891f51e1b1318f5   y = 0x8We'd get this Code:x = 0xa39e18d0399bce8cfb420aa94a928d9cb56dfdcc7b493ce7b76e0ae0e4ece333  y = 0x8Now if we set the above x and y as G, we get x = 0x7, y = 0x8  this is the power of lambda that creates a triangle, but it is interesting how it affected the x coordinates since y will always be 0x8.What if there was a way to find our k by reverse engineering The G? Too wishful I know.",

      "body": "The recurrence of points like (1, 2) on various elliptic curves is due to their structure and properties. As elliptic curves are typically defined over fields like the real numbers or finite fields and their equation generally follows the form : y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. For a point (1, 2) to satisfy multiple curves, the coefficients a and b must align accordingly.For curves of the form y^2 = x^3 + b, substituting x = 1 and y = 2 gives us 2^2 = 1^3 + b, leading to b = 3. This process can be repeated for any value of b to check if a particular point lies on the curve.Python Script for Analyzing Points on Elliptic Curves:Code:import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npdef is_on_curve(x, y, b):    return y**2 == x**3 + bdef plot_elliptic_curves(b_values, points, x_range):    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))    x = np.linspace(x_range[0], x_range[1], 400)    for b in b_values:        y_squared = x**3 + b        y_positive = np.sqrt(y_squared)        y_negative = -y_positive        ax.plot(x, y_positive, label=f\"y² = x³ + {b}\")        ax.plot(x, y_negative, label=f\"_\")        for point in points:            if is_on_curve(point[0], point[1], b):                ax.plot(point[0], point[1], 'ro')    ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")    ax.set_ylabel(\"y\")    ax.set_title(\"Elliptic Curves and Points\")    ax.legend()    plt.grid(True)    plt.show()b_values = range(1, 11)points_to_test = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]x_range = (-2, 3)plot_elliptic_curves(b_values, points_to_test, x_range)This script can be expanded to test a larger set of points and a broader range of b values.Results :For b = 1, the point (2, 3) lies on the curve y^2 = x^3 + 1.For b = 3, the point (1, 2) lies on y^2 = x^3 + 3, as in your example.For b = 8, the points (1, 3) and (2, 4) lie on y^2 = x^3 + 8.No points tested lie on the curves for b = 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10.This script can be expanded to test a larger set of points and a broader range of b values.Your observation about even private keys generating valid x coordinates but invalid y coordinates for secp256k1 is interesting. It suggests a possible pattern or property of the curve that might be worth exploringThe use of a specific value like lambda to create a triangle and the effects on the x coordinates is a part of exploring the geometrical properties of elliptic curves. The invariant y coordinate in your experiments is peculiar and might be an artifact of the specific curve and values you're using.While it's theoretically possible to reverse-engineer k from P and G, the computational power required makes it impractical I believe.

The point (1,2) is on the curve y^2=x^3+b only when b=3 (and by 3, I mean 1+1+1; the element 3 is definable in any field). When b=5, the point (1,2) is not on your elliptic curve except when 3=5 (which is the case precisely when the characteristic is 2). And if b=7, then the point (1,2) is not on your elliptic curve except when 3=7 (which is the case when the characteristic is 2). You should probably go take or retake a college algebra course to learn a thing or two about solving equations. And don't even bother with finite fields. Just use the real numbers.It is really sad that people can become hero members on this site without knowing basic algebra.

If you are working with elliptic curves over a field with characteristic 2 or characteristic 3, then the equation y^2=x^3+ax+b is not the general equation for elliptic curves; one must use a different equation for these characteristics.Merry Christmas,-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",
