If you are not too good in the general boards then post in the local board more than the English boards. And as you advance in the local board then you can do well for the general boards because naija board is synonymous to English boards.",

      "body": "Welcome back to the forum mate and I hope you are much better right now to continue with your daily activities? Everything about the forum is simple you just need to dedicated your time and put in mental efforts to go round the board to read the post made by other members that alone can fasten your learning and help you to also contribute positively inline with the threads you will come across. Take time to open the link that has been provided by charles-Tim so you understand how the other things work here and as he has earlier informed you, do not copy the work of someone else without referencing the person or sharing the link where it was copied from so you don't put yourself in to trouble.As a beginner you may find it difficult to make quality post so I will advise that you focus more on reading first instead of making low quality post that may not be seen as meaningful, going to the beginners and help section can help you to learn few things especially some questions that has been asked and answered by members so try reading more post there and make more research too to be sure of the information you see, good luck.",
