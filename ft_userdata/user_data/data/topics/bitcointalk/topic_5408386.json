They excluded me for no reason even though there was a 10 percent cashback promotion for losses. ------                                                                                                  ↓                                                                                                  ↓                                                                                              - Mail -Hello there. First of all, I signed up for the duelbits family by reading the amazing reviews on bitcointalk.and I've been betting with you for about 15 days.you have this promotion.https://duelbits.com/promotions/tennis-10-cashback-offer-2My single tennis bet of $550 on July 30 lost. This is the bet number. 4738db27-3e88-4f53-93ff-e7f6220c2d20however, I was not given the money I was entitled to 10 percent cashback even though I fully complied with the terms and conditions of the promotion.After,I contacted customer service. After waiting for a while, he wrote me the following reply.( We have confirmation from the dedicated team that you are not eligible for this and any other promo on the site.Sorry but that's all the information that is available at the moment. ) WHEN I ASKED WHY I WAS EXCLUDED EVEN BY I DID FOLLOW THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, I WAS TOLD YOU DON'T ASK THE SAME QUESTION, YOU WILL BE BLOCKED FROM LIVE SUPPORTWhy was I excluded from the public promotion on your homepage for no apparent reason ?Is it my fault that I got lucky and my bets won?Why don't you give me 10% cashback of my $550 lost tennis bet.The offer is valid for all users. how does this happen. You very clearly wrote back 10 percent for your losses and I lost.It is valid for every user who meets the promotional conditions. and I did all the conditions...this is scam behaivor.This issue should be resolved immediately. I am clearly and unequivocally right.WAİTİNG.........SCREENSHOTS -https://ibb.co/tDW9mXbhttps://ibb.co/92L7r9hhttps://ibb.co/p1bXPRHhttps://ibb.co/mzgwFt9https://ibb.co/fkYxDhHhttps://ibb.co/2YPjrj6https://ibb.co/DCMqPpqhttps://ibb.co/gT0WC0Vhttps://ibb.co/Y31N6tHhttps://ibb.co/SRgfJR3",

I guess there are casinos for which you are responsible.The 10 percent cashback promotion on their homepage is open to everyone. The conditions are very simple .. they say make a bet, if you lose we will give you 10 percent back.I think your math is good but your logic is not. You didn't understand a very simple thing.",

This is indirect stealing. or clipping.Yes It's good money but you are not accusing a robber or a notorious scammer QuoteDear coin-investor , Sometimes I come across your posts. try to be with the customer. I guess there are casinos for which you are responsible.I'm not part of any support of casinos here I'm just a member of this forum who gives input on the discussion QuoteThe 10 percent cashback promotion on their homepage is open to everyone. The conditions are very simple .. they say make a bet, if you lose we will give you 10 percent back.Believe me, I'm supporting you on this if you really deserve and I support winners that deserve their winnings and I'm against scammers QuoteI think your math is good but your logic is not. You didn't understand a very simple thing.I have a failing grade on Math but fair on logic, if you get robbed by a robber then it's stealing but if you've been shortchanged then take up your case and ask for an explanation, calling anyone a robber if it only communication is such a bad start",
