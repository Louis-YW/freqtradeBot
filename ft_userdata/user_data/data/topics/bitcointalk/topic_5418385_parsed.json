How do you resize your image? If you want your image to have high quality, you shouldn't increase the size here. Increase, you should upload a bigger image. For example, if you upload a 16*9 image and you want your image to be 1600*900, it's normal that it would have a very bad quality. Upload the image with the proper size, so you won't have to change the size here.",

Do you try properly to use third-party services for uploading images, like imgur.com used by example from your first post?",

In that post, the user has posted an image with the width of 640 and height of 2526.The problem may be with the ratio of height to width of your image.",

When i upload an image of 1440x4700 just like other users, it is being compressed, while I need it to be widened on the whole post window just First of all, I think that's postimg.cc that's deceiving you. Maybe you use a different image upload website or pay more attention to settings and details. I don't know how you've uploaded and how you've hot the links, but:* The image you've posted [the first image in my post] seems to be a downsized image; it's the same image as yours* If you look on postimg.cc, the cursor has a + for this and if you click the image you'll get another link, for a bigger image [see the second image in my post]; it's a bigger image obtained from your link (I didn't upload anything new!!)* Neither of them have the size you'd expect so maybe you see to upload somewhere else, as I said.** If you upload a bigger image you can use img width= like tag to resize; it's advise to resize only one dimension and leave the other one get auto-calculated** Make sure the image size in megabytes is not too big (images can be processed to be leaner without significant quality loss), else some may complain that your topic loads too slowThe two versions for the image:",
