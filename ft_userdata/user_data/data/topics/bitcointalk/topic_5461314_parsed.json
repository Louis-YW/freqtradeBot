Just curious, but may be interested with some more info...  Thanks!There were two versions. a) a postcard only with XMR symbolism and b) the loaded one which came later with added artwork inside and slightly improved quality and coloring for the outside.Reference threadsFirst Edition Monero Postcard (unfunded): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5077952.0Funded XMR Giftcards: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5140464.0Images for referencehttps://i.imgur.com/yuKpJs7.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/OxWPPoI.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/9QOc5M5.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/PZwFbCa.jpgTwo things to note- after smoothies 5 XMR and 25/50/100 XMR coin sets the first loaded XMR collectible to come after it- each card is as safe as a real moonbits chip: below the hologram is a solid metal chip that connects well with the postcard itself!- key handling and hologram are from Moonbits - I never saw/interacted with the priv keys. You get 100% Moonbits quality and security.Obviously I am biased, but I guarantee you will not be disappointed by this collectible. lol",

      "body": "Damn, thanks so much @kryptowerk. Always loved your art, especially since your coldkey stuff which was always one of my fave releases. Still love that print you sent me, thanks again I owe ya one.Dave, will have to think a bit on this - hard to spend my hodl-stash atm, but will probably cave later tonight or tomorrow. I need a loaded one at least. (Or maybe I just need to get loaded myself to cave. Hahaha).. üçªThanks!",

I figured they would have moved by now.With the loaded XMR being worth more than $75 between the pair that are loaded I figure someone would have bought them.Been concentrating on moving out more of the car stuff over the summer, so I have not been pushing the collectables but would have believed that someone would have taken then my now.-Dave",

I just think more people are hodling right now since the price seems to be jumping and btc consolidation starts to grow a bit early... I'd take the loaded ones, but not sure if you are willing to split them. I already have a few non-loaded, so it feels counter-productive to me atm",
