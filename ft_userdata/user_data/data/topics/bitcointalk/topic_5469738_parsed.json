Assuming that you designed this casino script, and as you yourself say that user degika may have bought the same one from you, you don't have much room for complaints. He bought it from you, for who knows what reasons he wants to sell it and that's his thing. Except if you don't have a specific written in the sales contract that the license is exclusively related to his name or his company and that he is not allowed to sell it on this forum. That sounds insane.If you do not want this scenario, then you should not sell the same script more than once.",

      "body": "I noticed that the person to whom you sold the script seems upset because you didn't install it for him as promised (as he said). When I saw your announcement about selling the source code, I thought you should sell it only once to keep the casino unique. But if you want to avoid such issues in the future, it's a good idea to create a script with a unique license. If you intend to sell it to multiple people you can provide one-time use licenses. This way even if a buyer leaks the script nobody else can use it.In your situation, there isn't much evidence to determine who is at fault plus there are no clear proof of what you both agreed upon. If you specified in the contracts between you and the buyer that sharing the script is not allowed, then the buyer shouldnâ€™t do what he did. But if he paid for the installation as part of your offer, as shown here:Quote$350 source code + installation + crypto gateway & mail verification setupThen it might be your responsibility to ensure that the installation is made for him otherwise you give him a refund.",

The OP himself is selling a script to which he has no rights. Here's a warning from phoenix-gambling in one of his previous threads, stating that they do not permit the resale of their script. Furthermore, the version of the script in question was never intended for public use or sale, as clearly stated on their Github repo.@swaga, as you're not the original author of the script and don't have the right to resell it, you also don't have the authority to prevent others from freely distributing it, which is precisely what degika has done now.",

You sold the script to him and there is no such an agreement that he shouldn't resell the script. You didn't lease the script and it is not also co-owned or in partnership, so why are you worried. Information on this thread also shows that you are not the original owner of the script. That from the source of this script, it is not supposed to be sold to the public but you did. Maybe the best to do is to ignore him and move on.",

Quote from: swaga on October 09, 2023, 11:52:28 PMto put simply:1) I'm selling my own updates - the base code is free and I never claimed I coded the whole thing.2) The OP bought the updates from me and tried to resell them.There's a claim that Phoenix owns it but it was refuted by @swaga Maybe the internet would be so kind as to lead the real owner here,",

It's just a funny thing to me that when this people gets exposed, they are the one that's madder than the people that's accusing them of something.
