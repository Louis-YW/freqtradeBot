You’ve made the right choice to move your bitcoin to a decentralized wallet for complete ownership and control of your funds. Now that you have the keys to your coins, keep them safe and do not allow anything to infiltrate your wallet. Security and privacy is key to every bitcoin hodler, you should keep things private going forward and not show anyone how much you’re worth.",

I just wish i had an extra smerit, I would have given you for your brave step into investing in Bitcoin. But moreover, I must commend, I feel honoured to be mentioned as one of those who did courage you into purchasing this your first Bitcoin, as it is indeed good move in the right time, as Bitcoin has been recently noticed to skyrocket within the past few days, and yet has a higher tendency to gradually continue to almost $50k (i.e mere speculation). While secondly, I must recommend you make security your top priority, by storing your wallet 12 words Seed phrase in a well secured place, while avoiding to click any link you don not understand to avoid been hacked. Because $1429 is a very huge sum to be kept carelessly",

That's a pretty big first purchase buddy because if you look at the conversion of the amount of bitcoin you bought at the current price it's more than the $1000 you spent to buy the first time today.But congratulations on your first purchase at this time because even though the current price is still quite large but I think it doesn't matter if you are serious about investing in it especially for the current price of bitcoin will definitely be even higher than before.But on the other hand, don't let this be your first and last purchase. There are some good strategies if you are serious and have money that is not too used with DCA or buy on the dip I think it can be a good method for your next purchase.",

I would say this is a great idea by you to go into full custody of your bitcoin by choosing an electrum wallet. The wallet is more secure than centralized exchanges like binance, just be sure you keep your seed phrase safe and store it online to avoid it been stolen. As for the device in which the wallet is installed make sure it is free from malware or viruses and avoid all clicking unnecessary links to avoid phishing attack. To over this device problems I will advice you consider purchasing an hardware wallet like passport. Also take note of your privacy, you do not need to disclose this current picture showing your bitcoin.

In future I will advise you use any amount that you don’t need and not probably your emergency funds so that you don’t turn to bitcoin every time you need money. The longer you hold the more the better and the more gain you will gain",

But you are different, you have taken our advises and you have bought it while we're not yet on the halving. I think that you need to maintain this practice because whatever you're feeling right now or what level of happiness is in there on you, maintain that. This time, there will be ups and downs on this market but just enjoy it and endure all the pains and negatives that you might feel because they're part of it and essentials to survive into this market.",

The toughest part is to understand that investing in bitcoin is a great idea, there will be moments where it will feel hard to hold, the price will fall and many things will happen, but if you can weather the drops and the crashes, then as long as you hold it then you will make a profit. Thats the good thing about bitcoin, there is very very few people doubt its future, as long as you hold it, eventually you will be happy that you bought it, and other are not many investments like that in the world, it should be a very proud moment for you.",

Because a hardware wallet is more secure and doesn't cost much lately. I assume you will buy more bitcoin and increase your portfolio this way.

One thing that interests me the most is that you moved it over to a self-custodial wallet where you can be in charge of your own security. But how do you manage to withdraw from Binance with the high rate of fee that they charge more than usual this period? With the rate of transaction fee, I can see the need for buying in bulk rather than the normal DCA because the fee alone can be almost equal to what the person is buying. Next time, if you want to buy more, you can use Dex exchanges to make your purchase; their fees are relatively lower than what CEX charges for a single bitcoin transaction.

I'm sure your investment will be rewarded. Although I have satoshis now, I still want to save up or do DCA to bring a full bitcoin. That is my goal, so we are the same; we are investing, and with the help of the forum, we could decide what we will do.
