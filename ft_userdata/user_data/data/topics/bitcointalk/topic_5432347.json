The domain through which you wanted to do business is only 1.5 months old, and that alone is enough of a warning for anyone who knows how to do the simplest 5-10 second check. Never accept such offers, it is a waste of time and you can still end up in a situation where the client tells you that he has paid and wants his goods - and then you try to explain to him what the problem is.Quote from: https://www.whois.com/whois/oultrade.comDomain:oultrade.comRegistrar:Tucows Domains Inc.Registered On:2022-11-15Expires On:2023-11-15Updated On:2022-11-17",

Please if someone have experience trade in oultrade.com , appreciate to share your thoughts. OP as mentioned I have never heard of such a platform. Maybe they have set up such a system to trick you into cheating. They ask you to deposit more money to withdraw your money. No platform will ask you to deposit more money for your withdrawal. From here it is clear that this is a fake site. You get out of here quickly. Never deposit money here or you will be in big trouble. Hope you understand.Thank you.",

Please if someone have experience trade in oultrade.com , appreciate to share your thoughts. This is the first time I've heard of such a site/platform.Just because your buyer says you should proceed with your transaction on that website because it has a \"secure deal option\", you should've dug a little deeper into the site's background and reputation before going through the deal. As Lucius has already stated, the site is just over a month old, and then on their website, they have stated they have 4 years of experience; that is ridiculous. Also, the part where they ask additional deposit just so you can withdraw your balance is a classic scam-site move. Ask yourself, why on earth would they need $700 to let you withdraw your balance? For withdrawal fees? LOL. Don't trust that site.",

Here they ask to deposit 700 USD to withdraw your BTC. There is no such platform that I have to deposit money again to withdraw money. It is a complete scam platform. Protect yourself from such fraud traps.",

      "body": "The lessons that we need to learn out of this incident:There is enough possibility that that buyer is a part of that website which deliberately did this? Because, I don't really understand why would the buyer choose that platform for payment. Anyone can send and receive BTC freely even they hold bitcoins in a custodial wallet. You should never deviate from your usual business practices just because of a demand from a buyer. Even your buyer demands any kind of new payment option, you should accept only if you are familiar with that particular payment option and already holding a verified/established account with that payment system.Instead of risking some more money ($700 in this case), I believe taking legal action must be a better option.",

What will you lose if you waste a few minutes of time collecting enough information about the anonymous oultrade.com site? And I hope that you did not rush to deposit the $700 because 99% of the sites that ask to deposit a sum of funds before withdrawing are just scam sites. The buyer simply wanted to drag you into the mud after sending fake BTC amounts through this site, which is part of it to your internal wallet until you deposit your funds to withdraw them.Please Stay away from this platform.",

Please if someone have experience trade in oultrade.com , appreciate to share your thoughts. From what you have explained and looking at other people's thought about the site, it shows that oultrade is a big scam and you should never deposit any fund there or you will lose it. This is how they do there scam business.They have agents around and there work is to lure people and force them to use the site mostly for transactions. If you are not intelligent enough you will fall for there trap. When you use the site for transaction, they will ask you to make deposit stating some issues that will restrict you from withdrawing your funds unless you make some deposits. If  you do that, they will ask you to make another deposit higher than the previous one until you are fed up and understand what they are upto.",

Newbies are the main target of this kind of scheme knowing they have limited knowledge on what platform if better or worst. Well, yeah, if OP did asked or research before proceeding the deal he or she may avoided such scam, but unfortunately sounds like its too late.",

This is what I discovered on the outrage platform you are asking about, it is a trading platform investment that promises high returns for the investors. A platform that makes promises is a sign that it is an HYIP or scam.In the situation that happened to you, as far as I remember, I read about a similar style here in the forum who had a similar transaction to yours until he realized in the end that he was scammed, so I hope next time you learn from that incident, dude. Just be careful next time and I'm sorry for your bad experience.",
