If you're in a country with high levels, investing in stablecoins like usdc, dai or usdt can provide good stability against the dollar but might come with some risks.I wouldn't recommend investing in bitcoin with more than you could afford to lose or going straight into a discipline like trading because you might get discouraged and just leave if the value of your investment seems to fall. Bitcoin and other cryptos are a good method for accepting payments for goods or services if you have hobbies that are marketable or can work to maintain a hedge against inflation.",

Talking about getting a hardware wallet so one doesn't lose one's Bitcoin, I would say even at that one can still lose one's Bitcoin stored in it. The security of our Bitcoin depends largely on us than on an equipment. I don't think it will be an issue using an Electrum wallet as a beginner.",

If you have money to invest into cryptocurrency as a newbie the market is bearish and loosing money now is at high risk. I'd advise you to think of a business to start under cryptocurrency niche. It could be a site or products and services. These are long term investment with lesser risks compared to the risk involved in buying and holding crypto especially for a person who is not used to the market fluctuations. Think and research about businesses available on the cryptocurrency niche and note those which you can handle and start with them.

It's a great way to make your voice heard on subjects you feel strongly about, and some good exchanges often develop as a result.

Since you said you are used to character of saving, I will tell you their is difference between fiat saving and bitcon, if you are saving fiat your savings those not increase or reduce, but when you come to cryptocurrency their is always volatility, after investing in bitcoin don't be suprise if you see your money reducing, I think most newbies always have wrong mindset before joining cryptocurrency, they believe immediately they invest, they are already in profit, but bitcoin is not like that, you can invest and still be at lost, but we should always learn to Hold.Also make sure you avoid altcoins if you want to have rest of mind, the best project which I will recommend for you is bitcoin, since you are used to savings, then am sure you will be able to hold.In Cryptocurrency space, scammers are everywhere and scammers are coming up with with new strategies just to defraud people daily, since you are newbie they are always targeting people like you, my little advice for you is that don't trust anybody you meet on social media, and don't share you private key with anyone, don't let anybody brainwash you.",
