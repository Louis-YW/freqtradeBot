Besides, I don't think that anyone can just avoid being associated with their old name, so I don't believe that a thread like this threatens someone's privacy. Those who want complete privacy can get it by creating a new profile and taking all measures to hide their true identity. There are at least 10-15 members who have changed their names over the years, so even though a lot of time has passed, every time I see their profiles I remember that they used to have a different name.",

Here is a take from theymos on discussing username changesQuote from: theymos on January 13, 2020, 04:46:57 AMWhy are you guys posting the old names of people who clearly needed their names changed for privacy reasons? Obviously any data posted online is going to be quickly archived somewhere, but that doesn't mean that your highlighting/reposting of it has no effect. In some cases you may literally be putting lives in danger. If you were investigating a scam or something, that'd be different, but you seem to just be indiscriminately & recklessly dredging up data that would best be forgotten. I guess you need to revisit your list and ask the users for their consent to be on this list.Edit:Quote from: joker_josue on January 09, 2023, 09:29:10 PMSome names are not included, by request.I think I overlooked your notes, looks like you already did the exercise if so then well done.",
