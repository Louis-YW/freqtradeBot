Payment was excellently quick and sharp, you made payments with digital currency (bitcoin and ETH), gifts cards.

Gift cards are more relevant for gamers than non gamers. Gamers check out gift cards to use in games and they always look for discounted price to save their cost when playing games and buy in-game items.",

The best example of that is Bitcoin, a digital currency. The best example I believe in the future that will be a real-life use case is the lightning network of Bitcoin.",

Shopping mall is already outdated because everything that you can do at the mall is can be do now by just using mobile and internet. Amazon offers an express delivery which will give customer a feeling that they are buying and receive the goods instantly same with paying bills and other things that can be done outside the house.Quote from: Godlovesyou on April 01, 2023, 01:59:38 AMBut you've cash like neat dollars you can still pay directly with machines or sales reps around.

I know Bitcoin is for everyone but making street people have a mobile phone and internet connection just to have Bitcoin is already not fitted for them considering their situation.",

In this age time is priceless. Sometimes I am very frustrated when I see long queues each time I want to make payments in supermarkets. Sometimes one has to wait for up to an hour to make payment. I think this new technology will be highly welcomed in my country. It saves time and makes payment very easy. But this facility or program might be expensive that only big supermarkets will be able to afford it. And it will also require constant power supply and a stable internet connection. It might also add to the running cost of he supermarket which will be transferred to customers making products in the supermarket expensive.",

I think this method of payment already existed before, there's an open store with just a box of money where you pay and take a change from it. If I remember right its from Japan since the people in there are generous and honest. If you were asking about that machine's name I don't know what is it called but the process is called self checkout not sure if the machine is also called like that, where you don't need to be assisted which you have to simply put your items in the box to get scan. Once you're done scanning you will just need to pay cash or digital currency. That's the pros of it, the convenience it gave to the customers and employees but the cons of it, is it open to theft. No one will assist you to scan your goods which could be the high chance of stealing. There's a lot of people stolen items with this kind of system due to it's way of catching theft is based on the scale weight of the items. They could simply put it in their body to avoid getting check and walk like nothing happened.",

Bitcoin is now ideal for buying products digitally, as the 10-minute interval is not a problem for most digital orders, but it is a big problem in stores.They can accept the lightning network, which will make a difference for daily purchases, but I am surprised that there is a large mall that tries to attract the largest number of customers by providing the ability to pay even with gift cards.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on April 01, 2023, 03:44:56 AMIf you buy gift cards from official sources or stores, it is safe but if you buy them from secondary market, you will have higher risk.Not only risks, you may end up in prison if the cards are stolen or hacked, not to mention the freezing of your bank account and a lot of headaches and legal problems, I remember that someone had the Amazon account and bank account frozen because of such a transaction.",

TBH, I like this concept and we hope that all countries we saw like this, must see the good side of Bitcoin and other crypto benefits not only the downside that boils down to heavy regulation.  I just wanted to know if they use the Lightning Network which is very convenient for small transactions in a shopping mall. In big cities are very easy to access the internet and no doubt this will happen on the streets but the most that I'm afraid of is the possible abuse or misuse of crypto as an alternative payment.",

Personally I like it, mostly because I have found that when using self checkout the person in front of me has never been shopping before or used money before or learned how to put things in a bag. And when you go to a store with actual cashiers the person in front of me has to fight over the fact that some item was on sale 3 months ago and they want that price.This is just so much nicer, I walk around, take what I want and my credit card gets billed.-Dave",

      "body": "I've been to an Amazon store last year (DaveF provided a link to this type of stores in the thread as well) and I've experienced something similar to what the op seems to be talking about. It was linked to an Amazon account, and then you just pick up the foods without the need to scan it anywhere. It was actually a step up from the op's description, I guess, because you don't have to stop to pay when you are done shopping. The money if automatically taken a few hours later from your debit card that's linked to your Amazon account, and you get the receipt online as well. Unfortunately, though, you can't use Bitcoin payment there and unless it's a centralized service, it would be impossible with Bitcoin (because money can't just be taken from your Bitcoin wallet automatically). But if it's a smart shop that calculates the price and lets you know the total amount at the checkout while also allowing to pay in cryptos, that's amazing. Can you tell us more on where that is and how it works?",

You are lucky because you found this shopping mall and its advanced machines are paving the way for all customers who are looking for speed and do not want to waste their time, and this is what you did not find in most countries of the developing world. What I also liked is the payment by bitcoin and Ethereum, but what about the fees? Were the prices of items that you bought by crypto expensive and exaggerated? How long did the payment transaction take for items you purchased using crypto? Frankly, I have not previously tried gift cards for online purchases or from a shopping center, but I am really impressed and wish you would give us additional information about the name of this shopping mall and its geographical location. I am 100% sure that if all shopping malls in the world adopted payment in bitcoins and cryptocurrencies and relied on developed machines in these transactions, human life would have been transformed into the best, easiest and most enjoyable.",
