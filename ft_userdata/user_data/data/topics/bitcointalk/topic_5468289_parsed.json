Regarding the region restrictions, 500 clearly defines them in their Terms of Service so if the game or site is blocked in your region, you should be unable to access it.Which country are you from, if you don't mind me asking?",

Surprisingly, he was able to deposit and withdraw some money before the bigger wins. It must be something unfair for the player, but on the other side the casino also has a valid argument due to their written terms. Hope to see there will be a win-win solution for this issue because I think both parties make mistake. Player's mistake is because he is coming from the restricted juridiction while the casino's mistake is by letting player from the restricted juridiction to deposit, play and withdraw.",

A MAX win player may only win once during his entire career. It would be unfair to take such a win away.From the TOS, only NetEnt Casino Games are unavailable to Lithuanian users, so they are still able to enjoy the other games on 500. No such restriction applies to No Limits City as well.QuoteAre there any countries you cannot deliver to?Our current delivery offering is limited to the countries within the EU, to Canada and to Japan. Unfortunately, we can not deliver to any other country than listed. While having a license is definitely a positive step, the casino (PUNT) is still able to exercise decisions at its own discretion, such as your case. Unfortunately, only the official PUNT account user or a representative is able to shed light on this matter since they are fully aware of this.On 500, as long as one's account is properly verified, has no bad records, not from a restricted country, and the wins are legit, he/ she is entitled to the full winnings.EDIT: Were you aware of this when checking out their TOS?QuoteJURISDICTIONS. Persons located in or reside in Australia, Belarus, Cote D’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Cuba, Curacao, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Lithuania, Netherlands, North Korea, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sudan, Syria, United Kingdom, United States or Zimbabwe (the \"Prohibited Jurisdictions\") are not permitted make use of the Service.As this was already present, technically every user has agreed to the above clause the moment he/ she signs up for an account:QuotePunt reserves the right to update or modify this Agreement or any part thereof at any time or otherwise change the Service without notice and you will be bound by such amended Agreement upon posting.Ultimately, the ball is in the casino's court on whether it is willing to honor the last payout before restricting further access, or simply denying it altogether.",
