By understanding the past, we can gain valuable insights into the present and the future. However, predicting the future with certainty is impossible. While knowledge and analysis can inform our decisions, they cannot completely eliminate risk.This is always important to think about because Investing in virtual currency requires careful consideration of the market, technology and regulations, as well as a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances. In the end, success in investing requires a balance between knowledge, skill and luck.",

He knows that bitcoin will not be able to replace fiat. Bitcoin was designed to be an alternative currency, which means it is a choice for people to use it or not. Presently,due to people seeing bitcoin as a store of value and an assets with high privacy has made the volume to be increasing day by day. If tomorrow a better project pops up and is more valuable than bitcoin, I believe that the volume of bitcoin acquired will begin to go down. Nobody can predict the future of bitcoin because it is a volatile assets. We can only study bitcoin movement based on past event because life cycle repeats itself.",

Did you saw what happened in 2022, the price of cryptocurrencies fell, also that people knew that it would be more dawn on altcoins than bitcoin and it happens just like that.The only people that are getting it wrong are people that do not make any research, people that only what they are trying to do is to fomo and nothing more.

Why don't we apply that in investing in general and investing in virtual currencies in particular?It's because bitcoin has 4 year cycle, or at there is what we call bitcoin halving happening every 4 years. So that alone is also cyclical, no matter what happens, the block halving is going to occur as it is written by Satoshi.So that is the only thing that we can predict, so as far as we know, the price will go on a massive bull run but we don't know what will be the highest peak or the all time high. Predicting it is going to be very difficult, we have seen in the past cycles about some modelling that predictedÂ  bitcoin will be $100k or 6 digits in the last bull run but it didn't happen as we the highest we achieved is $69k.",

I bet the later market participants don't know what the real purpose of bitcoin is, what they do know is that investing in bitcoin is to get rich. Given the way the government is treating bitcoin, I doubt they will accept it as legal tender in the future. They hate it more than they love it, so that's a big challenge for bitcoin.",

Even you as the maker of Bitcoin couldn't have an idea that it will worth a lot as of today. It took years before pumping a lot with its demand. Imagine the volatile system of bitcoin so you can't confidently say that it will reach to the moon. Bitcoin could be already used as an alternate currency even before. With its popularity and value as of now, people have an idea what is bitcoin so it can be adopted as a currency in our daily lives. You could already see some businesses, transactions and mode of payment outside the internet so I think it can be used as an \"alternate currency\" since we're still sticking to fiat money. Because if we're gonna use bitcoin as our currency today, I don't know what would be the economic situation to our world once we adopted bitcoin as our currency.",

While there are some repetitions and one can be fairly confident that there will be ups and downs, for example, or that there is a Bitcoin bull market every 3-5 years or so, it's much harder to know the moment when the bottom is reached or when the price is about to start moving significantly. So it's not just the cycles and learning from history, it's also perhaps something like a talent. Kind of like some can become great artists and singers, but most can't. I know I'm alright with long-term, relatively safe investments, but I'm not good at trading.
