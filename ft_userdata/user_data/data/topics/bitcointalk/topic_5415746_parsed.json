  "content": "Binance has come out with what they're calling their KYC NFT KYC stands for know your customer usually it's all the hoops that they make you go through to create an account on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange giving away your information like your name your date of birth your addressyour phone number your emailif your us citizen your social securitynumber your the amount of money you'rebringing in every monthhow much you're investing in crypto whatyou're planning to do with that crypto what you ain't for breakfast and whatyou plan to do with the rest of your life I still stand by that because they are making you vulnerable by giving them your very personal sensitive vulnerableinformation to be stored by someone else and then you are ultimately trusting that that third party who doesn't knowyou will protect your information as if it were their own never happens and identity theft and hacks happen onlineall the time and this is why so Binance they have to comply they have to make their customers go through KYCbut a cool tool that they've built if you can get best if you can get past the fact that you have to give yourinformation to them in the first place to receive the nft if you can limit how many entities you are giving thisinformation out the better especially if you don't if you aren't interested in going the fully decentralized fully private route of cryptocurrencythis binance KYC nft basically it's a non-fungible token that proves that you went through the KYC process withbinance it is not transferable you can't trade it you can't send it to anyone else you can't list it to be bid onit is your unique token that is tied to your identity in the Binance ecosystem.I think it's a cool idea you can say you have this nft and you want to go on a differentplatform and they're requiring KYC you can just prove your ownership over the nftand then that can qualify you to have access to their platform rather than you giving your information out yetanother third party to be potentially compromised",

This is not the problem, but the problem is what you will do with the data after verifying it. For example, the passport contains data in addition to your name and country where it contains your real age, place of birth, your passport number, your fingerprint and other data, if it is not destroyed, they get more information Just your name, country, and IP address.I still don't understand how NFTs could make things better.",

Whatever new service, product, reward, interest, prize, etc., that they offer to their customers, you can be 100% assured that they will be making more profit out of it in some way.So what does this NFT cost them? Literally nothing. They attach an NFT to some address in your Binance account, which you cannot move, trade, or sell. It costs them nothing. What do they get in return? They get a bunch of users now signing up with ever more invasive KYC in order to receive this amazing prize! So a whole bunch more data which they can monetize and sell to third parties.What does this NFT cost the user? Complete privacy invasion, as well as the new ability for Binance to tie all your data to an on-chain entity and share that information with third parties, allowing you and your coins to be intricately tracked. What does the user get in return? A completely useless NFT.This is just the next step in government surveillance and centralized exchanges invading your privacy, but with a shiny thing slapped on the front to make it seem palatable to idiots.",

Is the interest still high in them?People are already detesting DeFi's, I think you know why.Here's a post of mine from over 3 years ago, which is just as relevant today as it was then: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5181053.msg52340461#msg52340461. I'd encourage anyone to go and click on the various ICOs I linked to in that post and zoom out on their charts.My prediction was during the next bull run we would see newbies throwing their money away on shiny new projects which turned out to be complete trash. This is exactly what has happened. Centralized lending platforms promising >10% interested gone bankrupt. Countless DeFi projects, staking, yield farming, or whatever else, abandoned and worthless. The value of Metaverse \"land\" down 94% with only a few dozen active users.Lots of money for the creators, and a bunch of disillusioned newbies losing everything.Quote from: logfiles on October 09, 2022, 02:41:48 PMThe token OP talks about is not supposed to be called an NFT as such... they call it an SBT (SoulBound Token). Apparently, it's going to be the first SBT  Can't wait to hear about how SBTs are the next big bitcoin killer, how they will revolutionize the internet, how they will change the world, how they are the best thing since sliced bread! Fast forward 5 years and no one will talk about them, just as no one talks about 2017 ICOs now.",
