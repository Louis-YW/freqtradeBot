Does anyone have the hash I can match?Greetingsphelixn1I am not sure what your problem is, please see this checklist.1. This is a tutorial for verifying: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-verify-your-electrum-download/2. Make sure you verify the download, not the exe after install3. The signatures are on https://electrum.org/#download in the signatures columns, download from there, make sure it's .asc file4. On the same page on the upper area you can find \"The current executables have been signed by ThomasV, SomberNight, Emzy.\", you can download from there the signatures to import into Kleopatra.If you've done all this and still have problems, please elaborate.",
