  "content": "I started a small business on exporting rice in my town. It's been several months and everything is going well.All my customers are happy with the service. So to make things a bit more interesting, I've decided to accept crypto as a payment method. I have designed this business card of mine, and I'll be handing over this to my customers.In the beginning, I have decided to stick on Binance pay, and BTC payment. The BTC address is in the QR code on the business card, and also with the PAY ID for Binance.Universal token transaction will be done through pay ID and BTC could be transferred too.For those who want to pay with other method, can choose BTC address. [Note: Information is blurred out for personal reasons.]I gave it a good thinking and have implemented this in my business. So I want to know you guy's opinion in this.Feel free to suggest me more secure options and how to improve this.Thanks a lot in advance.",

What I mean is that the crypto you'll be receiving... it's not you who will be receiving it, it's Binance.You have an account there and in normal circumstances you'll be OK and you'll be able to withdraw or spend those coins. But.. what if..? With so many centralized platforms going bankrupt and freezing the user funds, it's a risk.The usually recommended solution is self-hosted BTCPay server, but that's for situations people need new address for each payment. And it may need knowledge and hardware.As you use same address for all payments, your own address in your own local wallet would do. Of course, I recommend you get yourself a hardware wallet to avoid hackers.I will add that I've seen your address on that card is Legacy type. SegWit Bech32 addresses (bc1*) are newer and the fees to pay when sending to those are smaller. It also worth considering using those (again, in your own wallet).",

      "body": "Implementing a Bitcoin payment method into your business isn't going to cost you much, unless you have to process those transactions manually, and there's a lot of them. However, you would have to do that with fiat transactions I would guess? Unless, you have a automated system for that. Again, if it's worth your time, it might be worth investing into automated system for Bitcoin. There's no real downsides to accepting Bitcoin, unless you're a company like Tesla that care about their branding, and therefore don't want to be associated with some of the accusations regarding energy usage. Although, as suggested you'll want to be receiving, and accepting your Bitcoin into a wallet which you own the keys. Especially, as a business that might be generating some pretty pennies.",

I'm generally hoping that we break away from having to rely on several third parties having access to your information, and data. When you normally purchase things with fiat plenty of companies are actually getting information on you, simply because that website relies on them. Some websites are absolutely sickening the amount of third parties they share information with. There's no real incentive to do that with Bitcoin, except for convenience for the merchant. I'd be more willing to buy things from someone if they didn't rely on third parties though. Obviously, I do understand where you're coming from, and it has everything to do with convenience, especially when just testing the waters to see if Bitcoin would be something worth investing a bit of time into. The truth is, at the moment we haven't reached the global usage where Bitcoin will always be useful to accept. I guess, it does take a bit of admin, and if you aren't receiving payments regularly in it, keeping up to date, and assuring you've got the systems in place might be more hassle than it's worth.",

I'll make sure to follow those and make a good use of this knowledge. It is really difficult to convince people to use crypto as a payment system. But you'll never know before you try. I'll be mostly accepting stable coin payments through Binance Pay ID. It's fast and easy at the same time. So if people start to use it, then they can gain more knowledge on crypto, and they will be more eager to learn about this. I know it has many flaws and drawbacks. But I want to see how people will respond to this. Appreciate all your help, and thanks again for sharing your knowledge.

But as for the beginning and to let people feel more comfortable using this, I have chosen the easiest way which is binance pay. zero fee and fastest transactions. In future i'll change it up a bit to make it more secure and then i'll use a website for various tokens and cryptoQuote from: yazher on August 11, 2022, 11:01:47 AMI hope your business will prosper and even though the number of customers paying with cryptos are less, don't remove the option for them because you are also helping to the financial revolution we have to remove the banks from having total control of our money.
