WBTC is actually of no real value; the value and price attached to it are just done by the developers, so the chances of it re-pegging will depend on how much the developers are willing to pump in in order for it to maintain the same price as Bitcoin. Now will be the chance for anyone who is holding WBTC to sell off and take whatever they can in order not to incur a more painful loss. If this goes below this and we see it at $26k, we might likely see another crash just like what happened to soBTC.",

The point is not in how much you will sell bitcoin now, but in that as long as your coins have been exploited and you did not find them at the moment of unlocking, there is no guarantee that their value is equal to 1 bitcoin at all (even if de-pegged is restored).One reason to de-pegged is WBTC/PEPES: $26,994.00 meme coins achieve wealth in indirect ways.",

The price fluctuations you mentioned, are where WBTC de-pegs from the bitcoin's price can occur due to various factors.1. Supply and demand  imbalances2. Liquidity issues3. market dynamics4. Technical challenges in maintaining the peg.Also, the trustworthiness of WBTC depends on several factors including the transparency and security of the underlying custodian or organization responsible for minting and redeeming WBTC.",

I think I used this coin only once in a decentralized exchange like UniSwap or PancakeSwap, I will check later if I still have a balance on that coin. Anyway, that's bad news if they are not on the same value as Bitcoin which means losses for everyone who bought this way back there is a difficulty in buying Bitcoin in a different exchange. Well, if it's not worth its usage anymore, better just sell it for something else but the timing must be perfect or the pair should be better. I just don't know if we can still get the same value as it should with Bitcoin.  The sad part is many buyers of the new meme coins might not even be aware they are being fooled by this manipulation.",

I would be curious to know why even buy any altcoin that has the word bitcoin or BTC in the name. This is a clear attempt to speculate on the background of bitcoin and attract the attention of investors to buy this worthless cryptocurrency. I see no reason to buy altcoins that mimic bitcoin in one way or another. This also confirms that bitcoin is №1 if they try to release copies for this. But more often than not, this is a way to force newcomers to buy junk under the bitcoin's pseudo-wrap.",

This time we all understand there is no such thing as absolute perfection, and especially when we compare it to fiat prices.The difference is that we still see it as an altcoin, if it weren't for some forced trade I wouldn't have chosen it for holding, but we've seen the evolution of defi that wbtc can also be considered as a convenient and diverse choice to transfer assets across different ecosystems.",

They are not trying to exploit the name of Bitcoin to increase the price of their currency, such as Bitcoin Cash did, but rather trying to give you a token of the same value as Bitcoin. It has good roles for those who want to trade Bitcoin in another blockchain, but they must be trusted in their saying that 1 BTC = 1 wBTC, which has been proven wrong.Quote from: Apocollapse on July 13, 2023, 01:18:08 PM Don't need to wait until there's someone discover the WBTC smart contract or chain has a security problem because any smart contract has a low security.Bitcoin is decentralized and not controlled by any single person, while Wrapped Bitcoin is opposite.This is not the only problem, but whenever it is 1 BTC ! = 1 wBTC, this means that those tokens are not locked, mined and burned against Bitcoin, even if the price back to previous levels this has no meaning now.",
