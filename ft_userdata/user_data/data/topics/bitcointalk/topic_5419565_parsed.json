  "content": "It looks like Solana found a strong partner. News going around saying Google cloud is a new validator for the Solana network. Apart from this, Google Cloud is also bringing Blockchain Node Engine to Solana. The Blockchain Node Engine (BNE) was formerly focused on Ethereum but is now widening its range onto the Solana ecosystem. This is great news for Solana supporters as it proves the project might have a bright future ahead.",

      "body": "Google cloud knew when to take the right decision since hetzner was blocking thousand of solana nodes and then google cloud was taking such decision to run a validator in solana blockchain caused by those thousand nodes potentially migrating from heztner to the google cloud. The google cloud was taking the advantage over such decision by hetzner which is good but the bad thing is when solana developers never fix the outages problem which is really annoying. The google cloud itself doesn't even aware about the problem that have been facing by solana but at least this google cloud will get at least hundreds of potential users to use google clound for their nodes. It's such a great decision in the business. google knows how to get the right decision to take all of advantage. that's smart enough.",

Solana must resolve their technical problems too as only the support from FTX and Sam FTX are not enough for Solana to take off and make a new all time high.The coin must have better technical specifications as well as more smoothly operations and bigger capacity on their blockchain. Recent months, a lot of NFT projects have issues of performance on Solana blockchain and the Solana ecosystem will not grow more if such problems won't be handled well enough.",

We'll also see what Solana will look like after using Google cloud as the new validator for the Solana network. And if this really brings a new twist to the Solana project, maybe it could make Solana's price increase in the short, medium and long term. So let's see what happens to Solana.",

For some partnership maybe its not an issue but for a real case user of their platform, its a really big red flag. Even though they got some backed up in the long run a platform, that has a lot of users will remain. Look on how btc remain on top by adding up users everytime and how great the adoption to a lot of countries.",

Ouch. I almost comment positive words if not because of your post guys. Guess it's too early to celebrate yet until further fixes are done by the team and upon a long time of observation if solana is now running well without a hiccups.For now, let us still be cautious and won't be carried away by the hype. True investors of solana might stay because solana is still showing signs of life and I think some will push their support even at the very end and will just accept if the result is a loss while fake investors and hype seekers will only come and go depending on how the news go.",

That kind of news will probably make the trend and I am sure this will just be the start of their pump. Soon, more hypes will come, and we better buckle up.",

Not only solana I believe similar projects like near, celo...will also have the same end. Every bear season passes, there are always new projects that are better and attract a lot of attention from investors. If given investment choice between aptos and solana, I'm sure everyone will choose aptos, it's a new project the potential is no less than sol and the special thing is that it has not been hyped. Chance of getting higher return and same risk.",

There’s been a lot of times over the last year where Solana has gone down, hindering all of the projects that rely on it. Some have recently even moved to other chains as a result. As far as centralized blockchains go, Solana is one of the best and it sounds like this is a step forward for them.",

The 2 projects he is referring to are 2 new layer1 projects and they are being evaluated as replacements for solana and some topcoins in the upcoming bull run. Those who are passionate about altcoins or like to find hidden gems, these 2 new names will not be too strange, I am also monitoring these 2 projects very closely, in the future they may replace sol and we also know that topcoins will often be replaced by better new altcoins. Google may have just saved Sol a life from Hetzner, which is good news for Sol but not enough to say how good it will be in the future.",
