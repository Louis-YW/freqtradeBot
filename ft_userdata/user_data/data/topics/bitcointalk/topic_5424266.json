And, we get to see Lightening Network become more popular and adopted.",

If I am about to guess the next trend, maybe it is again ICOs. Why? Campaigns are slowly coming back this year and I think it would continue for the next year to come. More projects are being released so I think it has a chance. But if there will be something that would rise, which is for sure, existing already in this industry, it could also be 'halving' of token which is somehow ringing a bell already this year. Bitcoin's next halving is believed to happen in 2024, and I think it could be the next big thing for this industry. I've mentioned different thing since we are talking about 'trend' and halving, alone, is not.",

Each one of these phases, draw a lot of attention and newcomers to Bitcoin as well as it helped Bitcoin to reach new Heights and to go mainstream.I would say it is the opposite.  These phases did more harm to Bitcoin than good and Bitcoin was the push for Altcoins.I think one of the reasons Cryptocurrencies are still alive is because Bitcoin does not drop by 95 to 98 percent every bearish market.  If that happened, nobody would continue mining.  But Bitcoin is as strong as it ever was while Altcoins keep showing the same vulnerability.  They come up, pump, dump and then vanish like they never existed.Honestly.  All these crazes are actually just a false hope.  What do we have after all the phases you mentioned?  Bitcoin on the BNB chain?  Decentralized Exchanges like Pancake Swap which are not really as Decentralized as they seem?  Coins like Shiba Inu living ultimately on the hype because they have no real purpose other than bringing fuss in the market?  LUNA, showing us how 'smart' a Coin can be and how easy it is to self destroy as an Altcoin?  Or do we have Decentraland which pumped just because Metaverse became a trendy term in the past year and will probably die until 2024?To newcomers who want as big profits as Shiba Inu got the early holders, Bitcoin is not attractive.  Bitcoin brings only a few hundred percent profits while, in their mind, Altcoins can bring thousands to tens of thousands.  To them, Bitcoin growing is exciting because the Shit coin they are holding will also get more expensive.  And when markets dump, most of them will sell and whine, fewer will continue purchasing their Shit coins to DCA their losses since their Coins are now worth nothing and fewest will turn to Bitcoin.Bitcoin was not helped by any of the phases you mentioned.  It was the opposite.  Bitcoin keeps growing and growing while Altcoins get increasingly more Centralized, opposing Bitcoin's core values.  If you want my honest opinion, Altcoins are regressing while Bitcoin keeps progressing.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Some of them were just hype, others managed to cut out a niche for themselves (like NFTs). I don't know what the next craze will be (maybe CBDCs at some point), but I don't think it will revolutionize the industry. Best case scenario, it has its brief popularity and then remains something occasionally remembered and used by others. If ICOs couldn't make Bitcoin less significant, I don't think anything can, until we have a major breakthrough which doesn't seem to be around the corner.",
