Kucoin and other exchange already implemented burn feature for Lunc so Binance just follow the trend to satisfy the wish of there customers.There’s Trillion supply for this token and burning this huge amount of supply will cost a lot to all the traders because this will have extra charge for the fee. This dumb decision by the blinded holder of Lunc because this project is already abandoned and no future.",

I can't forget that crash when it first happened. I could be one of them as I also traded luna and made some money thanks to it. I was lucky.",

But the thing that makes me curious is why is he still not in jail? If he is indeed a wanted criminal not just within a single country but in the whole world, why is he still free until today? And he is even saying that he is not even hiding. So what happened to government authorities who are supposed to arrest Do Kwon?",

Burning create value but fork does not.However, the decision of Do Kwon and Terra team is bad and CZ tweet \"SMH - Shake My Head\". Now I don't think CZ has interests to support LUNC and why Binance should sacrifice trading fee on their exchanges to buy back and burn LUNC. That's unrealistic at the moment but I don't think we can exclude that possibility in future.Maybe someday CZ might change his mind but it is not his responsibility so it's not wise to speculate what he will do.",

People have already lost their trust in this project, most especially that Do Kwon is now facing legal consequences for what he have done. Binance on the other hand might be in the middle of helping the project bounce back and helping users to win back their trust and losses.",

He still isn't under the custody because he hasn't still been convicted or anything and things are still pending.Binance was always in favor of the Luna classic community. They weren't scared of losing total number of users (i doubt it would affect them if all the luna classic holders boycotted them). I guess people weren't patient enough for Binance to implement the burn mechanism (which is actually going to optional and I wonder how many of those that wanted to boycott will enable the option to burn).",

Definitely not and I believe Kwon does too. Moreover, Lunc hasn't been under kwon's control since the fork ended.",
