What action are you expecting? Should he be tagged for your laziness to do research?One thing you should know is that Julerz12 is not a part of the volare team he was only hired to run a bounty campaign and I'm very sure that he clearly wrote in the campaign what bounty hunters will be paid with which was mvolr but hunters were just too lazy to do research about the project. So calling him a scammer makes it look like he refused to distribute bounty payment and he ran away with it which didn't happen. If you have any complaint about the project you should take it to the project directly I believe they do have active social media handles and ask them directly why they have chosen to lock the token for 6 months maybe after the reason behind you can then proceed with your thread creation against the project and not the campaign manager.",

You need to first define what are the roles of bounty managers before you throw accusations, Julerz has no control over what action the developer team will do after the bounty campaign, he is out when it comes to decision-making, you know that because Julerz always put a disclaimer on every bounty campaign he is managing so stop barking at the wrong tree.This is the risk every bounty hunter should understand because the glory days of bounty hunting are over, bounty hunters now are risking their effort and time on every project that they are going to promote, even if you did your research it's still uncertain if the project you are promoting will turn to scam.",

Hey mate, I believe before you take up any job offer here you already agreed to their terms and conditions of operation as they have the sole mandate to take decision at an given point in time. If you were not ok with the terms and conditions stated out for the bounty then why participating in the project bounty? And from what you have said you were paid for the work you did as a bounty hunter. Do you not know that the team has every right to make sure that they project their project in a good way every aspect? They have the final decision and they Make any decisions that suits the growth of their project token because that alone attracts investors when they have a good project at hand to showcase to the world at large. You are busy calling bounty manager names do you expect him to do research for you before joining his campaign? He did state his conditions of engagement before you took part in the bounty. You should not be angry at the bounty manager because he is not part of the team he is just a bounty manager hired to manage the bounty for the project.",

They already distributed the tokens. As for the tokens being worthless, this may be due to the failure of the project team to make their currency a success and because of the lack of investors interested in this currency or because of the lack of liquidity and capital and other reasons, so I see that it is not the bounty manager’s fault but rather your fault because you did not take sufficient time to do research and review the goals of the project and the level of experience of its team. If the project fails and its currency does not succeed in attracting investors and turns into a scam, then this is indeed the fault of the team. Also, no one can predict this, regardless of his experience and skills. Once again, you have to review the project that you will work to promote and review the currency information that you will receive before wasting your time and blaming others.",
