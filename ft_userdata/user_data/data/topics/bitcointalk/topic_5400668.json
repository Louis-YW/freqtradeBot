  "content": "Every time I read something about a bitcoin miner being a space heater it ends up being either a joke, or a vaporware.Is there anything fundamentally wrong for making this?, I would be happy to buy one that looked good and wasn't very noisy.For example, have a look at this great little space heater:It looks good, produces nice heat, and it's not crazy loud or annoying at all. It has 2 modes, low(750W) and high(1500W). It's a great little machine.Now, for home miners, look at something like the Apollo BTC:It also looks good, produces nice heat, and it's not crazy loud or annoying at all. It has 3 modes, ranging from around 100W to 300W or so generating about 2-3TH/s. It's a great little machine.Why hasn't anyone made a great looking space heater with something like that?You could make basically something like the Vornado, but internally instead of just having a simple heating element, you would have something like 10 times what the Apollo has. There's enough room to do that.It would run nice and quiet, produce enough heat, look great, consume about 1000W-2000W or so(configurable) and generate around 20TH/s. It would be a great little space heating machine that gives you a few sats while running it.My only guess is that it would be too expensive, but I'm not sure about that really...",

Let's assume you will keep the Apollo nonstop for heating purposes and you've got 18$ a month ignoring power.So, why would anyone bother with these, especially since as years pass your machine will be less and less efficient compared to the newer models?Quote from: mikeywith on May 30, 2022, 02:07:34 AMalso the manufacturer rather deal with 10,000 possible warranty claims, support, and shipment that dealing with three times the number.Spot on, this is common everywhere and this is why in some cases manufacturers of goods do not even sell directly to the consumer, they unload all this to resellers and let them deal with a mob of shoppers that will probably encounter every single problem in the universe. One tiny fraction for the profit and you can cut a lot of personnel in support and a lot in accounting, you won't be faced with tens of failed payments, chargeback, and everything else.Quote from: mikeywith on May 30, 2022, 02:07:34 AMBut even if someone else was going to do what you suggest, how would they exactly cool 1000W-2000W without moving enough air? and to do that you will end up using \"load fans\",You can't without using air but you can reduce the noise by playing with the numbers of chips and their settings, of course, this would end with a mining machine mining at 1/3 of its capacity and not being a lot cheaper either. I just check my emergency air heater, it's rated 1500W and 50DB, and I bet the chips would melt at the temperature that the ceramic plate inside is heated.",

Because as they heat up that can have an effect on the performance. That is not optimal for heating a room anyway. One effect that people who buy \"gamer laptops\" do not understand. Heat degrades electrical components. Although this becomes an optimal solution for people who live in very cold areas e.g Siberia and have many miners... Just as long the miners don't overheat at their specific room temperature requirements.",

      "body": "Yep, exactly. The issue isn't total amount of heat but heat density. It's going to take a particular volume flow of air to clear a certain amount of heat from the unit, so if you increase the volume of the unit you decrease the linear flow rate of the required volume of air. Slower air means slower fans means quieter fans. Another component of this is reducing the length of the flow path, as the exhaust end will be cooled with air already warmed by every heat source between it and the inlet. The S7 and S9 had trouble with roasting boards due to a 9\" flow path. Spondoolies rack gear was even worse, with about 30\" flow paths. With the S15 and onward, Bitmain shifted to short wide paths over long narrow paths, more like 6 inches, and with larger heatsinks in the hotter regions to increase the rate of thermal conduction into already hot air. The R4, specifically designed for quiet operation, had an airflow path of about two inches.Resistive electric space heaters tend to be small because the heat-generating materials (usually basically a length of wire) are able to operate at extremely high temperatures, so the heat density of the machine is allowed to be very high. A fairly quiet fan can still do the job with heating because any air moving through will gain a substantial amount of heat, given that the goal is to pull *some* heat out of the element, not try to keep it operating below a semiconductor-survivable temperature.Bitcoin miners generating the same amount of heat as a consumer space heater will need enough airflow to keep the chips operating at least below 100C. Ideally, even lower, as with CMOS technology there's a positive temperature coefficient for power use: as temperature increases, the power required to maintain a particular switching speed also increases. So even for a given voltage setpoint and target hashrate, as a miner heats up, it'll draw more power, causing it to heat up further, until an equilibrium is reached or failure occurs. In order to maximize profitability, the chips should be kept as cool as possible to optimize hashes per unit power.The best way to optimize hashes per unit power is to operate the chip at a minimum stable setpoint - low volt, low speed. But this means low hashrate, and low power, per chip. In order to meet hashrate specs, or heat generation specs, it's required to use a whole mess of chips. This helps retain low density and therefore quiet airflow, but it also means a very high initial cost and a larger device that may not be trivial to unobtrusively integrate into a room.So the design of the device will be a trade-off between the lowest initial cost (fewest chips) versus the highest operating profit (highest efficiency), coupled with convenience (lowest physical volume) versus comfort (quietest airflow). That's a lot of factors to try and optimize simultaneously.",

Yeah, this is what I was aiming at, in my opinion, a \"miningheater\" would definitely not look like a miner and far more likely as a radiant panel.Rather than trying to cram all of it into some small box that will make a lot of noise you could simply go for wall placements I know hotmine tried something like this:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5152874.0from what I understand it was completely passive even at 700w.Large heatsinks, as you said, designed and placed perfectly so that they would release heat on the exterior, not on others, the ability to replace those chips when they get highly inefficient, capacity of turning it to different levels of heat generation as nobody wants a constant 2000W blowing on their wall,  and far more important in my view, lower initial cost, which as we speak probably are impossible to realize, I don't think anyone would sell you chips that they can put in a miner and sell for $7000 at a price that would be at under the normal heating bill for 5 years.Quote from: sidehack on June 01, 2022, 09:26:31 PMThis helps retain low density and therefore quiet airflow, but it also means a very high initial cost and a larger device that may not be trivial to unobtrusively integrate into a room.I just wonder, has anyone tried to approximate the cost of a complete passive miner, or if it would be possible at all?",

And is very cheap to do.burns 270- 300 watts and since a dorm is basically free power  why not?I would imagine that in a college dorm power will be both free and limited, thus utilizing every bit of free energy would be a wise move, I mean 3th of Sha256 makes only dust, besides it won't be so cheap to buy, and the ROI will be instantly high, 35 cents a day isn't worth it, that person could save for a good GPU.Most modern GPUs make over a dollar a day, they can use those GPUs for gaming, study, and design, even when they leave college, the GPU will still be somehow usable, I mean an RX 470 bought 7 years back can still run some solid games, do a bit of rendering, sell for somehow a good price, there are many people that would still use and buy that card, but not so many people who would buy an antminer S5 as far as I know. I am not saying that having an ASIC miner run as a space heater is the worst idea in the world, but it only makes sense if you mod your own gear as phill does, I mean imagine you have an S9 with 1 or 2 dead hash boards, selling it for $100 will mean listing on eBay, shipping, dealing with all kind of annoying buyers/scammers, maybe even some tax-related matter, you don't have time for all that, mod the gear, make it run quiet, turn it on in the winter to make some sats, a brilliant idea.That VS, paying $2000 for a good-looking factory-made quiet miner that makes you 50 cents a day, not so brilliant idea.",
