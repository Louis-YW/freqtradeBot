If not then how to acquire this amount or more?It's possible since there were already exchanges around that year. Plus, aside from exchanges, you could also buy through P2P transactions.Here’s a reply from one of the old members in the forum that should answer your question.Quote from: Xavofat on October 29, 2017, 09:50:25 AMQuote from: pennywize on October 29, 2017, 09:06:49 AMBuying BTC is easy today with sites like Coinbase but what was it like in 2010 and 2011?New Liberty Exchange was up in 2009.  Mt. Gox came up in mid-2010 and took up a lot of the market until its eventual collapse in 2014.It was also more common for people to mine at home, because specialised hardware was not yet available nor required.Quote from: pennywize on October 29, 2017, 09:06:49 AMWhat wallet did people use?Bitcoin Core.  The blockchain was tiny then so it wouldn't have taken much effort (not that it really takes that much effort now).you can also follow and read that thread for more information.",

I wish I knew about Bitcoin back then.  True, mining was possible back then but considering the price at the time, it's also easier to just buy Bitcoin, and in 2010 Bitcoin was worth less than a dollar, it was basically worthless. If we had seen it coming, maybe dropping $1,000 on Bitcoin back then wouldn’t have been a big deal. And if we had held onto it until now we’d be living the kind of life most people can only dream of.As for me, when I first got into crypto, the name I kept hearing was Mt. Gox. Of course, I never got the chance to trade on that exchange since they shut down in early 2014 after people started panicking.",

However, we can't turn back the clock, and even if we have heard Bitcoin before, majority might not be interested on it in the beginning.Right now if you wanted to acquire it then it's obvious that you need to have a lot of money to invest. Think of it as like Michael Saylor is doing, but majority of us doesn't have millions upon millions to invest and acquire a lot of Bitcoin. But you can still start your journey and still invest in which ever way you can.",

Poloniex is also one of those exchanges you can buy BTC.Exchanges existed in the past where you can actually buy the quantity of btc you wanted but not quite a number of people believed btc until later in the year around 2015 when the price started growing rapidly.I remember there was Coin Exchange which was one of the popular exchange but no longer existing.

I'd like to add that the first large bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was launched in July 2010, so before that date it was almost impossible to buy bitcoin in large quantities, like the mentioned 250k, since people were trading on PayPal, but the fees were making it hard. To give you a perspective, the price at launch on Gox was around $0.06 and the whole exchange held less than 1% of the supply. This means that even if you were to use the largest exchange on the market in Q3 2010, you'd have a hard time buying $1k worth of BTC. One more thing to add. I found daily volume on Gox in August 2010 mentioned in a post and it was 23k BTC, which at that price was around 1400 USD.",

I think that you'd be able to do it in Q2 2010 if you tried in different places all at once, like buying on Bitcoinmarket and Gox at the same time, over the course of a few days.

Between Q3 and Q4 bitcoin rose from 0.06 USD to 0.25, so 4x, which means USD volume of trades also went up. At 0.25 USD per coin, previously mentioned Mt.

I personally knew people buying (and selling) $1000 worth in 2012 when the price per bitcoin was between $8 and $12. That's an average of 100 BTC for $1000 which was easily doable in places like BitFloor and MtGox.I wasn't aware of Bitcoin yet in 2011, but I suspect that it became quite a bit easier to acquire $1000 worth as the liquidity grew at MtGox throughout that year. If I recall correctly, Bitcoin hit a value of $1 for the first time in February of 2011?  That would mean you could pick up 1000 BTC for $1000 if you could find a seller.Perhaps someone that was paying closer attention towards the end of 2010 or the beginning of 2012 could give a more exact answer, but I strongly suspect that it became relatively easy to acquire $1000 worth of bitcoin sometime between fourth quarter of 2011 (beginning of October) and third quarter of 2012 (end of June).",
