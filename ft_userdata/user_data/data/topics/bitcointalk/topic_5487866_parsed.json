  "content": "Introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, BTC was envisioned as a new global currency for the internet age [1]. While Satoshi intended for widespread adoption, BTC has primarily become a store of value. While I believe everyone should have access to Bitcoin, with its open network allowing anyone to create an account and transact, it's important to acknowledge that profiting from BTC may not be the chance for everyone.Throughout Bitcoin's history, periods of thrilling price surges have been followed by sharp corrections. During these downturns, also known as crypto winters, Bitcoin's price has fallen by a staggering 77% to 93% compared to its previous peak. In simpler terms, the price has dropped 4-10 times. These harsh winters act as a crucible, testing the resolve of Bitcoin holders. Those who remain confident in Bitcoin's long-term potential, often referred to as \"diamond hands,\" are contrasted with those who hate BTC, or \"anti-fans.\"Michel Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has become a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency world. He is credited with leading MicroStrategy's strategy of accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, which has resulted in a significant profit for the company: over $6 billion from its 193K BTC budget [2]. Additionally, the company's MSTR stock price has seen a substantial increase: over 800% in 3.5 years. However, Saylor's approach has also attracted criticism in the media in 2022 [3].Even more famous than Michal Saylor is Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, the first country in the world to accept Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender alongside the US dollar in 2021 [4]. In addition to helping people access financial services without relying on banks, reducing transaction and remittance costs, and attracting tourists and foreign investment, the reserve of 2,380 BTC accumulated through mining and DCAing BTC has also helped El Salvador earn a profit of over 40% [5]. However, we also cannot forget that in 2022, Nayib Bukele and the El Salvador government faced criticism daily from a range of critics, from large organizations to individual market participants, on financial news sites, social networks, and YouTube [6]. I believe that Nayib Bukele has taken a risk with his entire political career to bring El Salvador into the Bitcoin era, and he is fully deserving of being re-elected president of El Salvador to contribute more in the next term [7].Nayib Bukele: “When Bitcoin’s market price was low, they wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses. Now that Bitcoin’s market price is way up, if we were to sell, we would make a profit of over 40% (just from the market purchases), and our main source of BTC is now our citizenship program”.Major media outlets can be seen as capitalizing on both positive and negative aspects of Bitcoin (BTC) to capture readers' attention. For instance, The New York Times frequently reports on recent BTC price surges [8]. However, during the 2022 crypto winter, they also published an article exploring the link between cryptocurrency investment and the \"dark tetrad\" personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism [9].Holding Bitcoin (BTC) long-term requires resilience, as the market can be volatile. While some humorously say \"the best way to hold BTC is to go to jail\" (meaning you're forced to hold), even strong believers can find it difficult during periods of decline.For me, holding BTC is not a coincidence, it is a rational choice!I want to know your opinion on the success of BTC holders:Is the profit of BTC holders just from luck?Are you a BTC holder? What makes you keep believing and holding BTC?When will you hold BTC until?References:[1] Satoshi - Sirius emails 2009-2011[2] MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Made $1.2 Billion In 3 Days Following Bitcoin Boom[3] Michael Saylor Bet Billions on Bitcoin and Lost[4] El Salvador To Make Bitcoin Legal Tender: A Milestone In Monetary History[5] El Salvador Bitcoin holdings hit record $164M as BTC profits pass $50M[6] El Salvador’s bitcoin experiment: $60 million lost, $375 million spent, little to show so far[7] Nayib Bukele re-elected as El Salvador president in landslide win[8] New York Time: Bitcoin[9] Bitcoin fans are psychopaths who don’t care about anyone, study shows",

I think for me, forever. I hold Bitcoin multiple bear markets and multiple bull markets and I still hold them until now.

What makes you keep believing and holding BTC?When will you hold BTC until?Luck? Luck does play a role in market changes, but making profits from holding isn't about luck. It's about being willing to hold onto your investments for a long time. Holding onto investments, especially with Bitcoin, can be challenging because you might feel tempted to sell when you see others making quick gains.As a long term holder, it's important to not worry too much about short term market changes. This mindset helps prevent you from selling your coins at the wrong time. Bitcoin has seen so many ups and downs like in 2021 when it reached its previous all time high and then experienced a downturn. This downturn might have led many long term holders to sell out of fear of uncertain doubt(FUD), fear of missing out(FOMO).These types of holders are what I call \"weak.\" As a holder, you shouldn't be swayed by short-term market trends. Bitcoin's unique qualities, like its limited supply of 21 million coins, attract investors who understand the principles of supply and demand. When a product is limited or scares, its price tends to rise due to increased demand and limited supply.In the future, Bitcoin will likely become even more valuable. Understanding Bitcoin's market trends and its scarcity makes holding onto it a smart investment choice.",

Top altcoins were also cheap. We also made money during the height of the ICO craze. But then here comes financial management. Many failed in this aspect. Some friends who made a lot of money in those early days are now mere employees. And then there's also the factor of emotions especially after the bull run in 2017. I know of some individuals who panicked and sold much, if not all, of their Bitcoin in 2018. Some even left Bitcoin for good. It isn't just emotions, of course. Risk tolerance, wrong appreciation of Bitcoin, miscalculation of events, wrong predictions and sentiments, and so on and so forth were also at play. Some could have analyzed but were mistaken.Generally, I consider myself lucky because there's Bitcoin and a loved one introduced me to it. But it certainly is not luck that I still have Bitcoin until now, that I didn't squander my profit on worthless things, that I hodled strong through the years, that I continued stacking Sats, that I didn't flinch regardless of how bloody the market was, and so on. It's definitely a combination of luck, conviction, understanding, responsibility, perseverance, and so forth.",

When you invest many people will call you stupid and many people will laugh at your investment but when you invest successfully those same people will tell you that you are very lucky. We see such people in every society. So since I am investing myself, we should not give priority to what other people say or laugh about my investment, we should only stick to our own decisions. When we overcome hundreds of hurdles and keep investing by accepting all challenges then we will definitely get profit from investment but we should have enough patience for this profit.",

What makes you keep believing and holding BTC?When will you hold BTC until?1. Maybe the early adopters, they're really lucky because there's not a lot of people back then that are speculating too much about bitcoin getting this far in the market, it was supposed to be a P2P currency that's supposed to be used so there's no middlemen like banks and have trustless transactions.2. I'm a BTC hodler, I've been hodling since early 2017 if my memory serves me right and the reason that I believe and still hodl bitcoin is from the fact that bitcoin never really wavered from it's detractors like Mt. Gox incidents, the SEC on their tail, and just general group of FUD spreaders and bitcoin critics saying that bitcoin is dumb and that it will go down sooner than we'd expect and bitcoin has proven them to be wrong time and time again.3. I'll be hodling my bitcoin until bitcoin has reached the price that I want to sell those bitcoins, it's going to be taking a long time though as I've set an absurd amount for my goal so for now, I'll just keep on hodling and buying bitcoins through DCA.",

Profiting from Bitcoin requires patience and the ability to hold long-term, not luck. Huge amounts of people have invested in Bitcoin and those who have been patient and invested for a long time are reaping the profits. Does this mean everyone is lucky? It's an investment and investing involves risk  So everyone has to take the risk of investing in Bitcoin but it can't be left to luck",

What makes you keep believing and holding BTC?When will you hold BTC until?1. Holding Bitcoin is not easy, especially for new investors. This period is filled with diverse challenges such as fear of the unknown. There are always negative events that will force you to dispose of your coins. Just like every other Investment that involves planning and risk, putting money and profiting from it is never luck. People who lack basic knowledge about Bitcoin are the ones who think that making a profit from it is luck because they don't know what investors pass through before profiting from the sector. They assume that Bitcoin is like gambling because they fail to understand that it takes planning, persistence, and sacrifice to invest. 2. The history of Bitcoin shows clearly that it is a dependable investment. There have been diverse speculations that it will not stand the test of time, but over the years it has proved critics wrong. I have seen and heard stories of individuals who have benefitted from Bitcoin because they held it for a long time. I am confident because Bitcoin is different from other coins that have lost relevance within a short period.3. For me Bitcoin is a lifelong Investment. I will always use the DCA strategy to invest in the sector. It will always be my first Investment choice as long as I live.",

There are phases that will be passed through which are very challenging so not everyone can handle them.Indeed, when people are able to go through all these processes, in the eyes of other people they only see the profits and victories that we achieve, but actually they never know how we went through to get to the point we wanted.",

They love to focus on the extremes, good or bad.  But for most folk I'd think Bitcoin sits somewhere in the middle.  Its an investment with a lot of potential but has its fair share of unknowns too.Here's my two sats on your questions:Is the profit of BTC holders just from luck?Yes, timing those big spikes takes some fortune tellin, so there's definitely a luck factor involved. But having a strategy matters too. If you do your homework, get the risks, and white-knuckle through the lows, that takes some guts. So, it's not all just blind luck.Are you a BTC holder? YesWhen will you hold BTC until?Ideally, you hodl until Bitcoin reaches its full potential, whatever that may be. But everyone has different risk tolerances, so selling some for profit along the way isn't a bad idea either. Me, I have my own strategy and goals that I don't want to talk about publicly. For now, I'm focused on accumulating as much as I can, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't take some profits when the real bull run kicks in.",

I guess to some of us, it is luck but you getting just right has to have some explanation out there and you just didn't know it so you say that it's all luck, I think that you invested at the right time and coincidentally it was at that time that bitcoin is on the verge of surging up.",
