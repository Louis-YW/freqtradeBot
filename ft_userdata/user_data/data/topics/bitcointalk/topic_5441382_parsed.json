But I think it's only for online businesses where the customers ask to add crypto payment, while offline businesses you can directly use fiat to pay anything without need to ask if they're really accept Bitcoin payment and I don't think there's a big demand from the customers.",

Another reason is because of the lack of regional restrictions, unlike fiat that has restrictions Bitcoin can be used anywhere without the fear of restrictions.",

You know that it's quite difficult to make transactions if your target is international. bitcoin or altcoins will make that transaction easier. however, its other goals are also to increase profits, as well as accumulating assets while doing business.",

But merchants do have other reasons as well to accept crypto payments.What's your reason?  I think the proper question should be, what are the reasons why we feel more  merchants should accept Bitcoin as a means of payment in their stores. We don't have much merchant on the forum so asking the questions from their angle won't yelled much positive response. I'm not a merchant anymore but if I still run my personal business I'll accept Bitcoin.The reason I'll accept Bitcoin is because I'll be exposing my business to a new fan base. People might just patronized me because I'm accepting Bitcoin and those who do so will spread the message and I'll be getting free publicity without spending any penny. If Bitcoin isn't consider illegal in my country I see no reason why not to accept it. Means of exchanging it to my local currency is very accessable and I can do that with my phone so what's there not to accept it. Merchant are missing out on profit as people are looking for means to spend their Bitcoin.",

Customers are asking merchants to accept crypto as payment for services they are providing. Well, this is a really basic reason. But merchants do have other reasons as well to accept crypto payments.What's your reason?  It's a payment method that you can easily accept and it's a currency that you can easily exchange. It's both at the same time and has millions of users. Why shouldn't anyone accept bitcoin?  It's volatility can be a little tricky cause it can go from 20K to 18K in a minutes sometimes and during the payment process your $20 value product can become $18 during the transaction confirmation timeframe but opposite can happen too but it's not a huge deal and no one has ever stopped by this reason alone.I want to underline the greatest advantage of bitcoin payments: You can install and setup BTCPay server on your website and accept bitcoin payments without any 3rd party payment gateway companies. This gives you full control on addresses and you don't have to pay any fee to anyone, so all the money, 100% amount of coins goes into your address.",

Businesses will be more than happy if accepting cryptocurrency payments will help them to find new customer base. Otherwise crypto payment option is a risk to the businesses purely due to the price volatility. Last week I had to renew my hosting plan for my business. This time I have ditched my usual hosting service provider and went ahead with Hostinger because they were accepting crypto payments. So I purchased a hosting plan for 4 years. That's what I mean by customer acquisition.",

What their customers ask for and if their requests are legit, practicable, merchants will consider to integrate it into their platforms.Adding cryptocurrency payments also help merchants to expand their customer population to more people. Like one cryptocurrency project announces its partnership with a merchant and their cryptocurrency can be used on that platform, their community members will want to explore the merchant platform.For unbanked people, they will see chance to use cryptocurrency and get access to merchants as well.

The market prices are simply having higher rate of increase in comparison with other type of investments, therefore generating bigger profit. In terms of being an alternative mode of payment, there are still problems for it to be the possible reason from doing so. It is more likely for merchants to fail sustaining their business or to partially lose whenever the market price is falling. It has advantages in terms of anonymity and avoiding taxes but for sure such thing is not that needed on a regular basis when purchasing marketable goods.",

Banks in my country limit the amount citizens can transfer or use for business transactions. Also, the banking charges sometimes are very high, hence bitcoin transactions offer cheap transaction fees. Bitcoin transactions to a large extent are fast and more reliable than most banking transactions that are always affected by network issues. Although it is wrong, some business owners accept Bitcoin to invade taxation. Some business owners might want to keep their business dealings private which is why they use bitcoin.",

But merchants do have other reasons as well to accept crypto payments.What's your reason?  If I had a business, medium or small, I would have started accepting bitcoin as a means of payment a long time ago to attract attention. That is, in fact, I would use it as a marketing ploy. I don't think that at first there would be many buyers willing to pay in btc. Of course, it depends on the services provided and human traffic.Another reason is the ability to accumulate bitcoin. For example, if it is an online service, let's say, for the sale of educational materials, then I would be ready to keep received btc's for payment. Because it doesn't require circulating the profits received.Another reason: to keep up with the times. This allows you to keep up with the development of the market and overtake slow competitors. It's like accepting credit card payments when everyone else is still cash-only, like it was quite recently (a couple of decades ago). When people experience the convenience and benefits, paying with a bitcoin will pay off handsomely for business.",
