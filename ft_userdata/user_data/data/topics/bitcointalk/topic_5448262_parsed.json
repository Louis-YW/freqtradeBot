When government banned cryptocurrencies trading or transaction in Nigeria in February 2021 they were only possible to freeze accounts on banks that actually had done crypto transactions but weren’t able to get funds stored on non custodian wallets. Although this will also frustrate many that actually trade on centralized exchanges because they are the easiest platforms that the government will target but it will be had to accomplish.",

There was no place to spend the gold either so the value changed for it.Also, this was not to 'stop people from owning gold' but the main reason was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve preventing it from increasing the money supply during the depression. The restriction was only around for 40 or so anyway and probably had no real meaning after the first few years. Even now, most real precious metal investors (not the ones you see on TV, but the people that do it for a living) don't really invest in gold.But, with a purely digital medium such as crypto. Taking away the places to spend it, except F2F would kill it's use here in the US.-Dave",

I really think that if any government tries this, it would lead to violence amongst citizens because no one would want their hard earn coins to be taken by the government and without any reason, do nothing. definitely the government would have to provide a good reason for such act as this may bring about unrest. so I think it is unlikely, for the government to seize cryptocurrencies just like the US government did to gold this may cause instability in the country.",

There is a big risk to using KYC platforms. It will be easy for the government to only succeed in such a ploy if every Bitcoin user is using KYC platforms to purchase their crypto, but the identities of those that use DEX platforms cannot be exposed.",

Now I hope the governments do this only for tracking criminals who are rampant in this sector hiding in plain sight as common users.This is difficult to manage and with KYC based exchanges this is tough indeed.

Criminalizing cryptocurrencies will instantly make investors in the sector fugitives because people will start hiding from law enforcement agencies.

Although this is a very highly unlikely situation, before the government can generally decide to seize all bitcoin holdings which is not possible, they will need to know the identity of the users and the exact amount of bitcoins they have which can easily be seen on the Blockchain and identity determined from KYC verification that you must have submitted to an exchange at some point. But this will not be totally possible because there bitcoin mixing services that people have engaged to ensure that their anonymity is increased and their transactions on the Blockchain not traceable. For people who mix their bitcoins, it is difficult to know the exact amount of bitcoins that they have.",
