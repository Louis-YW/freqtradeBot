  "content": "I'm designing a wallet that is going to use a Bitcoin Core node to fetch balances of addresses. And yes I am storing master public keys using standard BIP44 derivation. So in other words: m/44'/0'/0'/0/[0-1000 or whatever] and m/44'/0'/0'/1/[0-1000 or whatever], for legacy addresses for example. Other types of addresses are constructed similarly.But I cannot figure out how to fetch the balance of these xpubs as a descriptor. I would prefer the UTXOs be separated from each other and tagged with the address they belong to.Of course, if I was working with single addresses, I could just use importaddress, but legacy wallets are deprecated and will be removed soon.And for example, this fails with \"Error -5 missing checksum\": bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=some_wallet importdescriptors '[{\"desc\": \"addr(<address>)\", \"timestamp\": \"now\"}]'I'm running Bitcoin Core 24.0.",
