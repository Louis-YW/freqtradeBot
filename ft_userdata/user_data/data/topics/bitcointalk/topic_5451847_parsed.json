I always say that if someone has the capacity to predict future market then why he is not making a fortune with such ideas rather selling them for few bucks. If you don't have time to analyze market then better don't jump into this industry which is volatile all the time. You will thank me later.",

So suggest me some best signal group.Why not work out your own analysis instead of relying on signal services that are 90% fake and have no results, there are a lot of trading signal groups on telegram but I won't advise any one to risk their money following those trading signals. Quote from: isomoyes on May 07, 2023, 03:58:05 PMI dont have time for analysis. This is where your major problem that will lead to loses come from, the best form of trading patterns that guarantee profits is combination of signal and your trading analysis that way you mix the decision and minimize the risk of making a bad trading decision in the long run.",

Further, if you're relying on a signal group, you're trusting a stranger over the internet who won't take any responsibility hence another fragile aspect.",

You can just analyse the market yourself and try to trade confidently. It’s always advised that when in risk “your money “ is there, then you should only listen to “your calls”. Nevertheless Telegram’s alternative can be twitter. Just follow 4-5 big crypto whales or traders there, and buy or sell according to their calls. Wish you all the best OP.",

That's funny to think that you have no time for analysis, a person that don't know how to analyze and then seen that these groups are not helpful won't even join one and will rely to himself and news. But if this what you think that will give you some good gains, you're thinking the wrong thing IMO.",

So suggest me some best signal group.Don't make the same mistake I made bud, \"I don't have time for analysis\" was exactly what  caused me to end up a victim to several scam groups all in the name of searching for a signal service..You can search through Google, you will find loads of signal service groups and channels leading to telegram, as well as those leading to Twitter, but I tell you something, out of 100 percent of those, 99.9 percent are scam groups and channels, while the remaining 0.1 percent can only be legitimate for a while, then turn scam too.Scam does not necessarily mean they will take your money and run away, no, they can manipulate the price of a coin through their followers, make profit, while they leave their followers in various degrees of losses.Best way to trade is doing it based on your own analysis, simple.",

Not all free telegram signals are legit and not all paid ones are accurate as well. But some of them you may find in discord I think rather than in telegram. I've subscribe to a paid signal channel before and got upset, so I learned the basics myself so that I will not blame other people as well for the non accurate signals.",

You saying you don't have time to do some active work on how to ensure that your making a good call at your trading simply means, trading isn't your thing or you just don't value your money.Its just not the best of ideas to hope that, some one would do all the hard work for you while you go about copy trading. Perhaps you might not be good at analysis but, you might as well grow confident through series of failure if you fail. Its the one way to get better.If you've got something more engaging and takes your time away from conscious trading, you might as well focus on that too.",

And they are not answered well because this is not something you could get in just asking but more like connections. Signals mostly came from a private group of traders and not in a big forum like this where everyone could see what they are discussing. How to find them? That will be one heck of an adventure in both Telegram and Discord. It's not like they are in public, and it's not like every signal service is an honest one, most of them are scam attempts and will leave you hanging once they get what they needed from you.

If a telegram signal providers can give signal then What's wrong with you that you can't do this? Telegram signal providers will charge fee for providing signal. If they are pro trader then why they itself didn't buy to make more then fee they charge. I will suggest to do your own study over trading, learn well and then start trading according to your strategy. zin this you will be able to take trade with money management easily.Telegram Signal will be look like thisLong Btc 28200Tp1: 28300Tp2: 28400Tp3: 28500stop loss: 28000what a joke they are doing with signal followers.",

To earn money in society you also need to work hard, you cannot ask someone to work for you, and you will get paid without doing anything. In this market too, no one is kind enough to be able to help you earn free money without you paying any price. What you are looking for is a scam, and if you are stubborn in looking for it, you will soon see the consequences.",

Am sure you will have been receiving lots of personal messages, people will have been sending you Telegram trading signal groups, and some will be offering to give you signal and you will be paying them, all of them just want to steal from you, they will be giving you fake signals, and you will be the one to lose, because they will collect money from you for the signal and you will also lose in the trade which they provided the signal.

Too confused and as if your trading is the same as what is shared in the trading signal group. That's the problem, instead of trying to learn more and break that signal dependency. Trading crypto assets is high risk and that risk leads you to difficult choices while constantly monitoring useless trading signals. They trade at high volume levels but you don't. They already know when to log in and out, but you don't. They sell, you enter to buy, and they TP, you lose. Trust me group trading signals do nothing for you. If you're ready to prove it works, can you show it here? start taking a wrong step, then whatever trading path is taken, you are completely lost.",
