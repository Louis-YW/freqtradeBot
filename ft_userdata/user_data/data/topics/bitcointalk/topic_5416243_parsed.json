I think it's really helped revitalize the sport in a big way.  For those of you who don't know who Le'Veon Bell is an ex-NFL running back (a very good one too).  He recently just knocked out one of the best running backs of all time Adrian Peterson which you can see here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3Ip1_ItIv4Excited for this fight. What do you all think?? \"A unique football-versus-MMA matchup has been added to the Jake Paul vs. Anderson Silva undercard.Former NFL All-Pro running back Le'Veon Bell will face ex-UFC fighter Uriah Hall in a pro boxing match Oct. 29 in Glendale, Arizona.The four-round contest has been contracted at 195 pounds and neither man can be above 200 pounds on weigh-in day, per officials. Bell and Hall, who are making their professional boxing debuts, will wear 10-ounce gloves. The card is being promoted by Paul's Most Valuable Promotions and distributed by Showtime pay-per-view\". https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/34739492/leveon-bell-fight-ex-ufc-fighter-uriah-hall-oct-29",

Also an exhibition match answers the what ifs of fans who is willing to pay just to have an answers to those what ifs.  Exhibition fight is a special fight of course, it tends to give a special payment to those participating athlete.",

So it will go and continue as long as the paying public is willing. And then there is another factor, the gamblers, who as well willing to bet on this kind of fights. Pro gets their spotlight though, in a regular ring with an opponent, referee and judges and belt on the line. But not sure if they are getting more as compare to this exhibition fighters.",

And of course, there are fewer MMA fighters as compare to boxers, in which boxing exist till the turn of the centuries. And so obviously, boxers will have to compete with a lot while MMA you can have 5 straight wins and then you are guaranteed for a title fight.Th Paul brothers is different though, there are more of exhibition fighters rather that pure professional boxer so the market is very different.",

The influence of the stars like Floyd who has all the skills in the world of boxing and also has the skills to make money didn't make a significant effect to new athletes. The only part they tried understanding is to make money.  Watched the full fight of Adrian Peterson vs Le'veon Bell, we can obviously see how they are not able to learn yet how boxers do it to get a better angle and make the full strength using the foot work.",

If the market becomes too saturated with unvetted amateurs competing at the highest levels.This is good for entertainment purposes. Although I am not a fan of events like this. I would rather see real MMA and boxing. It is hard to compare boxing and MMA because they are really different sports. It's like saying that it is easy to play chess which is true but is it easy to make it to the world level or IM or GM?The numbers of fights are sometimes misleading. Most MMA from the big leagues like UFC, Bellator, and ONE spent years in kickboxing, boxing, wrestling, and many other forms of combat sports. Just like boxing too, even if Lomachenko, Inoue, and Usyk became world champions in 10 or fewer fights but they spent years as amateurs.The point is there are more boxers that are earning millions of dollars even in their early 20s and some of them are not even world champions like Ryan Garcia. In the UFC (the biggest stage of MMA) you'd be glad to earn a title shot before 30. And we all know both sports can generate as much money but shares to boxers are way too bigger. The biggest superstars in boxing can become highest paid athletes if they fight 3 times a year.Jake Paul's entry into boxing hasn't changed the usual real boxing competition and its purse. Jake Paul only opened the door to more celebrity boxing events either professional or not, although they are not really sanctioned by the major boxing organizations.",

Just look at how NFL fans now realize boxing can be a good sport to learn not just football since this is a kind of martial art to defend yourself.I find it entertaining actually but they got to have some special training the kind that boxers do. Because this is also a combat sport that can damage them, blocking jabs should be easy for them to learn.",
