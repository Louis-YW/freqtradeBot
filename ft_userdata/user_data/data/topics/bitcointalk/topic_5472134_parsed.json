However its unclear how do I spend now given those funds were transferred to another address for privacy.Can someone guide?Damn! Based on your explanation, it does not look good at all. Electrum does not do anything on its own. It seems your wallet was hacked, and the hacker managed to wipe it. As a result, your funds are lost, and you cannot access them anymore. Do you have access to your wallet? How many confirmations does the transaction receive? If it's not too late (I guess it's too late already), you can change the destination. Try to access your wallet and check if you see its balance.Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 30, 2023, 01:15:46 AMYou can not use watch-only wallet to spend because it only has the bitcoin address or the master public key. If you want to spend the coin, you will need to import the seed phrase or the private key of the wallet into Electrum (for you to be able to spend the coin).It seems his wallet is hacked based on his words, as he said his coins were transferred to another address.",

You are correct, I made a mistake. Someone knows his seed phrase or his private key and use it to steal his coins.@rparpani0With watch-only wallet, your coin can not be stolen, but likely where you backup the wallet seed phrase or private key was known to someone and it is used to compromise your wallet. Know that it is not from the watch-only wallet that the attack occured from. Do not use the wallet again.For a better offline backup, you can use a passphrase next time. This will generate you different keys and addresses and makes your backup secure. You can backup the seed phrase and passphrase differently in different locations. Know that if you lose the passphrase, it is like you lose the seed phrase because your coins will also be lost.",

What forbids you from accessing your wallet and checking if it is okay or not? How much Bitcoin was transferred? I don't want to know the amount, but was it partial or the full amount? I don't think any wallet can generate a new address on its own and send Bitcoin between addresses for privacy reasons. It's only possible if someone has access to the wallet. You should check it yourself. Or you can share your Bitcoin address if you don't mind.",

If your Bitcoin are gone then it isn't something that has been done automatically via Electrum's side but someone else got access to your wallet and manually moved the funds to their wallets.Like other members I also think that it happened because of the hardware wallet Cold card that you used. I really don't like hardware wallets at all because they can be manipulated easily by the hackers and can sell those online which users buy blindly. It's always better to have a software wallet in an air-gapped system as that's the best way to secure your Bitcoin, and that one can't be hacked unless you connect it to internet or share your seed phrase and private keys to someone.",
