In curbing the menace of jungle justice in our today's society, i think there are laws already in our constitution to deal with it. But i will go further to make the law bite hard on offenders if I'm to make recommendations going forward. for instance, if your a traditional ruler in a community that a Said incident of jungle justice occurred, your to face charges for murder, if you're also a Local government chairman in charge of that LGA, you too are to face charges for murder. Doing this will make the leaders of various communities and towns to be proactive and vigilant because they will easily pass the message of not killing people unjustly to their wads easily.",

So if government can pass a law about \"Jungle Justice\" & be serious about it, that whoever is found to be guilty of such to face life imprisonment, I'm sure this menace will drastically stop.",
