Most Nigeria churches now are being treated as private business which it's sole aim is to make profit and for them to continue making the profit and meet up with competitors they have to advance on the  market demand just as a normal business owner will do for it's business, if the church will want to adopt the crypto payment option, they will not even have to pass the address from member to member with the way thing has been modernize in the Nigeria churches now they will just have to display the address on the TV screen or projector which will be a faster means for it to be seen by other members. That way self other members will be able to see how much was raised each service as they can scan through the address on their own, without needing the permission from secretary to access it, it will be a good thing in one part and also bad from the other part.",

I think using or a church having a Bitcoin wallet shows how desperate they are and would leave no stone unturned just to get funds out of members. What are your thoughts about it .It can only be thought about in two ways, the first being the important one and the second one which can be negligible. The first one which is; bitcoin adoption which we have been clamoring for is now becoming a reality and all bitcoin enthusiast will feel happy for this new development and will want such to continue in other parts of the country too. It’s a commendable effort and I see nothing wrong in that.While the second point is that; the mindset the churches are having for employing that method of payment of tithe is something personal and between them and their creator. If they are doing it solely for business sake/extortion of their members then our view won’t matter since it’s something spiritual to handle between themselves. And for the second purpose which could be another motive for this, then we’ll always commend it as bitcoin enthusiasts.",

Because most of the bitcoin users around the church won't know how to scan or use the app,  so this will bring us back to using our naira to settle all those bills with zero fees. Bitcoin is too precious to gamble around with all in the name of religion where there is cash to settle that,  and the pastors or imams should know better if they truly understood Bitcoin before implementing it into the church.",

E good as people don de accept and understand cryptocurrency but as e be say even churches don de accept bitcoin as offering e don de too obvious say them just wan just de use members make money so no matter any form of payment you claim say u get dem go make sure say dem go fit accept am. Sometimes when people talk about how the church use to make so much money from its members I usually don’t believe but using God’s name for business purpose in the house of God is not a good thing.

      "body": "Op you never really knack the point of the topic. Want I am getting from the content is different from the topic, you are beating around the bush. What really happened that made you to create this thread? Did any church using bitcoin as you know? Please be specific and clarify us so we can argue from a good point of view. But like this you are keeping us in the state of dilemma and suspense. If churches accept bitcoin then it is a plus to us in Nigeria because bitcoin will be use in the local market and shops because it is an indication that lower class people will use bitcoin in their dealing of transaction. Because as the church has started accepting bitcoin before we know other firms and enterprises will also accept it. And why I am saying that other businesses will accept it because in the Church, the secretary, treasurer, and other management members in the church board are from the market place and business men and women so if such thing happened in the church and they are aware that bitcoin is a good investment then, you will see them investing in it. And from there the good news will spread around to other places and before we know everyone will be using it. Yes we all know that, contemporary church pastors using different ways to extort members but the church I am going is not extorting money from members because the resident pastor is strongly against all that, we only put offering and tithe, and not blessing and prayer fees. And if churches have bitcoin wallet, it doesn't mean they are desperate but probably the pastor in the church is a computer literate and he is good with internet technology and he fully understand bitcoin so he might announce to his members that bitcoin oriented to use it to pay tithe if they want it and not for offering but for tithe, though all depends on the church. I have not even seen a pastor of a church preached about bitcoin but I have taught bitcoin in the church from the Sunday School Class because the topic was technology and discussed bitcoin from there and many members were oriented and given the awareness of bitcoin from that day. This is a good topic but your content is too shallow. Please you can edit the thread and put flesh to it.",

Anything stopping the christians or other religious bodies from adopting or accepting or creating their own crypto currency is but a limitation of their knowledge and resources. It would make sense to accept crypto currency in places of worship, but is it the legal tender of the country or hope it won't become an issue that might fall back to the crypto community, incase the government is looking for culprits as examples?",

Provided say the churches no dey use the thing extort their members I no get problem with am. If na just normal tithe and offering wey be say we go just scan the church address from barcodes I no get problem with am. Where I go get problem na when dem start dey ask for specific offering like those wey get Bitcoin to income out like like dem dey do now with all those 10k, 5k, special offering just to use extort money for their selfish selfs. Churches fit follow increase the awareness of bitcoin for the country because church na one thing wey we dey believe die for this country.

What are your thoughts about it .Make we commot all biasness and forget anything wey we dey hear about churches but use a clear mind reason the thing. The world dey evolves and you no expect churches to dey backwards. Why church dey use the latest microphone dem and other things, why dem no remain for that old days type it's because they're trying to make your worshipping experience better. You fit talk the same thing for pos and Bitcoin, churches know now say people no too dey carry cash again so to make our worshipping experience better, it's only ideal that they give us an opportunity to make our tithing less stressful. One thing about life is, they way you expect to gain your success from mightn't be what will actually give you your breakthrough in life and church adopting Bitcoin is definitely going to be more positive as more people will get to know about Bitcoin. Remember what brought about Bitcoin exposure in Nigeria isn't what we all expected will do it which is ponzi scheme.",
