It is fairly simple because you don't need to know how other application works on a low level, what language it is written in or how it handles incoming requests. You make requests to provided API endpoints, get some data in response and use this data in your application. Before making a request, however, you need to obtain a special API key from a service you are trying to connect to so that it knows that request is authorized and not coming from random source. If you are interested in using API of particular platform, you should consult its API documentation in which you will find how to find endpoints and how to create correct requests.",
