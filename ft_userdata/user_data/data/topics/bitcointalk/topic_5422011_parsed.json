  "content": "Hi folks, I'm curious to know what the general preference is regarding Auctions lengths, Short Auctions: 48 hours - Creates greater interest and engagement in the forum- Greater turnover of products and innovation- excitement - Higher vigilance of buyersLong Auctions: Up to 5 Days - Greater and more prolonged exposure to the post- An opportunity for many forum members to be exposed for sale, active/inactiveI would be happy if you share your opinion on the subject   QB",

There’s a lot of potential buyers on here who don’t view the forum but maybe once every week or two, and I feel like you’re setting yourself up for a bit less or a return if you’re not running them for a full week. Of course you can run shorter ones that do every bit as well, but I feel like you get a better shot with a full week.",
