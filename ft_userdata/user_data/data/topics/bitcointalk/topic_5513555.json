Could give them a better understanding of the \"why\" behind the price movements (like halvings or major news stories.) Anyway, fun idea.  Surprised I havent seen something similar before.  Making me think maybe I should track my net worth this way, ha! Lifes ups and downs in technicolor.  Could be motivational or could drive me crazy. Hahaha!",

I especially love the way you designed Bitcoin Supply Countdown. I think it will be good if you also include the portion of lost Bitcoins in red color in that supply. If you are a developer, this project is a good presentation of some of your skills, include this website in your portfolio.Put donation address if you would like. I believe, some people might donate.To be frank, your website makes me sad, especially when I set years to 2009, 2010, 2011.",

Hopefully, it's not there to give the impression that it can only go up in value.- BTW, With regard to the DCA part that you're currently working on, you might want to also add an end date.Quote from: Big0ne on October 17, 2024, 05:57:31 PMIs there something I can add to make it more informative for newcomers?  The historical data on \"archived pages\" of the New Liberty Standard [first Bitcoin exchange] might come in handy [their data starts from \"October of 2009 (roughly nine more months of data)\"].",

There are two things that I particularly liked the most. The first one is the chart displayed from the date selected to the current date. The second thing is the circles showing the percentage of the predicted prices of people.There are a couple of things that I wanted to mention. In the section where \"Buy First Bitcoin\" and \"Bitcoin Wallets\" are mentioned, I noticed that you didn't mention the most popular centralized exchanges such as Binance. I first thought that maybe because it requires KYC, but then I thought that even Cash App requires you to pass KYC before you can purchase Bitcoins and Kraken as well. I also believe that Electrum wallet deserves to have a number higher than 5, also, Electrum is also available on mobile, so you should add \"Desktop/Mobile\" in front of it.I also had one suggestion about the chart if you can add it. I noticed that currently, the timeline is set to weekly which means the interval between shown price points is a week. Can you add more options for that such as 1D, M, etc.?",

Electrum also has a mobile version, which is only available for Android users.",

In side to side with apple or nvidia stocks, bought at the same time and maybe visuals that represent the difference clearly (charts etc).But i love the fact that you use examples like how many gaming rigs or restaurant visits you would get. That would be fun to see as in comparison in the start. Like how many cigarettes, expensive dinners you could buy with the initial investment during the time of initial investment, if you decided to buy something else.",
