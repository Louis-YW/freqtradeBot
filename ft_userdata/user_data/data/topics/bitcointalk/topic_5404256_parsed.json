  "content": "Hey everyone,I have been using a blockchain wallet for a long time(almost 8 years now). Lately, I have been accessing the wallet on my andriod phone. But yesterday my phone's charging port malfunctioned and it has been shut ever since. So I tried to access my blockchain.com wallet(since I am going to receive wasabi sig payment on it soon), and I can't go beyond the password stage. I am 1000% sure that my password is correct and it shows no error message. Nothing at all. When I click on \"Login\" after entering my password, it transitions into a loading button for a few seconds then changes back into an active login button again. There's no other change on the login page. I tried logging into blockchain app on my backup phone(which I have been using after my primary phone went dead). On it, I am taken to a recovery page after entering my password. Either I have to provide my 12-code security key or reset my wallet. It's a 8 year old wallet, I don't even remember where I kept my recovery code lolI am booting my childhood PC(after I fix it), maybe it has the keys. Maybe it doesn't.According to blockchain's mail, my wallet was Last Accessed on Mon, June 13, 2022(which is true, and that was probably me. Can't be sure). And there's an active transaction on my address, which happened todayhttps://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qcfr52tdsj0wz4jxza9pg0sx3epn5nce4get3jf?page=1I am also receiving deposits of $40, which I think are from betfury sig campaign. Even though I left that campaign. I will obviously pay them back if it's from them. Whether or not I am able to recover my wallet.Edit : There's no transaction on my address. I have been checking someone else's address. Don't know how landed on it, checking my history  Is my wallet compromised? if it's compromised then how come there's still some balance on it.Or is it some pairing problem? Has anyone experienced this before? If yes, then do you think I will be able to access my wallet on the primary phone once it gets fixed(couple of days)?My wallet also contains my staked address    1edgym1sR5wLyhiziT8nk5spF1MUWAJcA",

I have been using Maestro75's address ever sinceI remember copy-pasting the address from my betfury post when I applied on some other campaign. Looks like I copied Maestro75's in the process and not mine. Luckily I received nothing on it.No surprise that address kept on receiving campaign money, even though I left it a long time ago.Here's my real broke address of that walelt https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qp0f85yu60yl0vp7x24a2un6vjjlg8wpzu9dz6yThis is some Lock, Stock and two smoking barrel(the shootout in the end ofc) scenario lolMy walet is safe, definitely some pairing problem.Edit: I am dumb. I never used Maestro75's address. I have the wrong address in my post lol Before somebody puts their tinfoil hat on, this is how I landed on the wrong address while creating this postMy history: https://imgur.com/a/9YszCkYExplanation: I searched for my address on google, and opened the first link to check transactions. But guess what, the first search result isn't my address   Ignore the striked-out part of my post.",

It's a 8 year old wallet, I don't even remember where I kept my recovery code lolIt does not matter how old the wallet is, you should have kept your 12-code security/seed somewhere safe. What if Blockchain.com shuts down there business or anything happen to the company. You will lose access of the wallet or safe to say you will be in trouble.Did you try to use another browser, cleaning your cache? Quote from: edgycorner on June 27, 2022, 04:33:11 PMI am booting my childhood PC(after I fix it), maybe it has the keys. Maybe it doesn't.Hopefully you find the key. If you do then make sure you write down the 12 word seed in a paper and keep it in a safe place.Best practice is to forget about this wallet. Once you get the key, create a new wallet in Electrum, transfer the coins to the new wallet. Write down the seed of the new wallet in metal or in something that is fire proof. There are many techniques to keep your seed safe in physical form. Use whichever easier for you.",

Same thing, the button transitions into loading style then back to active with no message. And on my backup mobile, it's displaying \"authorization failed\" followed by \"pairing problem\" constantly now. I will wait until my primary phone is back, as my wallet is logged in there. If for some reason I am unable to access it on my old phone too then I will contact support. Maybe they can help.Honestly, wasn't expecting their wallet to break like this lolMaybe I still have backup, I will have to go through a dozen of hard drives. Since there's no balance in it, I would rather wait for my old phone for now lol",

      "body": "That’s really inevitable if you forgot to save the seed backup somewhere in your PC just like me when I'm totally a newbie. I have experienced using a blockchain wallet before and I can't access my wallet even though I have the correct wallet ID and password until now I can't access the wallet with some BTC inside. There is someone told me to access it with the same device where I created the wallet but the problem is my phone LCD is broken instead of hiring a technician I sold it for a cheap price and actually don't care about my wallet on that phone because Bitcoin before is not yet well-known. After that I sold it I bought a new phone and try to access my wallet again but it also do not work. So my Bitcoin on Blockchain wallet is stuck and there is no way to recover it unless I found even the aes.wallet.json file to brute-force and decrypt the wallet. Since your problem with your old phone is the charging pin/port why not disassemble the unit there are some guides on youtube on how to disassemble the unit and try to fix the charging port replacing it actually is very cheap it's around 10 cents but if it's iPhone charging port is around $2 I guess. After you fix the phone maybe you can still able to access it with your old phone like someone said to me before that you can only access it with the same device where you created your wallet.",

Just make sure to be careful on the attached flex subboard to the mainboard.Alright, just purchased this precision screwdriver for 3 dollars.I will get it by Sunday. This option will be cheaper for me. And I can charge the battery externally until I get the spare part.I will get to learn something too. I have never fixed an electronic appliance(except for PC ofc) on my own. This will be a start.Thanks!",
