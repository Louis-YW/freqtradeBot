I never know how important a mentor is to investors when I nearly lost my $300,000 few years ago, until I found a potential mentor who thought me when to sell my coins to make a good income and when not to sell not to experience losses in the market.Who is a mentor?A mentor is a someone who help people to achieve their common goals. Mentor never give up on helping people until they began to see a good results coming out from them. Mentor don't scam people who are trying to rise like them than to help them to stand well.Do we still have potential mentor in crypto community today?I love Satoshi because he was a great mentor i have never see in the whole world, for building a great family like this, that will produce future president's of different countries and senators that will make this decentralized currency fully legalized in the whole world.",

I doubt there's a legit mentor will guide you about how trade Bitcoin since no one can control it, it's different if your mentor tell you to trade shitcoin. He might a shills or the CEO, that's why he ask you to buy shitcoins.",

By your definition — especially knowing that you're talking about Satoshi himself (whom you most probably never talked to), you're describing more of an inspiration or role model, than a \"mentor\".",

Mentorship comes in different ways and you have to draw a line between mentorship and a role model Santoshi is a role model as a mentor is someone with who you can actively get involved with both communication and relationship bodily and doesn't have to be from afar.",

Satoshi may be your role model, or you may be inspired by him, but either way, he wasn't your mentor. Especially not when it comes to crypto trading, because he never said anything about it, as far as I know.

You don't have to pay someone to teach you some trading knowledge because now there is a lot of useful knowledge shared for free whether you like visualization or something else. YouTube, articles from several trusted sources can be good mentors for that. Satoshi didn't tell me how to be a good trader, but the experience of other traders has given me a lot of knowledge about how I should start trading.",

In trading you need someone who should handhold you towards the right direction and make you a trader who doesn't runs behind mere profits rather takes up trading as an exercise to churn return on his investments in a longer term by taking profits when market is favourable and taking loss when market is unfavorable.",

It's more on you are acting not a real trader or, lol.

So it is best if you can find it via personal connections or within your close contacts. It is very rare that you can find a valuable mentor that is reliable and won't take advantage of you in terms of financial matters. I don't have mentor in crypto trading, I just learned the tricks throughout the years of being in this market. So whatever I want to trade, I still do my own background check for the coin.",
