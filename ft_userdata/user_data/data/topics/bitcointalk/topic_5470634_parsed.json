  "content": "So far, the majority of the network’s hashpower has been allocated to the top-tier mining pools (foundry, f2pool, antpool, binance pool, and others). yet, it’s interesting to note that smaller, lesser known pools with much lower hashpower are still able to consistently mine more blocks than the big players. How are these lesser known pools able to consistently achieve such high block success despite having significantly less hashpower?",

      "body": "There are a few factors that cause that 'smaller pools' can mine more blocks than bigger players in the network.The luck factor which describes how lucky the mining pool is compared to the expectation. For example: 100% luck on a mined block means that the pool found as many blocks as expected compared to their hash rate. 50% would mean, that it was two times faster than expected.So it can happen that a 'smaller' mining pool might experience a streak of good luck - finding more blocks than expected statistically.Don't forget that there are a lot of pools that are marked as unknown. At some times it can also happen that a larger pool mined a block but the address is not attached to this specific pool - so it gets automatically marked as 'unknown' aswell.I would like to address another point that is becoming increasingly important:The diversification of hash rate among various pools, including smaller ones, is a trend that is noticed in the mining industry. Smaller pools may employ strategies or have particular attributes that enable them to mine more blocks despite having less hash power.",

      "body": "What tool did you use to see all these block data statistics?Those unknown pools are not just a single miner or a pool I think there are many it is a combined mining pool they do find more blocks compared to a big pool because they are many and they include the old data where mining pools are few because most of the miners years ago are mining solo(this is just based on what I understand).There is a block distribution tool that I think is better than the tools you use check https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/poolsYou can also use mempool to search those unknown blocks I tried a few blocks on the image you provided above and it gives me complete data including the name of the pool that mines that block. Meaning they are not unknown they do have names when you check it to mempool.",

      "body": "I also heard a lot of rumors about the SHA-256 protocolSome wonder if there could be a conspiracy afoot in which the NSA plans to use a backdoor in SHA-256 to either identify individuals or drain their wallets of funds. However, there is no evidence of this aside from the fact that the NSA contributed to the development of several hashing algorithms. It is therefore unlikely that the NSA has much to do with Bitcoin’s development otherwise. https://supraoracles.com/academy/the-nsa-and-bitcoin-origins-of-the-sha-256-hashing-algorithm/",

I used to think that everything depended solely on hash power, where the higher the hash power, the greater the rewards. However, that's not the only reason. There are other factors at play, such as the location of nodes, lower latency being better, the software and hardware used by the mining pool, the strategy, and management. But in the long run, larger mining pools still have an advantage.",
