It won't contribute/ add value to the forum, just a place to flash paid signatures around. I don't know man, do as you please, forum seems quiet nowadays maybe this is what it comes down to, fame/ shame/ contest/ awards/ catching plagiarism/ spammers , etc. Barely seeing something worth discussing.Sorry for my criticism, don't feel bad, just my thoughts.",

I am glad to see you followed my suggestion and created a revamped thread for post records.  I hope you have more free time than me and be able to update it from time to time.And, while waiting you to update OP with the screenshots from the old thread, let me be first one who posts a record inside the new thread  It's a pic from my l33t moment, but which was not posted in the old thread due to OP's lack of activity.Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on December 01, 2020, 04:42:45 AMQuote from: GazetaBitcoin on September 07, 2020, 02:37:43 PMI saved this record of mine as it happens once in a lifetime",
