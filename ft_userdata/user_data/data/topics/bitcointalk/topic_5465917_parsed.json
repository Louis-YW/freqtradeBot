  "content": "Competition in crypto is always one of the things that appears familiar in the  market. Recalling a bit of what we went through in the most recent uptrend cycle, that competition is mainly in the top L1, and is easily accessible. Things will not be like this forever, as many problems have been seen, such as operations, fees, speed,... and L2 will be a new competition to solve these problems. Why is it like that?If everyone notices that L2 listing or airdrop announcement, then the market is quite exciting, and there are quite a lot of people participating in the market.Looking at the overall data, markercap,... L2 projects always have Top crypto, TVL is also something that says many things, like a high TVL will depend on the project team working well as a whole. Use trust when staking into pools in the L2 ecosystem.A year and a half ago, I heard many people talking about ETH vs BNB in ​​the near future, but now that L2 has joined the main Ethereum network, it is creating expansion as well as bringing in more Dapps networks, and ETH's TVL has far surpassed BNB. I know the story that when entering the uptrend period, the investment tendency of traders is to use a lot of money to invest in this market, as I recently saw things about L2 investors raising money. A lot of money (there are projects raising more than $100 million) has partly determined the trend will belong to L2, at the same time, Ethereum's L1 competitors do not have many breakthroughs or marketing for money to flow in L2, which is constantly being marketed on every social channel. The upcoming Ethereum updates will aim to expand the network as well as other L2, and every time an L2 project launches a token, it is an exciting time in the crypto community.So the vision with L2 top What is that?Optimism ( OP)          TVL: ~ $704,72m          Market cap: ~ $1bArbitrum ( ARB)          TVL: ~$1,7b          Market cap:  ~$1,2bPolygon ( MATIC)          TVL: ~ $804,8m          Market cap:  ~ $5,1bI see this as the top project on L2 that I'm also paying a lot of attention to, the first project OP is quite interested in, there's a lot to say about it but I think simplification is the start, I' m sure this is one of the projects that people pay a lot of attention to and are accumulat,talking about features, the project helps reduce fees, speed up... bring smoothness but still safety.ARB with its extremely huge TVL/mc ratio, it deserves a leading position in the crypto market.As for MATIC, I see their strength as they have been around for a long time so they have enough experience and strategy._______________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________So through this, I also had a few small studies as well as speculation about L2 in the near future. Basically, most of the things that L2 needs to do well are processtransactions at a fast speed, reduce gas fees,  scales Dapp deployment, and require a strong enough MM to maintain the price. And this is also my speculation about the top L2 projects, the information and opinions are all based on personal subjective knowledge, hoping to receive everyone's contribution. In addition, you can also suggest the L2 project you are following.",

      "body": "Arbitrum is the market leader right now proven by its TVL, but I was surprised by Optimism development in recent months. We've seen several other L2s adopting the OP stack like Base and opBNB. I'm not sure whether it'll directly affect the $OP token or not (most likely not) but an interesting development regardless.As for other L2s which don't have tokens yet, I'm most excited for zkSync. The usage metrics for zkSync might be inflated now due to airdrop farmers' activity, but compared to other new L2s, e.g. Starknet, Linea, etc., it has the most hype and community support so far.Quote from: shinratensei_ on September 07, 2023, 10:31:27 PMbut i wonder if polygon could actually be categorized L2 since its standalone blockchain, the gas fee isn't even using ethereum.but speaking from the perspective of investment polygon is just as good, but I always have this thinking that polygon is basically almost the same as BSC, will always be alternative for ethereum.True. The Polygon PoS is more like a sidechain, but they are working on Polygon zkEVM which will be an L2 of Ethereum. This is already in mainnet beta phase and you can bridge some ETH assets there.",

Most importantly is, the project is legit and the team cares about the community. No wonder why they got successful. With that said, obviously their revenue's are huge. I'm not sure if Opensea has it's own token but I heard Metamask is planning on having one. There is that new Opensea competitor but it's only difference is it has a token.Even though some don't have it, interacting on their platform's alone can still help us to produce a profit. I don't think lots of users are expecting for more tokens because we have ton's of it in the market already. Some might be, because they think they can get an airdrop.",

But like woul said, hype is only for the token, not the usecase. And hype for token doesn't bring adoption, in fact it could hurt adoption when fees are complex and price of matic so fluctuating.If i recall correctly you need both matic and eth to use polygon, while you need only small amount of eth to use arbitrum. So in my eyes, simplicity wins the race if we want to lure in normies who struggle with metamask already. This is why i would like to see Arbitrum to win the adoption. And while i don't see this as simple enough either, we have come a long way from ages before metamask and eth probably gets even more easier to use.",
