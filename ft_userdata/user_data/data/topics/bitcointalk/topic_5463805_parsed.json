  "content": "Hi, I was just wondering what is the effective wattage consumption running an S19 90TH with only a single or two hashboards connected. My assumption is a single board should run at 30TH with about 1100w in hash rate mode, correct me if I’m wrong.Also, what hash rate and power consumption per board should I expect in power save mode?",

      "body": "I think the hashrate on s19 low power mode is roughly 10% so if you only had a single hashboard running at low power mode I guess it's around 24-27TH/s and power consumption of around 800-990w.If you are looking for a better power efficiency you can try to switch to Braiins OS because I heard someone improve the power efficiency by manually set the power target. You can set the power target to 800w and let's see what hashrate it can achieve but my guess is it's around 26-28th/s.",

You can set the power target to 800w and let's see what hashrate it can achieve but my guess is it's around 26-28th/s.Min/Max values varies with model/variant but each hashboard will use 1/3 of the specified power target. So if your model min is 1677, disabling or removing two hashboards means the miner will use only 559W, but note the power target value you define is 1677, not 559Keep that chip temp at 60°C to get the best efficiency, one person said that 55°C is the sweet spot, do your own tests....",
