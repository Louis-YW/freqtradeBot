  "content": "Hello, I'm not really an active user here but I've decided to check in to see if someone would be willing to be my trade peer for BTC. Preferred method would be an Amazon gift card code, 100$ in exchange for the equivalent in bitcoin (roughly 0.002887 right now as of this post). I can and will provide the code upfront before you send me the BTC so you can confirm the gift's legitimacy. However you need to be a reputable member here, just so I can be reasonably sure you're not a scammer. If you're a member no one can vouch for, perhaps we can setup some sort of security deposit (say 25%?) if that would be agreeable. I'm opened to suggestions. Escrow as well, though I'm unsure how to use such services (my only experience thus far has been centralized exchanges). Send me a message if anyone is interested. I am setup to do PGP communication as well if that's preferable to anyone. Best Regards, JohnThe not important stuff: I'm here because I wish to escape the centralize KYC oligopoly, I've looked into decentralize P2P exchanges and while I like the concept they seem pretty much dead to me. Especially places like Bisq. Basically anyone who's not buying \"cash by mail\" has a hard time finding trading partners. Or Zelle maybe, which I've seen quite a few offers for, but I'm not setup to do as of right now. As I originally said, I'm interested in escaping KYC for security and data collection purposes. I'm not really looking for fully anonymous coin. So cash by mail has no interest to me, especially when it takes so long to close the deal. Most of their minimums are frequently too high as well. I'm typically never looking to buy more than 100-200$ in BTC at one time.",

HodlHodl.comAlternative, you can post your offers on those platforms and wait for someone to see your offer and sell you the Bitcoins at your preferred rate, though it may take time.",

      "body": "Thanks, yeah I've already tried looking around on AgoraDesk with not much luck. I had an ad there but no one responded (I may post another later, just waiting to see if I find anyone here first). The other two I haven't seen before, I'll do an extensive search on them. I see a lot of the immediate offers (localcoinswap) for gift cards are charging pretty high fees. I'm more looking for someone who actually needs Amazon redeemed points, not so much people looking to make profit off the deals. I suppose I'd go as high as 5% above market value, but a lot are much much higher than that. The 9% ad looks kinda fair I guess, but I'd rather just buy 100$ worth my first time.",
