They just need to understand that the results of the post-halving event won’t really be until well after a few months.For those who will stay invested however, it will be good for them. Many will try to sell their coins allowing more people to accumulate more bitcoin in the process.",

Many huge capitals ventured into Bitcoin as a result of the ETF approval and not the halving. From past records, halving attracts more of retail short term traders who just want to buy Bitcoin before the halving and sell during the peak thereafter wait for the next market cycle. If your post is referring to such people, they have already come and some will be leaving as price continues to rise. The big players will stick around and gradually drive the market upward especially when the effect of the halving will begin to be felt in the market.",

I believe that when we hit the ATH, that's how most of the people will start getting out of the market when they've already made a lot of profit and they'll be back somehow in 2026 for the bear market and that's the time they'll buy. But getting out this early? I don't think that's a wise decision to make but who are we to stop them if they think that getting out is the best choice and decision that they can ever make.",

      "body": "Why do people invest in Bitcoin? Hard to say for sure.  Some folks probably get excited about stuff like the halving or follow the hype and think it will make prices go up.  They wanna make a quick buck.  Others are in it for the long run, believing in the technology or whatever... And, the halving seems to usually get more investors interested based on what has happened in the past.  Prices often go up quite a bit the year after.  But you never know what will happen in the future.  Markets are unpredictable. We dont have access to anyone's personal reasons for investing, you know? Newbies chase those short-term profits and will bail if things go south after the halving.  Thats markets.  But Bitcoin has shown impressive growth overall if you zoom out.  Still, past dont equal future.  Who really knows why each person buys in? People's motivations differ.  We can speculate but thats about it.",

With that, those people will for sure come across bitcoin and for sure will show interest and might engage in investing in it, and I hope it happens, because the more investors there are, the more chances there are that bitcoin will reach new heights this year. I'm also sure many of the investors will become dormant in their holdings because they might wait for the next halving, or rather, they are just waiting for a good opportunity after the bitcoin halving. I also want to ask those who are waiting for what will happen next in bitcoin: will it dump or will it reach a new ATH this year? I hope it happens.",

There was an event; the Halving, and it is expected to see people rush in to invest in Bitcoin. Let’s not feel bad if the were people who are here only for the moment, we should long for people who will start using Bitcoin as electronic cash. That’s better investment for Bitcoin’s purpose.",

These kinds of investors who disappear quickly after the hype of halving are just looking to capitalize on potential short-term gains. Nonetheless, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have steadily gained mainstream acceptance over the years. Some investors have different backgrounds and investment goals, not just because of halving. So even though the hype surrounding halving may fade, overall interest will continue to grow as they become integrated into traditional financial systems.",

However, the reason why I think the numbers of investors will not be reduced is that any investor who knows how the market works will know that he will surely get their money back if they lose now as long as they leave their money in theirs they did not sell at loss.But for the ones that came to invest without the knowledge, they only come due to greed and will sell even at a loss if they see that the market is not as favourable as they thought in the first place. But any investor who is an expert and knows how it works will be ready for a long-term investment, and he will surely get his money with profit.",

Sadly, I don't have any concrete data to show you but if you ask me, significant drops would most likely happen during the bear market aka when price corrections comes. and I don't think we're at that stage yet but we'll see. There are some speculations about continous down trend in preparation for the new ATH, if this happens, I could see some weak hands falling out lol.",

Also is the case of the bull run which normally happens after the halving to be in effect. The bull run season is a time when demand gets higher and profits are made from quick trades. Although, it would be that the ETF is the major innovation prior to the halving event, the rise in price and demand for other crypto currencies, tokens and altcoins compete with the throve of those interested in long term holding investment that BTC is sure to provide.",

So even if the investors leave, they gain nothing. because bitcoin price has been lingering around $60k to $71k and has not pushed up to $75 or $80k Which would have amounted to making more profit which they desire. so leaving now is meaningless. I believe the people who would make fortune out of this, is the long term investors not with those that came with the intention of quick profit making like the traders.",

Those who are patient will surely be rewarded and once that happens, many new investors will again be interested in bitcoin thus attracting more investors than what we already have right now.",

I'm sure that it's just the beginning of the new bull run because when it starts getting intense then the number of investors will be far more than we have currently.Everyone was waiting for a new ATH, and when they got that new ATH before halving event then they started waiting for halving event to see what's going to happen at that event, now the halving event is also gone, the investors will continue to look for other opportunities to make profit from crypto market. Some of those investors are hunting for shitcoins while others are after meme coins.The quest for taking profits will not end here and trust me the greed of the investors won't end with the halving event. We may see more pumps in coming weeks and we may see a new ATH before the end of this year or in straight words before the end of 2nd quarter of 2024.",

It's too soon to say number of new investors already started to reduce.
