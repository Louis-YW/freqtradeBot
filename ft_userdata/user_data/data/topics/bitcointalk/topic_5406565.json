Or other algorithms such as PoS accompanied by large premines has ensured centralization of such altcoins.We also have altcoins that are designed to be centralized like CBDCs (eg. Petro), stable coins (eg. USDT), exchange coins (eg. BNB), ... because they can not operate any other way not because their creator is known.",

Would the BTC blockchain be the most popular blockchain, even if Satoshi remained anonymous? I don't think so. Bitcoin Core has it's team of developers and we have to give them credit. The success of Bitcoin isn't Satoshi's achievement. He is the creator ,but Bitcoin has a community of users, developers and miners.I don't agree with your views about altcoins. You are generalizing too much. Not all altcoins are centralized shitcoins. Most of them are, but a small amount of altcoins actually have some qualities.",

(blockstream, chaincode, brink Â (chaincode&brink&blockstream majority funded by DCG))so dont be so utopian about pretending bitcoin is around because inventor has the power but chooses not to use it, while ignoring that current devs do have power and we simply hope they dont abuse it, or pretend current devs are not influenced. be risk AWARE.. that way we get to keep devs on their toes by knowing we are watching them and reviewing themif we pretend they dont have power thus ignoring them, allows them silly freedoms to change what they like and think we wont notice, care, put up a fight should they abuse it",

Bitcoin too can be called centralized in this context. Satoshi Nakamoto holds 1 Million bitcoins, which is roughly 5% of the total supply of bitcoins as it is 21 Million. This actually is too much and enough to actually call this coin centralized as well. Infact some other cryptocurrencies have even less promoter holding than this. But yes the only advantage here is that one the creator is anonymous and secondly it has not moved even a single penny from what the holds so far which indicates bitcoin is quite safe to hold and obviously much better than the rest.",
