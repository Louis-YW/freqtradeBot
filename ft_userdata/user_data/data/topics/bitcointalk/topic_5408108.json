  "content": "When the T17 kernel log shows EPPOR FAN LOST, indicates that the cooling fan of the miner is missing.https://www.zeusbtc.com/Upload/image/202206/16549373527116743.jpgThere are ways to troubleshoot:1. Check whether the fan cable is loose or damaged; it is recommended to re-plug the fan cable or replace the damaged fan data cable.2. The fan is damaged, it is recommended to replace the fan.3. Upgrade the control board firmware to the latest version.4. The control board is damaged, it is recommended to replace the control board.The above is the response given by zeusbtc for the kernel log. I wonder if there are more troubleshooting ideas?",

      "body": "the fan can be tested with a long four pin fan extension.open the controller and pull the bad fan plug out of the controller.plug it into the four pin extension.plug the extension into a 12 volt power source. see if the fan moves.if the fan moves unplug from the power source.if the fan does not move it is dead.lets say it movedtake the “bad” fan which is in the four pin extension cord and swap with one of the “working” fans in the controller.if the problem moves to the good fan jack the fan has a bad cable which may not be repaired if the problem stays  then the jack has a bad sensora fast way to test a missing fan readout  is always have a good one.open the controller plug the good fan in place of the non detectable one.if the good fan shows up the bad fan is badif the good fan does not show up the jack is bad.",

      "body": "In addition, the fan has 4 wires red, black, yellow, and blueRed = Voltage inputs 12vBlack = GroundYellow = Speed SignalBlue = PWMIf the Blue wire is not connected or has a connection problem then the fan will run at full speed but if the yellow wire is cut or no connection from the fan to the control board the controller will detect that there is no fan connected. So if the yellow wire is disconnected even if you connect the fan to the control board then the error will come up like \"error fan lost\". You can fix it by replacing the yellow wire or resoldering the yellow wire on the fan if nothing works then use a multimeter if the yellow wire or the terminal still has a connection or signal.",
