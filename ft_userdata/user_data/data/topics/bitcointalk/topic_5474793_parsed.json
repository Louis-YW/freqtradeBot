  "content": "Before I go on with my question, let me make it clear that ive search the forum, and this same topic have actually been discussed here before, but that was a very long time ago, I think around 2020/2021, and being eager to read what you guys think. Or believe concerning this, I decided to bring up the top again.Client seedCHANGING IT as frequently as possible, does this in any way increase a gambler's chances of winning?Some gambler's change their client seed after experiencing too many loses on a streak, and they believe doing this has the potential of turning their ill luck around. For some gamblers, doing this actually does work, while for some others, it simply doesn't change anything.Is this to say that, changing client seed as often as possible, (most especially when a gambler keeps losing for too long) has the potential of turning what seemed to be a long losing streak, into winning? Or is it all still based on the gambler's luck..?Lets discuss this once again.",

      "body": "All the client seed does is prove that results are pre-determined. Being able to verify outcomes shows that the casino isn't just changing your results (for example, dice rolls) based on the amount you bet. Honestly, there's no reason to believe that changing the seed gives higher chances of winning. It'll only give you another chain of pre-determined events. If you're playing dice, you can change the win-chance and also your bet amount and hi/low pick before each bet. Dice is the most versatile game in terms of betting possibilities. But the house edge is always there.So in the long run, the odds are always stacked against the player. Otherwise the games wouldn't be sustainable to host for casinos.",

And that outcome was the result of your seed.Personally, I like to use a new seed each run, and i make close to 1500 bets with each seed. But is just the way i like to gamble, i don't think this will make me win or lose more, since the client seed doesn't affect the house edge the result should be the same in the long run.",

YES/NORegular change of client seed can affect the outcome of the results of your game but it doesn't for certain ensure you will have a winning chance however with the random changing of the seed you just might be lucky to stumble on a win.Â  But it's ain't a guarantee that by changing you will have an increased winning chance.The notion behind the client seed is for transparency for both the gambler and the house against rigging, and if the changing of client seed roll out to increase winning chances then there's a problem somewhere (the casino) which makes some of the seed's questionable.",

Well I will say it doesn't operates that way I think it's a personal belief that if think you and have it in mind to work that way then it will surely, but at this point I won't directly point that increasing your seed guaranteed your winnings as we know gambling is always luck based game so what you need is \"Technicality + Luck\" then equals to winning which is still under probabilities.

Those who tweak it are usually guided by superstitious beliefs, but there's no solid evidence that it actually enhances the likelihood of winning. Nevertheless, some gamblers consider the seed to be a significant factor influencing their results. But, let's cut them some slack, it's their personal belief. In truth, when you consider reliable factors, it doesn't really change anything since the house edge persists, ultimately favoring the gambling site.",

      "body": "I created a thread that somehow discussed seeds just recently. One seed, One casino game. Superstitious or Not?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5469526.msg62959020#msg62959020I don't usually change my seed. I don't think it has something to do with our luck. There will always be that winning point but sometimes it will not be enough to cover the losses. This is where I will try to think about switching to a new seed but it will take like 20k to 50k bets before I change to a new one. In my mind, I think it will not give more than that and so I must find a new seed that hits the RTP as soon as possible so that I won't be rekt in my early session. Another way that I do this is by just refreshing the page or closing the browser and opening it again. But these are all just superstitious beliefs, in my opinion. There will always be a part of that seed that will give back but most of the time it takes longer than what we are expecting. I've seen it before where I am losing in the range of 300x - 500x before it surprises me to give x200 - x300 once or sometimes twice.The other reason why I don't switch seeds often is because I think by doing that we are refreshing the chances of receiving the jackpot which means we have to grind from the start again.",

Actually changing seed can make a difference because it changes the outcome of a bet but don't expect to start winning like crazy, if your luck is far away from you losses will come knocking, the problem lies in knowing the best seed that you could use, lots of headache if you ask me, someone claimed that a seed is the best and still lost 100k. It's best to stick to your plan of bankroll management, if you want to try any gambling strategy always make sure use only what you can afford to lose, a sport gambler wouldn't need to worry himself of client seed, choose the games that you are good at and risk only what you can afford to lose.",
