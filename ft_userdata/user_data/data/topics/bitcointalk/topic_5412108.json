  "content": "The rate of Bitcoin adoption has been slowed down since last year when two countries made Bitcoin a legal currency within their jurisdictions and also mandated all payment and financial institutions to make Bitcoin a payment option within the agencies. The major constraints to Bitcoin global adoption!Bitcoin has gained global adoption and penetration reaching even the unbanked and poorer regions without the presence of modern technologies and facilities, but with just the Internet Bitcoin can reach them and onboard them into the global financial system. But despite this, there have been limitations as to how far-reaching Bitcoin should have gotten and this limitation is traced to the presence of so many altcoins that seek to undermine the relevance factors that Bitcoin presents to gain global attention we have thousands of cryptocurrencies in the market and all of them are just copy cat of Bitcoin to gain popularity and also cashing out on the gullible minds. If only Bitcoin exist as the sole digital currency the speed of adoption will be made faster and there will be less distraction in the entire crypto space and less bad image that are resulting from the operation of so many altcoins scams giving the entire young growing cryptocurrency industry bad spot on the limelight.BITCOIN: should be pushed to the global limelight with verifiable track records.Check the Bitcoin adoption rate in various countries and regions.https://triple-a.io/win-new-customers-insights-into-cryptocurrency-adoption-across-europe-and-america/",

Altcoins that are trying to beat Bitcoin in the currency/SoV category is so 2016. 99% of altcoins today that has at least a small number of following are either smart contract chains, or pseudo-equity. Not much projects are trying to beat Bitcoin at it's game for a while now. I'm saying this as someone who actively follows the altcoin space despite being a Bitcoin maximalistmostly-malist.^I don't even think it's fair/accurate to compared bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies today. Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrencies are in different categories functionality-wise and usecase-wise, the only similarity is both using blockchains.",

Slowly peeps injected the market with p2p, p2e, NFT markets and much more. ICO also started the most attractive trend in the past and thus keeping most of the investors away from the bitcoin or at least it divided the certain amount of money towards them thus keeping bitcoin on slow rate path. If bitcoin would have been slower then yes obviously peeps had no choice and all of them would gone for it.",

Who's to say it was or wasn't the intention of Bitcoin's creation? Bitcoin was described as \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" on the Bitcoin whitepaper; it wasn't stated if it should be the primary or just an alternative currency.

Altcoins can be seen as competition, but it's not so simple. Most of them have their own things going on, and they also aren't really a competition to Bitcoin. Moreover, tons of people are interested in the crypto market as such, not just in Bitcoin, and you've probably observed that during the bear market, everyone suffers (every or most big coins anyway), whereas during the bull market, they all benefit. So if Bitcoin were the only one, it wouldn't have taken over the total marketcap that currently is occupied by other coins; instead, that marketcap probably just would not have existed. Also, Bitcoin isn't capable of handling all the transactions that would need to be handled if the demand remained the same as now but other coins weren't out there.",

I really doubt that we would see BTC becoming a dominant global digital currency that will replace the traditional fiat.While there may be services/product that can be purchased using BTC, pushing it as a global currency is a bit of a stretch. With adaptation comes regulation especially on the hands of the government. With this in mind, this would also somehow defeat the purpose on why BTC was created in the first place- which is to gain and experience financial freedom.By becoming a global digital currency, it will most likely be subject to stringent rules and regulations that can potentially destroy its very existence and purpose in the long run.",
