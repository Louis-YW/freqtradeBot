If you don't want them to attack you, you either don't have their citizens allowed to use your service at all or you register your services under their regulation and let them be in control. but it might not guarantee you're totally free because the SEC doesn't need an excuse to attack anyone who is on their target list; they can just wake up and make one.",

Binance, not Bianance.Bianance might not exist now but it can exist in future and can belong to a phishing exchange that tries to do phishing attacks on Binance users.QuoteIs it possible for all crypto exchange companies in the US to avoid SEC's trouble ?.They will because the SEC Chair Gensler failed to protect his standpoints in the Congress months ago. He will no longer to do everything he wants if the Congress is no longer in control of the Democrats.I believe that the US. government don't want to see many cryptocurrency companies to shift their companies, offices to other nations like China mainland because of SEC.Gensler denied to answer that in his position, in SEC available regulations, is Ethereum a security or not? He failed to answer it but he uses his power to attack many other altcoin projects. Gensler will fail, not those projects, not the cryptocurrency industry in the US.Watch two videosChairman Patrick McHenry blasts SECGov Chair Gensler's disastrous rulemaking agenda and short comment periods that carve the American public out of the rulemaking process.Watch Chairman McHenry grill Gensler on his contradictory views on digital assets",

The whole event sent Bitcoin price sliding down the hill faster than a kid on a waterslide.Crypto enthusiasts have been crying \"Moon!\" all along, but all we've seen so far are storm clouds gathering. I'd say the SEC's assault on Binance could continue to put a damper on the crypto picnic.As for escaping the SEC's grasp, it's like trying to avoid rain in Seattle. If you're playing in Uncle Sam's backyard, you gotta abide by his rules. Crypto exchanges can try to dodge the raindrops, but without a sturdy regulatory umbrella, they're bound to get wet.",

Because by reading their allegations, we can find out why they are against Binance, and yesternight, i have covered the same topic of reasons behind this sue against Binance USA. Here is the article--> My TopicSecondly, i do not think that SEC can further do any harm to Binance because if something happens then it is only limited to the USA boundary and only the US citizens will be affected and they (investors and traders) will find another way to perform transactional activities. Like maybe from Coinbase etc. The point is, BTC price can not be affected more by Binance (in my opinion).Yeah, every exchange if cooperate with SEC then why SEC will sue them (like if there is anything on them or if they are in cooperation).",

I checked spot trading for bitcoin, ether and Binance coin on Binance, Binance coin is not near the trading volume of ether, while bitcoin trading volume is higher than ether which I think is the second most traded coin on Binance.Let me use yesterday trading volume as examples:Using bitcoin price of $26770Ether price of $1818Spot market:BTC/USDT: 65805 = $1.76 billion ETH/USDT: 555361 = $1 billion USDT-M futures:BTCUSDT: 700502 = $18.75 billion ETHUSDT: 4260000 = $7.74 billion Coin-M:BTCUSD: 111834 = $2.99 billion ETHUSD: 714927 = $1.3 billionBinance coin is very low. Also other coins are lower to both bitcoin and ether, but ether is still almost 2 times or more than 2 times lower in trading volume than bitcoin on Binance. Binance is truly an altcoin exchange as it encourages many altcoins, but bitcoin is the most traded coin on the exchange.What is affecting the crypto market is also affecting bitcoin too, but just that altcoins are more volatile and riskier.",

This season they have broken my hopes to see BTC go all the way up. They are like taking advantage of loopholes to get a lot of money for people in their organization. Not only today some cases of large exchanges dimming seem to also be the result of the SEC, if not wrong Poloniex, Bittrex. Many people are panicking for this matter. But all this has not been tested to be true or not. If CZ and Binance can stand by and provide concrete evidence of the falsehood of the allegations, I think Binance will be even stronger.",

And these numbers translate into easy business and easy profit...but unfortunately the US market has always played hardball, I wonder if this lawsuit is meant to keep Binance away and let coinbase flourish on its own",

If killing the business is going to be a problem, they should get out of the United States and find a better place to run the business.

      "body": "I think it's time for investors to finally shift away from the more risky and speculative altcoins to those considered safe havens, namely Bitcoin but also likely Ethereum, given they both haven't been labelled securities. I would also add Dogecoin to this short-list, but it still seems considerably overvalued, and there is also lawsuits pending against those who promoted and profited from it which is never a good look.The other reality is this isn't a situation that will be resolved very quickly. XRP lawsuit has been going on for a long-time, and I imagine that the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits will go on for a long-time as well, maybe a year or two. So if I had to guess then we could see a shift over the next 12-24 months of investors shifting to safer assets, namely Bitcoin, until the SEC lawsuits are resolved one way or another, as there is too much uncertainty right now. Personally I've been waiting for Bitcoin to reclaim a lot of market dominance for the past year, which hasn't happened, but this seems like the long-term catalyst for that now.",

Is this really just that too big for them to freak out like that??Few percent drops is just like an ordinary day here on crypto space and it isnt something a moment or situation for us to whine like babies. Fundamentals and news alike this about SEC or other government institutions or something isnt really that tired on throwing issues and other stirring up the situation of this market via touching up those services and platforms.Later on, it would really be just simply forgotten and simply move on.",

So we might conclude that there are no effect whatsoever. Nevertheless, there could be some part of manipulation by the whales here. As if they are giving hope that the news will not have a effect. But then again, maybe after hitting $28k there could be speculators that are going to short BTC.But if we look at the long picture, at least six months down the line, we might forget about this issues. Maybe Binance can get over the hype, answers everything or move out their Binance.US for good, just like what Coinbase did.",
