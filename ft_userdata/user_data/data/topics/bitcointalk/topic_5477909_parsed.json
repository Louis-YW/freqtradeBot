  "content": "After the ban on mixers I decided to provide a new service to the community as a prostitute, but it seemed to be problematic because I'm not pretty and not a prostitute. Lol.Now I am willing to work honestly.My terms :No porn.No ICO.No garbage coin.No gambling.I won't shill.Payment terms :Â max of Â  posts per month.(Most of them to be considered as trollfuckery and garbage post by the most trusted forum members. ðŸ¤¥ðŸ¤¥) lol.My past works : What's that?My reputation :Working so hard to get to -999 trust score as the most legit non-DT member.Success rate for your project:Recognized as the most legit service being promoted on this platform.Disclaimer :All the contents of my posts are my personal opinions, does not reflect on your brand. Editing the disclaimer, please note that I am not in any way associated with anyone who has ever merited me, their merits does not indicate any legitimacy, credibility and my trustworthiness, you should do your own research before using the advertised services by me.Ps. That red box on top, is my badge of honour.ðŸ˜‰Edit: as I just learned new business tricks from a thread on B & H board, I would like to add that I got 1 merit on my alt account from an ADMIN, so even though he could be unaware it was me when he merited my alt, still this is an achievement on it's own to add to my resume, right? ðŸ˜… Â this is a joke, remember.",

Best of luck.I have no such balls lol, everything I can stand for is thanks to the freedom that theymos provides here, otherwise I wouldn't bother if I see nobody cares. But it seems some people disagree with that kind of freedom, that's why they try to shut me up with every chance they get.ðŸ˜‰",

Good luck guys \"Only dead fishes go with the flow.\" Read that somewhere, maybe in a urinal or a gas station bathroom somewhere. I think that the quote is what embodies what @digaran as a person, not the kind that will bend to the norm and won't follow what's the current status quo, kind of like an anarchist but will probably follow @theymos's rules.",
