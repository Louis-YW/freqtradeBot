What your vision with Bitcoin after 20 year laterThe future is filled with many disabilities, if you have the money to invest and knows the importance of your investment then you don't need a prior target, whatever you get from investing can be utilized into something remarkable, our initial objective may be different from what it turns to be. Most people get the confidence of investing in Bitcoin for retirement purpose, some to extend wealth through their generations, while a few sums every vision into one, 20 years from now Bitcoin will be worth if not a million dollars per one, imagine holding too many portions of it, what you think to matter by then may not and the funds be used distinctively from what was thought of into a new sector.",

What your vision with Bitcoin after 20 year laterJust belive in Bitcoin, You may find it a golden opportunity in next 20year. Bitcoin can cross gold market cap, so it's high time while you can grab Bitcoin as much as possible. Imagine 1Sats = $1 . I think that was the vision for satoshi nakamoto other wise he wouldn't have devide it to 8 decimal. Well that's just my point of view. I remember back when I joined in crypto 2015/2016 that time we can get 100/150 sats easily just by solving a little captcha. Back then thousands of captcha equal $1 equivalent of BTC and now it would be worth almsot $100 how fascinating isn't it. How fast it's growing.",

What your vision with Bitcoin after 20 year laterI have not appropriately planned what to do with BTC or what I want to buy in the future because our plans change every moment. According to DCA, I have a small investment in Bitcoin. I will HOLD the maximum amount through this investment, but I don't know how many years I can HOLD Bitcoin. I have not thought about what to do with this Bitcoin in the future because I am continuing to maintain DCA by maintaining the investment and indicating that I can earn a good amount of profit from this investment.However,As a demo, I will not lose Bitcoin in the future. I will try to HOLD some amount of Bitcoin with which I can do something later. If I continue to invest and get a good amount, I will try to fulfil something good in my daily life with it. After 20 years, the view of Bitcoin will be high from today. Since good things are expected from Bitcoin, investing in Bitcoin is the best way.",

What your vision with Bitcoin after 20 year later Investing in housing is a good way to spend your money imo because there is no shortage to the need for shelter. There's also nothing wrong with continuing to hold though but it's also cool to have multiple streams of income and with the fact that there's volatility to worry about, it will be nice to have something to take your mind off your Bitcoin for a while. I see Bitcoin in 20 years time being the legal tender of some countries because with how countries like America are pushing to make a reserve out of it, who knows if others will want to lean into adding it as either their legal tender or to pair it with their fiat.",

What your vision with Bitcoin after 20 year laterrealities as this is one reason why we can't blame earlier bitcoin investors who sold a good fortune of their bitcoin holding for some pizzas because of their ignorance of what the future holds. like, past investors, we all have set a target where some of us hopes to sell once bitcoin gets to that mark. for some, once bitcoin gets to $150k, they had already planned to sell and for others, it might just be $200k. realistically, it will not take up to 8 years before bitcoin gets to that mark which means that a lot of us might still sell our holding pretty too soon. and then if in the next 20 years bitcoin gets to a million dollar, does that mean we should regret our action? 20 years from now is a long time, things might go positive for bitcoin or might not, bitcoin might go really high or might not.if I am able to keep holding my Bitcoin to the next 20 years and Bitcoin goes really high, I will use my proceed to set up a very huge multi-purpose tech/library hub which is what I have longed to put in place but I've since been hindered due to lack of good finance to implement the project as I desire.",

What your vision with Bitcoin after 20 year laterThere was one famous line that we hear recently, \"When Lambo\"?Perhaps when Bitcoin reaches the price of 1 Lambo, perhaps that could be the dream of others, to purchase their supercar with just their Bitcoin holdings. Seriously, though, I'm not really sure, only thing that I can think is that Bitcoin can give me generational wealth. At least me and my kids and my grand kids will have a good life because of my Bitcoin investments. So all we can do right now is to look at the bigger picture and then accumulate as much as we can.",

I'm holding onto my Bitcoin like it's my stash of digital gold, something solid for the long run but I also think it might turn into real money we use every day. I'm not sure if it'll shoot up in price or just become super common but either way, I want to play it smart. For me, it's all about locking in some financial freedom and down the road. i've got this dream of tapping into everything Bitcoin could be. It feels big and I'm in it for the ride.",

Instead of being concerned on what I'll acquire with my Bitcoin in 20 years time, I'm more interested in investing as much as I can now and when I've made enough profit in the future, I can then decide on the buying things that are more economically demanding for myself and family. And in a case where I succeed to acquire my needs before then and settled the people around me, I'll prefer saving them for my generations to come instead of lavishing my saved assets on material things that I do not necessarily need at that time",
