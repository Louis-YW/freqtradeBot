You can also continue to help this Merit system run well by distributing your sMerit. there's no point in you keeping it. keep it up. maybe in the future, you will feel very bored. but hopefully, you can still be in the forum.",

Now that I'm at the highest rank that can be reached, it's always nice to see that you've been given merits but the feeling is more monotonous, more routine.By the way, what you should start doing is to send merits yourself, I see you haven't sent any.",

However, motivation alone is insufficient; we must actively enhance our knowledge through diligent reading and continuous learning. It's reassuring to know that other beginners share this sentiment too.",

I doubt if only I feel this pleasure.Definitely they do, everyone feels this sense of pride and honor whenever they feel they have done a thing or two and people acknowledges them, this gets them going and that is what the merit is for. One advice I would be giving is do not get carried away in trying to get them but learn and create a purpose why you are here and allow them to come through by themselves. But once you are obsessed on getting them it leads you to making mistakes and if they don’t come you get frustrated and lose interest in the forum.",

Earning your first merits can be a huge motivation the feeling is actually pleasing and you wouldn’t want the feeling to stop. I was merited with my first post though when I joined this forum I wanted to understand bitcoin technically, i was not after the merits i just tried to engage myself in discussions and ask questions about things i wanted to learn more about and I noticed there is a special feeling when you receive merits. Ranking up maybe challenging but merit hunting shouldn’t be your purpose on the forum, just try and make reasonable contributions to the forum and the merits will flow in naturally when someone admires your post or contributions.",

I doubt if only I feel this pleasure.Receiving praise or even views and comments after each post is actually very encouraging and shows me that the time I spent researching and developing that particular topic or project was worthwhile. It also helps to dispel any unclear or perplexing doubts and questions. However, I don't think it is necessary for every post to be praised with merits, views, or comments because it may also serve as a way of knowing and learning some crucial things about that specific topic or project. As a result, I will firmly advise all beginners to post constantly and do more research rather than to become disheartened by a lack of views, comments, or merit.",

But I personally never take it as a trivial thing because everyone needs effort to achieve what they want, and that effort is how you try to add insight and apply it where you can apply it because motivation is built through the desire of everyone who wants to be better. So I consider nothing seemingly trivial in terms of merit.",

I doubt if only I feel this pleasure.Ranking up is a motivation and for me it is still a motivation. Getting some rewards can indeed add enthusiasm to keep trying to give the best because everyone will not keep sMerit in their pocket when they find something unique and useful from someone else.Some time ago, my sMerit was empty because I principally kept sMerit not good. But right now my sMerit is filled with as many as 4 that I can take out. Maybe I'll put one out for you after this post.Here you know what you have to do to get people to send you some merit.Don't force yourself to get it, but focus on the useful things you need to do so that people see you as unique with your own character.I see from the 55 posts you have made, you already have 11 merits which means you can issue 5 merits to other people who you think are worthy of giving. Don't let sMerit settle down because by distributing sMerit, we are already running the merit system as expected.",

Because I've ever been in that position. when I first joined this forum. But what's more important is to focus on our goals on adding insight and believe me the quality of your posts will increase by itself and getting Merit will be more enjoyable.

Those merits show me that people are okay with what I said; my idea or my question was reasonable, which made me start posting, and by doing that, I was also open to learning more. Even as a high-ranking member's earned merit is to some point still motivational, it makes one put more effort into doing what he or she did that earned them those merits.",
