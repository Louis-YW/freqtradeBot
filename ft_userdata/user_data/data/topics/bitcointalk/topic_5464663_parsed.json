  "content": "Good day to all readers, I have a question regarding the taxation of dydx wins. On dydx, trading is only perpetual, so the capital gain tax would apply. However, the problem is that you are not trading in fiat, but in USDC which is a cryptocurrency. Is there now income tax due to cryptocurrency? Or does the capital gain tax fall because of Perpetual? (since you buy the USDC with Fiat)",

This means all transactions, from selling coins to using cryptos for purchases, are subject to the same tax treatment as other capital gains and losses.source[Tutorial] Crypto taxes for beginners maybe helpful to get better understanding about crypto taxation.",

So the tax due depends on your purchasing price of BTC Since USDC is a stable coin so you can clearly find the profits you made and can claim the tax-free if it's below 600€ Crypto Taxes in Germany: Complete Guide & Instructions [2023]",

Tax is a complicated issue and most of the information provided on the internet is based on personal experience. I am not a German, and I do know there is a local board Deutsch (German) local board. Did you ask your question there, if you have not then it is better to ask your question on that board or do a search. Still, it is better to talk to a pro than us on the forum.Thanks.",
