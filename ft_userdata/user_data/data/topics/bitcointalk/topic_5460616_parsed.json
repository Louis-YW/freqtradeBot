There are a lot of posts I come across here where the OP is really not good with English, but when you read through those lines, you will have to understand what the person is saying. A shitpost is when the person doesn't know what they are saying and goes completely off-key or out of line. The post doesn't aim to share any positive contributions to the forum or its members. Reading through posts is nice, and previewing is especially helpful when there is a warning regarding someone who just posted a comment. Especially when you are about to give a recommendation or correction about something, the recent comment might have said a similar thing to what your own comment might appear to look like spam.",

I feel the preview button is more important when adding other tags (code, links, image etc) asides from just normal write up in order to get an actual glimpse of how your post will be when published. The more reason and cause of the spelling errors should be the autocorrect function enabled in phones and also when users are typing too fast than the little the brain can give out at a time can also cause it.",

As my first languages are Punjabi, Urdu then English which i learnt in school. And i totally agreed with your point here. At start, and now in current situation too, sometimes i made mistakes. Like i wanted to say something in favor but i end up against it. Last time i mistakenly wrote in a post reply which i was corrected by another member to whom i thanks later.The point is, we should check our english first and should not rush. I really like this gentle reminder (well it's at least a reminder to me). So, i will try my best. Actually for those who are not english users, should take help to verify your writing from Google translate. (I am not sure if that's also against forum rules). But AFAIK it's not. So we might clarify at least our statements from google translate. Like first write the post in english then translate it into your local language and see does it make sense to you if not the. Correct the grammer mistakes. And try not to use too many tools because it will make your post looks like BOT written and it might get you tagged as plagiarized. So be careful with tools. Because in some cases they are bad.",

A post with good point and no grammatical error is impressive, but what if the post don't have anything to say, only repeat a general information that everyone already know and no grammatical error? do you think it's a high quality post?Quote from: Ayebabara on July 17, 2023, 09:16:39 AMIntroduction: Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be used in different ways, both in buying and selling of goods through per-to-per transfer and also in investment which many users of bitcoin are interested. People invest in bitcoin because it flustrates in price either the bearish that people buy and in the bull that they sell. Bitcoin also trend in the eco-space that everyone who is good in the latest technological ideas in the world key into it. Therefore, I should not be exempted for joining the trend and start my journey. I am also aware of the risk that is involved but that will not be an excused to the journey. What's matter is the determination. The price of bitcoin is unpredictable but yet people guest it correctly. Bravo for those guys.For the crypto space, some people prefer trading to investment while some prefer investment to trading which I might also fall unto and some are for mining.I wanted to start my bitcoin investment journey but I look at it that the price is still high to start the investment and I am waiting for the price to go down to $20k to $25k or below. Is that a procrastination? If yes, when is the best time to start the journey? Now that the price is still high? Will bitcoin go down again? The way it stand, it looks like it would not go down again until the next halvining and the bull to come. Bitcoin price was good to invest last year which was $16k to $19k but I was not having cash to start the journey but now that I have small cash let me start the investment. To What Extent Bitcoin Price Will go for the Bear MarketBitcoin start the year 2023 with a good price and the price in in this year is much more better than last year 2022 and those who invested last year 2023 would not say that this year do does not favour them. And we have spent 7 month in this year and the price of bitcoin right now is $30,277 that is, the price is sliding down compare to last week. So where do you think the price of bitcoin will end for the bear market before this year will end?To What Extent Bitcoin Price Will go for the Bull MarketAs it is said, bitcoin price rised to $20+k from late last year after the bear market and in  this year the price rises to $31k, so what is your speculation on the price before the end of the year?",

It is better you reread you work before posting to avoid mistake. Be a good poster. Avoid mistake. But mistake is inevitable. It most come but not always.It's actually good to review and reread your post before posting knowing that it's going public. You already know that mistake is inevitable and that's why sometimes despite reviewing your post numerous times, you'll discover some error (s) after posting. You can see the area I outlined in your post with red color, it's a prove that reviewing your post will not make it entirely error free. I initially thought you did it deliberately and later realized that your post is about making a perfect post devoid of error and I don't think you'll do that deliberately. Is this a prove that you didn't reread your post before posting or a justification that mistake is inevitable? Lol It's normal to check your posts after typing and still discover mistakes either in spelling, repetition of word, punctuation usage or even the whole collocation as the case maybe. It is understandable sometime to the readers as long as it's minor. However, making it a habit is actually bad. An error might be discovered in my post too.",

One might not be good at English grammar but we are expected to put effort and improve our writings. Using English grammar software like Grammarly and Whitesmoke online checkers might help correct some errors and some of these software are free online. We should also review our posts to make corrections. Natural English speakers should also be patient with us who are learning how to speak the language. It has not really been easy to become proficient.

And when readers don't understand some sentences, will be incoherence which will lead to misinformation and most people are not patient enough to read through the lines of some posts. Mistakes happen but we should try to limit it by putting more effort into our posts. But it because a problem when it becomes a common occurrence in our works.",

As here many of us are Non English users (including me) we should learn about some basic ways to minimize grammatical problems or to make quality posts: 1. Use Grammarly or Grammar Checker App: Ehen you have problems with English language like grammatical problems then you can easily know about the errors of your sentences. Just use Gramarly or any other popular checker websites. 2. Use Google translator to find out meaning or spelling: Sometimes we face hard words that we don't know the meaning or we want to post in English but can't translate a word in English then just use Google translator to find out it. But never translate whole sentence and just copy-paste it because it's prohibited.3. Learn about the topic before posting:  To avoid making shit posts you must have proper realization about the topic which you want to create or make a discussion. When you have a little knowledge about the topic kindly avoid or try to gather some knowledge and then try to contribute but never make shitposts. 4. Receck your posts and use Preview Option: Anyone can have grammatical or spelling mistakes and it's normal so when we revise we may find out easily. Also we may see if images, links, quotes or any features working properly or not by this way.",
