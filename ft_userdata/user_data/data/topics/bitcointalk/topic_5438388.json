It's always not a best option on rhe side of the one giving the advice to point you in a direction. Eventually, your blames gets laid on the adviser and that's not a very good thing to do.In respect of the above, I'll say, a 100% lose can only come into plat when bitcoin loses all its value $0.00. From history and how bitcoin has been carrying, that's not going to happen. It might drop or devalue but always soon goes back up and that down/up movement is vital towards a healthy market.What defines your profit is how long your willing to hold on when it goes bearish. If you can afford not to panic sell or even sell with any small pump, your going to have your profit metre counting.",

Yes, that's possible. Market is unpredictable, it can go wherever it wants depends on the supply and demand. If the supply is higher than demand, the price will go down, and if the demand is higher than supply, the price will go up. If we look btc chart, we can see that the price is in consolidation phase after a big pump means there's lack of demand so we expect for retracement that can be possible to go to that price before it will continue to go up.If you're using spot trading, I suggest not sell if the price goes back to that area because you will only get loss if you sell below at your entry. If you're trading with leverage, I suggest to put stop loss with calculated risk 60% only.",

Yes in the sense that, this is the best time to invest on bitcoin though the market will still go down but saving is not good because it is stagnant. But if you invest in bitcoin for long term of 4 to 6 years of time, your will appreciate your investment. But you have to understand the market before investing don't just invest. Then no, in the sense that, there is risky in the market so if you are not a professional you will lost everything and blame people about it so instead go and learn more about the investment some times before investing with your 60%.

So, it's no use about asking here for some probabilities because no one can actually predict the future. But for your question, \"can you invest your 60% of your savings in Bitcoin?\", certainly yes as long it's a savings and it's a spare funds that you won't be using in terms of an unfortunate event that needs emergency funds.Just one thing though, make sure you're looking for a long-term holding for that and know bitcoin first before investing on it so that you're not moving blind.",

You must make your own financial decisions; this is not financial advice. No one in this space is qualified to respond to your other inquiries. What do you mean by a 100% loss? I'm not sure. Because Bitcoin would crash but not go to zero, you couldn't lose 100% of your investment. If the price of bitcoin drops by 100%, you will have lost 50% of your investment.

Unless you are investing for the short term like dor a few days or weeks, I don't see you making a lot. For longterm and buying at $23k is still fine. Yes, where else can the price go but up.The rest of us probably invest more than 60% of thier savings in BTC. Mine so far is somewhat 50% since cash still is the best to hold when there is uncertainty. But the more you hold BTC, the more profit you could make when the price goes to another ATH.",

You can invest a smaller percentage if you do not believe in Bitcoin, but in my opinion, even if Bitcoin goes down below the $20K Level I will not sell, because I trust that the next small storm with a price correction and that the bull comes very quickly and I must be there, do not let the FUD affect you and make you lose hope, do your own analysis and wait for the good time to enter.",
