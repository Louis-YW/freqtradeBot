  "content": "I'm developing a series of standalone miners built around BM1387 & BM1397 asics and an ESP32-C3. I've been working on these for over 1 year now and I think I've got enough knowledge now to make a version that can be mass produced, the question I have now: is anyone interested in such a miner?The configuration I'm thinking of has the following properties:- Standalone, only a usb charger with 5V/3A needed and a wireless connection.- Single BM1397 asic.- Hash rate of 200GHs upto 250GHs (and more probably).- Power consumption out of the wall 8-15W (depending on efficiency of the charger and hash rate).- My own miner software (open source, in beta stage, fully working but lousy UI) based on Arduino libraries that allows manual on the fly voltage and frequency settings.- totally not worth running on a non-solo pool, but a cheap lottery ticket where you enter the drawing for free every 10 minutes for as long as you live(*)..I've designed my hardware around parts that are for sale on aliexpress, but for mass production I will have to redesign parts of it using components for sale at mouser.com , and I will need to find a company willing to produce them (a problem as the asics are not sold by any big electronics reseller), and also sell them. Currently I'm thinking of seeedstudio.com, but I haven't contacted them yet to see if they are both willing and capable (sourcing the bm1397's and soldering them on the backside of the pcb).There is also a open source version with bm1387 asics (that I could also redesign to use mouser parts) that you can built yourself (advanced electronic soldering capabilities/tools required).I have 6 prototypes running, live stats https://solo.ckpool.org/users/1KgwWwBh7qGtcWJ9ZRNTUbVCR1L2qYkzcy, 3 bm1387 versions (2 with 2 asics, one with 4 asics), and three single bm1397 versions (workernames containing 'test').I started out designing the miners for personal use and therefor used parts from aliexpress but I'm so satisfied with them (they will run as long as the internet connection is up, and will reconnect in 99.9% of the cases when it is not, the 0.01% is caused by a quirk in the esp software) that *I think* others might be interested in them also.But it will require another hardware redesign which is not needed for my personal use miners.So, should I invest the time (and money) in this for you? Or is this a niche product? I have no idea what the retail price will be in the end, but the pcb hardware and assembly should not be much more than $50, add to that a margin the the sales & production, an included cooling solution (say $5 for the heatsink and another $2 for a fan, $x for 2 small 3D printed clips to mount everything) and that should be it.Comment in this topic if interested, or if you think this is stupid, you won't hurt my feelings as I have already got what I set out to achieve.(*) I'm not sure if any (solo) pool will support low hash rate miners in the future. Pool operators have to pay for their hardware and connection, and a low hash rate miner costs them as much as a complete mining farm. Maybe CK can answer that.ps: new forum user with (unknown to me) restrictions, my old user name got lost in 2016)edit:I've redesigned the miner to use standard parts, but sadly i'll have to make another one as one of the buck converters from mouser.com is apparently a fake Anyway, I did some stress testing to see what it can handle and got this https://github.com/rapsacw/aSiNine-ESP-miner/blob/main/ui.png",

The miner in the screenshot consumes ~13W from the wall, the efficiency of the charger is 87%, so the miner itself uses ~11.3W at ~250GHs.Quote from: BitMaxz on June 16, 2023, 01:49:20 PMI like the dashboard the design is very simple and since you said you can connect through wifi and it doesn't need Raspi because the board is Arduino then that's a big advantage compared to Compact F.So for me, I like it but I don't know if I can afford it that is why like I said it depends on the price of your miner.You've only seen the polished part of it Â The input side is 'rough', to get it working (from 'new') you need to- Enter your Wifi credentials (the miner turns into an access point if it isn't configured or can't find the configured Wifi, connect to that ap and open page at 192.168.4.1) by entering 'write /wifi.cfg:<ssid> <password>'- Enter the miner configuration (best after a reboot so you can connect to it over your newly configured wifi) by entering 'write /sys.cfg:<asic type, 1387 or 1397> <#asics in series> <#asic parallel> <Vcore multiplier to convert the adc result into the core voltage>', all this info is hardware (&revision) dependent.- Enter the pool configuration by entering 'write /pool.cfg:<pool address> <pool port> <user name> <user password> <worker name> <suggest difficulty y or n>'- Enter the asic settings by entering 'write /asic.cfg:<freq> <voltage in mV>'Then finally after a reboot the miner will run as configured. Other possible commands are;- r for reboot- format to format the internal storage (factory reset)- type <filename> to show contents of file- dir- c to calibrate the core voltage (this is needed as the actual core voltage will drop when you increase the load by increasing the asic's frequency due to droop in the charger, charger cable and pcb traces)- f+ & f- to increase or decrease the asic frequency in 5MHz steps- v+ & v- to increase or decrease the core voltage in 5mV steps- s to save the current asic settings to /asic.cfg so it will reuse these settings after a rebootQuote from: BitMaxz on June 16, 2023, 01:49:20 PMIt seems the idea comes from Duino mining from Gunther where you can mine Duco?Never heard of anything you mentioned here..Quote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on June 16, 2023, 06:26:49 PMWelcome back on the forum OP!..I'd even like to be a reseller in Europe for you if you're interested, if after I've been able to test them everything's OK, I'd be sincerely interested.I'm currently in the process of learning how to make Bitaxe myself, a DIY sha256 ASIC based on BM1397 created by Skot (who replied to you above) that reminds me a lot of what you're describing.

Its too early for resellers, first comes the manufacturing, and I've sniffed enough leaded solder and flux in my life to even attempt doing it myself Bitaxe is cool, I wish Skott all the best. He started his project roughly at the same time as I did, but I only discovered it 6 month ago (I was too busy developing things to search github, although I did search github before I started working on it). His hardware should be easy to implement in my miner software, all that is needed is modifying the routines to use his dac.Quote from: Skot on June 16, 2023, 02:00:07 PMYes, do it!!

Gekkoscience Compac F offers the same kind of performance (approximately) and can be bought for between 250 and 400 usd depending on the reseller and the time.It doesn't have to be so cheap to be sold IMO.

My goal would be to bring the pcb to market and let the end user fiddle with the cooling. Cooling will not be hard as the asic is the sole component on the side of the pcb it is mounted on, so different size heatsinks will work.

For example the BM1397 has a higher hashrate per chip and is cheaper in small-ish quantities than the BM1398 (S19) and BM1362 (S19J Pro)I guess the esp's are more than fast enough to handle several asics. I will do some profiling so see what the actual number is.I think sadly the BM1397 is the last asic suitable for these kind of miners. If you do the math you will find that newer asics need 20A or even 40A to run, and those kind of currents are not easily managed on 2-layer pcb's (or even 4-layers, just look at the current shunts plastered all over antminer hash boards).Quote from: mikeywith on June 18, 2023, 09:21:56 PMQuote from: rapsacw on June 16, 2023, 11:36:51 AM(*) I'm not sure if any (solo) pool will support low hash rate miners in the future.

I would love to learn more about this.Or maybe they are ntime rolling? I guess thatâs a lot easier.Version rolling is not possible with most (stratum V1) pools; the ticket send back to the pool does not include nversion. ntime is no problem though, but you 'only' gain 60x with that, so you will only have to send work to a single asic @250GHs once for every work from the pool, or even @500GHs on ck's pool (as the work time is now reduced from 60s to 30s). Some sort of block generation will be unavoidable sooner or later unless they do something with the serial interface to make it fast enough (a normal T17 needs a ~1.5Mbaud Â connection between the asics, so a S19j @120GHs would need roughly 3 times that speed without block generation).",

Nearly every stratum pool I have seen supports the version-rolling extension. that adds a version_bits field to mining.submit. afaik It's necessary to support ASICboost.Quotentime is no problem though, but you 'only' gain 60x with that, so you will only have to send work to a single asic @250GHs once for every work from the pool, or even @500GHs on ck's pool (as the work time is now reduced from 60s to 30s). Where does 60x come from? every 30s is pretty leisurely compared to every 8ms @ 500 GH/s with nonce rolling alone!QuoteSome sort of block generation will be unavoidable sooner or later unless they do something with the serial interface to make it fast enough (a normal T17 needs a ~1.5Mbaud Â connection between the asics, so a S19j @120GHs would need roughly 3 times that speed without block generation).120 TH/s over 3 hashboards = 40 TH/s each, which means each hashboard can cover the 32 bit nonce space in 0.1ms. The newer ASICs have more midstates too, so that means bigger job packet. No way serial can keep up. It makes sense that they would include some sort of work generation on-chip. I'm really curious which field they are rolling.",
