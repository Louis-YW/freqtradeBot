      "body": "Yes and it probably already exists. The only issue I could see from building one would be who is paying the fees when channels close as that'd have to be covered in transaction fees (on the exchange) - just in case there's a forced channel closure.Purse.io has lightning payment acceptance (the place where you can buy things from amazon with crypto at a discount) but I don't know if this is the exact way it's done there. Also lightning payments still mean the exchange is the custodian if the funds while they're there unless they're doing an atomic swap (I don't know if that would disincentivise users taking funds out of the platform if they know they can withdraw from it within a few seconds).",

Most traders and holders want an exchange with high liquidity that can able to withdraw them to any coins/token they want because if an exchange doesn't have sufficient liquidity and the exchange platform only use Bitcoin LN to deposit/withdraw then no one will use it. Unless you are planning something different in your own exchange?",

      "body": "Thanks for the replies! I was thinking that everything can be built on the bitcoin network. If the lightning network can support derivatives then why would I need to use another chain or centralized exchange? It could use BTC as the settlement layer. Forgive me if I don't understand the lightning network fully, but it seems to me that it would be possible to do this. I have a dream that we can exit this corrupt fiat system totally and just build everything on the bitcoin network. BTC would become the backbone of everything that happens in the economy. I mean I am struggling to fully understand the limitations of lightning, like why would I need to use any other chain if everything can effectively be done on a BTC layer 2? What are the limitations of the lightning network?If you have some reading material on the lightning network that may help me that would be really appreciated.",

What are the limitations of the lightning network?If you have some reading material on the lightning network that may help me that would be really appreciated.Since you mention BTC layer 2 it means they use another chain than the mainnet. Like lightning networks or other off-chain networks like ERC20 and BEP20 they are just used to help the issue of the congested network with cheaper transaction fees when you need to transfer your coins to other exchanges but the problem is not all exchange support lightning network look at Binance I use binance but they don't yet added it on their payment method except to another layer 2 ERC20 and BEP2/20.So it means you are going to use a other chain than the mainnet.If you are looking for a great source to learn about lightning then check this link below- https://github.com/tmlee/awesome-lightning-network",
