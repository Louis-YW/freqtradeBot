There is indeed a problem with gold if you will receive a real gold if you are the buyer unlike in btc where there's a record in the blockchain. Other difference between gold and bitcoin is you cannot hold bitcoin physically unlike gold where you can wear it. P2P is very risky before until you can do p2p in exchange platform nowadays which increases the chances of p2p transactions being completed.",

As long as you're buying certified gold from a well known place. If we start talking about jewelry it's very difficult not only to get good price, but also to prove that it's real. If we're talking about bars like 100 or 250 grams, it's very easy to sell. There are buyers in every town that will take it from you and even if you have a lot of it there are places you can contact online that will come to you and pay you. Literally, there are exchanges where you call, say you have, for instance 500g of gold  from e.g. Royal Canadian and they will tell you their price and come pick it up with the money. Bottom line, when you have certified gold it's very easy to buy or sell it. What is difficult is transporting it. You can't leave the country with 1 kg of hold in your suitcase, but you can leave it with the same value in bitcoin.",

I don't know about other countries, but in my country, selling your gold can be relatively easy because there are specific locations where gold buyers are usually gathered, and if you take your gold there to sell and it is legit, the likelihood of you living there without selling your gold is close to zero. There is a level of security, but since it is a physical transaction, you can never guarantee the level of security on it.

Like you guys don't have banks that does this for you? I personally have my bank app in my phone, and my crypto exchange (binance) on my phone too. So for me, exchanging lira to gold, dollars, euro, bitcoin, eth all are same and just requires me to open up the app and do it. There is a set price, usually very good competitive price in all the banks and binance is fine with pricing too, so its all quite good. I don't understand why you think that you need to buy and sell gold physically like old times, we aren't in that age anymore. And even if you did, there are literally gold smiths that buy and sell, in every city, here at least.",

Of course, they have to profit and margin from your gold and that's why their pricing won't be the same as what the market says. I haven't done personally this kind of sale and I don't think that I'd invest into gold this time when the matters of the world is full of uncertainty.Quote from: headingnorth on August 07, 2024, 06:50:01 PMBy comparison, bitcoin is extremely quick and easy to sell with a few keyboard clicks on your computer or phone app. Right, P2Ps, DEXes, CEXes.

Trading Gold can be done just the way Bitcoin is done, only when Gold is used for jewelry then it will need to be done through the physical presentations. i still prefer the online way of trading it as its stress free and huge volumes can be traded at once without the fear of anything and security challenges like when its been handled physically and you having to travel to go see a jeweler or walking into a shop where you may have to sell for much lesser than you did bought it.",

All that's needed is a device connected to the internet, and the person will receive the true market value for the amount of Bitcoin he sold quickly and instantly, without incurring any manufacturing or repair costs that might be associated with buying gold in the form of jewelry instead of bullion or coins. However, while I don't see gold buying and selling as complex as mentioned by OP, I find Bitcoin to be a more ideal, modern, and profitable investment than gold.For me, my Bitcoin holdings are much more than gold.
