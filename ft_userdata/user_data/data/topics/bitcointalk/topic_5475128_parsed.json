(https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/1904.html) Today, Israel is waging a war in Gaza against the terrorist organization Hamas, which carried out an insidious attack on Israel, as a result of which 1,200 Israelis were killed and about 250 hostages were taken to Gaza. The Israeli government has decided to destroy Hamas. Due to the fact that the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas and the fact that Hamas terrorists hide behind civilians, casualties among the civilian population of the strip are inevitable. America cautiously reproached Israel for the disproportionate military actions in Gaza, once again demonstrating a double standard. Can America's actions during the war with Japan, when atomic bombs were dropped on the civilian population of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, be called proportionate?The UN adopted an anti-Israeli resolution, condemning Israel's military actions in Gaza, despite the fact that the initiator of the war is the terrorist organization Hamas.The representative of Israel in the Security Council, when discussing a resolution on Israel’s war with the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip, was strongly indignant, it must be said, at the very bold words of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the Hamas attacks did not happen in a vacuum, the Palestinian people were subjected to a suffocating occupation for For 56 years, Palestinians have seen their lands consumed by the creation of Jewish settlements. Yes, the Israeli diplomat did not like the truth and aroused outright anger at Guterres, whom he strongly advised to resign, but he forgot that he was in the UN, and not in the US Congress, where the Jewish lobby traditionally has influence on political decisions.( 1) By the way, we must pay tribute to Biden, who spoke about the need to create a state for the Arabs of Palestine. Echoing the US President and Secretary of State, Blinken spoke about the need to revive the peace process.However, the peace process had already taken place, if we recall the Madrid Peace Conference on the Middle East in 1991, lasted for 4 long years and ended with the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin (2). And, if now, as Blinken advises, we begin the peace process again, which will again drag on for an unknown amount of time and it is unknown how it will end, then this is only a waste of time, during which Israel will continue to take away Palestinian land through settlement activities. We must not waste time during which blood will flow again. The UN must correct its mistake made in 1947 (3) and send troops to the borders between Israel and Palestine, as provided for in the UN resolution, in accordance with the famous map:True, in this case one unpleasant nuance will inevitably appear. The fact is that if the Palestinians really find their own state, then, sadly, the only conclusion that will follow is that this happened thanks to Hamas.1.

So maybe they are not terrorists, but guerrillas.I don't think those negociations between Hamas and the government of Israel will hold, though. Netanyahu will continue to keep his promise and try to destroy Hamas and Hezbollah, as long as he has the power as the mine minister of Israel. This rather an strategic withdrawal from the first line in order to re-organize their forces and continue to kill those considered to be members of Hamas and Hezbollah. Remember, Donald Trump is now the President of the United States and he is pretty much friendly towards the government of Israel, so I expect Netanyahu to be given a blank check, so he can do whatever he wants to protect the interest he has. Any organization who kills innocent people for the sake of a political objective is a terrorist organization, at least that is my personal definition.",

It must be said that this has been going on for almost 80 years.The result of Hamas's struggle for freedom with powerful countries is the loss of civilian lives and increases the long-term war. How logical is it to expect an easy solution? The US administration will provide Israel with more weapons to use to destroy Hamas. Hamas should reach a solution through a long-term ceasefire and a situation of peace among the civilians. By releasing Israeli prisoners has already begun. Yet the Israeli army continues to bomb. It seems that we will continue to hear the cries of Palestinian children for many more years.",
