Not that there is no idiots here there are plenty of idiots in the crypto world and when (if) this happens, there will be ton of people who would buy \"just in case\" by their defense, and we all know they just believe it.We all know that Satoshi will not come back just to promote some brc-20 stuff, we all know that is as Ludacris as it could get and that's why there is no reason why we should be thinking this would happen. I fear that the type of people who would invest because of this are the type of people who could get scammed so easily, and they may not even deserve their money as well, I can't really feel sorry for those people to be fair.",

BE CAREFUL \"https://twitter.com/dogdaddotx/status/1666853103667224577?s=20I was speaking to a young cryptocurrency enthusiast a few hours ago that is passionate about owning Bitcoin. He showed me a website and app called Satosicoin and told me he will get his Bitcoin from the scheme. But I told him that the site is fake and a scam. He further told them it was Satoshi that owns the site, and I told him it was not the truth. The owner of the site told them to invest and get Bitcoin, meanwhile, it was a worthless shitcoin. I had to teach him about Bitcoin, how to buy, earn or mine it. The point is that many ignorant people will still fall for this cheap scam and waste thier money. People will not stop using the name Satoshi to commit fraud. If Satoshi comes back, I guess bitcoiltalk will be one of the first places he would show himself but I doubt he would ever be known.",

I was able to access satoshi@vistomail.com and all correspondences, emails, accounts, everything. IT IS A LOT OF INFORMATION. It is going to take me months if not years to go through everything but I have had it now for 3-4 weeks. I do see an email about 5-6 months ago regarding a brc-20 token but cant give much information yet on it because I don't want to give anyone incorrect information. You can email me at satoshi@vistomail.com to verify that I do own it. I will respond with my name Alex Elbanna in the signature line. my twitter is @AlexElbanna I will be posting my research there and on bitcointalk.org. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me on here. I am not sure if I can receive or send DM on Bitcointalk.org.Excellent work.If the email account fell into nefarious hands, they might have released a dump of email records including potentially falsified or forged email messages from Satoshi. Assuming they were not GPG encrypted of course.DMs work on Bitcointalk, just use use the \"My Messages\" section at the top of the page to access it.",

I did find this https://vistomail.shopco.com/site/home which is very interesting attached to secureanonymoussurfing.com domainThere is so much more information than we could ever imagine. There are some VERY VERY HIGH PROFILE DOMAINS IN HERE and I am too scared to share the list of domains. I will to the Top Merit and Admins here ONLY.\"Back on topic regarding brc-20\" I found a list of brc-20 Tokens along with a document that contains information that would make Bitcoin more valuable than anything in existence. Each individual brc-20 token was planned to the exact number with Bitcoin liquidity. I don't know how to share this information properly or if I should just keep this to myself.-Alex Elbanna I'm not sure if BRC-20 tokens coinciding with liquidity numbers is significant in this context considering that BRC-20 was invented and announced by a random faceless person on Twitter. People will just name the tokens after whatever they want, AFAIK there is even $ETH, $LTC and some named after exchanges like $COIN, $FTX, so it probably does not have any useful information attached to it.",

Such plan was far from being elaborate or product of a mastermind, it was just a simple idea and i had little hope it could work. Still my endless curiosity made me go for it.Today I woke up, checked my email box and there it was - satoshi@vistomail.com replied to my email.So yes, hardworkingfamilyman is saying the truth, he does have access to satoshi's email. But im still not sure of his intentions.Ive replied back to the email, awaiting for news as well. Hopefully can be the beginning of a new era on this topic.EDIT:it is still a very big coincidence that 2/3days after ive emailed satoshi@vistomail.com i get an answer and this user pops-up on bitcointalk claiming to have good intentions. my email may have incited a scammer to have a different idea on how to cash in with this OR it can actually be true and just be a coincidence. either way, @hardworkinfamilyman you have our attention and im available to help get to the bottom of this and collaborate in the research.",

Just 'cause you squat on a domain don't mean you got any ties to Bitcoins creator.  Honestly it comes off shady like you're hoping people just make assumptions and throw money at this and, folks aren't that gullible.  This whole thing smells fishy to me - it's teetering into scammy territory big time.  I know you wanna make your project seem special, but piggybacking off Satoshi aint the way, and most people see through that nonsense pretty quick.  Maybe try building value without these attempts to trick people?",
