  "content": "I have been investing in Crypto.com , now known as Cronos, since March this year. I see it has been falling in the last 24 hours as many are panicking it could be one of the next exchanges in trouble. I have just tried to deposit some money onto my crypto.com account and it has left my bank but not reached my account and this was over half an hour ago now, it usually reaches my account in a few minutes. Is there currently a problem with deposits??What does everyone think about crypto.com is it in trouble or should be ok?",

      "body": "I've been hearing rumors regarding Crypto.com as well. These rumors, starting right after the FTX incident, are quite concerning and suspicious. From what I've read (and I'm also quoting the article below), Crypto.com is holding 20% of their assets in Shiba Inu, which is more than their Ethereum reserves, in a meme coin. My other guess is that someone or another major exchange is spreading rumors on purpose in an attempt to hurt Crypto.com and the market in general.One thing is certain, though: trust in cryptocurrencies will be dented if another exchange goes down.https://www.euro2day.gr/investments/crypto/article/2161051/ypoptes-kinhseis-apo-to-antallakthrio-cryptocom.html Article in Greek but could be translated into English.",

I read that this transaction was made after an audit of crypto.com to help gate.io. So it's not crypto.com that has the problem. Because after gate.io was audited, they returned the ETH amount back. True in my opinion crypto.com also has a problem - it is 20% of funds invested in shiba inu. So the owners of this exchange are even bigger gamblers than their users.",

I only have few hundreds left in some places for just in case i need to short something. But i agree with you, this would be a serious blow and it would mean more bear run and that we would have to wait for Bull run quite a while as trust has to be established again.",

As those speculation or news have said about them depositing to Gate and then asking for them to send it back.That has made the big news about them and I'm starting to feel that this is just another way of sending the market down.

I can imagine that bank deposits in weekends will be even slower to process.i think, it is more on because it falls on weekend, and if it is via bank deposit, it may take time. though should read announcements if they are having trouble with deposits. what i knew at the moment, is the deposit mistake of crypto.com to gate.io of about 320k ETH. however, they already got it back. try asking their support what's going on, they may have direct answer to you.",

Not looking good, does make me less confident now  Not only crypto.com is having rumors but even houbi and gate are having some false rumors after the FTX incident happened. I don't use crypto.com but I use houbi and depositing and withdrawing on houbi is fine. According to the developments that I read, crypto.com is having a non-transparent problem when transferring ETH to Gate.Earlier on twitter CZ also warned any exchange that transfers funds before or after, after releasing proof of reserve, that the exchange is having problems. If you have funds left on any exchange then it is best to withdraw them all to your non-custodial wallet, bad things can happen at any time.",

There’s a lot of issues with exchanges right now, I can say that its not safe to hold with them anymore. This is not a FUD but a precautionary measure to protect your asset from any possibilities of getting hacked or lose the control over that crypto.",
