  "content": "Hello! finally, after waiting a long time to get my hands on a cheap raspberry pi, I have managed to buy one. I am so happy right now!I have started the initial syncing process, but I want to pause it and restart tomorrow, because I know there will be a 2hrs electricity break for maintenance during the night. Is it possible to turn it off and start tomorrow from where I left it? I don't want to ruin my progress so far. I also haven't been able to find a similar topic on the web.",

There's also a \"stop\" rpc command that you can use with bitcoin-cli to stop bitcoind.Use it like any other RPC commands, e.g.: bitcoin-cli stopJust make sure that you'll call it with bitcoin-cli since it wont work with bitcoind like in the very old versions.",

Please though check my following answer to @ETFBitcoin, because it seems like I am wrong.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on May 19, 2023, 09:44:11 AMLast time i tried myNode on Virtual Machine i can access OS desktop and terminal easily.
