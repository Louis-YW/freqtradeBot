  "content": "It is no longer a news that El Salvador president adopted bitcoin in the month of September 2021. And for them to progress in economics they have to extend bitcoin adoption to their embassies in other countries. Which means bitcoin will be officially used in the embassies across the world. The first country that the bitcoin embassy is built is Switzerland. A legislature of El Salvador made the pronouncement.Quote“My fellow Salvadorans and I are very excited by the promise of Bitcoin, and I look forward to seeing how this initiative will help increase access to economic security and economic freedom for all,” said Mayorga.El Salvador Opens a Bitcoin Embassy in SwitzerlandEl Salvador will be a Great Nation",

      "body": "It's not just the Bitcoin adoption in El- Salvador but it's also some other countries accepting Bitcoins on their own , I recently went to Budapest, Hungary and there was an amazing Bitcoin cafe!! They were just accepting Bitcoins and ETH, even though I had to transfer and had to pay like 10$ instantly for p2p fee , I decided to support their small business and it was amazing. Slowly the countries are adopting Bitcoins and that's the reality and in the upcoming years wed can expect so many amazing things !! Thus it's important to promote Bitcoins since it's the only way we would be able to get out of the capitalism. It would be wiser to start with small businesses and ask them if they would accept the Bitcoins ! And teach new generation all about it. Yes sometimes users create extra threads but I do understand it's not just copying most of the time understandably some of them gets lost in the array of new threads thus no harm as long as it's a positive news.",

The title of the thread is what got my attention, and reading through the link makes me silly as this is more of an article than it is a news or government policy. The Embassy establishment is a fundamental right and duty of countries to strengthen their International relation and aid faster communication between countries, so El Salvador may decide to accept Bitcoin as payment in the embassy for services such as visa payment, international ID processing and lot of other payments that are generated through their Embassy in any country.",

I hope that this will encourage others to follow suit and adopt Bitcoin. I know many years ago companies adopted btc and then removed it when the price fell. I think wikipedia was one of the organizations to adopt btc then drop it when the price dropped. A big country like EL salvador doing this can only help the growth of btc and shows that you can weather the price drops.",

The only thing they can do is to extend the embassy related services against bitcoin payments. Probably that's the thing they are targeting. As bitcoin is their official currency, their embassy has full right to use it as an official currency in all embassy locations. As of now, El-Salvador holds embassy in 33 countries only! Also they are not much actively visited by the travellers. So I am not sure how helpful it will be for El-Salvador. But every Chang needs a humble beginning. So that must be it.",

This move will only be effective in countries that are friendly to bitcoin because every embassy must abide by the laws of its host country. Maybe people that want to apply for an El Salvador visa have the option of paying with bitcoin, which might also be a plus to bitcoin no matter how small. This step might also contribute positively to bitcoin awareness in some countries that have an El Salvadoran embassy. El Salvador deserves all the accolades for becoming a pacesetter in the path of making nations adopt bitcoin as legal tender.",

The Swiss government wouldn't really mind about bitcoin in El Salvadorian embassies so long as they do not go over the said territory.",
