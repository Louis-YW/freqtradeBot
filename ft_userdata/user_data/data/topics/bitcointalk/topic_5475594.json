  "content": "(ai generated image, https://creator.nightcafe.studio/)Before I start explaining DT (deity types), I must first explain what a deity is.Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeityA deity or god is a supernatural being considered to be sacred and worthy of worship. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines deity as a god or goddess, or anything revered as divine.A deity is basically a god or a goddess. Divine beings. Everybody knows that much already. The important part is, he/she must be worthy of worship. This is important because that's how deities generate their godlike power. The more worshipers they have, the more powerful they become. A god without worshipers is not a god. He/She is basically nothing. Not even a mortal. Not even a memory because nobody even remembers his/her name anymore.There are two types of deities.1- DT1 (Deity Type 1): Gods and Goddesses. They have enormous strength and durability.Major historical examples: Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Odin, Thor, Tengri, Baal, Amaterasu...2- DT2 (Deity Type 2): Demigods. These are also holy beings but they differentiate from the DT1 due to their unique characteristics. These beings have the blood of a deity and a mortal.Major historical examples: Hercules, Leonidas, Helen of Troy, Achilles, Kabundungulu, Bragi, Gilgamesh...DT1 (Deity Type 1)~Gods Of Bitcointalk~ai generated image, https://craiyon.comThe divine beings have the power to create life from nothing and eradicate any living creature. This is the club of gods where they drink blue label and bang virgins all day every day. They (mostly) live on Mt. Olympus and look down on mortals.We measure DT1 gods' power with \"God Power\". God Power (gp) can be obtained from the other gods (fallen gods included).The most powerful (top 10) gods (DT1) of bitcointalk are:Quote1-LoyceV (59 gp, the god king, also known as Switzerland)2-gmaxwell (24 gp)3-nutildah (23 gp)4-o_e_l_e_o (22 gp)5-DdmrDdmr (22 gp)6-Mitchell (22 gp)7-yahoo62278 (22 gp)8-The Cryptovator (19 gp)9-lovesmayfamilis (19 gp)10-Rikafip (18 gp)These are the most powerful gods who have lots of worshipers and very powerful beings. You just don't fuck with them (or else)DT2 (Deity Type 2)~Demigods of Bitcointalk~Demigods, half mortal, half god. One of the parents was a god and the other was a peasant. Even a godly being can fall in love with a mortal every once in a while. These divine beings are also very powerful and possess some godlike abilities but their powers have a limit. Still though, that doesn't prevent them from achieving amazing goals. Every once in a while we might see them slay a dragon or a Nemean lion which mere mortals can't even dream of doing.They don't have a club of their own and they certainly don't drink blue label. They drink walmart beer and bang whatever they can get.DT2 members take their power from the gods directly. So unless a DT1 god supports them, they are just peasants, mortals.We measure DT2 demigods' power with \"God Particles\". God particles (gp) can only be obtained from the gods. (fallen gods can't reproduce demigods)The most powerful (top 10) demigods (DT2) of bitcointalk are:Quote1-suchmoon (41 gp)2-Hhampuz (39 gp)3-hilariousandco (32 gp)4-DarkStar_  (31 gp)5-The Sceptical Chymist (29 gp)6-marlboroza (26 gp)7-Welsh (23 gp)8-owlcatz (21 gp)9-LFC_Bitcoin (20 gp)10-icopress (20 gp)Special Mention #1: satoshi(4 gp, unique demigod - creator of bitcoin)Being a demigod doesn't prevent you from accomplishing amazing stuff. satoshi is only a half god but he created this universe. Or maybe he used to be a god and decided to give up on his god powers later on. Or maybe he is hiding his real power. We can only make assumptions at this point because nobody has seen him for years. There is so much to be discovered about him. The researchers are doing their job revealing the mysteries which surround him.Special Mention #2:DefaultTrust(42 gp, an anomaly in the universe, gets stronger eating excessive god power)Fallen Gods~ DT1 ~Exiles. These beings have lost their god powers because of the crimes they have committed. They are banished from Mt. Olympus. Depending on their behavior, they may or may not regain their god status in the future. In their current form, they have the capacity of sending god power (elect gods) but they can't act as gods. They also can't send any god particles to elect demigods (DT2). Power-wise, they are only a little above mortals.Some notable fallen deities are:Quote1-HostFat (-5gp)2-Timelord2067 (-10 gp)3-Symmetrick (-11 gp)4-The0ldl_lser (-6 gp)5-stoos (-1 gp)6-wolwoo (-14 gp, antihero)7-be.open (-9 gp)8-Vispilio (-6 gp)9-bobita (-2 gp)10-comit (-1 gp)DT3 (Deity Type 3)~Special Deities, The God Killers~Yes, I lied. I am guilty. There is one more deity type which I haven't mentioned, yet. That is DT3, The God Killers. While they have all the characteristics of DT1 and DT2, in addition to that, they also bear a unique power. They can delete anybody and reset the realm. Even the most powerful heroic figures have no power against them. Don't let their god power fool you. They are above gods. They can have zero or below gp and still perform as god killers.There are only two known god killers in existence:1-Theymos (major god killer, 53 gp)Theymos devoured the whole Greek and Norse pantheon before. Now he is on bitcointalk. Hopefully he gained some wisdom and we won't share the same fate as the others. (at least for a while)2-Cyrus (the virus, minor god killer, 24 gp)Not much is known about Cyrus the virus.This post was possible thanks to:1- TalkImg (joker_josue)2- Bpip.org (Vod, suchmoon, ibminer)3- LoyceClub (LoyceV)",

The forum is multinational and many people believe in different opinions and beliefs, so it is better to keep religion away from the explanations. I also think that most religions today are monotheistic, meaning that there is one God that does not need your worship, but rather you are the one who needs.In general, the descriptions you mentioned are far from explaining how the trust system works.",

To start with, I really never knew what the word \"DT\" meant in the first place, not until now, and coming across the meaning for the first time, it now appears scary to me, like it's presented as some sort of secret cult group where there is really some kind of supernatural power purpose by those DTs. It makes it really scary to me, and I think I won't be the only one. This alone can put one in a position where they start seeing spiritualism in the forum. I can make them avoid engaging in conversation or arguments with some people in order not to get into trouble, as they don't even want to know what will come with that.",

Imagine who doesn't knows about the trustsystem and happened to come across this post they don't mind spreading the information across to others while isn't what exactly it means. I was actually confused at the first place just as orpichukwu said so please let try as much as possible to present things at the right way in order not to mislead people who yet to get whole configuration of DT system, although you could be right at your own views but it would be better of given the right information.",

Where everything is in control in every judgement for positive or negative tag, if a demigod was judged with negative by a god, matic he will no longer in the list next update. The same thing of gods gave you positive judgement, you will be enlisted from deity soon become a god.But today it will be different cause anyone can be deity and gods just depend on their trustlist.",
