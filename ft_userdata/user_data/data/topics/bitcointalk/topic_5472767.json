Affirmative. That was the point I was trying to drive home. It's theoretically possible but the effort it would take to achieve it is not worth it even with the fastest available computers today. That's why attackers don't try to guess or regenerate a private key or seed phrase. Except they have shit ton of money they'd like to waste without any expectations of getting something back.",

This is what they say about quantum computers but until we haven't see it happen, it's unlikely that this is possible through it. I think that I have already heard this like more than 6 years ago but with how fast technology evolves today, I don't think that we should worry with quantum computers and they'll just mostly used commercially.

It's usually a 24 or 12 seed phrase combination of different words, and no matter how you guess, you can never guess the right words. Even if you are lucky enough to guess some words, you will never be able to combine them correctly.

This makes it highly impossible for any existing seed phrase to be generated again by chance. Even if you were given a 1000 years to leave on earth, the chances of guessing a positive seed phrase are as high as spending your entire life on earth.",
