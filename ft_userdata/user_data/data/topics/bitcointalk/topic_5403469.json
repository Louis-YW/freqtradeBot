Without Bitcoin, CBDCs probably wouldn't be this crazy for every country that insists governments rush to launch their own CBDC. With objects that cannot be combined with each other, we have seen how important it is to maintain Bitcoin ownership assets. Therefore I strongly agree that Bitcoin cannot be compared to CBDC.",

Nobody wants to be stuck in the 19th century traditional banking system. They have to keep up with the paste otherwise like you said crypto will have the upper hand.Since the introduction of cbdc am not sure if there has been actually usage by citizens of countries that has so far introduced it. If most of cbdc are not built on blockchain technology it will encounter the same problem as fiat (as it is centralized and controlled by the government) and especially since they can manipulate the funds just as they do with fiat. So definitely crypto have a better advantage.",

They are much more than fiat, in the worst sense: with fiat you have the possibility to pay in cash, so payments are anonymous, unless you ask for an invoice and give your details. With CBDC all payments will be controlled. With the fiat you can keep it and hide it, with the CBDC they can confiscate it at any time by pressing a button.There has been talk of some features, such as putting an expiration date on CBDC money to stimulate consumption and other such crazy things.So they are not just fiat, they are much worse.",

Just like what happened to UST.I'm not in crypto to trust people/companies.I'm forced to trust Central Banks anyway, they can decide to dilute the existing money supply at any time.

This is a very pragmatic, thoughtful product and ideology. After its launch, there will be no paper, no coins. There will be a unique identifier of the citizen and his wallets and transactions. And the RIGHT of the issuer to MANAGE it. And first of all - CONTROL. Something that is not present when using paper money, and partially not in non-cash payments. And here there will be full control, from emmissi to gateways for converting one currency into another, as well as for each transaction, and the ability to slow it down, block it, transfer it to another account. Governments are tired of fiat problems. Yes, and the cost of maintaining the fiat is quite high, whatever one may say... What about the risks? In general, a separate topic for discussion.",
