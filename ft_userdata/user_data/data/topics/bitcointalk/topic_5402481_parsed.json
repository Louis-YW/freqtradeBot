Because for now bitcoin is volatile and I can't afford to get huge stress and be broke once the market is totally falling just like what happen on the market these days.Just put the amount what you can afford to lose and its not advisable to go all in because you are gambling your future on things you don't know what will be the outcome on future.",

Unfortunately I do not have much, which resulted with me not really having anything to offer for crypto, and that is the reason why I am not trading at all. I would love to do it, bitcoin is the better version of owning assets, its both a currency and an asset at the same time. People often forget that even though there are 1+ trillion dollars worth of coins out there, there are plenty of poor people like me involved in crypto as well. I may not be the traditional poor person because I make a decent living, but I still do not have much, I just have income, not assets, not items in my house, I just have income that I spend everyone month. Downside of living in an expensive place.",

Let's find how we are ready to negotiate, and what tools we do need in order the buyer could find the seller.Selling the items you bought with $65K BTC now isn't the worst idea.  Buy fancy car, drive for a year, sell for more in BTC than you paid.  Sounds like a good deal to me.  Doesn't have to be a car either.  Maybe jewelry or collector coins.  Basically anything...  Even USD...  I think the folks who were able to sell at $65K are probably happy to buy back twice as many coins and spend the rest on whatever they see fit.  This is why diversification is always important, sometimes even with things that might not appear to be smart financial purchases at the time.",

So I normally sell some for fiat, like, every month, to have some of that fiat on my card instead of doing international transfers.

Bitcoin isn't much of an investment to me, but it's something I keep some of my money in. If I don't need fiat for something specific, I won't sell BTC, but that's largely true for my behavior with BTC regardless of the price situation. Reasonably, I think now is the time to hodl or, if you have extra funds, buy more.Of course, if I didn't have to sell and could, say, for the bills or for groceries in BTC, that would have been much easier.",
