      "body": "Quote from: zzzccc on December 04, 2023, 04:05:16 PMI bought a Coldlar pro3 cold wallet, but after a long time I forgot the password. I thought I could use the mnemonic phrase to restore it, but now the address generated by importing the mnemonic phrase into other wallet software is different. Officials said they did not use the conventional BIP standard algorithm. Does anyone know this algorithm? I really need your help.I did a few research and it seems like Pro3 uses a so-called \"mnemonic enhancement mode\" which also use the payment password to derive the child keys.So even if you know the correct derivation path or bought another device from them, you still need the payment password to recover your bitcoins.Are you planning to bruteforce it after knowing the correct derivation path?Since it's closed source and the key derivation algorithm isn't disclosed, try to ask them for the \"derivation path\".(their help page mentions iancoleman's BIP39 tool so the payment password may be a BIP39 passphrase)There is a ColdLar ANN thread here in Bitcointalk but I can't vouch for the author's integrity: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4391660.0The user haven't logged-in since June though.Quote from: zzzccc on December 04, 2023, 04:05:16 PMIn the past, there was an official APP that used mnemonic phrases to store private keys, but now it has been removed from the shelves.I've searched the \"internet archive\" (archive.org) to see if the assistant app is saved there but I failed to find a working link.",

Now the official not only does not provide help, but also restricts the download of APPs with algorithms. coldlar is a piece of shit. I have collected two Android versions of the APP, but my programming knowledge is limited and I cannot find the algorithms hidden inside. Hope to get everyone's help.If somebody can figure out what wallet format the ColdLar app uses, then that should help with brute forcing, since 10 digits can be cracked very quickly.The reason this is important is so that we can find out what kind of encryption is being used to protect the wallet file, the prerequisite for brute-forcing a wallet in the first place. But it will be challenging to find, given that it's closed source.",

So it must be something similar to the BIP-39 passphrase, meaning it appends to the seed phrase and produces another set of keys.OP, have you tried importing the words to Electrum? Just in case they use the same standard that Electrum does. Also, do you recall if they also offered LN features? Because they could potentially use aezeed cipher seedEDIT: I just saw you posted a valid BIP39 seed phrase. I hope it's not yours.",

Hope to get everyone's help.If anyone can provide me with a derivation path, I'd be willing to pay.~snip~Can you grab the master public key(xpub, zpub) of this wallet?You can maybe able to scan the master public key and find the right derivation path of your wallet using the xPub scanner developed by Ledger.Check the tool below.- https://github.com/LedgerHQ/xpub-scanIt should work if you have the right master public key. There's also an old version of the scanner but it only works on legacy addresses if your wallet uses legacy addresses then this one also works you don't need to run a node unlike the xpub scanner on the ledger check the link below.- https://blockpath.com/wallets/local/101?action=appxpub",
