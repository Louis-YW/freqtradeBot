I am really confused about what I saw yesterday; someone should please explain it to me. I created this Bitcoin wallet recently using a Trust wallet, which I used for my first signature registration. checked the wallet and saw zero deposits on it, but when I scanned it through Blockchain There was only one transaction recorded, a deposit of 16.8$ worth of BTC, but the balance remains empty.How could this be possible, please?bc1qaql8wk9x8h69lwutymah53sv5d8zzcmw3vvw80",

      "body": "How sure are you that the trust wallet operated by you was downloaded from the original website, secondly it can appear that way simple because of the transaction not been confirmed yet, the mempool might be busy or possibly already filled up, a good solution is to import your wallet on electrum or you can possibly delete the wallet and reinstall a new one and import your wallet as well, but in doing this, you can exercise some patience as well and i will also request that this thread be moved to bitcoin technical support https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0 where you could be more appropriately attended to.",

Next time just use other Bitcoin explorer like blockchair.com since it's the best choice since you run it over Tor network in order to increase your privacy and prevent from honey pot.Just checked your address, it show your address contain $16 in your wallet https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qaql8wk9x8h69lwutymah53sv5d8zzcmw3vvw80Or maybe blockchain.com will show the balance after the transaction has at least 1 confirmation, right now there's no confirmation 0 of 6.",

You have been in crypto for a long time and you do not know that the balance does not appear until after at least 1 confirmation?!!You have a pending transaction, there are 0-6 confirmations i.e. there is no confirmation yet so nothing will appear in your balance:                              Also Trust wallet is not a bitcoin wallet it is better to use a bitcoin wallet.",

It is not a problem on your end, the network is just busy due to ordinals or something (check Twitter and you'll know what I mean) if you're not familiar with how BTC works. I suggest reading more about Bitcoin so you can understand it better and not expect every transaction will get confirmation after a few minutes. It has been confirmed just now, but next week don't be surprised if something similar happens again.As for the wallet, I suggest using Electrum if you use Trust Wallet only for accepting Bitcoin for your sig campaign. It should be better from a privacy and security point-of-view, as long as you know what you're doing.",

I have experienced countless delays on blockchain transactions though this is my first receiving bitcoin with a Trust wallet which does not show incoming transactions until it's completed what confused me the most is blockchain.com which I used...Thank you all for the help and solution.. since my issue is resolved i will locked the thread now.",
