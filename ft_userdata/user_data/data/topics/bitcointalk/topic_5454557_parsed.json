      "body": "lol, are you sure that with just 100 bucks you can become a whale in the future thanks to this coin? Also, when I looked at this contract briefly, this meme was actually a scam. The liquidity is low, the daily trading volume is not much, and the price is falling and will never be in the support zone. So to me, it's really silly to put $100 on this project; I'd rather go out and trade crypto futures than this meme contract.",

I guess the bull is around the corner and is less than a year to get into fully bitcoin halving, I know many projects will want to utilize this opportunity to launch in other to scam people and go away with their investment.",

If that is possible, why do you need $100 from me? Isn't it better to take out a loan and pay it off since you are guaranteed to make a profit?The rush to ask you to send your money, the lack of a plan for the currency, there is no real active DEV team, a lot of lies, the dream of profit and wealth without effort, and telling you to invest first are all things that indicate that you are trying to scam, especially since your account is newbie account and without a commercial record, meaning that if you get a negative trust, you can go back and create a new account, you have nothing to lose.It is the fastest way to lose your money and your mental health.",
