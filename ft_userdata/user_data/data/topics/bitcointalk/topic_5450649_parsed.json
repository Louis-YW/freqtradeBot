  "content": "I have been thinking of how an RV or a customized camping vehicle stocked up, BTC in hand and the world as an open destination would feel like?The ease at which BTC has made gypsy movement easy by offering a decentralized banking solution to anyone who lives off grid is one topic I have been meaning to discuss mostly as it concerns those who love travelling or living off grid or camping off grid for a duration before going back to civilization. How has BTC or the use of cryptocurrency been of help? Let's discuss!",

He's the man that has sold everything and together with his family started living all in and bought btc from the profits they've made from selling everything even their house. They're the known \"Bitcoin Family\". Living in an RV is an exciting part of life but before doing that, you should consider if you think that you like to be one and have that free life going everywhere you want. This camping van life has been trending lately although it's been done already in the past by many but wasn't on the mainstream but thanks to social media it became a thing.",

IMO, the portability and borderless of crypto or Bitcoin makes it helpful.It can be easily transported across borders without the need for traditional financial institutions or government oversight as long as Bitcoin is accepted in your location you freely use it.  This makes them a useful tool for people who engage in off-grid living or frequent travel.I have a friend that talked about this and try to explore different places as he said, he is a crypto enthusiast who knows how to use Bitcoin as a payment.  He purchased a Starlink RV subscription for his RV van that was recently used for Youth camping.  He said he wants to try for months off-grid living (outside the country)and for sure since he has Bitcoin, he will use it.",

      "body": "I have not tried it myself, but isn't it hard to live off grid at the same time rely only on Bitcoin? Bitcoin's acceptance as a payment is mostly available online and in urban areas. If you plan to go somewhere far from civilization, will it not be a problem that you will probably encounter much less stores and probably not one that accepts Bitcoin? If you want to go camping, I assume it's not within the city. I don't think Bitcoin is that easy to spend in far away rural areas.",

      "body": "I think that lifestyle could definitely be fun, but also perhaps lonely. If you're a lone wolf or you got your significant other or a friend/s doing this with you that you enjoy their company I could see every day being a new adventure. As far as utilizing BTC for this, if it were me i'd probably get that BitPay card so I could have some form of payment option. Obviously internet would be a must, kind of ironic though isn't it. Getting off grid just to get back on it in a wireless fashion haha. Kind of counter intuitive. Anyways, yeah i'd definitely get like a cradlepoint or some 5G router with dual SIMs/ a satelite phone and a really dope radio. Other than that a suited up RV and enough BTC to get you through would make for an epic movie plot, wouldn't it? Even more epic lifestyle I would have to say. I would LOVE to do something like this in the future. RVs have always been something i've had my eye on down the road (Pun intended).",

I want to draw up a plan and try as much as possible to hold fiat and instead spend profits from my BTC investment.The question I still haven't figured out is this, is it till BTC is recognized as a legal tender in the country that one intends to journey through or journey from, that it will be possible to fully fund an RV trip of such manner, with only BTC?Is it also going to be better to go alone or with a better half or a family?",
