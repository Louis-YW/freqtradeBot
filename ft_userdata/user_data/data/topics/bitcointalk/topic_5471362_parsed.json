Are you sure what you posted is the correct website? If you don't mind, I would like to know how you got to know about the platform.If they were real and your fund is already stocked with them, they would have paid you 80% and taken 20%. Asking you to deposit more money to cover for taxes sends a red flag. If you go ahead with the deposit you will be incurring more losses to yourself because you won't be able to withdraw your funds at the end of the day. This is a scam and you should stay away.",

      "body": "There is no way the crypto platform is to be trusted since they are asking to deposit first before making any withdrawals. This is how scam platforms operate. They will try to entice you with their bonus, making you believe that once you pay the amount they are asking for, the money in the account you created with them will be yours(a big lie). The moment you pay in that money, a few hours later you will find out their platform is no longer accessible again and will cease to function. So run away from any platform asking for a deposit first before withdrawal. It's for your own good",

All that you can do now is to accept the loss and not send them any additional money and learn from your mistakes. Sorry for your loss and I hope that this lesson didn't cost you much.Out of curiosity, how did you even find about this unknown scam website?",

Try to cash out your money and tell them that why they aren't allowing you to withdraw the money while other platforms are allowing the users to withdraw their money without any such taxes. A legit platform would never freeze someone's account unless they find illegal activity done by that account holder. In your case it's clear that they are tricking you to deposit more money so they can scam you even further. They already scammed you by holding your money on their platform and now they are trying to grab more money out of your pocket. Be careful my friend from such fraud platforms and in future go with the trusted platforms only. Don't send them anything if your current amount is gone then let it go don't let them fool you and get more money from you. I'm really sorry for your loss and I hope that you'll learn a lesson from the loss because it's really unworthy to deposit funds into a platform which no one knows about. After checking the whois information of the site I found the site is just 118 days old and such new sites should never be trusted. Here's the URL to know further details about that site: whois details of the site",
