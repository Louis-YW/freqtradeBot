A rhetorical question.Transaction does not depend on Electrum, it depends on the fee that you paid and how congested the mempool is. For fee rate estimation, you can use:For beginners: https://mempool.space/For advanced users: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weightAddress type can also cause high fee. For low fee, be using segwit addresses (bitcoin addresses that start from bc1)",

The time to the next block to be mined can take up to 10 minutes or more. The time you make the transaction in relation to the time to the next block also matters.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 05, 2023, 11:01:57 AMMore specifically, you can read how the suggestions are calculated here: https://github.com/mempool/mempool/blob/827b0f6ad1c419e79d1a5cfa55b74b9c993a4748/frontend/src/app/docs/api-docs/api-docs.component.html#L199Snipped and reformatted for easier reading:QuoteHigh Priority. This figure is the median feerate of transactions in the first mempool block. Consider using this feerate if you want confirmation as soon as possible.Medium Priority. This figure is the average of the median feerate of the first mempool block and the median feerate of the second mempool block.Low Priority. This figure is the average of the Medium Priority feerate and the median feerate of the third mempool block. Consider using this feerate if you want confirmation soon but don't need it particularly quickly.No Priority. This figure is either 2x the minimum feerate, or the Low Priority feerate (whichever is lower). Consider using this feerate if you are in no rush and don't mind if confirmation takes a while.",

I am also very suprised about the speed of your transfer !!!The type of the address does not matter when trying to get your transaction confirmed, since if you use the same fee rate on both transactions, that means you are saving fees on segwit, but the amount of fees the miner gets does not increase. So in these current mempool conditions, when you're using the default fee suggested by electrum (about 15 or something), then your transaction's going to get jammed while even more transactions with a similar fee pile up and it will be stuck there for hours.",
