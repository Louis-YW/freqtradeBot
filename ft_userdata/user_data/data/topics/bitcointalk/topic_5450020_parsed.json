  "content": "So I was recently communicating with someone here who has anger issues and who does not even know what a Watt is. I cannot communicate with people when they mention Watts but they are completely oblivious to what those words mean. If you do not know what a Watt is, then you have absolutely no business discussing any of the aspects of cryptocurrency mining because you need to be able to understand the scales of things.Here is what you all need to know in order to be respectable people. I suggest that you learn calculus and basic physics before continuing on with life.1. Acceleration is a rate of change in speed. 1 meter per second per second is just 1 meter/second^2. This is just the amount of acceleration needed to change the velocity of an object by 1 meter/second every second.2. The Newton is a unit of force. 1 Newton is the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at a rate of 1 meter/second^2.3. The unit Joule is a unit of energy. 1 Joule is equal to the amount of work to overcome a force of 1 Newton over the distance of 1 meter.4. A Watt is simply 1 Joule per second. The Watt is a unit of power. 1 Watt is the power required to move an object at a speed of 1 m/s while the object is subject to a resistive force of 1 Newton.PROBLEMS: Here a problems that you should be able to do in order to be a respectable person.1. How much power does it take for a 180 lb person to climb 2 stairs per second where each stair is 7 inches long? Use the fact that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2.2. If a machine uses 15,000,000 Watts of power for 5 days, how much energy did that machine consume over those 5 days?3. How much power is 1,000,000,000 Joules per day?If you cannot successfully and easily answer these questions, then you need to get an education in basic physics. I addition to your lack of physics knowledge, you may want to consider improving your social skills so that you don't come off as a complete and total chlurmck.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.P.S. It is also a good idea to know about Boltzmann's constant k=1.38*10^(-23) Joules/Kelvin since the efficiency of cryptocurrency mining is approaching Landauer's limit k*T*ln(2) where T is the temperature.Creator of Circcash",

If you want to communicate with me, you will need to go through the effort of relaying your message through a third party. Or you can hope that someone else quotes you. In the mean time, you should learn more about physical quantities such as meters, seconds, Kelvin, Joules, Newtons, Watts, Pascals, and about Landauer's limit.",

As you've said, this area is for BTC mining discussion only.Oops... 'ignorant' me did anyway",
