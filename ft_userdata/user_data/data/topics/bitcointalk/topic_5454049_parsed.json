I also don't want to buy old gears that will fill my farm without any considerable hashrate, this forces me to pick mining gears that can live for long since that's all I worry about, I make a profit as long as the gear is alive regardless.Of course, someone else who pays a lot for power might be looking for other things, efficiency could be everything they care about, it's hard to assume what other people are thinking.",
