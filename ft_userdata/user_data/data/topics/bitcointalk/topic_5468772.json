Â Adding a 30k option to the upside. Â  Â I mean who knows...Anyway, here's the monthly chart. Â Looking decent, looking like a higher low... Â Dunno.",

October has been a traditionally good month for the price, although that is no guarantee of anything. But if we take into account that we are getting closer and closer to halving and that the worst of the macro-economy, such as the rise in interest rates, is already discounted, I believe that the price will go up.",

It could be delayed to 2025. If you look at the chart from 2021, you will notice that the M shape is fully formed andÂ  we know that bull doesn't really happen immediately after the second leg of the M. It seems that consolidation will happen for as long as half bear market happened before the bull run will take off.

If there isn't any more fud with binance this year we can see a consistent green till the end of the year. BTC dominance went down a little bit today but now it has come back to its previous level again. If it goes above 52 then breaking the 30k level is kind of easy for bitcoin.",

I think that we are not at a stage where we will have the strength to make more than 10% in one month, because it would be one of the better Octobers.

I know that it is not all that easy and we could end up with a bigger return eventually but we need to end up with something that should be a bit more calmer and not 30k. I am sensing that above 28k and stay there seems a bit more logical to me, because 30k looks little bit too much right now.We are already above 28k which is awesome and it looks like October will be a green month already and when you are this good just early few days of the month that gives you a better chance. I think staying around here would be good enough, if we can go to 30k+ and stay there that would be lovely and I would be very very happy, but I would stay happy as long as it stays above 28k as well.",
