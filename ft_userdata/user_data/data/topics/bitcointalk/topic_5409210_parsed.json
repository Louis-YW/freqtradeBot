This is one of the easiest way to create BSC wallets. But there is an alternative like Atomic Wallet. It will create you an ETH wallet, but it suits for BSC also.",

The biggest problem with trustwallet is that it's close-source and there is no way to know how the keys have been generated and whether they are stored in their server or not. That may be why OP doesn't want to use trustwallet. The other problem with trustwallet is that it's only available on mobile and it has no desktop version.",

I meant metamask can also be used for this. Some people already mentioned myetherwallet to create BSC and yeah it's also very safe to create on MEW. I will also mention mycrypto as a way to create your BSC wallet. This is also the safest way to create your own BSC wallet.",

In order to start using the address in the BNB Chains network, you just need to import the private key into a wallet, for example MetaMask.",
