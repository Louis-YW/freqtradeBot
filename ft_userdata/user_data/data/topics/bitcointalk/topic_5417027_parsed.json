  "content": "All else being peripheral, I appreciate your time in reading and any advice you may be able to provide – thank you. I am learning about the mathematics behind the proof of work. As I understand it, the basic concept is predicated upon the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The idea is that the blockchain sends out a target hash, which miners compete to solve by producing a hash equal to or below the target hash value. The target hash is a 64-bit hexadecimal string. However, the first eight digits are always 0, leaving 56-bits to be solved.The maximum target hash is: 00000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000To win a block, one must: 1) produce a string with the correct number of zeros; and 2) get a number lower than the target hash. Generally, the winning hash must be lower than the hash of the previous block. However, I am still struggling to find a way to interact with the network to get some hands on experience and visually see the algorithms running the mining process. Some ongoing questions I have are:Question 0: What are the specific inputs necessary to mine a block?Question 1: What is the specific value presented to miners that is being hashed? Question 2: Is it necessary to get the right number of zeros if the value is lower than the target?Question 3: How does the difficulty mechanism impact or effect the target hash?  Question 4: How can one submit a target hash to the network for validation?",
