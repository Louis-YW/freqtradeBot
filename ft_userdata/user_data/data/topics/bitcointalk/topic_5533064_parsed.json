Future can repeat history patterns or can be very different, it's an important reminder.If history repeats, you will have profit by hodling your bitcoin at least 5years and longer.https://hodl.camp/Bitcoin profitable days chart can give you more strength to hodl.https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/bitcoin-profitable-days/",

Losing confidence in holding your Bitcoin investment it means that you have lost encouragement probably because you decided to be investing on your own without any community involvement because that can really help. for instance, it will be more difficult for someone who is an active member of this forum to become completely discouraged about Bitcoin than someone who is not a member of any community that talks about Bitcoin but just investing on their own personally out of their own knowledge and being their own motivation.",

During bearish periods, there's a little hike but it's not as much as compared to the bull. Take for instance, in January of last year when the ETFs were approved, Bitcoin price experienced a huge surge and then we haven't witnessed the bull run, so instead of attributing it's growth only to when we experience the bull season, it's better to say Bitcoin is regarded as king amongst other crypto currencies when there is a price increase and that even with the tragedies it has experienced over the years, its still standing strong.",

So, if all that I mentioned is embedded in you, I am sure you will be strong and not tempted by the existing profits because you are only sure that the price is not the last highest price experienced by Bitcoin until you find satisfaction with the price of Bitcoin.
