It is impossible not to have anyone mining bitcoin. Even the continuous high price of its mining tools can’t stop that. Or the government threatening to ban the POW mining method because there will be people mining it. But in fiction should every miner stops mining in the world then the existence of bitcoin will be threatened. Miners are the maintainers or validators of bitcoin transactions. Without them the bitcoin blockchain will be threatened.Quotehow would this affect the value and future of Bitcoin as a digital asset and decentralized currency?   in other words, what would happen to Bitcoin if mining completely stopped or ceased?Bitcoin mining will eventually stop when all 21 million bitcoins have been mined and miners will only earn from transactions fees. This will create bitcoin scarcity and as much will make bitcoin an expensive assets. It’s limited supply is what gives it an edge against other assets",

Imagine there no competition on mining. Everyone is looking at you to get their transaction picked and confirmed. You will have all these coins? Isn't it too good to be truth?But assume such thing just happened. Industrial mining died. Hash-power dropped dramatically, mining difficulty is just like it was at the beginning. More individuals will be able to mine bitcoin. That's in theory though.",

China banned bitcoin mining, but Chinese miners are now the second largest. When China banned bitcoin mining, Kazakhstan become the second largest, but now third largest. Kazakhstan makes bitcoin mining legal and see what that happened recently, the tax Kazakhstan government made from crypto mining. Kazakhstan collected $7M in crypto mining taxes in 2022All governments can not decide one day that they want to ban bitcoin mining. As one government will ban it, another government sees it as opportunity to mine.",

Mining is the process of keeping the network secure, producing new Bitcoins, confirming transactions, etc. If all miners stop, no transactions would occur because there would be no confirmations and also, no new Bitcoins would come into circulation.Obviously this would represent many jobs lost, companies going down the drain, investments screwed up and who knows what more!",

There is no conceivable scenario where difficulty drops quickly.If the last 2016 blocks took less than 2 weeks, then difficulty goes up, not down.The only way for difficulty to drop is for the last 2016 blocks to have taken more than 2 weeks.And the most it can drop is by a factor of 4. But that means that the last 2016 blocks took at least 2 months.So by definition a large drop takes a very long time.If all mining stops, it takes forever to mine another block.If nearly all mining stops, then it will take many months to adjust difficulty.",

Am sure you must have been a newbie in this, if not how could you expect all the bitcoin mining components to stop working at the same time for no reason, it's not possible because bitcoin is a decentralized network a d every miner is independently on their own a d what connects them together is when they are connected to the nodes on blockchain from their own system or computers, but they can't influence any change, or cause alterations of any kind to the network as long as such move does not conform to the blockchain protocols it's not considered, no central server anywhere like the centralized institutions do have in controlling the network, bitcoin network is decentralized and blockchain is immutable.Quote from: cafter on May 08, 2023, 05:37:24 AMhow would this affect the value and future of Bitcoin as a digital asset and decentralized currency?   in other words, what would happen to Bitcoin if mining completely stopped or ceased?If all the remaining blocks were completely mined, the bitcoin network will not stop, miners will depend on the transaction fee for their incentives and bitcoin protocols remains.",

Why would all the computers that are involved in bitcoin mining shut down at the same time? If you are saying about any specific reason you need to mention the same to clear the doubts.Second the miners are getting rewards for it so they will never stop doing so although the competition and hashrate will vary from time to time but nobody doing so will automatically push the difficulty to low and again profit making opportunity for miners so they won't stop doing it.Third as you are saying about being ceased then it's case where government has put ban on mining operations and strict regulations are being followed.Even in this case they won't be able yo track down miners because they are using TOR network with their own nodes so it's completely private for them.Forth even if such thing happens it won't affect the decentralised nature of bitcoin because no central chain of authority,no third party involvement still remains the same as you can't make changes to the source code in the manner it's designed.So don't think too much about it.",

Unless there is a world attack, it would be difficult for all computers in the world or device stop working at once or for mining to suddenly stop all round. Most countries survive on Bitcoin, so it should make you think that most miners use a special separate power source for their servers, I don't need to talk of the heavy encryption and firewalls they use as security too.Bitcoin would find a way to survive still, because more like fiat currency, it is also a currency of its own. AI these days can even be programmed to mine coins as well as major super computers. Imagine again if it might be plausible even.",
