E just be like a young boy wey dey inside house dey make money from legitimate online hustle dem but people go talk say na yahoo him dey do and that's because people don't believe you can make money from online without doing fraud, as you bring online business to introduce to them, dem go call am scam and na the problem Bitcoin dey get be dat. Many people associate bitcoin with yahoo boys and ponzi scheme.E get one thing wey the law enforcement agency like dem EFCC dey do on purpose. Dem go announced some things specifically repeatedly like dem go seize Bitcoin worth so so amount with other items and calls cars of special brand names and they're doing this to associate them with yahoo boys so now if you wan teach person Bitcoin dem go think say you wan teach them yahoo. We still get a long way to go for the country but we go surely get that information about Bitcoin out to general public. Make we just dey try our best dey preach good about Bitcoin and one day we go fit knack our chest talk say we dey into Bitcoin and people no go judge us as scammers.",

I don’t know how they were able to link owning bitcoin and yahoo together and they are in no way related to one another. Many people see any online investment or savings  as a means of scam and so they avoid it by all means and label all of them to be scams. I don’t blame your neighbor for her behavior and mindset towards bitcoin since she’s still ignorant about it. And thank you for spreading the knowledge about bitcoin with her and making her understand what bitcoin is about and different from the negative factors it’s attached to.",

She doesn't know anything about it, but it is due to ignorance because everyone in this country today believes that anything they do online is yahoo yahoo. They are ignorant of the legitimate side hustles available online. These individuals want a thorough explanation of what bitcoin and cryptocurrencies actually are. I didn't believe in bitcoin when I first heard of it because I assumed it was all these Ponzi schemes that defrauded people. As a result, I missed out on benefiting from it much sooner.

Bitcoin's presence in the market provided financial independence to most traders who chose to trade and invest in Bitcoin. Those who invested in bitcoin when it was $5k or $10k are now reaping tremendous rewards, as are those who bagged it and put it in their portfolio, which has prompted the sell.",

But the major reason why the CBN give the ban on bank vs cryptocurrencies transactions is due to the rise in the number of Ponzi schemes perpetuated using Bitcoin and other altcoins as means of payment or investment tools but in the end, the scammers pulled several exit scam on the investors when the bubbles burst. But aside from that,  Bitcoin is just a victim of circumstance and due to Bitcoin's unique features,  scammers seize it as a formidable tool to carry out their scheme activities.",

In crypto adoption, Nigeria is always among the first 10. If you know you cannot fully teach people what cryptocurrencies are, do not bother to tell them about it. If just discussing and you tell them, let them know how risky they are too.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on June 28, 2023, 09:27:32 PME get one thing wey the law enforcement agency like dem EFCC dey do on purpose. Dem go announced some things specifically repeatedly like dem go seize Bitcoin worth so so amount with other items and calls cars of special brand names and they're doing this to associate them with yahoo boys so now if you wan teach person Bitcoin dem go think say you wan teach them yahoo. We still get a long way to go for the country but we go surely get that information about Bitcoin out to general public. Make we just dey try our best dey preach good about Bitcoin and one day we go fit knack our chest talk say we dey into Bitcoin and people no go judge us as scammers. But did you know that some people are internet fraudster and they are dealing with cryptocurrencies? I do not mean they scam using bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies, but they scam and bought bitcoin and/or some other cryptocurrencies. There was a crypto scam research that I read in the past when cryptocurrencies were not regulated like this, with many exchanges like Binance making their users to deposit and withdraw without KYC, the research linked Nigerians scamming people on Instagram and using exchanges linked to Lagos IP addresses. I do not see the research now, it shows the methodology used which would have been something good to read. Few allegations may not be correct but not all that are wrong, just like in life without crypto.",

I had a conversation with my neighbour yesterday and our discussion lead to talks about bitcoin, it got to a point where I asked her if she had an idea about bitcoin then her reply was no (tufiakwa) i no wan even know am because na scam, then I asked how, she said yes now na yahoo boys dey do bitcoin and I no go like put body for wetin them go scam me, it was so funny that I laughed, and later began to correct her statement. I started by letting her know about cryptocurrency, i gave her a breakdown saying that crypto currency is a digital currency that the transactions are decentralized that is they're not controlled by government authorities, then I told her bitcoin is the 1st Cryptocurrency that was created as an alternative to fiat currency for transactions of goods and services, that got her interest and she was like really, oboy I think say na scam o, then I told her no that asides being decentralized that bitcoin is trustworthy and safe and all she needs is a better understanding about it as well as investing and storing crypto with a good exchange. I created this post because I know cryptocurrency is vastly gaining audience around the world but there are many left behind who doesn't have idea about it, most of them due to ignorance have been scammed on wrong investments by bad actors, these persons can be anyone, your friend, uncle or even closer family members so it's our duty to teach  them about cryptocurrency to avoid the risk of falling for bad actors.People go say Bitcoin na scam if they don't know anything about it or they don't have interest on it, I know go blame them, because dey go think say na that can of platform were if you invest money dey go crash for some weeks, dey scam people if dey don't have any knowledge about what dey are doing, scammers done full anywhere now, but if you guide them and explain everything about crypto for them, dey will understand that is not a scam, because Bitcoin is the best crypto currencies in the world and anyone will like to invest is money in it  but is long time investment",
