  "content": "Hello and I hope you all are having a comfortable and safe day.Today 6 years ago the deadliest mass shooting in American history took place and part of it happened in one of the biggest hotels and casinos of Las Vegas. QuoteOn October 1, 2017, a mass shooting occurred when 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada from his 32nd-floor suites in the Mandalay Bay hotel. He fired more than 1,000 bullets, killing 60 people[a] and wounding at least 413.Source: https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/video/day-history-las-vegas-shooting-142000950.htmlQuoteOctober 1, 2017. 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd of concert-goers from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay on the Las Vegas strip.Back then happened it was quite shocking to me, because I could not comprehend such senseless act of violence and even to this day, it is something which disturbs me. I would like to use this thread to both remember the victims of this mindless tragedy and also to lay some questions onto the table for all of you who have visited casinos and resorts since 2017, specially in USA.Do you think security measures in Casinos and Resorts got tougher since this massacre took place?Would be as easy as it was back in 2017 to bring dozens of weapons and ammo up to the 32th floor of a resort nowadays?If you were in charge of a casino, what would you do to curb the risk of something like this ever happening again?",

It's usually done by toping up your security measures and adding an extra layer of security devices with lastest upgrades like metal detectors with higher ranges just incase some might try playing smart. Also, you have to be aware of your employees, they might also be trouble for you since they know much about the system. So it's best to keep an eye on them.",

Anyone with some mental issues can do such a crime not only near a casino but everywhere else.I never had a chance to attend a real casino because of living in a country where gambling and casinos are not authorized, My only option is online gambling which is a safer option also when it comes to incidents like this related to weapons or violence. However the side effects in online gambling can be worse than gambling in a real casino.Answering your question about  the security measures in casino later after what happened I believe there is a better routines and measures because we didn’t hear similar incidents after that, still just what I know since I don’t live in USA, and if I were in charge of a casino security surely there few things I would like to do from prohibiting guns or any arms near the facility and also doing the best to calm anger cases between gamblers and control situations where I believe the gambler may do something bad especially on a big loss.",

Just like we always see a security guard outside the banks, since gamblers bring in and take out money from the casino, the security arrangements are very necessary.However, this applies to the physical casino. For online casinos, the security should be in a sense that no hacker can hack the site and the site should have all the measures to prevent brute force and other attacks.",

Handguns can be carried around without restrictions. From the news we get from the US, little has really changed. There is still a high rate of mass shootings in the US even soft zones like schools have been main targets in recent times. Most of these mass killers in the US invest a lot of time and financial recourse to carry out these wicked acts so they end up outsmarting the security systems of the country. In my country, we hardly have mass shootings because guns are restricted to only law enforcement agencies. Big hotels like Mandalay Bay will have metal dictators that will limit the possibility of bringing such arms that make someone shoot close to a thousand bullets from a hotel room.",

Don’t be surprised since mass shooting and other insane way to harm of people is very common on USA. I will not be surprised if the suspect on this mass shooting is a victim of gambling since most of them resort to violence once they know that they already loss everything. Casino security on Vegas is become more tightened because of this incident. This makes casino experience more suffocating in there since you can’t play loose in there or else security will come to get you.",

That is the weirdest part about this case, though.Even though he had lost a considerable percentage of his money to casinos, he continued to be a millionaire, had properties and a girlfriend who worked as a waitress in a casino. Do it does not completely fit into the profile of a gambler who had loss everything to casinos, though he was arrogant enough to claim he could beat the system while being a dedicated gambler. Officially, his motivations have been classified as undetermined to this day.",

Im guessing airport style scanners at entrance could be one way of trying to reduce it. But an arsenal like that would probably go in from a side door anyway.",

A mass shooting will always happen, it may not be in a Vegas Hotel but somewhere else because it's easy to acquire guns in the US. The 2nd amendment is a touchy topic in US.",

And it wouldn't be easy to bring dozens of guns and ammunition into a casino because security will check all visitors before they enter the casino.But visitors can carry guns and ammunition in underground casinos where we may have heard about it. If I were responsible for the casino, I would increase security and not allow the same incident to happen again. That will damage the casino's reputation that it has built a long time ago.",

Even with security in place, as long as an insider agrees to cooperate then things can be done way too easily. Everything from cameras to guard methods is, in the end, handled by humans. It's way too easy to say temporarily turn off cameras if they can get assistance from an insider, and the same with patrol areas and the like. Not to mention that even with security measures improving, you can say attack measure also improved. The least I'd do would probably set up traps. While it's hard to determine how to stop something you don't know, it's rather easy to setup a blockade/trap when you know it already happened. Sad to say though this can lead to a lot more people being implicated since the plan is to deal with it AFTER, not before.",

I think that if a person really wants to commit mass murder, nothing can stop them. If he doesn't commit it in a casino, he can do it in any other public place. Unfortunately, today's health care system cannot detect in the early stages of a person's predisposition to murder and cruelty. In my opinion, this sphere should be more carefully controlled, because there have always been people with predispositions to brutal cruelty. And there has always been a problem of detecting such people.",

A situation where someone has license to a gone, he could just open fire if he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and casino to me is a spot for illicit and bad intention minded people hang out, there might still be fight breaking out within enemies.",
