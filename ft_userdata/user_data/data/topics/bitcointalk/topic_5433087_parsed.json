  "content": "I have not used LastPass password manager before, some people said it is also used for 2 factor authentication, but this is about people that are convenient to store their seed phrase, private key and password using a password manager that can connect online. The password manager uses vault to store people's information which are encrypted. In August 2022, hacker breached data of LastPass users, but can only be accessed using the password the users used to encrypt the data, said LastPass.LastPass attacker stole password vault data, showing Web2’s limitationsLastPass data breach led to $53K   stolen, lawsuit allegesWhat do you think about this? Before hacker can have access to something, that means the vault is online. If something is online, it can be hacked. If a password manager is not offline, do not use it. I like to put my seed phrase on a paper, if you want it safer, you can use a steel backup for it, there are steels that you can buy to backup your seed phrase and it is not a waste of money.If you are afraid of people not to see your seed phrase and steal it, keep your seed phrase in a very safe place but use passphrase to make it safer.",

I like to print my seed phrases on paper and use plastic to make them more durable, super convenient to store, and easy to move. I was thinking of using small steel plates to carve the phrases, but I really don't trust handing them over to the blacksmith or any stranger.LastPass is the worst password manager app I have ever seen, it has been hacked many times before, not just once in 2022. Currently, I also use a password manager just to create strong passwords and manage regular passwords, never used to save bank accounts or important emails. Honestly, I never wholly trust online storage services, they are only for convenience, never guarantee safety.",

Therefore, in order not to blame ourselves for any incidents, such as theft or leakage, we must rely only on ourselves. In addition, we all exaggerate the complexity of storing important data.

I especially hate websites that ask you to change your password regularly, that just encourages people to use something simple.My system: I use different accounts for different devices. Hence LoyceMobile. Disable password recovery as much as possible. Don't do banking on mobile. Use a separate Bitcoin wallet on mobile. Never use my creditcard on mobile (that saves a lot of money too).I'm also paranoid to install anything untrusted. I prefer not to install it at all, but if I have to, I'll use a VM or a dedicated laptop (when done, I dualboot into the second partition to overwrite the first partition in a few minutes).QuoteThat's why the things (websites, apps) that hold money need at least 2FA too.I love dust crypto wallets without password and I hate 2FA.

      "body": "I also prefer to save Seed phrases offline. At first I just wrote on a piece of paper in my notebook and kept it with other important documents. but I have read in this forum about another way which is more effective and safe even without having to keep it locked. i.e. spreading every word in a Novel bookwhich is boring and has quite thick pages. and how it spread only I know. So it will be difficult for someone to find word for word in the novel. because it requires a special sign which is quite difficult to be found by people who don't know.I was inspired by this post by Mr. @ahli38 in this threadQuote from: Ahli38 on December 20, 2022, 10:46:11 AMBe honest if i imagine being in the same situation. so I'm also a little confused when it comes to finding solutions to the problem of storing seed phrases safely when we are in a situation where we have to carry them with us when traveling like moving or something like that.the solution I think of if I want to move house. and of course have to carry everything including a spare sheed phrase of my crypto wallet.maybe when I'm at home then it's safe when I write it on a piece of paper and keep it in a drawer with a sturdy lock.but when we will move and take it with us. then I will do the following steps.- take a book of novels / stories or similar thick reading books.- took the paper that had my wallet's seed phrase written on it.- I will start copying into the novel/thick reading book in the order of 1 word per sheet. It doesn't have to be the front page, we can start from the middle page. for example from page 20. if there are 12 seed phrases, then I will write 1 word on page 20, 1 word on page 22, 1 word on page 24, and so on until the 12 words have been copied at the novel/thick reading book.- after making sure you copied correctly. then burn the initial paper that contains our wallet's seed phrase.- and now we just need to keep the novel containing the seed phrase on the way safely. I'm pretty sure no one wants to open the page after page of the novel we brought. and if it opens it will certainly be cursory.second wayWe can save our wallet's seed phrase into a novel by bolding or underlining every word that matches our wallet's seed phrase. I don't recommend marking it with a highlighter because it's too obvious.that's the only solution i could think of. hopefully help in keeping our crypto wallet safe on the way.but I only do this for wallets that are specifically for storing my assets in the long term.and for the wallet that I usually use every day, I only save it in the SDcard backup on my cellphone. I don't want to over complicate it. because there are not many assets in it. but for a special wallet for my long term investment. then obviously I saved it specially.",
