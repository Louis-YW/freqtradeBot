  "content": "Bitcoin is such an uncertain future currency that no one can say for sure what will happen in the future. Hundreds of predictions are constantly being made around Bitcoin. Predictions were made about this valuable currency in the past as well but some have gone down in history by selling this precious currency at a low price.Martti Malmi sold 5050 bitcoins for $5 at a rate of just $0.00099 in 2009, setting the record for the lowest bitcoin sale in history.Laszlo Hanycez made history by being the first person to buy a product at the lowest price in exchange for Bitcoin. He made history on May 22, 2010 by selling 10,000 Bitcoins for just $40-$45.Our forum admin sir has sold his 160 bitcoins at a rate of only $0.003 on exchange for $0.48.Pic collected: SourceNot only here but also in the past hundreds of Bitcoins have been traded which is amazing to see today. Those who traded Bitcoin at that time are now only regretting it and those who bought and held Bitcoin at that time, it is amazing to think how much their fortunes have changed today.If you could travel back in time today, what would you do?",

Fortunately we don't have such time-traveling machine and the world is organically going as it should be.With time-traveling ability, nobody loses their bitcoins because of losing their wallet password or seed, private key. No bitcoin amount is lost by those reasons and the total supply of Bitcoin will always be 21M as well as the total circulating supply is always the same as the amount of mined bitcoins.Many people won't lose their bitcoins because they sold cheap in the past or from forced liquidations.In general  I believe it will only cause Bitcoin to have lower price than it has now. Not good at all for anyone.",

It is not like we've reached the maximum price possible! Funny thing is that if you check the price at that time against current price you can see what those who didn't buy then, have already missed out.For example you can see in this topic some people say \"they would have bought $X worth of bitcoins\". Price that month dropped as low as $6k and today it is 5x higher! Do you think any of those guys bought bitcoin then instead of wishing they had a time machine?Who knows, maybe in a couple of years from now I find this topic and post it as an example for someone else who will have asked this question again",

In any case the price would have changed drastically if someone had come along at that time with a knowledge of what BTC was going to be, right?In my case, I would have left CPUs running at the time when you could still mine with such low difficulty that it's downright ridiculous now. I imagine that if everyone was doing this with a time machine, the difficulty of BTC would have been directly much higher and the interest would be lost.I agree 100% with pooya87, there's no point in going through the trouble for nothing. Let's buy when we can and wait, we always have an open door to make nice profits. If you have the investment  capacity and the low $ rate per kw/h, mine and hodl, you will thank yourself later",

So why bother to go back in time when they couldn't or won't do anything in the future? It seems we're forgetting that what we do today will be part of what makes up the past in distant time.",

Once I have a lot of bitcoins, I will leave them in my wallet and do other things and only come back after I check the market conditions.Maybe someone regrets selling their bitcoins at a low price and maybe someone doesn't regret it. And now all we can do is keep trying to get more bitcoin before the price increases.And there is no need to regret what we have done in the past because it has happened. But we still have a future that we can make to improve our future. And it depends on whether we want to make a better future, be like this, or don't want to have a better future.",

They still have time to buy lower price that time since Bitcoin gain most of its value after couple of years after they sold. I don’t follow them but there’s a high chance that they buy back on much lower price that the current price.Quote from: LDL on April 30, 2023, 12:01:42 PMOur forum admin sir has sold his 160 bitcoins at a rate of only $0.003 on exchange for $0.48.Despite our admin sold in lower price, He has a continuous source of Bitcoin and selling is not that bad if he really needs the money.

Some would say yes and some for sure would say no. Not to break the idea but the only reason why we regret not investing earlier is because we failed to do so and happened to witness how beneficial doing so. But if we would recall by that time most of the people did not invest because of doubts and lack of courage to do so. Rather than wondering what could have happen if you do this, things could still be  done at the present with proper entry and exit points. The market would either go up or down and if you have the will to still invest, it will never be too late. Just do not be too greedy of profit 'coz you cannot have all the profit in this industry.",
