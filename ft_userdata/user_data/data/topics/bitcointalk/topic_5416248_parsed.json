  "content": "Hi everyone,   I'm going to be doing a video specifically on the 2021 Lealana coins including the error coins. Now that they've most likely been delivered Id like to see if any more variations in errors have been found. I have already seen one in edition to the one 2stout posted. The way I see it is, there are 2 variations to the error coins. First, the true error coin of the spaced out L which is an actual hologram error. Second error is partial holograms that have been omitted. I think it will be important post your error with your coin# so there will be an early record of these errors that truly came from the Smoothie factory. The goal is to discourage people in the future from creating their own #2 error coin by removing a portion of the hologram. Especially if we see these selling at a premium in the future. If you do post your error coin and coin# Ill mention your coin specifically in my video with your permission.",

So far I have about 10 coins as official errors.Not saying that there aren't more but your 10 coin error count= the total number accounted for thus far- (mine/unfinished, acknowledged by smoothie) + the other 9 listed by smoothie (3 for Nickel Rainbow Design D & 6 for Brass Rainbow Design D).",
