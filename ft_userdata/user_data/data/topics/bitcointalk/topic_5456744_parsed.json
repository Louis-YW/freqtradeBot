The last post I found about abbreviations was in the Filipino language back in 2017. I kindly request anyone here to share some slang terms with me as I believe they would be helpful not only to me but also to other newbies.",

Read the forum's rules and regulations2. Learn about the forum's moderation policy3. Read the way you're expected to make a quality post4. Learn from what other members were posting on each boards5. Make use of the forum search engine and aks questions when necessary on beginners and help.6. You havebto learn about bitcoin and the forum as well, though i don't know your purpose of coming here.",

There have been so many unsuccessful ones throughout crypto history that they are almost synonymous to scams. I don't know how popular the term is nowadays. We have seen some other names being thrown around like IEO, STO, IDO, etc. Instead of the old Coin Offerings, they now refer to them as Security Offerings or Decentralized Exchange Offerings, and so forth.",
