Now tell me was it the low demands or higher supply that causes it?No, because if i may get it correctly is a season that remains constant that can not be changed in the cryptocurrency market at large that effectualized the trading circle.Any of you may correct me if i am wrong, although what you said only works in some cases but not with bitcoin entirely",

As people compete on getting hands on a few supply Bitcoin in blockchain technology, which it increases the network and have a huge impact to the value of Bitcoin. In demand and supply its still depends on the situation of the market, even a few number of Bitcoin could still low the chance for it to pump due to the volatile situation of Bitcoin. Of course as Bitcoin got acknowledged by the media and news new people would invest their money for it and more competitors to come.",

When market has big forced liquidation, price will move up or down a lot. That is a time when Supply and demand principle does not correct.About circulating supply, you can not know it exactly and you can not calculate and know how many bitcoins were lost forever to subtract the amount from circulating supply. It is a challenging math and can not be solved exactly.In long term, Supply and Demand principle is important for this market as with only 21M bitcoins in total supply plus its increasing adoption then bigger demand, price must move up. New capital pours into Bitcoin market will naturally lift Bitcoin up.",

When the price of bitcoin decreased from all-time-high to a lower price, it was because more people were selling than those that were buying and the price of bitcoin fall. But I will say that OP discussion about supply is not that accurate because how the price of bitcoin is increasing but which is more responsible by demand not supply. Although supply is also important as the OP included it in the price calculation and as it is limited and there is circulating supply of bitcoin.",

Once the halving period is passed and bitcoin surpasses a previous all time high, many of the investors usually sell of their holdings or profits and this in turn results to the downtrend of the price. Also what affect bitcoin to hit as low as $16k could be associated with the likes of FTX having difficulty and this actually caused a little panic amongst investors that leave off there on exchanges, most started selling them off. If you also look at what is happening in the first quarter of this year you will see that bitcoin moved up to like 70% from the 16k it ended last year, although This can be associated with the fact that many people are buying for the next halving but the crises faced by banks like silvergate, Silicon Valley and it likes has made people turn towards bitcoin and that upped the price",

Favorable news, like widespread adoption by prominent companies, can increase its value, while negative news, like regulatory restrictions, can cause it to fall. The security of the network also plays a crucial role in determining Bitcoin's worth. Any compromise in the network's security can erode investors' confidence in the cryptocurrency, leading to a decline in its value as investors may be hesitant to risk their capital in an insecure token.",

To illustrate this, let us consider the case of the meme coin Doge. Despite having a low demand and a high total supply compared to other cryptocurrencies, Doge's value was significantly affected by external factors. Specifically, news outlets and social media groups that supported GameStop, as well as a tweet from Elon Musk, propelled the meme coin to a top-ranking position, where it continues to maintain its position to this day.Market cap of a coin determines its value. If the market cap doubles, the value also doubles. Circulating supply is also important in doubling the price of a coin. Market cap and circulating supply together determine the price of a coin.

Cryptocurrency has been in a bearish period for a year and a half, and this stagnation is already rather tired. I would like to see a continuous price increase.I think the increase in the price value of Bitcoin which we see today crossing the $30k resistance is a slight result of what we stand to experience after next year's halving. Because 2022 was indeed a long bearish period for the Bitcoin market, of which this year & next we should hope to see the opposite (i.e A long consistent bull market period), because today makes it 11 months now since last the price of Bitcoin was worth $30k per BTC (i.e 16th May 2022).Quote from: Honnet43 on April 11, 2023, 05:18:02 AMI never realized that my stash of unused gift cards was actually my own personal circulating supply.

In my opinion these are the factors that affect crypto mostly and ate listed below 1: News News Is more important thing in cryptocurrency. A single news can just shake it whole market or a single news can make market like a bull. That's why News Is most important thing2: Big whales Big whales play an important role in cryptocurrency industry because they can easily manipulate market and  thus is not good for the crypto industry. Agreed. \"Big whales\" are other terms for the big funds of market makers. They almost set the price for any risk assets because of their large and institutional funds. They set liquidity. SO when they get in, the price fluctuates higher and other investors will get in making the market continue to go higher. When they \"big whale\" takes profit, Price creates the top or end of the rally, where the retail investors left and lose money. In crypto whatever is hot, creates hot and fast money. just prevent hot losses.",

The reality is that we should be fixing the market by just figuring out the fact that bitcoin always recovers and goes back up, look at it now its going up and people were questioning if we will fail to go above 30k and start going down a lot. The market responded with a stern No right away in a day.We should stop doubting the market and stop using our emotions to trade and maybe start focusing a bit more towards how we could make a profit from this situation. Keep on insisting and get bitcoin, that is they only way we could make a profit and should be a lot better to have something like that going on then just hoping it gets better in the long run.",
