  "content": "https://ruinedcanvas.comHi I made this.I personally really enjoy these collaborative pixel art apps and so wanted to make a dapp for it.Being on eth helps mitigate bots.Joining costs a small extra fee, but placing pixels is free + gas.The cooldown is currently only 1 block.There are no censorship functions or server connections, everything here is opensource and on client.Happy painting",
