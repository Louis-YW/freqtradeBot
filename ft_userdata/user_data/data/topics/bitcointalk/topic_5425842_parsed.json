We have BFG and Owl tokens but these are dedicated to their respective platform, the most accepted are Bitcoin, Trx, and Dogecoin, players want a fast transaction and tradeable in the market not really particular if the token is dedicated to casinos because all coins/tokens can be accepted in all casinoQuoteNow, I'm aware that licensed casinos are tied to payment providers, and then they mostly use whichever currency that payment provider offers, but I personally would still love to see some exotic coins here and there.

These tokens are not familiar to me and Fun token is seldom accepted in popular casinos, it always goes on the popularity and profitability of the coin/token in the market.",

FUN is only being supported by the large community of the Freebitco.in website as without this community I think right now with only two casinos they are the main coin they would very well be dead for sure as no motivation by people to pick up that token to gamble with.If you want to open a crypto casino go with the coins that are more widely used like Bitcoin,Ethereum and Litecoin,beside these coins you can add as many as you like in order to attract a bigger user base but these three coins are far more than enough for any casino as a starting point.",

This is because it's not about investment per se when it comes to the choice of the token or coin to be used often by casinos, but the convenience of depositing and withdrawing. Be that as it is, any coins or tokens that would allow low transaction fees are my choice in this regard. We have many of them, so I don't have to start making lists.",

I myself have never really tried looking for \"exotic\" or anything similar type of tokens, I mostly use BTC, ETH, Doge, LTC, mostly normal tokens you'd see in most crypto casinos.

FUN token make sense if added to casinos much like the CHZ, WINK, and Wagger as they are all linked to gaming. You would really think they can become big in the gambling industry but generally, it's BTC that people want. The believers of the token sure would want them added, but it depends on the casino if they can make money out of it also.",

I'm not sure which payments provider Stake has, I see that they have Tron, but I wanted to register with them for ages so will test it out this week. Take a look at Coinfy, BitPay or other services, they are the ones regulating what a casino can offer. Then it's up to the casino to pick out the ones they want and can afford.",

It explains a lot about the brand then  Just some facts about FUN token. It’s original use was a utility token for casino partnered of FUN project. The FUN company dissolved and forced to sell the token ownership to Freebitco.in but FUN is indeed used on many casino before before it became exclusive only to Freebitco.in. Possibly the time when the guy told you about is when the project is still alive and kicking. They are really revolutionizing the casino industry of crypto back then until bear market occur and forced crypto company to close due to fixed expenses while token value is decreasing hard.Still Stablecoin and major tokens with low transaction fee is still the best. Other casino tokens that suggested above is exclusively good on their own casino.",
