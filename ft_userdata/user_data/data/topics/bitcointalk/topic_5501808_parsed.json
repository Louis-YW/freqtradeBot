  "content": "Bitcoin today has become a technology enjoyed by so many, due to its underlying benefits to mankind today. Although different people has different perspectives of what bitcoin really is, some view it as a store of value, some means of exchange, some a way to facilitate their transactions, some know it for its decentralized nature and its transparency. But what's more important is that even with divers viewpoints and perspectives, Bitcoin since its creation till date has been really beneficial to mankind and society in divers ways, and yet not everyone who enjoy these benefits of Bitcoin knows how it all began.Y'all fasten your seatbelt while we go on a little historical rollercoaster ride. THE FIRST TRANSACTIONOn the 12th day of January, 2009, the first ever Bitcoin transaction was made, and this has went down as a revolutionary event in the history of cryptocurrency because that when it all started.On the month of October 2008, the creator of Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto published Bitcoin's whitespace, where he promised to give the world a decentralized digital currency that would operate solely on its own without the interference of intermediaries like the bank or other Centralized financial institutions.It took him several months to develop this awesome technology and after several months of development, the Bitcoin Network was finally ready and was launched on the 9th of January 2009, and he mined the first block which was named the Genesis Block.And then 3 days after the launch, Satoshi  Nakamoto initiated the first ever Bitcoin transaction by sending 10 Bitcoins to a programmer who's name was Hal Finney, an enthusiast and also the one who had the same innovative spirit as Satoshi Nakamoto and also collaborated with him in the development of the amazing technology. This first transaction was to test the functionality of the bitcoin network, but it appears that wasn't the only purpose that first transaction served because it went down in the history of Cryptocurrency as the beginning and emergence of a decentralized P2P electronic cash system.This 10 BTC transfer was recorded on the bitcoin Blockchain, a decentralized ledger where all transactions made on the network are being stored and the transaction's block number was 170, and it indeed was marked as a historical event in the history of Cryptocurrency.The Block 170 has also went down in the history of cryptocurrency as a symbol of Bitcoin's humble beginning as well as it's potential for growth. Bitcoin today can be seen as more than just a digital payment system but has several other benefits to mankind, with millions of global users, Bitcoin is in fact the biggest cryptocurrency asset today with loads of benefits.",

And in alternative for the old days when people had to save their money, this is given them the freedom and ability to invest in new ways. It is decentralized and limited in a way, which in turn makes it rather appealing to people who do not wish to use centralized money and investments.It has led to the creation of a whole new universe of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies! It’s like the ultimate disruptor! Therefore, it is not a surprise to see so many coming for it like bees to honey.The real life effect is also felt with regard to people using Bitcoin. It has benefited many to invest and enhance their capital besides which they never could even imagine. And, it has provided a sense of safety as well as ownership of their financial resources, and this is worth more than any anything.",

It was the prove that bitcoin really works. Most definitely.We can also say it was officially the first transactions, there may have been other transactions that were before the block 170, but as long as Bitcoin History is concerned, the Genesis Block (Block 170) remaims the first transaction ever made, amd just as youve said, the very proof that the prototype which Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney spent several months working on was actually successful.So It didn't really matter if there were other transactions before the block 170, as long as history didn't recognize them, they're not as valid as rhat which was acknowledged.",

On top of that, freedom, no dependence on central or commercial bank on security of our asset, is key.Price is attractive for investors and one of reasons they spend money in Bitcoin investment but value and price won't exist if lack of other more fundamental things.",
