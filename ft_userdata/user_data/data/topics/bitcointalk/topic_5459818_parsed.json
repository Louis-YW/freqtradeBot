This got my curious since there seems to be many crypto bookmakers around.Crypto bookmakers usually don’t disclose publicly their odds provider so I’m interested to know too odds provider that our crypto casino using and what’s the best so far. I’m not familiar with betby and Inplaymatrix but can share more info on how do you find them and what crypto casino is using their service right now for providing odds. So far, We only have odds comparison but we don’t know the provider behind those odds.",

Interesting. I never thought the same. I thought it's something no bookie disclose no matter it's crypto or regulated fiat bookie. Sportradar is the most well known one and it is the one used by many of the reputable crypto casinos if I am mistaken as this topic has come up even other times.The problem is not which provider provides the odds to the bookies as all of them lay the odds in the favor of the casino,for example when a team should have high chances to win and the real odd should be like 1.30,they intentionally may make that odd go up to scare us at 1.45-1.60,the same can be said for a certain team which is not a heavy favorite and the odd should be 1.8-1.9 for them and the bookies give them 1.60 as odd so you go and place your bet thinking you will win,a clear example of this was the Milsami game in Europa Conference League yesterday,ended 2-2 but the home team which was not a heavy favorite had an odd of 1.45 when in reality it should had 1.7-1.8.What do I want to say with all of this?I want to say it is not important who provide the odds but how good we as bettors can read them.",

This got my curious since there seems to be many crypto bookmakers around.Lsport, betby, and sportradar. I think it would be better if you use one that is advertised or suggested by your online casino. It is important to consider the scope and availability of information in terms of games. Be it sportsbet, e-sports, or soccer league. Relevant to your timezone, and casino always make sure that bookmaker you've chose is updated, better if you are getting notified.Sometime it may not be that accurate so you really have to do the work of experimentation.",

Because it seems like you have plans to develop a sports betting platform, I think it's what you should do as well. You don't wanna operate without it because building a reputation in the community will be aa lot harder without it.I'm not familiar with those odds providers but I guess the most popular which it said is above was Sportradar, then you can't go wrong with it.",

When you are looking for cheap provider, it means you have money issue. Let's consider you found a good deal with a provider and you launched your casino. The next day someone won half a millions USD. Do you have that money to pay him? I doubt. So if you are looking for a casino business but you don't have few millions of dollar as bankroll then don't dare to think of this business.Quote from: cabron on July 16, 2023, 05:55:22 PMI'm not familiar with those odds providers but I guess the most popular which it said is above was Sportradar, then you can't go wrong with it. As far as I know, Sportradar are expensive to maintain for a startup, especially who does not have enough money to invest in the business.",

In other words, the site will be subject first to checking before granting the service.Out of curiosity, do you plan on building a sports betting site? Even if there's a cheap provider available or maybe close to being free (I believed there are), I doubt you can lure bettors on testing your site. It's obvious that in building a betting site, you will really need to spend decent capital to start with. If you can't afford to spend on the \"priority\" things that a sports betting site should have, then it means you are not ready yet.",

This kind of business needs a license because if you don't have then how a casino will get you as their provider in the very first place since most casino who have sports book is a licensed one.",
