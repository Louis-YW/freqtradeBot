But still funny.JUST IN: Rand Paul Literally Wheels In 'Toxic' Omnibus Bill, Slams It With Other GOP Heavyweightshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwH_TtJZWvICongress's 4,155-Page Omnibus Bill Is a Symbol of American Decadencehttps://fee.org/articles/congress-s-4-155-page-omnibus-bill-is-a-symbol-of-american-decadence/On December 20th a handful of Republican senators shuffled before an audience of reporters prepared to issue fiery polemics on the year-end omnibus bill which sat, heavy and ponderous in all its eight-ream absurdity on a wheeled cart before the five-senator assemblage.\"DANGER: $1.7 trillion of hazardous debt\" read one of the mock-hazard signs decking the cart. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul declared the bill an \"abomination,\" while Utah Senator Mike Lee skewered the unseemly pressures to freeze it into law by proclaiming the process \"legislative barbarism.\"Every year it happens with textbook repetition: Washington politicians procrastinate in releasing a colossal expense prospectus for the following year which unfailingly runs thousands of pages, requests billions of dollars, and is granted mere hours of scrutiny before being thrust to a congressional vote. The process is riddled with partisan intimidations and shrewd slandering. Democratic politicians trot out folksy pleas about supporting struggling Americans, to which, naturally, passing the bill is postured to achieve. Most Republicans cave to its smothering inevitability; a minority bitterly protest....",

Yet, seemingly, the U.S. electorate keep electing these people into office.The way it works is a bunch of lobbyists and attorneys will petition government under their first amendment right which includes a bunch of coincidental campaign super PAC contributions. These people will then generate the actual text of the legislation and submit it to congress, and congress will blindly vote on it without having actually read it or understanding it fully because they prefer the political funding.It's a rotten system.",

I certainly don't blame Congress. Congress is an elected body. The blame and burden is on voters to elect competent leaders. Of course, disparaging voters isn't a viable campaign strategy and the media would never dare say the quiet part out loud when it comes to ignorant voting populations. Most voters have no idea how their government works and these people will gladly participate in every election voting for the same politicians that drove their country into a ditch.",

After all, they know that the people who voted them in don't know much about governmental operations. But, if they only find this out after they get elected, or if they find out that their efforts are driving the country into a ditch, they can always resign if they are honest... or at least not run next time. And, they can make a habit of simplifying their position on anything, and bringing this simplification knowledge to the people, so that the people understand what is really going on.",
