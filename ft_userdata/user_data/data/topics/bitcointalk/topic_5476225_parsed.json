You will need to bridge it first to different blockchain.Enjin Relay Chain is not yet supported by Metamask or Trustwallet since I don’t see any RPC network settings for it since it’s just new. Your best chance is to download the official ENJ wallet and check whether they support the Enjin new chain. https://enjin.io/products/wallet",

Go luck finding exchanges where one can try to withdraw ENJ ERC20 because you are likely not going to find many. It's just common sense.If you are trying to look for away for arbitrage trading, then forget about it. The price difference is majorly because of the ENJ mainnet - ENJ ERC20 barrier.",

Because the second exchange you are using does not support Relay chain for deposit of ENJ, you will have to find another exchange.Second option is to move your ENJ from that exchange (must pay withdrawal fee) to your web3 non custodial wallet on Relay Chain. Be aware that you only can swap coins, tokens on a same chain. You can use bridges but they are risky and many big hacks on cryptocurrency bridges. Don't use them if you can do it even with a middle step between chains and exchanges.Check withdrawal fee and supported chains of exchanges for ENJ https://coinmarketfees.com/enjin-coin",

Done.I think that your method is more reasonable in situations like the one OP finds himself, it's a good alternative for him. If his coin is not supported by his exchange or network, the let him look for an exchange that supports the two, then convert back to his coin. He just needs to consider the fees that is involved in all process.",

I think you will no longer be able to exchange otherwise because the tokens will be automatically sent to the burning address.QuoteA: Your existing ERC-20 tokens will be burned through transfer to a burn address, and mainnet ENJ tokens will be sent to the Enjin Blockchain address you select. You will no longer be able to access your existing tokens after initiating the migration for these tokens.1. https://enjin.io/blog/enjin-token-migration-faqs",

If you're going to withdraw it to buy goods then this is a good idea. You can benefit of having the low fee if you use Binance Chain network, and the confirmation is so fast. Personally, I convert my asset into usdt and I use P2P if i'm going to withdraw some funds.",

Your best shot is find a bridge that support this token and check what’s the possible blockchain option which you can migrate your token to different blockchain.Only ERC20 and Solana are your choices to bridge your Mainnet token right now.",
