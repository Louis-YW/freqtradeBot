You can't set the fee rate manually on android version of electrum, but you can change the fee estimation method to static and set the fee rate to 1, 2, 5,10,.... sat/vbyte.

Enable \"Fiat Currency\" and set the currency to GBP.",

That has been designed very badly. If you update your electrum to version 4.4.0 or versions after that, you will see that the UI has been designed much better, however it still lacks many features of the desktop version. Quote from: BitMaxz on July 14, 2023, 04:30:31 PMInstead of using manual/static, I suggest use mempool and always set it to 1mb below from the tip to avoid stuck transactions.It's not a good idea to always set the target to 1 MB from the tip. Sometimes, you are not in hurry and you can save some amount of bitcoin with paying lower fees. And whether you are in hurry or not, it would be better to check the mempool yourself and not only rely on electrum's estimation.",
