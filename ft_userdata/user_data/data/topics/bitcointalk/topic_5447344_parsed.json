To learn about Bitcoin, you can start by checking out the website https://bitcoin.org/en/, which has a beginner's guide and FAQ section. There are also courses available on websites like Udemy and Coursera that can teach you more about Bitcoin.It's important to be careful when investing in Bitcoin, and to never invest more money than you can afford to lose. Start small and do your own research before making any decisions.",

Your starting time does not matter, there's a thought I always harbor in my mind each time I'm starting a new thing. \"You might be new and yet still do better than those that have been there for years\" just focus on improving yourself and don't let jealousy or depression get the better of you.And I believe if indeed you're serious about your learning, with all the resources/links already provided in this thread should be able to enable kick off your journey and also to build a solid foundation in Bitcoin.",

Yes it will take time for an average person to learn Bitcoin, but as a beginner, the only thing that you can do is to learn, learn and learn. There are so many information online that can help you. Just do it step-by-step because you might get overwhelmed with lots of information that you can see in the internet. I got overwhelmed one time when I was studying because of so many information, so many terms and so many words that I don't know, but I took time to learn. Cut the story short, I learned the basics now, and I'm just happy that I learned it.Where can you get information? I think many users here already sent some links that will help you, so I will not add anymore. What I can only say is that, watch Bitcoin documentaries on Youtube. That's what helped me back when I'm starting aside from the fact that I'm reading as well. Just take your time, don't think that there will be a faster learning curve unless you have a mentor that will spoon-feed you with information.",

The first stage of learning is usually the most difficult time, where you are still trying to pick up understanding about what a subject talks about. When you pass that beginners stage, it becomes easier from there to continue to update your knowledge. Learning something newly can be discouraging especially when it is difficult to grasp, but if you persist and do not get discouraged, you will finally have understanding. Do not rush or hurry the learning process, give yourself enough time to read and understand.",

As long as you have the enthusiasm to learn, everything will be possible. Just do your own research and familiarize yourself on the things that are associated with bitcoin. Soon enough, learning will be easier for you, especially if you become an active member in the bitcointalk forum. No need to study different courses, the forum alone is a good avenue to maximize your knowledge so you can interact intellectually with the other forum members.",
