In a later post, uploaded on 12/19/2017, he speaks of 130 error coins.The blog post referenced in that link is apparently now gone, but the error itself is stated on https://wiki.coin.community/Kialara_Silver_Series_2017_%E2%80%93_%E2%80%98To_the_Moon%E2%80%99#Error_Coins\"During minting some of the silver coins were created with the wrong back design. These coins were given to customers whose orders were delayed because of this. This is the only Kialara piece that can be graded.\"Edit - thanks @mbitr!",
