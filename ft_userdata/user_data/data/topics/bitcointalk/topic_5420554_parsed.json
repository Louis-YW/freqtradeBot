What are your predictions for this Bear market bottom'st bottom for Bitcoin?I don't think that bitcoin will go as low as $10k though, perhaps the bottom has been reach at $15k.But yeah, in any case that it will go down to $10k then that is the biggest opportunity once again, probably we will be back 2019-2020 prices, right after the pandemic scare wherein the price goes down to $3k and then bounce back to $6k and then eventual bull run.I'm not saying that we will be in a bull run right now, still very far, but the chance is here once again, even at the current price of $16,700, this is still a great entry point, in my opinion.",

The peak of the cycle was disappointing in this sense and at the moment, what was said about bitcoin not having fallen below the peak of the previous cycle more than momentarily, as happened in March 2020, has also been broken.This cycle was initially known as the institutional adoption cycle but I would call it the 'leverage disaster' cycle, both because of the cascading downward liquidations that have occurred and the bankruptcy of the exchanges for playing with leverage instead of being quietly guarding deposits and collecting commissions.",

Bitcoin is young, we are in an early stage and new investors are coming. Majority of the people do not have Bitcoin, they prolly do not even heard of it or they do not understand how it works.

They should really be happy seeing a 70k usd valued coin available to purchase at 16k usd. Instead of complaining, they should have bought as many coins as they can in this cheap, affordable price. Moreover if we greed for more and wait for more low price, then there is a chance that we might miss the best price which is right now. Consider yourself lucky, if you are able to buy Bitcoins below 20k usd.",

And it looks like the FTX case managed to shake the crypto market and fall even deeper. But we can still hope that the price doesn't really go down to $10k but if it does, it means we get a big discount so we can buy bitcoins at that price. But I don't think many of them will buy bitcoin at $10k because the rest will think the price will go down again.

What are your predictions for this Bear market bottom'st bottom for Bitcoin?I still don't even believe in the narrative that says \"Bitcoin is dead\" because for me Bitcoin is still alive and can still survive in the long term. Decline in price is not the end of Bitcoin because the potential for improvement is still there and on the other hand Bitcoin is also still being liked and traded by many people at this time. You also said that a good point to enter would be at 10K and that implies that you yourself still really like Bitcoin and don't think it's going to die. Because if you believe in that narrative and believe that Bitcoin is dead, surely you will no longer want to be in the crypto space and also here and will not set an entry point to buy Bitcoin again.",

The old narrative supposedly was \"Bitcoin, not crypto\", then around 2017 ATH with Ethereum's attempt at the flippening it was \"blockchain, not bitcoin\".How things have swung around. The world's 3 richest tech billionaires in the same week showed why the crypto ideals they support and advocate have never been sound, while Bitcoin plods along, doing what it's supposed to do, overdelivering.",

Keep waiting, I still won't buy at current price, still too high for me.You could be right, but if so I think youâd probably have to wait until the mtgox coins and the us gov coins hit the market. That could be nearly a year. If you have the patience maybe you could get lucky. Thereâs also a chance weâre seeing the worst of it now and when the massive groups of coins hit the market theyâre swept up by large investment companies. Thatâs why I think dollar cost averaging in throughout this entire bear market is the way to go.",

There might be a chance of this being the end of the Bear. It can maybe have a flash crash and hit the 10K mark, but given that volatility is decreasing, the chance for an overturn is bigger than the chance of having a new flash crash.

There are two scenarios I can see that will happen once we get to $10k and that is btc will drop further because the panic will be more intense or the price will now recover because many people are going to buy it.Current price is $16k and that is lower than last time. Don't be too perfectionist mate. We are still not sure if the price will drop more and what if $16k was the bottom already? You will be left behind or you will force to buy at higher price later on.",
