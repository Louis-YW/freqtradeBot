Meaning you will need to make a bootable flash drive with Tails OS then you can install your Bitcoin wallet. There is a guide here that you can follow check this \"How to Install Tails OS on USB flash drive for Wallet Purpose\"",

I prefer writing the seeds down somewhere safe, I am a very private person and I use my room alone so there is no one coming into my room, also its better to keep quiet about your wallet because there is no need for someone coming into your room to search for something unless you are the one responsible for their curiosity.",

Actually, you don't think a USB drive for you to store your bitcoin, what you need are the private keys or the seeds that you need to save in text form and that's it, you're all good.So, you can actually store your text file into a USB/flash drive but I don't recommend that as files are likely not safe if you'll store it into that.Since you've got access to a PC, just install Electrum and keep the seeds for that wallet of yours and never show it to anyone and store your written seeds on a very safe place where you can only access it or you're the only one that knows that it's your seeds.",

Well, it's OP who wanted a cheap portable wallet made out of a flash drive so most went along with his scenario. The utility of having an entire working wallet on a flash drive and not just the encrypted seeds you can extract when in need and import into the laptop or computer you would anyhow need to actually use the coins kind of fails to impress me.But still, I assume most looked at it from the point of having around easy access to spendable coins, not about securing life savings, if the second I would 100% agree with you.",

If you do everything correctly in a safe enviroment, you don't need a flash drive anymore, you can even delete the software from your device as long as you have your seed phrase backup and you repeat this process again to import your funds with your seed phrase whenever you want to spend, but only do this if you are holding a large amount of BTC and for a very long time. But if you want to be viewing your wallet balance regularly and for the best security, then you have to set up Electrum in an air-gapped device and use another one for watching-only, but this process may be difficult for a newbie.",

OP probably doesn't even know why a hardware wallet is considered secure, but established, decade-old user merely recommended him to back it up on a USB, and equate that with writing down on paper. Ridiculous. True so we should remind him that such action as keeping the private key to the flash drive isn't as secure as keeping the BTC in hardware wallets.   I think we can give him precautionary measures if ever he can't afford hardware wallets and chose to use a flash disk as an alternative.This article gives a good alternative in storing BTC privatekey if ever the person don't have hardware wallet yet.Quote3. Offline Flash driveIf you don’t have a hardware wallet, you can temporarily keep your private keys or seed in an offline flash drive or HDD. But these options are only safe as long as they aren’t in the hands of an attacker. One can also use offline drives that encrypt the data stored on them. This way you can add one more security layer for accessing your coins.4. CryptosteelAnother effective way to store your private keys is to record them over a Cryptosteel. Cryptosteel is stainless steel tool that allows you to store up to 96 characters worth of confidential information. And in this case, this confidential information can also be your private key which is always less than 96 characters. This is a very secure way to handle your private keys because Cryptosteel is fire and waterproof. But this level of security doesn’t come free. Cryptosteel costs about $100.Though the article stated saving your private key in cryptoart, I will not suggest to use any online application in storing your privatekey for security reason.",

I do make out some storage on a non-custodial walletlike Electrum since we are talking on Bitcoin on here and some keys on Trustwallet or Myetherwallet which i do make some list on a notepad and saving up those keysbut of course you should really be that mindful on where you do put up those usb sticks or flash drive because on the time thatit would be exposed to other people and plugged it in, then say goodbye into your funds.We could be able to differentiate on what are the advantage on having that HW though but since you cant really be able to afford then having that USB storage of keyswould be that sufficient but if you do have the chance on buying one then its better to do so.",
