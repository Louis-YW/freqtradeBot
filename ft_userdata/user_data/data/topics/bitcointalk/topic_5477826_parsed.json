I remember that TimeLord also coughs very often.You present a good point. That's what I quickly realized when I started this. 78 different users is way too much, especially for a new user. I also realized it was quite late so I went to bed soon after I posted that. I had a much longer post originally, detailing how exactly I would at least try to investigate users and who would specifically be investigated but stopped because I think my mental health matters more (I can dm you what I had so far if you want I don't think it really matters though)I've spent the past 10 hours worrying about all this and it's quite stressing simply due to time spent. I've learned alot about why Vod chose many of these users on his trust list though and came across some really good investigation tactics on how users found cheaters as well as hilarious people, etc.So far this is the most suspicious account I've seen throughout the 78 users on his list.The account \"Legendster\"The original owner isn't a scammer, fraud or anything suspicious but the original owner has been inactive since late 2019(verified by himself here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5359778.msg57932688#msg57932688) Vod quit somewhere in like, mid 2021. This event all took place during Late 2021, after he quit. During late 2021, the Legendster account was compromised, which he confirmed here (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5359778)Since he isn't hacked (anymore for now) he can stay on his list. Seeing that the original owner quit in late 2019 and hasn't made a real return ever since then, It's best to assume that if If this account ever becomes active and does any suspicious activity such as asking for non-collateral loans then I recommend trying to prove that it's actually the OG owner using one of the old addresses as shown by the post made by examplens (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5359778.msg57931591#msg57931591).",

It's a shame that he won't ever get his account back. I thought he just reclaimed ownership and went back to being inactive until this was posted.I also came across several other inactive users on Vod's trust list, who weren't compromised or anything but were inactive for an extended period of time(like 2-5 years)so I had them noted in what I wrote to verify ownership if they ever came back actively and behaved suspiciously.",

I only cared because I agreed to it, so I wanted to finish what I agreed to starting. Trying was better than nothing for me and I still learned alot regardless.

And I see you insist on it. The more you insist the more shady you will look like.1)And by that I did not mean that you don't deserve to be aware of, but the fact that's simply too much information for someone new to be able to comprehend even in six months, not to mention only since end of October and until present. I'm reading even now, years later after I joined the forum, about issues from the past which I am not aware of.
