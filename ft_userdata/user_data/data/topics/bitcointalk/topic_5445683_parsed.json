  "content": "Seeing the rising price of bitcoin over this last few weeks has been a pleasant change. What has been even more pleasant is that Bitcoin's original purpose (being, a hedge against the inherently flawed global fractional reserve banking system) is finally becoming headline news and directly gaining value from the beginning of the banking sector collapse.It seems like this would lead to a steady and fruitful uptrend for Bitcoin...but I also think, isn't this too easy? I find it hard to believe that the Fed and its subordinates would just allow Bitcoin to steadily increase and prove itself to be a hedge against fiat so obviously as it seems to be playing out right now.Â The next question that stems from this thought is that maybe there are new backstops in place that would reverse the current trend, prolong fiat money and its wicked way for just a little longer, cause pain to the true believers who (like myself deep down) feel something along the lines of \"This is the time! It's happening!\" and then accumulate before the real uptrend begins when the fiat system does inevitably start to hyper-inflate/collapse. TLDR: Do you think that the Feb or other Bitcoin adversaries have any potential plans to either hurt Bitcoin, or make the banking system seem more reliable for a period of time again to prevent the current uptrend from continuing?",

It depends on what serves them. Thank you for refreshing my thoughts. I read not long ago about some non-US banks beginning to restrict the amount that people could transfer to crypto exchanges per month to some ridiculous amount like 5,000 GBP, subject to additional review if they deem fit. I suppose that this is one form of \"stop\" that would be put in place to prevent a mass exodus from fiat. Another would be to completely try to ban BTC and transfers to exchanges in coordination. I feel like this would be a last resort and by this point, peer to peer solutions will be popular again or will quickly become \"mainstream\" after this happens.",

Any single move they do is being watched and could really play a big part for bitcoin's price movement.Eventually, it will be changed and bitcoin will still have to move on its own.

Doesn't mean they are not going to do it eventually, they will, but that doesn't change the fact that they will be busy for a while. Looking at the crisis they have on their hands right now, I am guessing that it will take a while before they can charge the situation ahead and tackle it.I believe that bitcoin will be on the rise for a while longer, not forever of course and this year won't end with a new all time high if you ask me, but we will end with a better price than we started there is absolutely no doubt about that at all.",

Instead of fixing the system they're breaking it more. When FTX collapsed they blamed cryptocurrencies and people believed it.

Bitcoin is the exact opposite of this system as it allows for every coin and every transaction to be accounted for. Nothing disappears in the blockchain. Therefore, I think that there's a number of points to be made:1. Inflation is not transitory and it cannot be controlled.

The banking system is like a building with weak foundation. It's shaking and trembling and all the FED is doing is prolonging its existence by supporting the walls from the outside, but eventually it's going to collapse. There's no way to rebuild it from the top. 3. People are beginning to wake up and they see what FED representatives are saying. That people will pay the price for the bank collapse, that they need more unemployment to fight inflation, that they have no idea if they should go back to printing, or not and that eventually they'll have to and that will decrease the value of the dollar even more.",

Though I found this point to be interesting. 2008 was a monumental event fixed with a solution that was very clearly a band-aid. I always thought that if there were to be another crisis, that it would be monumentally larger than 08' as the same band-aid solution won't work like it did before. Unless you are strictly talking about right now and not the situation as a whole, what makes you say that this crisis won't be as big as 2008?Quote from: coolcoinz on March 20, 2023, 10:06:00 PMThe way I see it, there was a fear of FED, rate cuts, regulations that followed FTX, but at this point the FED is no longer in control.

In 2008 no one would have thought that bailouts for big businesses/corporations like banks were even possible. Your post and points are completely accurate, what I wonder is mostly about what stops the Fed could put in place that no one would have thought of like they did in 2008? I find it hard to accept there has been no innovation in fiat failure/crisis management for the last 15 years. I suppose it also would not be so surprising if there wasn't. Or, maybe I am just over analyzing and it's as easy as ABC. There's no catch, and the next 1-3 years are what everyone in Bitcoin has been waiting for.",
