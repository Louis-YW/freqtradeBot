Even my dad, who has asked me questions a few times about how it works, is still not convinced as to whether it is worth his investment.  My parents are the type of people who believe in what they can see with their eyes; they are both entrepreneurs, yet they find it difficult to invest in Bitcoin. I'm the only one with my other siblings, who follow after me and have at least some basic knowledge of Bitcoin and are also holders. Buying Bitcoin might be the last thing on my parent list right now unless I'm ready to sign that whatever the outcome will be, I will take full responsibility, which I'm not ready to do.",

I have stopped convincing them rather i do convince my peers and other member my age group. Sometimes it's better to leave them with their traditional investments they don't fit in here.",

None of my parents invested in bitcoin even till now that I told them, they refused. I was able to talk to my uncle and he bought the idea of investing in bitcoin which he did.My journey in crypto started all by myself when I was introduced to bitcoin in the early 2019 during the Covid pandemic. I introduced bitcoin to my family to see how it can add impact to their lives just as it did to mine, and I am happy that my siblings bought some fractions of bitcoin.",

They are all retired and living a comfortable life with their savings. So they simply do not want to invest in something that is risky. The only investment they have is Bank deposits. Also it's a little more technical than they can manage to control by themselves. I had tried to explain them about bitcoin. But my dad was worried that I will be asking them to provide money to invest. That's why they didn't bother to listen.",

Our parents do not have to invest on crypto as a must even though we are into crypto and that same decision does not have to affect the way we are holding or journey on bitcoin for anything, business has to do with each individual adoption potencies, whereby they can uses such as a means to use in standing against all odd in their financial economy, if they don't see the reason and positivity for adopting bitcoin, it will always be of no relevance to them, so its something we can start from somewhere if we really want to get others around us involved in bitcoin, then they must see the reflection in how we leave our lives.",

In this situation it seems unlikely that my parents would have any knowledge about Bitcoin so my parents do not know anything about Bitcoin for now and have no opportunity to know. So my parents couldn't invest on Bitcoin.",

My parents are old and even struggling to come to terms with some modern facilities.

They are more focused on traditional investment that they can physically monitor.I would have been a happy though if they were investing because to have my parents investing in Bitcoin would have been a huge encouragement for me and I believe that I would have started earlier since they would have been a big influence from a young age.",

This will depend on the part of the world we are talking about, in my own opinion, it will be harder for older people to get involved in BTC in third world countries, or in locations where education is poor, and there is little or no literacy in tech or the digital world. However, even if older people in some parts of the world understand what BTC is, it would be hard for them to trust it or to buy it, they will most likely call it a scam and stick with older forms of investment that they are used to.",

Hmm, in straight yes, my father is an active accumulator of Bitcoin from his monthly salary based on the Buy the Dips strategy and DCA as well, you can say a hybrid technique to accumulate which is more efficient in my view as well. Yup, my own journey started after getting inspiration from my father although he knew just the basics TBH, he was the first motivation for me to start exploring this space, and now Alhadmdullilah I know a lot, and on the way to grabbing more and more.He did buy some Bitcoin in early 2016 and sold them for some reason id don't know haha but know he accumulated after realizing the potential in the 2020 market.",

Perhaps, bitmover already gave you the best of information you can get there. But I will add my personal experience too. At my age, I'm very very young compared to the people I see here in the forum, although it's an anonymous forum but I still see alot of my parents age here. Since, I know alot of old people are here who are capable of having me as their children 10x then, I can say my parents ages invests in bitcoin. But for my parents, Nahh.. I guess if I tell my mom to get some for her self as an investment she might if I'm able to convince her but for my father his in heaven 🕊️ I guess I would have gotting a lot of bitcoin in his portfolio if he was here, so basically the impact of this was negative in my journey with bitcoin.",
