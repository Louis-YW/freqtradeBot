  "content": "Started using the portfolio tracker last week on Coingecko and most of it I like however there is something I don't quite get and it seems to only involve those in my portfolio that I have both bought and sold at times. I have realized that when logging a 'sell' transaction it doesn't take the amount into consideration. For example if my spend was £500 for a crypto and I then log a 'sell' transaction of £50 , my overall spend should then reduce to £450 but it stays at £500. Am I doing something wrong or is just the way it is on Coingecko?",

      "body": "I've never used the coingecko tracker before so I didn't know how it works but reading your complaint it seems you need a tracker that can scan your wallet address to know and calculate how much you spend and how much you have left, I am a bit curious though as I've never seen such tracker before. I am used to Coinmarketcap and whenever I spent part of my assets I have to edit and deduct the amount.",

See 2021’s Coinmarketcap’s case for example, where it is believed that 3,1 M emails were leaked, though apparently no passwords nor portfolio data were. Of course, it could just go and happen next time with a more sensitive dataset on whatever tracker (another recent case apparently has a similar outcome).Having said that, at least the website seems to be doing things properly (I’m not really a user of the site though). If I create a test portfolio, add a coin, add a buy TX, and then add a subsequent sell TX, the portfolio balance is showing as total balance that equals the current counter value of the remaining assets (bought-sold amount of coin x converted to USD).",

      "body": "Do you mean like this?So basically you need to make new transactions to change your balance. I recently try to update my unused account to test and its work. My balance deducted since I'm adding new sell transactions. Please check back your spends, or try to use website instead apps maybe make you easier to update your balance. Well, as DdmrDdmr say, better to use different email with your exchange account for security purpose",

I'm using the Coingecko portfolio tracker but I can't get what you mean, you mean auto deduct, all I know is Coingecko tracker is manually edited if you sell  £50 you have to manually deduct the  £50 from your £500, and sometimes you will have to wait an hour at least for the changes to occur, because of the server lag but its not always this way.If you're holding a lot of coins the Coingecko tracker is a big help because you can track how much you lose and how much you gain and you can use your own currency to see your gains and losses.",
