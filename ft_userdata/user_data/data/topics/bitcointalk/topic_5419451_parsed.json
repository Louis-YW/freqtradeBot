      "body": "What token are you going to lock? Looking at the https://pancakeswap.finance/farmsThey're not requiring you to lock your fund there and that's a better option because you can pull it out anytime you wish. And the rate has increased but you need to partner it with BNB and another token like cake. If it's not allowing you to lock, just don't move it.",

And that's probably because of the volatility that one may take. If it's on the LPool, you don't have to partner it with BNB, there are 9 options of tokens reward for you to choose from upon staking cake.",

There are some like team.finance , deeplock and many more but i have not yet checked how much they charge for the fees. I think that the fees charged by unicrypto is still affordable for you. Unicrypto available for some blockchains include BSC. It's better if you check another LP vesting like team.finance. for me unicrypt is the best one. Mostly of crypto developers were using unicrypt to lock their liquidity.",

I guess if unicrypt doc is also able to redirecting you into the official site. I have been mentioning the official site. You can try to use it to lock your token easily without any doubt.",
