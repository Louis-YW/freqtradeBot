Arkham Intelligence labelled the wallet. 3B2jEBZi8fJWGEDrh6Pe7hDMaJ6iGfFtaU as \"U.S. Government: Ryan Farace Seized Funds\" Apparently, these funds are part of the seized bitcoins from dark web, originally from the drug dealer Ryan Farace. The U.S. Department of Justice grabbed a total of 2,933 BTC from the Farace family. Arkham data shows that the U.S. Government holds 213,239 BTC, worth around $14.397 billion. Who knows if they'll start dumping like the German government...",

If they want they can sell all the seized Bitcoin in their possession, that's their business. The German State of Saxony sold all they had and it had no long-term effect on the price of Bitcoin. Even if the US decides to take the same path, the market will still recover. The last time the US government sold Bitcoin last year it had no impact on the market. This kind of news is designed to create FUD and make weak hands alter their plans. For me, I don't care if the entire nations want to sell off, I am sticking to my plans.",

I don't think the US government has a record of keeping seized assets for long periods of time; they are always of the opinion of disposing of them as they don't have a need for holding them after all, so why then will they stop selling seized bitcoin if there is even anyone left in their holdings?  @Op, it's only those who are interested in looking for what will give them reason to start panic selling that will focus on looking for dumping wallet news to read and broadcast. I see no credit in it, and even if the entire world government wants to sell whatever BTC they hold through a seizure, it might make little to no difference again. The crypto market is changing to how they react to such news this time around.",

      "body": "Gradual selling of BTC seized by the US authorities from criminals is a normal practice. The total amount is significant enough to cause a major price change if dumped all at once via exchanges. But it doesn't seem to me that this is how the US is dealing with the funds. I'm sure they've been selling for a while and I remember news about some selling events, but I don't remember it having negative impact on the price. That is probably because it is done in small amounts and discreetly. Some of it is also sold via auctions rather than exchanges, which is a separate process that doesn't impact the price, I believe. In any case, it's not a big deal, and I agree with other repliers that it is not new and the US is not investing in BTC.",
