  "content": "Recent U.S. sanctions against cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash have sparked a debate within the crypto community on whether the ban compromises users’ ability to operate anonymously. Earlier this week, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Tornado Cash for helping hackers launder over $7 billion worth of virtual currency. The agency said the mixer service allowed cyber criminal groups, including North Korean-backed hackers, to use its platform to launder the proceeds of cyber crimes. Does that mean that all the privacy coins will be banned and regulated? Even those having own no KYC decentralized exchanges, like Crypton?",

Anyone can trade 0xMR on any EVM chain AMM without KYC or censorship, on 9 different chains in fact.

I mean the Utopia p2p. As far as I know, the ecosystem is decentralized, and no personal data is needed to use the exchange.

Though the government can’t totally control it but once they take action, probably this can still affect the project. With the current pressure from the government targeting privacy coins, I hope they are ready for this and will still fight for the project, the investor should take cautious for now and once in doubt don’t invest yet.",
