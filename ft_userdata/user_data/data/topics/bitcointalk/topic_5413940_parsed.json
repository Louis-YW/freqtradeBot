It wouldn't be the first time that a smart contract had vulnerabilities that were abused and taken advantage of despite being verified and open-source.You should have different wallets for different use cases regardless. You don't connect your main or long-term storage wallet to such a platform. Create a separate wallet for each of those platforms that you want to use. Top it up with the tokens and native currencies you need and connect only that one ensuring you are on the official website and not a clone. So even if there is a nasty surprise with one swaps platform, your main stash wouldn't be affected. Only the part of it that you transferred to the secondary wallet would be in jeopardy. Make separate ones for Voyager, PancakeSwap, etc.",

After that, for next action you will have to make approve transaction separately. 2) 'Approve all' would give platform access to use your all funds for any reason without asking any further approve permissions whatsoever. You save $ in gas fees here but were exchange smart contract to get hacked or someone to find exploit, you would lose your all particular 'approve all' fund.

Private key access? Recovery seed access? Or just control of your wallet for that limited time. This is a good concern and question, and with my little knowledge about this, the simple answer is that you are giving private key permission through the swapping procedure to initiate the transfer, but can't compromise it or leak your recovery seed. Once you do swapping only with a non-custodial wallet, I think that you are safe, nothing can access your crypto if you did not grant permission. Your wallet company is not foolish, neither is the blockchain technology, they understand how this works.If still in doubt, then only swap with the wallet you don't keep your money.",
