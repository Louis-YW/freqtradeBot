Cryptos do not have to be \"legalized\" at all, they are legal if they're not banned. And I don't think any central bank in the world supports (meaning uses) crypto transactions, nor do they generally have the mandate to regulate cryptos (they usually can issue recommendations).Quote from: Oshosondy on January 23, 2023, 09:38:08 PM...I have used it, also on some other exchanges, it is good to use if you do not bother about privacy, but bad for privacy people because KYC is needed.How was your experience on Binance specifically?

People will move to p2p.If the government have laws and the law illegalize crypto, it is illegal but decentralized p2p can be the only option as centralized exchanges can be banned from the country, or the centralized exchanges restrict users from the restricted countries Quote from: pawel7777 on January 23, 2023, 10:15:12 PMHow was your experience on Binance specifically?

Any feedback, whether from buyers or sellers, is welcome.It is convenient to say the least. Buying crypto with your bank card can sometimes take a day not to mention there are only a handful of banks in our country that fully support cryptocurrencies, so people turn to P2P. Trades are usually completed within minutes and you'll be able to 1on1 chat with the seller/buyer as well. Binance also shows ratings, number of trades made and trade completion rate for all sellers and buyers which gives you basis as to whom to trade with.I've only ever encountered a single cancellation of trade and that's because the seller ran out of crypto to sell.",

However, you need to select valid ppl to be able to execute your trade properly and faster. There are some trolls too who keep their time limits to 120mins rather than the default 15min. And if you start a trade with them you gotta wait for 2hrs and they never pay you (their motive is to waste your time). So always select users with 15min max. delay set.",

In this case, most of the time I have to sell cryptocurrency, from my experience, I would say that Binance's p2p option is a good way to exchange cryptocurrency to fiat currency. And p2p trading is basically mostly by stable coin, in this case you have to take a strategy and accordingly calculate the profit and set the price and create an ads for selling that's how it's work.In my country crypto currency  is illegal But if you exchange the currency in this way and following the right rules, then it can be protected from that jurisdiction banning.",

So is another alternative for we that are from Nigeria to trade directly from Binance p2p or we use forum p2p service provider.For you I don't know of your country if Binance p2p will be that effective since you people can easily associates your cards directly so it would make no sense engaging yourself with that service. It can only work perfectly fine with those people who their banks don't allow them to associate their details with crypto transactions.The thing there is that, is just a normal trade with your fiat (local currency).",

Are buyers actually rated as well?What concerns me is:To my understanding, Binance is locking the crypto to make sure the buyer receives it. But is there any similar security feature for sellers? If buyers are sending fiat directly to sellers, what happens when the buyer says he has sent the payment but the seller didn't receive anything? I'm guessing Binance would require some sort of proof from the buyer that he indeed sent the money - but what would that proof be? A screenshot? That can be easily faked.

You don't need to deposit the fiat all fiat transactions are made outside Binance that is why a screenshot is needed.",

And let binance decide the outcome.To be honest this is always be the case in every platform when it comes to p2p, there are also existing issue other users experienced.That is why dealing only to higher rated or verified seller or merchant or whatever they call it will lower the chance of facing this kind of issue but it won't give you 100% assurance so always proceed with risk.",
