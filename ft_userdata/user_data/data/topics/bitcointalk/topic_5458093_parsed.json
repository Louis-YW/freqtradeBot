  "content": "Hello, dear forum users, today I discovered that all my coins stored on the poloniex exchange were blocked due to delisting.¬†as it turned out later, the exchange posted a notice on the site https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/15295055557911-Announcement-about-the-delisting-of-NXT-RND-PERX-MESH-NU-RFUEL-ZAP-PRINTS-POL-KEEP-B20-MIST-SWRV-MEME-VALUE-ZLOT-on-June-23-2023but there was no official notification to the my e-mail, and therefore I did not know about this news and did not have time to withdraw funds from the exchange ...Now I am trying to file a protest against such actions of the poloniex.com exchange, if one of the owners of NXT coins also kept funds on this exchange and lost them, then write in this forum thread, the more victims there are, the more likely you are to receive compensation for violating the delisting procedure. ..QuoteAnnouncement about the delisting of NXT, RND, PERX, MESH, NU, RFUEL, ZAP, PRINTS, POL, KEEP, B20, MIST, SWRV, MEME, VALUE, ZLOT on June 23, 2023Dear Poloniex Users,¬†As part of the Poloniex team‚Äôs continuous efforts to improve the performance of the exchange and to better serve our customers, we may delist certain assets from time to time.

      "body": "Most importantly, why do you keep coins in a centralized exchange if you are not going to trade for a long time? This is the very exact reason you have been advised against the practice so many times.The time limit given for the traders to withdraw the funds is very short, though. Maybe they have to extend it. I am not surprised this is happening in an exchange owned by the scammer called Justin Sun.",

      "body": "Umm what???They announced this on the 15th of June and permanently disabled withdrawals on 23rd the same month? that's only 8 days! Lmao an email notice wouldn't make this any less sleazy. Any exchange which has a bit of respect to their users would not give such a short time frame. After all, this is a situation where it's highly likely people would not be able to recover their coins unless... they want more people to miss it üòè",
