  "content": "Recently we have seen a huge Dump in BNB price, as well as BUSD, is treated below $0.998. The BUSD price $0.998 seems not too low for many new traders but for the Whales and big investors its like, if they have $998000 USDT then they can get $1M BUSD, and later on they can sell it with an equal amount, so they do the trading but BUSD price dumped to $0.9959 which is a lot for the big investors.The same happened for the BNB holders, as the BNB was traded at around $320 but recently down to $283 which is also a lot for the big whales.All the Dump occur because of the SEC because they launch enforcement action against Paxos, the issuer of BUSD. Paxos says that it will vigorously defend itself, and the issue is going to court. But as per the CZ's recent tweet, \"Ignore FUD, fake news, attacks, etc.\" it is clear that both BNB and BUSD will recover the price soon.All the small investors and Newbies are advised to take extra care because if something bad happens then they won't be able to get their investment back and it will be the same case as LUNA and FTX as they were also considered Stablecoins like BUSD.",

Anyway, if youâ€™re still panicking and want to be more safe then just convert your BNB to BTC, you can be more safe with this while waiting for the updates and the official statement of Binance with regards to this.",

Limiting it means CZ may need to replace all its trading tools. He may even need to replace busd totally and do 1:1 replace with issuing another binance backed stable coin. Things are surprisingly going bad. I think market reaction shows what can be the worst. Many people trust cz but regulations are very important.",

Venture capitals don't swap their BUSD to other stable coins that is a very good signal of their high trust on Binance and CZ.Binance gained very high trust and reputation after the FTX fiasco and BUSD gained lot of interest in stablecoin branch. Hence other exchanges, other stablecoin teams want to attack Binance and BUSD that is understandable.If in a few more days, Binance and BUSD are fine, BNB and the whole cryptocurrency market will recovery very strongly. I believe they will recover.If you don't let fud affected you a lot, you will see globally, what are banks are able to proceed $3B withdrawals for customers in about 24 hours. Binance are actually better than many banks.",

Even the building they worked in got sold, and their names and offices and business' that they had, all of that was sold to others and that money was used to pay off the people they had debts to, and that means only Lehman Brothers got screwed because of this.They did it unto themselves, a big attack could always result with some companies bankrupting because they do not have enough income to pay off their debts, which means they weren't ready for a bad situation. I believe we do not have that right now, Binance is good, and they do not have to worry about this attack at all.",

In my view, Binance has many alternatives, and Dubai or any other country might be ready to provide Lisance to Binance for the BUSD minting. One more theory may be Binance is going to Pedge the BNB and BUSD as an algorithmic stablecoin. As Luna and UST were pegged I am not sure about this theory but it can be considered.Â  BUSD can also be pegged with any other Local currency such Yaun, Ryal or another currency it has low possibility but still its possible for now feel safe with the USDC",
