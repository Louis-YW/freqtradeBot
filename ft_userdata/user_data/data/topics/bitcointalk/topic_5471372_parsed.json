Well, technically, That board is for Bitcoin wallets specifically.  And it looks like the original poster is more into altcoins.  But I agree with you - I don't think we really need a whole separate board just for that altcoin wallets.  Its not exactly important when we're talking about Bitcoin ecosystem.",

      "body": "hey JoeyP did a more reasonable thread here. But there are always issues about why does one wallet get its own spot and another does not.It is tough as the name of the forum is bitcointalk. We do recognize other coins in alt section.  I have pushed scrypt in more than one section.At Joey thanks for a more rational question.I guess it falls to the btc purity test and its not pure enough.we do have a hardware section in the the software section and it does mention Trezor wallets which are hardware and they include any other coins.So JoeyP has a more legit point then some suggest.Hence the 7 merits.and here is a trezor thread",

Jaxx Liberty wallet has been retired, Wasabi isn't the same privacy focused wallet we used to know, Xapo, Worst of the worst. I don't think it's even a wallet EtcOP this is a community thing.

They can pin it if it's very good and informative.I do not know if I am missing something about this. It is on this forum that I know that Wasabi is no more a good coinjoin wallet. It is on this forum that I know that Sparrow and Samourai have Whirlpool which is a better coinjoin with remixing. Also on this forum that I know about Ledger unrecommended shards. Also it is this forum I know recently about the Trezor recently launched wallet with close source secure element which makes it close source et cetera. All these can be found on the wallet software. So is there any need to create any thread when we have a board for it already ? Anyone that is active on wallet software have no need of any new thread about bitcoin wallets. In my opinion, it is perfect as it is.",

That thread was locked and no longer updated because Lauda left the forum years ago. That account was locked by theymos with request from Lauda.Bitcointalk does not have responsibility to create and moderate threads for all Bitcoin wallets. It is their wallet softwares, their products and if they want, they have to create their announcement threads in Bitcointalk and moderate their ANN threads by their company resources.You can use https://walletscrutiny.com/ and https://www.cryptowisser.com/wallets/ to get reviews about wallets. For basic reviews, go with a second website. For deep technical reviews, go with a first website.",

Every time someone asks, members here always provide a link to their post.

Individual megathreads for it might make more sense, but still users would need to create their own new thread in the wallet software child board, because it can easily be missed or ignored if posted in the megathread. Imo, nothing needs to change there and if the wallet you want to discuss about doesn't have its own child board, just post it in wallet software.",

Although the question would be probably what kind of topic needs a new thread instead of posting it on the mega thread. From my experience pinned thread tends to get more views even from beginners, so that's that. Kinda hard to prove since it is based on my gut feeling in the end though.",
