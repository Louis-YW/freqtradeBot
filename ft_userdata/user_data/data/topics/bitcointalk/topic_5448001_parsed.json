  "content": "Hey there guys, I would like to open a case of my friend's friend. Maybe anybody could lay some info regarding it. There is an exchange she is using I dont want to mention the name but she got an email from them regarding freezing of her account due to malicious trading or abnormalities on her account which might involve in data leaking and money laundering. So they are holding her account balance. They said she needed to fund 20% of her account balance for verification purposes and this is within 3days span of time if not the account will be totally frozen.Ive asked her regarding their suspicious data leaked. She said that she was just copytrading the trading input of her whale friend and they were doing it simultaneously like if the other one is doing that time she also entering the same value or entry price and hence exiting on the same target price. So basically copytrade. Maybe this is the suspected thing of the exchange. But asking for deposit to verify or cleanse a freeze account? How is that even valid right to remedy the suspicion. They should ask for an evidence or any proof of their allegations instead.Has anyone here with the same experience? Or at least solution how to overcome besides giving the 20% verification fund to them. Cause she is scared that after she do that, what would be the guarantee that the account will be unfroze.Highly appreciated any response.",

As far as I know, almost of the exchange in the market today does that especially Binance and OKX. If I we're you, I'd go send an email to their customer support to verify if this is true, because to me, it appears to be a typical scam approach that you may encounter in Telegram groups, where a fraudulent representative may message you first and ask for money.",

Also the person involved dont want to compromise the situation cause if this got out to them maybe they will give her a hard time getting her money more since it got knocked out on a public discussion especially in forum.

Cause she is scared that after she do that, what would be the guarantee that the account will be unfroze.20% deposit for verification?  This is new to me.  Most of the freeze account due to violation often asked for KYC, or proof of funds.  This makes me think that the friend of your friend is getting scammed.  The sign are there, the 3 days deadline which gives the victim the sense of emergency thus may force the victim to give in to the demand.  It will be more suspicious if they give the deposit address instead of directly depositing on the trading platform. I think you should tell the name of the exchange since it is not defamation if what you stated is true.  Knowing what exchange it is enable us to avoid using that exchange in the future and help us avoid the same experience.",

Cause I know they are a normal one. But when I asked her about the website indeed its bitrue but the its not the one I knew. So when I checked it, looks like it is a different one. Can we report this exchangeIts bitrue but ends in [.cm] not [.com]Also I think that the one he do copy trade is an accomplice of this exchange.",

It is double scam against their user. Take user account first and try to ask user to send more money to their exchange to take it a second time.After investigation time, exchange can release fund for user or seize it but no such sending more money to verify your account. In addition, pressuring on user with 3 days span of time is another suspicious request.",

If eventually it turns out that they are really investigating her account then they should carry on with it, there's no issue there that's a normal thing for an exchange to do whenever they feel a user is doing something that's against their ToS but the fact that they are now requesting for her to find her account I have never heard of or seen anyone made such a complaint about an exchange before.

It is really shady and weird if we think of trusted exchanges. They can ask you to do KYC or do advanced KYC but a solid exchange won't request user to send more fund just to complete their verification process. Will they refund the amount you send to them after all?What if they reject your additional proof including your new depositing coin, will they seize it too or will refund it to you?No other idea rather than shady and greedy.QuoteSince you didn't mention the name of the exchange it might be a little bit difficult to give a complete/thorough feedback on your topic I'm just writing this based on the exchange I normally use for trading but she should check if she's dealing with a counterfeit of the exchange.

Hopefully your friend were not trading in illicit way where she might be opened in fraud and scams. It sounds fishy, is there no other option for your friend to retrieve her account such as proofs and KYC? If none then for sure its a scam especially the part they scare your friend to totally froze the account, makes you guys panic and would fall for their trick. Tried to call out the exchanges customer for service and ask for assistance to your friend's issue, for them to authenticate the mentioned freezing of her account.

I'm not familiar with Bitrue, but as far as I know, they never mentioned having other domains other than the com you mentioned. Even if it is true, I don't think any tier-3 or 2 exchange such as Hotbit asks you for a 20% deposit for verification. At best they would just close your account without saying anything else other than they were allowed to do so because the user is breaking their TOS. Still shady as hell, but not as scammy as this one IMO. Either your friend registered into a scam exchange that will serve its users for a while before they scam them, a phishing website, or a very shady exchange that should never be used regardless if she does copy trade or not.",

Aside from money laundering, scammers have also used tax as another reason to convince their victims to deposit and hold their funds hostage. Going forward, it's best to believe that any centralized exchange who ask for a huge ass deposit for your account to go back to normal standing is a scam.A bit of a meta related suggestion: Perhaps edit the op and add an update as a lot of people only read the first post which means you could reach more people.",

Ask also where the funds from his account came from when she is depositing to the exchange.EDIT: I saw it was just a phishing attempt, but my above scenario could be possible just in case that this is true for some exchanges.",
