Most of the traders that doing this meetup is using localbitcoin and not Bitcointalk forum since most user preferred there privacy.I use localbitcoin before when I have trouble converting my Bitcoin to fiat during the time when P2P is not available on exchange. I’m not updated on what’s the requirements of Localbitcoin anymore but that’s the place you can highly found a perfect partner on deal like this instead of the forum because it specializes in local P2P transactions.",

And if they go to a user profile, other means of communication are typically listed.",

A fair deal is not only that you receive your coins but that it is completed and on the other way that the seller gets a good deal and fiat too or whatever medium of financial transfer.",

So I had to use p2p and even though it was for small amount it was stretchy half the time.I did my best meeting in public or at a bank or police station however the other individual I got a bad feeling with. It was maybe like this 25% of the time. The rest were good transactions. However i would rather just KYC and pay 2% on an exchange than go thru that again.",

But meeting face to face is not what I can recommend. Centralized exchanges are not recommended for privacy reasons because the centralized exchange and the government know everything about you and the exchange can be hacked and your personal information can be known by hackers which can be sold, they are the worst of all. I prefer decentralized exchanges because they are the one that still preserve privacy the most.",
