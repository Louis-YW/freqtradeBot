I am asking because your first paragraph mentions pre-owned watches, but the sentence I quoted makes it sound like you are dealing with new Rolexes and only some of them are pre-owned.Quote from: xentertainer on January 05, 2023, 10:14:52 PMTo ensure utmost security for our customers, the items get shipped from the dealerships to our storage first to undergo a quality control by our watchmakers team. With all due respect, this doesn't make much sense for the buyer. Why would I trust your quality control team? You are the one selling those watches. Your staff and partners surely won't say the quality is bad or that the watch isn't genuine. Quality control and assessment should be carried out by neutral parties.",

After opening this topic, the OP did not appear here again for a year and a half, it is certain that he is not interested in further discussion here. These two Newbies who are doing necrobumps are just plain spammers, we shouldn't pay attention to them. Maybe the moderators could close such topics.",
