I'm sure we all know that most of the addicts we know never think about their families, let alone their partners. This should be a lesson that gambling should not be taken too seriously because once you become an addict it is difficult to cure it",

Regardless of the actual purpose of gambling to get entertainment, if the gambling I do has led to bad things, then I will accept and try the advice to stop gambling.Especially in my country (Indonesia), quite a few people have had their lives ruined because of gambling, of course, this all happens because of a lack of understanding about gambling and greedy behavior. People in this country (Indonesia) think they can get rich from gambling and can control everything there .",

I feel it belong to habits that should be discussed before getting married because there are some ladies that do not feel comfortable with gambling in any form. So it is better this is discussed and settled before the marriage so it does not become a challenge during the marriage. If these issue is address before marriage, maybe the lady confirm she does not have problem with moderate gambling, then there will be no issue. Perhaps people change and if the spouse change in the course of the marriage and decided she is no more comfortable with my gambling, then I will surely adjust because peace of the family is very important.",

I say this, you have to be able to provide for your family fully and gambling is just entertainment with cold money.If you feel it is for the good and harmony of your family, why not stop?Before you become seriously addicted to gambling, it is better to stop slowly and tell your future wife that you can do it.Everyone does it differently, believe me they can overcome it all.",

If it's becoming unhealthy for my family, I will leave it, hence it will bring peace at that moment. But I will try to explain to my spouse the benefits of me gambling, and I how I can control my gambling habit, so we can find ourselves on a common ground, and for she to understand my point of view when it comes to gambling.Because a lot of people despise gambling because they don't understand what's all about, or maybe they thick every gambler is a addicted to it, so you have a lot of people out there with a wrong notion about it. So whenever I find myself in those situation of people that don't understand, what gambling is, I try my best to make explanation in a bid to enlighten them.",

There should be a limit to which gambling should influence the life of a man. And before a wife or husband to be will place it as a condition that you have to leave gambling before he/she gets married to you then that means you must have a bad gambling habit that he or she has observed and can't keep up with in marriage.  Although some women especially who for no reason just abhors gambling not caring to know if you're a responsible gambler or not they just don't want their spouse to gamble and that's simple. If I love that woman so well and find peace with her as a wife I won't think twice before leaving gambling. I can get entrainment and fun from other sources if that's the case.",

This is relative and subjective also depends on someone listening to their partner or not, the fact that gambling can be done secretly without someone who knows.I do not talk as much as my love to the prospective wife, but when gambling is a place where I look for other fun, besides playing with family, so if it is a necessity (gambling) at a certain time and my future wife does not like me gambling, then forbid me to gamble, I need to make sure that he will never find me gambling, and I play behind him without being found out, because basically when we feel we need pleasure in gambling then we will stress when we don't get that pleasure, I better gamble in silence Silence rather than causing quarrels with my candidate/wife.",

Since i am a man, i refer to the opposite sex as female. what I have to first of all point out here is that, future wife is not a wife yet, there is every possibility that someone considered to be a future wife might end up not becoming the wife in the future, so, in this regard, I do not see any reason why I as a man should obey everything she says or ask me to do even when we are not yet married.Gambling is part of me, and no future wife can stop me from gambling, maybe when we are finally and fully married and have become husband and wife, I may consider quitting gambling if she asks me to quit, and I indeed know I should quit based on circumstances surrounding our financial life which my gambling is only making worst. Outside of this, if my wife is very comfortable and we both financially doing well and very happy, I do not see why she should have any problem with me gambling since it's my own way of having fun and making myself happy.And as for future wife, she has no place to decide for me what to do and what not to do as long as I know that what I am doing is not wrong.",

But asking you to stop something by your partner even if you do the thing with complete control is not fair.However, it is important for both partners to be open-minded and engage in discussions that will lead to a healthy relationship so anything that concerns one has to be sorted out as soon as possible for long-lasting love life.",

I believe that in everything, what we should put first is love and understanding. If my the girl that I want to get married to says that I should quit gambling before we get married, I might find it difficult because, I can gamble in secrete and there is nothing at stake yet. If it happens that we got married, and she noticed that I still gamble, and tell me to stop, I don't have any option than to stop gambling for the sake of family. There are some habits in us that we must give up in our marriages to stay peaceful, because in marriage one much sacrifice for the other and vice versa for it to work. Although, I cab still gamble occasionally but it wouldn't be a habit anymore, since my wife is not cool with it.",

If that happened to you, what would you do, would you stop or play in secret behind it?For me, I have a family, and I no longer gamble, not because of a mutual decision. but rather financial factors. If my finances improve, I will choose to be more careful if I want to play. because current experience is the best teacher for me not to use too much money for gambling or for something that not really need just for fun and entertaint. Because we never know what bad things will happen to us.",

Only those that have gotten married and have stopped their gambling habit because their spouse asked them to, are the only ones that should be entitled to answer this type of question.I am yet to marry and it will be very easy for me to come to the front of my screen and start typing all sorts of nonsense just because I haven't experienced it yet. I could say NO I won't allow a woman to control me or my answer could be YES because I love my wife but all that is just because the real deal hasn't been done yet.

The answer should be yes, but then if they are asking you such things then it might symbolize that you have a bigger problem and are already in a stage of denial about it. I would first ask them why they are asking such a question, is it a matter of overbearing control in your life style or is it because they are concerned you might be wasting your future funds together? If that is the case you might need to take it a step further and possibly address some wider trust issues in the relationship, before committing to marriage.
