  "content": "I was just watching videos about Lighting Network and then this idea came to my mind, to integrate Bitcoin Lighting Network into POS terminal, then googled it and this nice video came out as a result, watch this: FREE Bitcoin POS (BTC Lightning Network Accepted Here).We have an open-source payment processor called BTCPay Server which is a great help to get rid of 3rd parties and accept bitcoin payments in a modern way on your websites. I think it's possible to have an open-source payment processor for real-life payments. Just imagine, you have a hot hardware wallet that looks & functions like a contactless card and uses NFC technology to be able to pay with your hot wallet/card on Bitcoin POS terminal. And it's done though Lighting Network channel. Doesn't it sound cool?",

First, assuming you manage to successfully make a connection, or use some custodial channel, the maximum amount of money you can send is the amount you opened the channel with. I am not sure if you can refill the sending capacity with more HLTCs - it might be possible.Second, these things work great for mobile wallets. As for desktop wallets, you might as well just run a Lightning node.",

You can also set a spending limit for each card[1], so somebody else won't be able to drain your money. If this becomes popular, I'm pretty sure other products will have more or less the same feature. The only upside of using cards like this is basically convenience. The target market is definitely the average joe instead of those who want more control over their money.Quote from: Ambatman on June 15, 2023, 06:58:25 PMI still find having POS terminal for Bitcoin similar to traditional method of using third partiesDoesn't it depend on what payment gateway the merchant use? If they use a self-hosted and open-source payment gateway, I don't think you can say it is the same as a traditional fiat gateway.

Anyone who research LN extensively or already use it would know LN limitation such as it's not really suitable if you rarely make/receive payment.Isn't that with any method of payment. Like I said above.Eliminating everything else, if you don't see a need for something or doing think it's going to improve your business, you are not going to do it. That really is where all these places like Square that process payments for credit cards come into play. If all a merchant has to do it click 'I Agree' a few times on the portal they already go to daily to check credit card processing things and be able to take BTC / LN / Crypto whatever then they are more likely to do it then jump though a bunch of hoops.Bring it back to credit cards. Most legitimate places CAN get better rates then these terminal in a box services. But it's a lot of time and effort and paperwork and so on. Or you can pay the extra percentage and just get a terminal shipped to you. It dies, they ship another one, no jumping though hoops. Have a different issue, no having to deal with the CC processor, the bank, whoever else. It's 1 point of contact and done. So yes LN is going to benefit as these services start to put it in their terminals and let more merchants accept it with no other work needed.-Dave",

Some contracts can wait for (average) 10 minutes, such as paying for a new car, real estate, bicycle, smart phone, or other services whose average is more than a thousand dollars, and then the fees are not considered a problem, and the delay can be acceptable because these contracts It takes an average of half an hour in total.Payment for supermarkets, restaurants, and daily needs is the problem, and I see that the lightning network is doing it well as long as the payment is done online and not offline, and the fees in general are better and faster than cash, as most of us use the phone to make these payments.Quote from: Wind_FURY on June 27, 2023, 08:38:01 AM make it function more privately and be a kind of privacy layer built on top of Bitcoin.

You can't expect millions of people to wait days for these, and it's exactly what will happen if we all paid them on-chain. What I also see happening (and this is just a guess) is a change back to the way we did some things back years ago. Once again this is US based so the rest of the world might have acted differently. But here you if you wanted to pay by check some places took it and just took the risk, others like a lot of supermarkets, took down some information and gave you a card so the cashier knew they could take a check from you without getting more info.Changing the way wallets work a bit would solve this. Instead of RBF we call it 'Unchangeable Transaction' when you make it, you have to check that box so the store knows that no matter what you can't do anything about the TX going through. Also, you can make it so POS terminal generates a QR code that the wallet understands that makes sure the fee should get you into the next block or 2. No sending a 3 sat/vb transaction when fees are where they are now (7x that amount) And so on. Honestly, and although you are giving up a lot of privacy I think it's going to wind up with what I see now which is places like Coinbase issuing debit cards that pull from your crypto balance.Because, people are cheap, why send your crypto to whoever for free and pay a fee when you do it, when you can use your debit card and not pay the tx fee AND get 1% to 4% back.  https://www.coinbase.com/card-Dave",
