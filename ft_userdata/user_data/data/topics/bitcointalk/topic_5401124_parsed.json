  "content": "Hello all,Hope to get some inputs from miners, not resellers here.With the current pricing of hardware even after the drop, the ROI has gone from <1 year to 5 years on paper, this essentially means it will never ROI if btc stays at same value as difficulty will continue to increase, why is anyone even purchasing hardware at this point? Yes i know the btc might go up yada yada but i might as well put money into btc directly instead of mining hardware which is far less complicated..?As a miner i feel so conflicted right now, what are the other miners doing?",

Some of the gear that is being installed now and driving the hashrate up has been has been purchased or ordered a year ago:Mara:https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1251/marathon-digital-holdings-purchases-30000-s19j-pro-bitcoinQuoteBased on current delivery schedules, Marathon anticipates all 30,000 newly purchased miners to ship from Bitmain between January 2022 and June 2022. As a result, the Company’s mining operations are expected to consist of more than 133,000 Bitcoin miners, producing approximately 13.3 EH/s once all miners are fully deployed and operational.
