This is also what I thought when I read @OP.  UK being the first starter to introduce bill to clarify stuff would give a huge influence to other country.  Although this is a great news, there is also a possibility that the government will implement regulation where the freedom of anonymous transfer such as P2P would be monitored or need to report.  We know when the authority gets into something, often times the regulation implemented are somehow ridiculous.

Isn't this the normal flaw of taxes?  Government only tax gains and not the capital itself, and if the person is in negative he don't have to pay for taxes because he did not gain anything, he just to make a report of it though...",

But Kamala proposed that unrealized gains be taxed too. If this is in effect, it means an unrealized position will be taxed and even if the position ends up in the negative, people will still be charged on their losses. That's why the one UK is proposing will be a lot better than that of US that Kamala wants to enact.Quote from: Amphenomenon on September 11, 2024, 06:23:19 PM~Snipped Once enacted, it will help the legal profession determine ownership in disputes such as divorce and provide protection to crypto owners subject to scams and fraudIt's good to have some clarity on where crypto stands in a crypto so that people can make more informed decisions. For instance, in my country, it's unclear whether any involvement in crypto is punishable by low or not so it's like a grey area. That's why this seems like a good move imo but Government setting the pace for crypto is how they get back on the driving seat.",

      "body": "The UK's new bill is a great move to give a clearer indication of the legal status of crypto. By classifying it as personal property, this protects the owners of crypto, such as Bitcoin, Altcoins and even NFT, from fraud and scams. It also settles other legal disputes, like divorce cases, by indicating the manner of treatment concerning digital assets. This may attract more investment in this industry, therefore setting the UK apart in terms of crypto regulation.This, however, is not an investor's free pass. Currently, the UK already has a system in place for taxing digital assets whereby capital gains tax is levied at the point when one sells or trades crypto and makes a profit. Moreover, since crypto is yet to mature, we are sure there will be future updates as far as taxing it is concerned.",

Their main objective is for property declarations and inheritance when things go bad for the family. I did not see much of \"Regulation\" or anything of that sort here.Although this will help catch bad people, almost everyone will have to pay taxes now depending on the UK taxation system, which I am not much aware of.Things might get clear once it is passed.",

Information regarding the bill is still sketchy, but it includes legal backing for divorce and scam issues as it relates to cryptocurrencies. The crypto industry is still growing, so it needs more laws to cover many issues, and some of them might not necessarily be bad. At least lawyers or judges should be able to have a law they anchor their judgement on when it comes to divorce cases that include crypto assets.",

Foreign investors are attracted by low taxes and cheap human labour. In my country, many crypto projects and many foreign investors are trying to start a crypto business, especially big companies like BitFury and Binance because they get tax-free zones and don't pay import duties.Quote from: Z-tight on September 11, 2024, 06:59:05 PMGood news i believe, for crypto users in the U.K. It is always good if governments establish clear laws guiding the use of crypto in their country, rather than one of uncertainty, inconsistency and no precedent.If the bill becomes law, crypto users in the U.K will know that their coins are now regarded as 'personal property' under the laws of the country. It is a good development for them and would aid them in litigations.That should have been done way earlier because many people are confused when there are uncertain laws and people don't know what to do with their coins. Should they pay taxes, should they declare their Bitcoin holdings, should Bitcoin get split once a couple of divorces, etc... These things are unclear even in my country which is crypto business-friendly.According to laws, salary received from foreign countries should be declared but I know many people that work remotely in crypto companies and declare nothing because laws don't mention crypto. At the moment that's okay but governments are sometimes so shady that they'll make a law and will ask you to pay for past actions.",

It's not really something to stress over about as long as there isn't language about banning anonymous transactions, unknown addresses, mxiers etcmixers",
