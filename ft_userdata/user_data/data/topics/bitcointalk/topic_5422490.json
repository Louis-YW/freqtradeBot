      "body": "first CSW has to establish which network CSW defines as \"bitcoin\"because even this forums posts in 2010 show the actual satoshi described bitcoin as the network of the BTC coin. and BSV was not even an invention of satoshi nor existent until 2018however CSW if he wants to define BSV as bitcoin. though it only existed as of 2018.. then all lawsuits bout trying to get \"bitcoin\" to have coin robbery code added. are only lawsuits wanting BSV to have such code.if he wants to define btc as bitcoin then that makes BSV not bitcoin.he cant have it both ways..now lets look at the \"WRIGHT INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS LIMITED\"created 2016.. ok not 2008-10 although legal documents in tweet says that WII \"has traded at all material times in the commercial and technical development of Bitcoin.\"development of WHICH? bitcoin?. is CSW referring to.. i can see this as a first paragraph failing of CSWnext error (ignoring the obvious falsities (reality is CSW not being the creator))\"based on what the paper described as “a chain of digital signatures”. Such chains are now generally referred to as “blockchains”.bitcoins blockchain is PoW using hashes. its not a chain of digital signatures. as that is PoS.seems he cant tell the difference between PoW vs PoSsignature chains. are not a think. because signatures are not chained in bitcoin.transaction UTXO's are, which are something else but the term of the chain of OTXO is called \"taint\"next errorpretending he owns bitcoin.orgCSW should have stayed with pretending to own bitcoin.com and bribed R.Ver to sell it to him years agonext errorbitcoin was not described in the white paper as:\"Bitcoin can be bought, sold and transferred through digital exchanges.\"because there were no such things in 2008the white paper was actually about coin rewards from PoW mining and the transfer peer to peernext errorCSw description of successful minded block and coin reward\"In respect of nodes which are successful in theirmining efforts a distribution is made comprising a quantity of Bitcoin together withthe transaction fees relating to the transactions recorded in the new block.\"a 'distribution is made'.. um distribution. excuse me but what english is this..? i guess he meant a contribution.. but had bad autocorrect.. next errorCSw says he set up businesses to control the commerce of bitcoin and development. then he uses other things like handing development over to independent devs in 201. and that other independents set up businesses. yet wants to say WII was in control of bitcoin commerce and development!!again which direction is this guy trying to walk along.. he is saying two things at once and getting the lines crossednext erroragain he says \"During the period of 2009 – 2016, Dr Wright set up, owned and controlled various tradingentities, including WII, to develop his ideas for blockchain technology.\"yet WII was not around in 2009-2015next errordescribing forks as \"air drops\"CSW has no clue about crypto systems or terminology.. it pains my eyes just reading his errors of crypto history and terminologynext errorwas where segwit activation \"requiresinformation relating to the digital signature to be stored on side networks or “off chains”,seriously. he really has no clue.. even though i did not like the procedure used to activate segwit. CSW is by far going complete idiot by not understanding what the activation triggered or the layout of data thereafter. ..here is the kicker. he admits the bitcoin using the BTC ticker is the one that has segwit.. and the core dev team maintaining it... so he admits that the btc network is the network of the real satoshi who also used the term btc.. ..next errorhe confuses which network he defines as the \"airdrop\" he ends up calling the BCH as the airdrop. which means that its a new network giving away free coins.. and then admits that BSV is another airdrop that was created that gave away free coins.. so thus he is admitting that BSV is not the original network but a fork of a fork. or to use his words an airdrop of an air dropthus.. his BSV is not bitcoin.. point 32 quoting for emphasisQuoteThe 2018 Airdrop32. On 15 November 2018, a further airdrop occurred in relation to the Bitcoin System usingthe Bitcoin Characteristics, using the name Bitcoin Cash and the ticker, BCH.hmm BCH was created august 2017.. BSV was created november 2018seems he doesnt even know when his own network begun or which network to speak ofok im getting a headache im stop reading at point 32. and ill come back later to add to my post about al the crap thats just stupid about that filing document",

That is a brilliant idea. I will sponsor 1000 people around the world to file case against Craig Wright. Also I will file 10,000 cases against bitcoin maximalist I think that will be a great drama for the nex 20 years before bitcoin go to moon. But before that, I must create a Nuclear Bitcoin Holocast and burn up all the Bitcoin Gremlisns to clean the Bitcoin Space and my Bitcoin Forum. I am planning to turn on the  Bitcoin Killer switch so all the alt coins will be dead very soon and then I will return after the Grand Finale to rejurect bitcoin  from the dead. Duh, Have all cases with the same complaint moved to a single trial.Also counter sue anyone dumb enough to file a false lawsuit for legal fees.FYI:  https://fhnylaw.com/can-i-sue-em-for-my-legal-fees/Quotea court may assess attorney’s fees when a party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons. In this regard, if a court finds that fraud has been practiced upon it, or that the very temple of justice has been defiled, it may assess attorney’s fees against the responsible party, as it may when a party shows bad faith by delaying or disrupting the litigation or by hampering enforcement of a court order.I suggest you might want to start your meds again.",

A cryptocurrency exchange (FTX) goes down causing bitcoin price drop, now The Scammer is going after a major bitcoin exchange...I think that Faketoshi and his team of lawyers don't have much sense for anything, not even for timing. It may seem to some that this is a good time for such a lawsuit to cause even more panic, but Faketoshi announced these lawsuits even before the trial in Norway started in which he sued (and lost) @hodlonaut. Then @hodlonaut publicly asked for help from both companies, but as far as I remember, there was no response.Quote from: https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/craig-wright-files-billionaire-lawsuit-against-coinbase-and-kraken/Craig Wright, an Australian cryptographer who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto , the creator of Bitcoin (BTC), has sued Coinbase and Kraken for alleged copyright infringement. According to CityAM, the entrepreneur claims that Coinbase and Payward, the operator behind Kraken, affected his intellectual property rights by using the term ‘Bitcoin’.Such powerful companies can lose a case like this only if two things coincide - and that is that they have incompetent lawyers or that the judge is bribed or a total idiot. Faketoshi simply cannot prove anything, except that he has piled up a bunch of fake evidence with which he can do something only in countries like Colombia where they recognized him as Satoshi.",
