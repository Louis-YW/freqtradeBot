      "body": "Your topic aroused my curiosity, and I never meant to belittle what you offer, but what is the benefit of purchasing one of the Gmail email packages? Suppose the buyer will not use them for illegal matters, such as sending spam messages, posting false reviews for one of his projects or applications..ect. Is there another legitimate, unknown benefit? In addition, these emails can be created very easily for free, I believe, without a phone number. I do not expect that anyone can use one of these emails as their primary email since they were created by someone else.",
