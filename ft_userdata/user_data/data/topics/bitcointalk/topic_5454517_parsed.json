Though meme coins are taking over it but the hype of it will be gone anytime soon. Nonetheless, AI has triggered the crypto market to make a good burst of trend and success that's why AI projects are hot today.",

Currently the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and can rise or fall at any time. Before investing in any cryptocurrency, you should thoroughly research the project, learn about their strengths and weaknesses. You should consult with experts on cryptocurrency investment to get an overview of the market. Make sure you don't invest more than you can lose and always be aware of the risk and potential when entering this market.",

And i definitely would call this a gimmick, i can't see any use for blockchain in AI so this is all meme to me, same as pepe and inu copies out there trying to ride the wave and end up making their own tiny pump & dumps. NFTs however were whole new thing and i definitely would call that NFT summer. The amount of people it lured in was massive. And it's still not over by a long shot as new erc protocols for non-fungibles are coming.Quote from: GelatikKembar on May 31, 2023, 02:38:34 PMIn my opinion, AI coin still has the potential to be bullish, especially since Elon Musk also always tweets about AI, and makes the price of AI coins pump.My recommendation for AI Coin is OCEAN, because if I compare it with other AI coins, OCEAN is one that is still at a DIP price, so why not just invest in OCEAN.Tweets of Elon Musk or any other influencer are the worst idea to make decisions about investments imho. If you want to chase the moonrocket, you will always be late. So i recommend finding your own moonrocket, that influencers haven't found yet.",

AI tools adopted by bloggers,youtubers, teacher, student and many other institute s. AI has been supported by crypto projects and those project which was already working in data related function got benefits of this trend and we have seen rised in all data related token. Amongst these all AI token i think Fet and Ocean are more stronger than other m The reason is that these tokens are listed in Binance and the volume is very high. beside this their team are permanently working on their idea to improve their system. I think buying these coins are also not free from risk because if trends over the price will drop like sand and mana after Metaverse trend over.",
