  "content": "Translated Topic in Pidgin Language: Silk Road Case: De Real, Untold Story. Na Karpelès be Satoshi or DPR?Original Topic: Silk Road Case: The Real, Untold Story. Is Karpelès Satoshi or DPR?Author: GazetaBitcoinE get any person wey don watch de latest documentary about Ross Ulbricht? You fit find am here Youtube (or for dis second link) and na Free Ross organization na im create am.I dey ask because I notice some interesting allegations, besides all de wuru-wuru wey dem do during de trial. De wuru-wuru wey dem do against Ross Ulbricht (I think) many people sabi well well de details about de case, many of dem xtraelv bin also torchlight am for im very interesting topic.However, some of de details (atleast I no no) wey de documentary expose. Some dey very unrealistic (like de suspicion say Mark Karpelès be Satoshi, which I no say actually na fake, but no bodi no de truth), but some raise questions though... Besides, de film give de idea say Karpelès fit be DPR, and not just Satoshi.For example, for de beginning of de documentary, (between 0:04 and 09:22), e bin first mention SR for here, by the user silkroad inside de topic Silk Road: anonymous marketplace. Feedback requested  (wey dey correct). Jared Der-Yeghiayan, wey be de first investigator of SR (no talk about how im get to know about SR existence), find out say de site wey dem mention for de topic (silkroadmarket.org) na just a surface web platform wey bin dey inform users on how to use Tor and on how to access de real SR for Deep Web. Der-Yeghiayan find out say dem register silkroadmarket.org with XTA.net, na domain server wey a company Mark Karpelès own wey de name na Mutum Sigillum. As una already know, Karpelès na de ex-owner of de defunct Mt. Gox. From dis point e raise de suspicion say DPR(de new owner of SR, after Ross give am de site) na de same person wey be de owner of Mt. Gox.By dat time, according to Ross statements, him no longer be de owner of SR. Him bin talk say him dey overwhelmed and after him don find a guy wey help am well well wit de site, him agree to pass de ownership to am. De guy nickname na DPR (Dread Pirate Roberts) and dem dey suspect am to be Karpelès.From here, things come even dey interesting: Karpelès buy Mt. Gox. about de same time wey dem launch SR. For de documentary e raise de suspicion say Karpelès fit be Satoshi (wey I doubt) and him for get all de reasons for de world to open SR, to put there de BTC wey him earn from Mt. Gx. and vice-versa. Besides de interesting coincidences, e get one nonsensical accusation - say Karpelès na him be also de owner of BitcoinTalk, na de information wey Der-Yeghiayan receive from one secret informant, wey Karpelès bin previously hire. Dis idea come up after dem note another coincidence for de film, e dey like dis: de SMF platform, use for BitcoinTalk site, dem bin also use am for de discussion forum for SR. Besides, due to say dem dey hardly use SMF for forums, de fact say dem bin use am for both BitcoinTalk and SR bin raise de suspicion of de investigator, wey come make am dey consider say de same owner fit get both platforms, meaning say Karpelès fit be Satoshi.Examples of de similarities in UI between de sites:Make we come back to Ross and how de investigation start (32:00 - 34:46): dem talk am here say de govern use \"parallel construction\" in other to frame am and make am look like de real DPR. To be more specific, one IRS agent (Gary Alford) bin find for BitcoinTalk one post wey contain Ross email, wey him write before Der-Yeghiayan create him thread (wey I mention above). Practically, Der-Yeghiayan find de topic Silk Road: anonymous marketplace. Feedback requested , wey de username silkroad bin post March 1st, 2011, while Alford talk say him find de post wey de user altoid for January 29th, 2011 (without specifying de name of de topic). De documentary talk say Der-Yeghiayan no fit don find dis topic during him investigation because e no exist. Alford claim say him find de respective post wey another forum member quote in one discussion about SR ( I no fit find de post though I don search for am). Afterwards, Alford come mention one real post of altoid from October 11th, 2011 (wey I find to be IT pro needed for venture backed bitcoin startup), where one email bin talk say: \"rossulbricht at gmail dot com\". And from here de govern come believe to suspect say Ross bin dey behind SR.However, wetin de documentary yan, Karpelès (de alleged owner of BitcoinTalk) fit don plant this information or by another user wey get high level of access. Besides, de way Alford find de respective email, dem fit compare am wit \" finding a needle from a pile wey fit dey like de size of de internet\" (which I totally agree). In other words, for all de people wey dey try to find information about de SR owner, Alford only manage to find dis email address. From there de idea con come up say dem fit don plant de information. Because someone wey get high access fit don make de respective post in de name of Ross and hand over de information to Alford, make everything look real. De entire documentary dey very interesting, but na de first 35 minutes na im dey raise de questions wey dis current topic talk about. Karpelès fit be Satoshi and also DPR? Another aspect wey de documentary no mention but de forum know about am na say Karpelès bin also perform audit for BitcoinTalk, maybe dis aspect for raise more suspicion for de documentary. Quote from: theymos on October 07, 2013, 05:18:33 AMI believe say na how de attacker carry out de attack: after de 2011 hack of de forum de attacker bin come put some backdoors. Mark Karpelès bin come remove dem wen him run post-hack code audit, after small time, de attacker come use password hashes wey him obtain from de database in other to take control of an admin account and put back de backdoors.In de end, I wan mention say I find de entire film very interesting, wey bring new details about Ross case, about de unbelievable way de judge treat am and de sabotages some secret agencies/agents perform towards other agencies/agents. I recommend everybody to watch am, na a must watch documentary!",

      "body": "Thanks again Sokani as you take translate another of my topic! I appreciate all your efforts!Dis na very special topic wey mainly dey dedicated to raising awareness about Ross Ulbricht unfair trial. Many people bin accuse am without proper knowledge of de case. E dey easy to talk many things, but as you watch dis amazing documentary, you go understand say things bin no dey dat simple with am. Agencies bin dey fight each other to take over de case, corrupt DEA agent dey steal BTC from Silk Road: Dem no gree make Ross authorized witnesses appear for court, de persecution bring unauthorized evidences to de court and de judge accept am just to make an example of Ross - all dis and many mata you go understand from de topic and from de documentary.Finally, one man dey serve 2 life sentences for prison + 40 years bonus(how any person fit take fulfill this kind sentence?!?) without parole, because him dey run a website (!!!) and for him first offense, while de administrators of SR 2.0, 3.0 or other dark markets dem bin don caught dem, imprison dem, and already release dem. Fair justice? Yes, sure!!!",
