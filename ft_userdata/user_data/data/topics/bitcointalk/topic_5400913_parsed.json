They can just use the \"utm_source\" if they need referrer when visiting or accessing the site. I have checked the board and i just see lots of gambling ann threads do the same like this, i wonder how mods will do about this if rules is absolute since some of the users have been banned for several days, or years, worst permanent due to this.",

And it is common thing to see affiliate link under the infographics in a gambling site announcement thread. The owner of the site has said this in that topicQuote from: Jumbo Ticket on May 22, 2022, 10:03:48 AMThe first screenshot you shared is of our official website. The second screenshot is of the promotional $50 bonus welcome offer exclusive for bitcointalk members.Registering with the offer link gives to $50 credits using which you can purchase tickets and participate in our Jackpots. Hope this clarifies your doubt.It means, the owner of the site has created the exclusive referral link for the bitcointalk forum members. You will receive some free balance if you create an account through the referral link of the announcement thread.Probably it isn't forbidden to use referral link under the infographics/hyperlink in the announcement thread if the OP is owner or hired by the owner of the site. 1miau has made an explanation about thisQuote from: 1miau on August 05, 2019, 12:19:24 AMThere are some exceptions, where reflinks could be tolerated like if you are including it in a very informative reply / description which adds value, a site owner who wants to track traffic coming from Bitcointalk or similar where it's very clear that it's no ref-spam. However, spamming with referral link is against the forum rules. But you will find referral link under the infographics in most of the announcement thread in gambling section. Here are some popular and reputable crypto casino with referral link in the announcement threadBitcasino.ioDuelbits.comFreeBitco.inSportsbet.ioStake.com",

Of course, I can easily guess that most don't do this.",

That's the link I have put in the ANN.Website like Duelbits use a tracking link https://duelbits.com/?a=duelbit to track the clicks on their website. I believe the OP pointed out that you are using a regular referral link which is not allowed in the forum unless you have proof that the team really use this link to track the clicks coming from the forum. This is your only choice to prove that you are not using your personal referral link. Some Casino ANN thread really uses same referral link as your but the difference was the account posting there ANN thread is the official Bitcointalk account of the casino there's no issue with that.I hope you will justify this before the thread was removed by the mods since some user probably report the thread to moderator.",

It’s something like a referral link of user duelbit on their site.The link I have posted is- https://jumboticket.com/refer/offer/xxxxxxxxWhich says offerIt's clearly an offer. Also, I'm not abusing this. Once again, as I said above, there are exceptions of referral link posting in bitcointalk. Thank you for notifying this but I think this is not what the forum rules referring to. This is an example of the exception.Also, you can see that official representative of the site is responding to the questions. So, there's nothing to prove here either.",

Like I posted on the thread, I registered on the site, and discovered I signed up through a referral link when I saw a name on my profile as my referral (screenshot below).I thought maybe it was you trying to get users to sign up with your link for some bonus, which I personally consider inappropriate and highly unprefessional, sorry I misjudged.",
