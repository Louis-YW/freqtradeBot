  "content": "The long awaited Ethereum Merge is just around the corner, but not everyone is excited about the major upgrade. A group calling themselves ETHW Core have voiced its opposition to the change and are set to conduct a hard fork within 24 hours after the Merge. Under the project name, ETHPoW and with the token ETHW, ETHW Core plans to split off from the main ETH blockchain and maintain a PoW version to keep ETH mining alive beyond the Merge.“ETHW mainnet will happen within 24 hours after the Merge. The exact time will be announced 1 hour before launch with a countdown timer and everything including final code, binaries, config files, nodes info, RPC, explorer, etc. will be made public when the time’s up,” the group wrote in a Sept. 13 tweet.The Merge will shift the Ethereum network away from its current Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining model to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, phasing out miners and replacing them with validators.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

But it can be assumed that it will not be as profitable as ETH mining.Well i can totally understand that those big mining companies that are mainly in China are not very happy that Ethereum will switch to PoS soon as they have invested Millions of Dollars into their mining farms and most of them are using ASIC's to mine Ethereum which means they can not just switch to mining Bitcoin as it is using a different algorithm.That being said, it is known for some years now that ETH will become proof of stake so those companies had a few years to prepare for that moment that will come now in a few days.I doubt that their ETHW fork will be really profitable. It is just a desperate move in my opinion, but we will see.",

      "body": "Even with the version fork and meaning keeping the eth 1.0 version, will mining still be as profitable as it used to be? The problem is, scalability will also be split and it is likely that old and future project developers will actually use eth 2.0 which obviously brings a solution from version 1.0",

Crypto can be labelled as a scam caused by that.This was simply inevitable, it is obvious that miners which invest a huge amount of money in equipment were not going to be happy about the change, and at least for them the most obvious solution to all of this is to create their own fork, but while people may use it for a while and be excited about it because of the free money they're going to get, after a few months people are going to move on, this is exactly the same that happen with the segwit upgrade we saw in bitcoin, and for a time bitcoin cash and other forks became quite popular but eventually bitcoin imposed itself and I think the same is going to happen here.",

Miners have plenty of choices aside from mining eth, there are other options like btc, rvn, etc and many more. Maybe their just inclined towards eth pow and probably looking forward to the fork. But isnt it gonna create confusion to others? Well diverting to PoS has its advantage especially on environmental aspect and probably Vitalik feels the need to do so. Anyway some supported him a lot maybe some cant accept this but for sure he thinks a lot of this before going through it.",
