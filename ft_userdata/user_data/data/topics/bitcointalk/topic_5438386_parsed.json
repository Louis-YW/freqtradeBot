  "content": "I understand say everything just hard for the country for the country and the matter based on how things dey go just dey so frustrating wey be say people no dey get patience or even conscience again to tolerate or give free supportive assistance to each other especially among strangers. All of us nai dey face same palava Dem so make we dey try in as much as we can to dey tink twice bfor we react or act towards issues. This wake up call the com as a reminder based on some few things and happenings wey I dey see among Nigerians that are suffering same fate under a certain condition fighting themselves as if they are both d enemy to their horrible plight at the moment.Some examples are:1. You go see two people wey don stand for line since early mor-mor inside filling station waiting to buy fuel, just out of small misunderstanding Dem go start d abuse or fight themselves as if na two of them cause d reason to their plight , meanwhile the real enemy dey government house for inside AC. Same tin dey happen for banks sef as two Nigerians under frustration start fighting and hitting themselves with objects inside d bank, while one of their main problem dey inside office dey collect AC as bank manager wey dey carry d new notes dey go give politicians for their houses.2. Another example na market women wey go just dey abuse u sake of say since morning beta market never sell, and u wey try com to buy just d price price d market anyhow, Dem go com d shout for u say u be bad market, say mk u leave their shop. But them d forget say na based on ur pocket u dey try wan manage. Even bus drivers and conductors na same category Dem fall too.Actually the list supposed plenty but just that too much preaching no too good for evening church so mk we stop am here, as una know the rest. My conclusion be say, abeg make we dey try put ourselves for the plight of others, cos as it dey pain u na so sef it dey pain de next man, all of us na dey inside dis suffering together, in most cases no be we wey dey suffer same fate be our enemy, no allow frustration from the suffering mk us d fight each other. The actual person to fight na thean at the top no be we we.",
