If you are part of the team and you would like to create an announcement thread about your casino, then it would be far better better to do that than trying to promote to the casino. Since you are looking for partners the await those who will be interested in service. You can as well move this to the service board for more visibility or better still, give a comprehensive description about your service.",

For examples of the sites I am talking about PM.The internet is the field of scammers, they have various tricks and modes, maybe countless tricks and modes that scammers use, starting with analysis, predictions, regular bets, dealers, partners and so on, which at the end of the story is extortion and loses in gambling, that's a fact that often happens in the world of online gambling.I also think, humans are never ending greed in making money, if you are experienced in the field of development, web, gambling, software, expert in regular edge bets and can make big profits, why don't you bet yourself or become a bookie yourself, to make big profits.Notes:Partners or dealers, don't want to work with you, they trust the parties/management of gambling sites directly, rather than trusting you whose origins are unclear, You could have appeared today, after getting your prey disappeared without a trace, your tricks are old-fashioned, partners and bookies are not stupid.",

Strangely enough you are a newbie on the forum and you did not lost any time to try and find a partner overhere, even if  your post is shaddy enough. Thing is... Your post is a mess and no one will understand what kind of expertise you are showing with a couple of screenshots. My advice for you is to get a reputation first and then you canstart thinking in posting proposals that make sense.",
