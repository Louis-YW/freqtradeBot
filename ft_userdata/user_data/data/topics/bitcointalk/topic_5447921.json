I got so calm, because what is there to rush about? I have no money anyways, since that time learning became my first priority. If you don't have the money yet, maybe because you are jobless or still in school, do not let that be the reason to be out of Bitcoin, there is more you can learn that will help you in your crypto journey.

      "body": "Congratulations, because it helped you learn more about Bitcoin technology. But, well, every human doesn't have the same character, and that experience of yours was a disadvantage to others as well. Some wished they had had enough money to invest in Bitcoin because investing doesn't really require all the knowledge about Bitcoin. IMO, people can only have two major regrets about Bitcoin investment: not having money to invest in the early days and not having the knowledge or help to make them invest. When I first heard about Bitcoin, I was terrified that my money would simply vanish if I invested in it; I didn't know anything about it, and there was no one who could teach me.",

Not having enough money can actually be a good thing because it teaches us to be strong and focus on doing things that matter. I think you did an amazing job by installing that wallet and starting to mine Bitcoin on that old computer.I'm guessing you either held onto those mined Bitcoins for a while or sold them when the price went up to $100, but either way, it's great that you shared your story with us. It really helps new Bitcoin fans understand how things used to be and how far we've come.",

I agree... sometimes lack of a resource and hunger are the fuel needed to accomplish great things. Most persons who invested in bitcoin may have done so because they wanted to change their circumstance. They wanted to improve the economic situation in their family.Glad in your case you took the right steps. While you may not have had money but you had a PC that could work some persons do not even have a PC, they started with their mobile phones until they were able to take profit and invest in a better electronic device.

You should consider that in 2009-2011 mining were really easy to do and anyone with a PC were able to earn a good amount of Bitcoin. Yes, naturally you should have accumulated it for years before to seea big sum, but pioneer in the early stage has had possibility to change their entire life. About the OP, totally agree with him, learning is more linked with desire to earn something, the more desire you have, the more you'll earn probably.",

So I did my own research online, watch some videos on yt and explored the trading/investing app. Its actually tempting to do some trading/investing if you have already the knowledge with it, the only problem is that I lack funds. That's why I started from low since that's all I can afford as a student and looks like my studying pays off well.

I don't know what you're trying to mining, but it's definitely not bitcoin, or at least not at the moment.If by knowledge you mean mining, then mining requires knowledge and money, not just knowledge.Learning in itself is a beautiful thing, but investment needs more, and not only learning, but money.Learning may bring you that money, and it may be in other ways, but a financial return is required to be able to invest.Knowledge helps you to improve the chances of doubling this investment and achieving an ideal income that enables you to invest quickly.",

After that, they can sell their tokens to BNB or even directly to BTC to own their first BNB or BTC.Just to add, you need a good high ranked account to earn enough from bounty campaigns. And to earn a high rank, you need merits and for that you need knowledge, etc. Also, I wont recommend joining any random altcoin bounty campaigns, most of them end up giving just a few bucks at the end of the month due to rapid price drop and scummy nature. Give priority to bitcoin based campaigns.",
