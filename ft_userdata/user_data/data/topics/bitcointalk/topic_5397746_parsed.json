Still he never gave up despite the years it took to fighting the government agency for the unlawful fraud allegation he was accused of.Actually if your alibi really does a strong affluent then you can win a trial in any case. Most government will take advantage of some people with their stunt on crypto but of course there is a case to case basis where the other party could emphasize and win it by such facts and evidence. It would take years but the fight might be on his advantage and favor.",

As far as I understand he is a crypto investor, is cryptocurrency trading illegal in Nigeria?Cryptocurrency trading is not particularly illegal, the only law is that which bans Banks from mediating in crypto transactions.About what he did, probably nothing illegal, in a country like Nigeria, the border between rule of law and arbitrary actions from security operatives is murkied and one can be arrested and charged over mere suspicions; Reason for the nation wide protests about two years ago against a particular security sect which were know to victimize citizens, especially youths. You could try googling EndSars protest, there's a thread about it on the forum too.",

If you must embrace crypto it shouldn't be at the expense of your human right and going against the government policies. I think a cases like this get victory with heavy bribe to accompany it. Crypto shouldn't be presented as a source of income in Nigeria to protect your own interest make it as hidden as possible for the sake of what you believe and know about crypto so you don't lose your coin and key",

Lack of money has caused so many injustices in the society we live in. Denying human beings' rights and health because of no money or backup. It's not like people don't know what to do when the government invade their privacy or properties by going contrary to their line of duty, it's just that the system will frustrate you if you don't have money to make your case. It's a big win for him, recovering all his seize assets by the EFCC",

The cause and facts to the case where not really spilled and makes it hard to understand. You might want yo drop a reference link that could be clicked and redirects users to the detialed case as a lead or clarifier or perhaps, add more detail to OP. It would help as not to live users with a shabby idea of the storyline.Mean while, the Nigerian government isn't entirely welcoming of the cryptocurrency innovation. In fact, it is at a point where you get queries for having a crypto related app on your device. In most instances, your immediately linked with fraud and prosecuted. Making most legitimate crypto investors to question there rights to a legitimate crypto business.It's a welcome development indeed that this particular individual could go on a case against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, a government agency for fighting fraud and won. Its good news for every legitimate crypto investor in Nigeria as,1. Builds a reference case for crypto traders/investors in the legal field2. Serves as an encouragement for cryptoprenuers in the nation state3. Points a part to building a case, the importance of keeping records and the need to be clean in business4. Also, it shows the transparency of the law and that's reaffirmingThere could be more to this case as, building a case against the government and winning would require resources and supports from various individuals and organisations. To all the parties involved in ensuring that the case was free and fair, thanks for giving Nigerian legitimate crypto investors hope.",

There may be a tiny possibility the accused could be guilty of whatever charges against him, the court can be manipulated by very good lawyers. Perhaps your not getting it but, its pretty much related to crypto as, the query was based on a fraud allegation against him to have transacted in cryptos. You know, they never get to believe someone can be involved in crypto and not be fraudulent. This case proved otherwise and have got some backings.When it comes to court being manipulated, I guess the same would have gone if the government did win the case (it still would be said to have been manipulated by some good lawyers). There is no perfect system in the world and as such, we could only try to be fair when we can. There is no one more richer than the government. Somehow, this individual managed to pull resources to push his case though and with a transparent record to back it up.I don't see why, this isn't a win for both cryptos and for the citizens to have some faith in the judicial system.",
