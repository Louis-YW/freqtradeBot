You can only use it on the Windows operating system. They will be launching a new version of it on 20th March and are conducting an event known as Bisq Market Day. Another reason for conducting this event is to create more liquidity on bisq. As they provide multiple payment options for users in India. I was hoping that as a community on Bitcointalk India can create some buzz on the BTC/INR pair. KYC is not required on Bisq!Payment option available on Bisq.NEFTRTGSPAYTMIMPSUPIWhat do you guys think? I think it is a great opportunity for everyone who has been struggling with crypto tax.",

I think it is a great opportunity for everyone who has been struggling with crypto tax.That is an incredible news but what about INR transaction which are done by a seller are not something to worry about. What I meant is that if I sell my Bitcoin using the BTC/INR pair and then ask the amount to be credited using UPI or any other method, can you guarantee that the INR received won't get me into trouble as KYC is not done on Bisq. I mean it can come from an illicit or illegal source. That account may not be in the radar for now but might be part of some conspiracy in the future.",

      "body": "Even though Bisq has added INR trading pair, I see no offers available there! With the unfortunate closing down of localbitcoins and localcryptos, I expected BISQ to have some offers. Still, unfortunately, INR trading section is not at all active and has no offers yet. I have tried checking at different times but the result is the same. Also with such a non-custodial and non-kyc exchange, there's always a considerable risk of dirty money being pushed to the accounts of commoners like us. It seems the only option for Indians will be to use Indian exchanges like Wazirx, Bitbns etc. going forward. Not really a favorable time for Indians in the crypto market.",

I think it is a great opportunity for everyone who has been struggling with crypto tax.If we have enough liquidity in BISQ then it is the best option. I tried using them a few years back but no one was available to carry on any trade and hence i uninstalled them, but now there is a renewed interest for decentralized exchanges is good and if anyone used them recently how is the liquidity.Quote from: avikz on February 16, 2023, 04:12:55 PM~Also with such a non-custodial and non-kyc exchange, there's always a considerable risk of dirty money being pushed to the accounts of commoners like us.

If we receive hacked money then we are in trouble, so yes the risk is high for non KYC exchanges and some of the users here got into trouble for receiving money from hacked accounts in the past.",
