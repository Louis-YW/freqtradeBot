So so and so potentials would had been amidst (added) to the Bitcoin potentials? Or have you ever been wondered at any of its potential maybe that doesn't favour you or you just accept that Bitcoin in general is a perfect inventory?I have really had some series wonders about some Bitcoins potentials which are>>>* I wonders the creative ideal and what is and was behind how Satoshi Nakamoto  could succeed in convincing the  world to believe on a digital currency even when it is not controlled by any individual or any authority and the world accepted it even when every nations have its own local currencies.* I am still yet to understand how 1 Bitcoin was valued at the rate of $0.001 in just 2009 and today its value is rated in tens of thousands.* I am wondered about the solid reliant of its Blockchain technology on how it is binded with security trust and access denial from altrances. I wonders how records of the decentralization is privately secured that it is untraceable not by other users or even by any authority such as our local banks could have access to our bank accounts and statements of account.* Also as the volatility. I wonders who is really in-control on the volume of Bitcoin that on whatever rate it comes, there are always ones taking advantages of it whereby if it is on a low value it paves ways and attracts more investors and if at a high value rates it is appreciated by its investors.Most especially... I am wondered about the confidence it could inspire to its dealers (Bitcoin investors) where it requires one just patient without a personal marketing skills before getting to the hill of profitablities.I am still yet to pick errors on any of the Bitcoin potentials instead I am finding every reasonable reasons in it.When I think of the permanent access denial at when lost passwords and private keys of wallets, I just appreciate the method requesting when submitting of wallets account for rewards (payments) in a campaign job where you will be asked to paste your wallet address instead of having a fixed wallet account payment system.Imagine if you looses your wallet access and you just keep working and earnings keep getting to your unaccessible wallet at where unacceptable to submit another to your payment manager. Oh! It should be a damned.I just love this system where one can tender its desired wallet account at when payment is due. And I bet there would be so much accumulating useless bitcoins on  displaced wallets access more than the useless accumulated bitcoins of today.I am most wondered why Bitcoin could still keep to an integrity without crashed despite being decentralized instead it is striving and enhancing its security trusts as it gradually silents over some local fiats while it is already accepted global digital currency.If I may ask, are there what you are wondered about Bitcoin? Are there some additional potentials you wished it portrayed or do you feel any sign advancement (update) of Bitcoin in the nearest future?",

My brother, this matter dey pain me wella... Bitcoin was a good opportunity for poor man piking to take meet up for life. I no doubt Bitcoin one day. Ever since I realized how good and sweet Bitcoin make life become, I accepted it with my full chest. Even when people dey talk say Bitcoin go crash, I always dey tell them make e crash untop my head. Even till now I stoll get colleagues wey still dey wait make Bitcoin crash and I dey laugh them dey go. Well, now no be the time to wonder again, Bitcoin don survive plenty fud and media propaganda, the technology dey very strong and reliable, the security dey kajad so no need make we continue to wonder. If we must wonder, it should be how to buy enough Bitcoin now as we dey prepare for the next bull run.  E good make we join the crowd now so we go fit do dorime like our mates them come 2024/2025.",

Well it's up to him whether to reveal or not.he knows best why he chose to be anonymous. Who knows if he chooses to show up maybe people who have questions to how possible bitcoin would be, or how it would look like and government would have seen him as a threat to produce a digital asset like bitcoin to devalue or eliminate fiat, or produce something with a monetary value in thin air. They would have probably kill his dream of achieving Bitcoin. So far as I am concerned there is no nessesary need to appear because the project is already a success. It was a risk to him to produce something like that. Satoshi nakamoto has a bright future for the masses and see bitcoin as the only way to eliminate poverty. Just look at us now, how we are always happy about Bitcoin and most currupt government officials are angry about bitcoin, how successful it has become. Up till date most country has ban/prohibited crypto currency. that is a sign that if Satoshi nakamoto appears in air, they might even jail him or accuse him of some unesesary charges.You talked about helping him on idea of improving the authenticity of bitcoin? If I may ask did bitcoin lack authenticity? If anything is lacking I think is human that is lacking to understand the future of bitcoin and not to take part in it before they regret more later. If bitcoin was not that authentic I think I wouldn't have lasted the way it did. Even altcoin that were produce after Bitcoin has no match for bitcoin even the founders of altcoins are still woundering how powerful Bitcoin is. So I think you should just buy bitcoin and hold and stop thinking for the masses.Quote from: Richbased on November 10, 2023, 02:01:38 AMYou see inasmuch as humans are concerned, we all believe mostly on things we see and experience with our physical eyes as some persons who might want to develop interest in bitcoin may begin to wonder why Satoshi can't reveal his or their identity, then what if anything happens to bitcoin tomorrow who would they run to for help or for ideas on how to revive it. Satoshi being anonymous has made billionaires not to have much interest in investing on bitcoin because they are afraid whether it's future will be sustainable. I see no reason to worry about bitcoin, if bitcoin was to fall it would have did that long time ago. Whoever Satoshi nakamoto is or the plan he has I think it's for good he said bitcoin is common man or for orinay peopleBehind any reasonable doubt I find it to be true he is worthy of emulation and such genius like him are not 2 in this world. If anything happens to bitcoin today which I don't even think so, many people will still testify about the goodness of bitcoin because it has lifted men expecialy those that believe in his dream and mine it people like Half For and many others. I think I have answered your question correctly.",

When Bitcoin ben start, e been hard to convince people's to believe in Bitcoin as many economist predict say Bitcoin go crash. Plenty article dey online wey dun declare Bitcoin dead many times but e still dey stand strong. Bitcoin convince people no be Satoshi because nobody even sabi the man. Bitcoin is backed mathematical and those wey be understand maths that time believe Bitcoin go succeed and started mining Bitcoin. The early miners are those wey we go appreciate because without them, Bitcoin for fail, they were basically mining Bitcoin for free like dem no been dey profit back then.Quote* I am still yet to understand how 1 Bitcoin was valued at the rate of $0.001 in just 2009 and today its value is rated in tens of thousands.Power of demand and supply, although the circulating supply was lesser back then but there was no demand. Nobody been dey reason Bitcoin as e never proof himself for people but after the demand begin to increase due to Bitcoin getting more popular and the circulation supply keep reducing (that's the supply available for trading due to miners block reward reducing, people Hodling off exchange and Bitcoin getting lost), all this things contribute for the increase in price. Quote* Also as the volatility. I wonders who is really in-control on the volume of Bitcoin that on whatever rate it comes, there are always ones taking advantages of it whereby if it is on a low value it paves ways and attracts more investors The community, no centralized body dey in control of the price but dem dey get some kind indirect control like when dem do something wey go influence buyers to buy more or sellers to panic come dey sell. Nobody dey in control and na one of wetin make Bitcoin a decentralized project be dat.QuoteI am most wondered why Bitcoin could still keep to an integrity without crashed despite being decentralized instead it is striving and enhancing its security trusts as it gradually silents over some local fiats while it is already accepted global digital currency.Bitcoin was created with a mindset of combating inflation and that's why it has a fixed supply and not unlimited supply like all fiats. Bitcoin is actually backed by maths but the fiats isn't backed by anything. This na the reason why the fiats no dey appealing to use as a store of value but Bitcoin is and this na why Bitcoin dey advanced as a better option than fiats to use as a currency and an asset. Bitcoin can't be duplicated, can't be clone as anything wey wan happen like dat will just be another altcoins like dem Bitcoin cash, gold and won't be verifiable on the Bitcoin blockchain. QuoteIf I may ask, are there what you are wondered about Bitcoin? Are there some additional potentials you wished it portrayed or do you feel any sign advancement (update) of Bitcoin in the nearest future?Reduction in fees (scalability problems): This na only the place wey Bitcoin still get issues if you ask me. The solution wey dem dun introduced never do the job well, the use of Segwit address still never help matters. The use of lightning network isn't a permanent solution because lightning network na layer 2 solution wey many people never still support and that's why it isn't getting accepted rapidly. The developers need to find way to make fees no dey get issues as we dey get now wey network fees just high anyhow.",

Because if this government officials get a trace of him or his offspring they will find all possible means to control the system he has built all these years. It takes a lot of discipline to maintain anonymous, this is because humans like the feeling of ownership and fame. If some persons were giving the opportunity to be the owner of Bitcoin they would make sure all the world knows and brag about their achievements, just the way Elon musk does. I won't be surprised that some well known technological CEO have some hidden deal with the government's which they use as a strategy to control how the technology is been used in the country. For instance Facebook can save your personal data and sell it to other companies and this is only authorized by the Nigerian government. Any day the government decides to stop access to users data then Facebook will lose a lot of users. But they cannot stop it because they are benefiting from",

Satoshi remaining anonymous was the best strategy taken for the true adoption of Bitcoin.Bitcoin has been a revolution in the world today and thanks to Satoshi the massive now feel they have a say in the control and financial freedom concerning the money system that the world has bent everyone on believing and this time around it's the government who are at the back end of the scare game as they say if you can't them you join them.

      "body": "Yea, Bitcoin technology's existence and dominance in space is what someone can sometimes actually wonder about, but then again, if you want to relate the whole thing to the traditional monetary system we have today, the question would be: how did people just get to believe that money holds a particular value? Why are people accepting money in exchange for goods? Meanwhile, this money we are talking about is just ordinary paper made off; some color was added, and the number was written on it (like, $1, $2, $5, $100).Let me tell you one comparison I made with Bitcoin and normal fiat money. It's said that \"it doesn't actually matter who started first, but what matters is who is going to win.\"In the time when money first got introduced, it was valued, and people as well valued the money, but look at what that same money has turned out to be today. The fiat currency has totally lost a lot of value compared to when it was first created, and also, back then, when it was created, it was a bit limited compared to the volume of printed cash we have today.But just take a look at Bitcoin. Right from when it was created, its total supply has not increased; it has just remained what it is from day one, and I believe that's also one major reason why people are frequently adopting Bitcoin. Despite the fact that there are thousands of individuals worldwide who are in demand of having 1 or 2 pieces of Bitcoin, it seems impossible for them because the price is high for them, but Bitcoin doesn't care about its limited supply because it knows that it's the limited supply that will make the price hike and value with be high.",

If anyone come up today and say he/she or any entity comes up today and say am Satoshi Nakamoto do you think anybody will believe them? If anybody tries it others will rise up and claim same identity and this might lead to unnecessary chaos which is not needed. Also I believe Satoshi Nakamoto chooses to be anonymous, because bitcoin transaction should be anonymous. And Satoshi is showing that example. There are so many reasons why Satoshi Nakamoto should remain anonymous which I can't mention all here. But I think for his/her or their safety which is paramount it should remain this way. Quote These has always been my thoughts for a long time that Satoshi Nakamoto being an anonymous person or group should rather reveal their identity in other for people to be more confident about the use of bitcoin and moreover if an issue comes up so that we can know the right people to channel our complaints to.The confidence of people in bitcoin is already high and this has nothing to do with the anonymous of Satoshi. Every year people all over the world keep adopting bitcoin and centralized exchanges keeps recording new users creating accounts. On a contrary if Satoshi reveals it's identity it might even lead to some decline in the use of bitcoin for some reasons. Imagine If Satoshi reveals it's identity and it happens to be a Russian and with the ongoing war between Russia and Ukrain, do you think that the people of Ukrain will confidently use bitcoin? I think the government of Ukrain will place a total ban on bitcoin trading and also Ukrain allies will do so and this will hinder bitcoin users in such countries. Same thing goes to Isreal and Hamas war in Palestine. So I don't think that the identity of Satioshi being revealed will boast any form of confidence or whatsoever.  QuoteYou see inasmuch as humans are concerned, we all believe mostly on things we see and experience with our physical eyes as some persons who might want to develop interest in bitcoin may begin to wonder why Satoshi can't reveal his or their identity, then what if anything happens to bitcoin tomorrow who would they run to for help or for ideas on how to revive it. Satoshi being anonymous has made billionaires not to have much interest in investing on bitcoin because they are afraid whether it's future will be sustainable. I think you are mistaking one thing here, bitcoin was built on trust and not physicality. Physicality has to do with fiat system of money and not bitcoin. Satoshi revealing his identity how does that add money to our pocket. What exactly can happen to bitcoin if I may ask? Crash, I don't think so and that is never happening till the end of time. Anything that has lasted more than a decade is successfully pass the trust test and bitcoin has done that despite all the attack.

And Satoshi is showing that example. Bitcoin isn't anonymous neither is the transactions anonymous, you can see everything happening on the Bitcoin blockchain openly. Bitcoin is pseudonymous which gives you privacy (dem no fit link your transaction to you because no personal information dey attached to your Bitcoin address) but if you go dey do anyhow like post your identity (like KYC) linked with your address then dem go fit trace am to you. Bitcoin guarantee privacy and to increase am more you fit make use of mixers to increase your anonymity so person no for track transaction to use but make the mixers be correct ones wey no dey save logs of device wey use their service or how dem do the mixing (which address dem send from or receive).QuoteThe confidence of people in bitcoin is already high and this has nothing to do with the anonymous of Satoshi. Every year people all over the world keep adopting bitcoin and centralized exchanges keeps recording new users creating accounts. On a contrary if Satoshi reveals it's identity it might even lead to some decline in the use of bitcoin for some reasons. Na better truth you talk here, which dey self Israel ban Bitcoin and e no get anything to do with Bitcoin but because dem observe say their enemies wey dem dey fight dey get reinforcement through financial backing with the help of Bitcoin. E good as Bitcoin no dey connected to anybody wey go come connect to a particular country, religion or anything wey dey divide people. More country go ban Bitcoin if e dey link to a founder from country wey dem no like. Satoshi is a very smart person or a wise set of people (assuming dem be group) because all the decisions wey dem take make sense. Making Bitcoin a community project and not a personal project was the best decision. See BNB coin, just because people hate Cz, dem dun hate the project. If Satoshi no do wetin dem do na so e for dey for Bitcoin too, so you make better sense.",

People will always accept whatsoever invention that attends to their needs, addresses and brings solution to their challenges. Anybody could have invented bitcoin and still get the rate of adoption it's receiving today, it's not about the inventors influence but the invention being capable of solving and providing solutions to people's financial problems.People are in dare search of what could give them financial freedom and privacy in their daily business life and this is one of many other solutions that bitcoin offers to it users.The oppressive measures and policies of the central authorities in controlling, monitoring and directing the financial flow of citizens has been a challenge to many people and bitcoin as decentralized technology giving anonymity, privacy, financial freedom etc to it users all these made people from divers countries to adopt it even when they have their own local currency.",

Physicality has to do with fiat system of money and not bitcoin. Satoshi revealing his identity how does that add money to our pocket. What exactly can happen to bitcoin if I may ask? Crash, I don't think so and that is never happening till the end of time. Anything that has lasted more than a decade is successfully pass the trust test and bitcoin has done that despite all the attack. I have never seen any technology that has suffered the amount of attacks and propagandas that bitcoin faced over the past 14 years and survived. Yet bitcoin is still soaring higher. Moreover there are no facts to support your claims that billionaires around the world are not investing in bitcoin because Satoshi has remained anonymous.From the history of bitcoin and it's progress there have been several attack launched to hind the growth of bitcoin especially government tried all possible that is why you see them attacking exchange and some altcoin we may know even go to an extent attacking people who keeps promoting those altcoin on their media pages. So this shows that for Satoshi to remain anonymous gives it a better bracement to kill the dreams of government to break into bitcoin to control it the way they wanted, now talking of billionaire, yes there are into bitcoin investment even some of those government agencies fighting against bitcoin has in one the other filled up their wallets to make sure their investment are secured since they can't control the flow of bitcoin then it's better they join the trends.",
