All of this may have happened because of the loss of confidence in projects with a background in Finance, which have a very high APY.",

There are over 20000 cryptocurrencies and many of them are not good coins to hold. Many of them do not have utility purpose. But luna is just one of its kind and a present failed project which could later inceease in price there is nothing impossible.

The reality is they want to mimic what Satoshi did which is not applicable in this era anymore. We want transparency and as much as possible we want to know them using means like video calls or other options. It would be best to stay on those kind of projects. There might be some anonymous teams who are doing great in this NFT era but there is the risk factor included in it which is rugpull anytime.",

A rug pull is when a team or a single dev of a project is suddenly removing all the liquidity from a pool on sushiswap or pancakeswap for example which means the token can not be traded anymore and the scammer has more of the token that was paired with his own rug pull token for example ETH or USDT or something like that.The Devs of Terra Luna did no rug pull. The sell pressure on UST just became to high so it could not hold it's peg to real USD anymore. This then caused the panic selling of a lot of nervous investors which of course made things only worse and lead to the complete downfall of the Terra ecosystem. If we have months or even years of a bear market ahead of us, then i am sure that a lot of smaller projects will have a hard time to survive.",

It seems some people use rugpull or \"to rug\" as a synonym for a price crash of coins or tokens.Apart from that we are in a bear market. It might go on for another 6 months, maybe even longer. After that we will see whether we have new innovations that can fuel another bull cycle or not. Stablecoin regulation might be coming soon too, which could be another problem for crypto in general.",

It's obvious to be a rugpull but the team keeps on blaming it on the whales who bought the coin at a cheaper price, then sold it after it was pumped. Yet, they discontinue the project and just gone declaring bankruptcy. The key not to be traced was being anonymous. We don't have any idea where he is. This is just the beginning. More will come.",
