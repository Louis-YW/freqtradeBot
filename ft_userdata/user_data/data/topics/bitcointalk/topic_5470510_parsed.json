      "body": "When I first read this circular when it was sent to me by my bank,  one thing that came to my mind was,  why didn't the CBN circular complaints all the names and list of that category that got this forex bailout,  and the sad thing is that this market has been blocked since 2015, this is the result of bad policy from the past CBN governors. Just like what the immediate CBN did on the issues with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in Nigeria,  he made a hasty decision by blocking banks from carrying out direct bank crypto transactions and this has limited a lot of development in the area of blockchain-based development and digital creation within Nigeria.",

The decision of our leaders most times are not being reasonable due to the some fact that they'll benefit from it, they just removed the FX restriction on some item we hope they also remove that of crypto currency.",
