What strategies do you have for newbies whose start up capital is a way lower than $1,000? Will they have to borrow to have upto $5,000?Again if they buy red color with 2% and it keeps going red red and red, what should happen?",

Will they have to borrow to have upto $5,000?Again if they buy red color with 2% and it keeps going red red and red, what should happen?U can start with even 100$ if you do it right there is no problems2% of 100 $ is 2$  there is a month at least one bigger green day you can sell it.even more of them in bear market and in bull marketNow look at  30 days a month each probably maximum you can buy in with 2%  is 15 days.15x2 exacly 30 but each month there is futures options so one big move always will be.If you have capital of 100$ then you can have only 1 coin under ur management.200$ u can have 2 coins  300$ you can have 3 coins until 1000$ u only use 2% each by counting 2% of the 100$ so until 1000$ u have 10 coins under your AUM you still use 2$  for each coin each red day.By this calculation you have money always left 20-25% after you overbought all dips small ones and big ones.Off course uf u hold short position with small leverage then it will act as hedge insurance against sudden fall Do the math you cant get wrong with it.I put the food on your plate i serve i explain and how to eat i give my hand to drive fork and spoon towards to ur mouth and u still complain even if i do explain  Its not about easy its about math and logic nothing genius here just the way how it is",

BTW, what food are you putting on the table if I may ask? You just painted a hypothetical scenario in theory and you're already gloating like someone who has a wand? Hello?Quote from: KingsDen on July 31, 2022, 01:30:30 PMAgain if they buy red color with 2% and it keeps going red red and red, what should happen?OP, you may want to look at that question and answer. I can only guess you missed it the first time and that it wasn't a deliberate omission.",

      "body": "If you are a newbie, it is not recommended if you are trading with 5 coins because that can make you confused to watch the price move. You can be too late to decide whether to buy or sell the coins. I prefer to recommend 1-2 coins as you are still a newbie with little experience in trading. The case will be different if you have much experience and with $5k to trade, I am sure you will make a big profit from each coin.As a newbie, using $50-$100 will be enough to learn the trading basics and practice the analysis you already learned. It will give you some time to understand how the market moves. Until you can gain more experience from trading, you can add more funds to trade and get more profit if your analysis is right.",

You mean trading with as low as $100 is simple? and going down to $50 also? Bitcoin price can get to any low so as you speculate for bull also you consider bear, that time when price goes down and cause panic in the market.",

As for the new traders, you're telling them to leverage even it's just 3x, it's not advisable to them to jump off quickly for it.",
