  "content": "Hello.  I am based in the U.S. and want to trade these bitcoin cryptocurrencies.   I cannot find a U.S. based broker from my searches that offers these for trade.  What is a reputable broker I can trust to trade these?  I am not inclined to open an off shore account unless it is absolutely the only option.  Thanks for any advice.",
