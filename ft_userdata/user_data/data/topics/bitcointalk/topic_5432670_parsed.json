Lead generation is a term used to describe the process of identifying potential customers whomight be interested in a specific product or service. It's all about creating relationships between businesses and potentialcustomers that will drive sales. For example, if we offer alternative lending services to small business owners, we'd wantto target those businesses specifically in order to generate leads.How Can Lead Generation Help Us Make Money?Lead generation helps in two key ways: firstly, it allows us to identify potential customers who are likely to be interested in our products or services; secondly, it makes it easier for us to reach out and connect with those potential customers.By leveraging lead generation strategies such as social media campaigns,email marketing, content marketing, and more, we can quickly build relationships with customers who are likely to beinterested in our offerings. Another great benefit of lead generation is that it gives us valuable insights into customer behavior.By tracking customer interactions through our lead generation campaigns, we can gain valuable insights into what kind ofcontent resonates best with our target audience as well as which channels are most effective at driving conversions.This information can then be used to refine our marketing strategies and ensure they remain effective over time.Market Researchhttps://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/08/24/2503924/0/en/Loan-Brokers-Market-Expected-to-Reach-1-061-79-Billion-By-2031-Allied-Market-Research.htmlAccording to Allied Market ResearchLoan Brokers Market Expected to Reach 1.06 trillion By 2031. Loan brokers have good access to a large number of lendersand possess chances of getting good deals on loans, thereby driving the growth of the global loan brokers market. Furthermore,loan brokers provide the best loans to borrowers based on their financial requirements and this will boost the global markettrends. Based on region, North America contributed toward the highest market share in 2021.There are companies offering training programs on how to start A business loan broker (Lead Generation) at a premiumprice ranging from $3k - $68k! I have listed a few links for you to see and know that this opportunity is no joke. These companiesare charging so high cause they know that the return on investment for the investors is unlimited in the Alternative Lending Industry.Here are the links to companies offering the programs with  premium price tags:https://commercialloanbrokerinstitute.com/training-program/https://commercialcapitaltraining.com/finance-program/your-investment/gold-program/https://commercialcapitaltraining.com/finance-program/your-investment/platinum-program/https://businesslendingblueprint.com/  ($3,000+)https://loanbrokernetwork.com/  ($$$$)Even Shark Tank Investors are in the Alternative Lending IndustryKevin O’Leary - https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATyaUQJMmgIBarbara Corcoran - https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKFh8Z3TAskKevin Harrington - https://loanbrokernetwork.com/loan-brokerAfter checking out those links, I hope you all are fired up and bursting with excitement now that you know howserious this business is! Only we determine what success looks like in this industry!OriginationYou all can call me IAN, my background is in IT/Telecom. I started investing in crypto back in 2017 and got discouraged in 2018 LOL.If I have known better, I should have done DCA and kept accumulating HOLO, Stellar, MANA, and more, then I would have reached Forbesmagazine during the last bull run.  Smiley But I learned from the experience and made a decent profit last 2021 and I was able to venture into otherinvestments outside crypto using the gains I made.I continue to look for opportunities  online that can generate profit by spending time searching online, and that is how I encounter LeadGeneration for Alternative lending. I actually bought a training program from one of the lists above that cost thousands to buy but it was worth it.I just started to apply what I have learned about the training and through testing and analysis, I found out there is a way to fast-track to gainmassive returns.The more funds we spend on ads the faster the return is, and the thought of a crypto community pitching in pops up in my head and that's howI got here presenting the opportunity to you all and hoping some of you are on board. This is truly a great opportunity for a long-term investment,I am pretty sure a lot of us here are tired of chasing hype tokens that are just a pump n dump.PrososalThis will be a community-driven project We will create a native token that is programmed to send token rewards of the community's choice. The commissions for EACHloan deal from the leads we provided to the lender's partner range from 2.5%-10%. 40% will go to the lender's partner and 60% of thecommission will be used to buy back the native tokens and keep sending them to the burn address until we hit the community's goal for themax supply that we will keep in circulation.The community will decide the name of the token and the tokenomics for the native token.  I would suggest a higher tax rate for LP and rewardssince this will be for diamond hands and we don't need volumes from crypto investors. The volume for the rewards and burn will be coming from thecommissions we earn from the deals that are successfully funded. Each deal can make up to a couple thousand to tens of thousands due to the typeof loans that we are engaging. Business loan amounts range from 20k+ to 1-10s of millions and I have seen this on the group I am a member withfrom the program I bought. A 2k+ budget for ads to generate leads is already good enough to see some good returns, If more will participate thehigher budget we can have for monthly ads, the higher the returns which means the faster we see our trading volumes increase and rewards distributed.I want you all to let that sink in! We don't need volumes from crypto investors which is the major issue with a lot of cryptos that kill their projectsdue to the lack of traction and volumes cause they don't have real use cases.ConclusionLead generation offers a valuable opportunity for anyone looking to get into the alternative lending space. Not only does it allow us to easily targetpotential customers who may be interested in our products or services, but it also provides valuable insights into customer behavior which can helprefine our marketing strategies over time. So, if you're considering a long-term investment, alternative lending is the way, now is a perfect time!This is the Most Demanded Product Ever.Money is the best product we can ever offer to others in the market.
