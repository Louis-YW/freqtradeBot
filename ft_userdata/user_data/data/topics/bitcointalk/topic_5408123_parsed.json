The reason I’m saying this because of your conditions. When someone meet your conditions there’s no need to use your services in order to get that limited account back. And probably you take payment before completing your service right?",

And probably you take payment before completing your service right?For me need your advice here, and many offer such a service, you can’t even imagine this in a nightmare.These services have been relevant for more than 12 years, if it were not relevant, no one would offer such a service. I will not explain to an incompetent person how it works, you think like a small boy/girl, not understanding the essence of the service.Good luck",
