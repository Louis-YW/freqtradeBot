Sorry can't help you there, There is no way of holding the hackers wallet so they probably cash out the bitcoin from their address or move it to other wallet. I checked the link and you were logged in from a phishing link from telegram. That is a huge mistake to click on unknown links from telegram or anywhere, now you paid for that mistake. You have got some replies on your thread in gambling section maybe you can check them out, try to do something, but I think there is nothing you can do now.",

I was hacked for $9k back in 2018, and I was able to track the coins to Mercatox, where the scammer's account was frozen, and Mercatox returned the portion of coins that were not yet sold. Not every exchange will help you out like that, in fact, my case was probably a pretty rare exception, but keep faith if you can keep a track on the coins. You'll need to act fast too in explaining things to the exchange where the coins end up (and this is all assuming that they do end up on an exchange), so it might be helpful to have your message pre-written out and ready to send so you can spring into action if the opportunity arises. Good luck!",

No people could help you if you are legitimately been hacked by some unknown hackers around and even stake supports cannot retrieve that if the hacker successfully withdrawn your money since there's no dispute on crypto.  Much better slowly learn to move on since unfortunate incident happened already and be careful next time since there are so many desperate criminals finding some ways to suck the money of innocent individual.",

It is nice you have opened a ticket with tether to start up with your case. I think with the amount involved, they would give you attention so as to fast track the whereabouts of your funds to recovering them for you but you will have to be patient as the circumstances surrounding your account getting hacked is some how. Of lately, hacking has been a common thing and the hackers have been doing away with it and no one can trace their activities. Money lost accounts gone and hackers can no be apprehended and brought to book to face justice. This is Crypto for you.Lastly, OP you have already created a topic for this related issue why not continue the conversation there than creating a new thread.",

AFAIK being reckless doesn't give the right to anyone to steal you. the problem arose due to his (OP) mistake. No one (Stake in this case) can take care of the safe behaviour of all its users and bear their losses because they were careless. what would it look like, millions of users simply don't have to worry about security because someone else will cover it for them.I am speaking to you as someone who was a victim of a hack myself with a somewhat greater loss than what is said here.viewed from the casino's point of view, another doubt may arise here, whether the OP was really hacked and someone else withdrew his funds. it is also difficult to prove.I'm not trying to defend the casino, but just a bit of reality. in the end, it doesn't have to be a casino, for example, would you ask Coinbase to participate in covering the loss because their user was hacked and his account was emptied?Quote from: Saint-loup on February 26, 2023, 07:17:00 PMThis casino doesn't ask to be a security expert or at least to be an educated crypto user to register.

So them changing security procedures after it happened to me for these amounts when it had already happened for less to other people is extremely annoying as well. People making comments like they have no responsibilty for their clients money or making sure people aren't stolen from is kind of amusing. They have to safe guard ppls money as much as they can and they haven't even bothered to update security that had been violated numerous times in months leading up this.with the knowledge that they have many security failures months ago and so many accusations, in addition to all that, to continue to keep such a large amount with them is, in my opinion, extremely irresponsible.",
