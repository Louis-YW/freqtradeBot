Last week one of my friends lost his job after working in the same company for a decade. His life abruptly changed, putting him in a place where he could not support his family. If you were him, how would you survive this tough time ?

A little cooking skill just cooking street food may just be his savior. Your friend will survive. He'd be lucky if he isn't a father yet in this ridiculously made up crisis time. I have seen this happening when my brother lost his job as well with 2 kids still and a mortgage to pay, it's a pain for a father to see themselves this low because he is unprepared for what's to come. If he had just saved something, maybe he wouldn't have had to ask for a loan to start a small business.",

What about you ?It is my conviction that life operates in cycles, and as such, we cannot expect things to remain in a constant state of abundance. The adage from \"The Richest Man in Babylon\" rings true: \"If you cannot save money, the seed of greatness is not in you.\" Therefore, it is wise to exercise prudence in managing one's finances and to save during times of prosperity.This practice can serve as a lifeline during times of financial hardship when one's sources of income may become limited or depleted. In essence, by cultivating a habit of saving, one can fortify their financial stability and prepare for unforeseen circumstances.",

Growth from employee wages take a crap ton of time and effort for it to increase.Exactly. You should have at least half a year's worth of salaries for emergencies, not to mention a whole year to be on the safe side. Saving is vital if you wish to have purchasing power at any moment and have money set aside for emergency purposes. Thus, it's important to have various sources of income, which could be a side job as little as being paid by signature campaigns; that way, you'll still have a flow of money supposing you lose your job, like the OP mentioned about his acquaintance, which will provide you with some peace of mind till you can find something else.",

They say it’s an after effect of Covid, who knows, maybe these companies are planning on replacing human workforce with AI.  Learning a skill now will be difficult without a means to support himself and family. Doesn’t your friend has savings? It’s fishy living on one source of income. There are side-hustles and investments he could try like investing in real estate, airbnbs, vending machine business. If I were in your friend’s shoes, I would start mass applying for jobs and update my resume to meet criteria of the role. The last thing you want to do after being laid off is take a break.",

And not only saving but we also have to set aside money to invest in our future. and don't forget to prepare an emergency fund too early on. but about the friend that OP told me about, I hope he will be given severance pay from his original company. and your friends can use the severance pay as capital to start a small business or to look for another job. because the current conditions force us to be able to continue to make money to survive.",

My suggestion is this help your friend to gain new skills, learning something new can give him a chance to get back his roots or his job after this financial crisis.",

You have learnt from your friends experience @OP, prepare and plan for the rainy days because the rainy days will always come. It sounds really sad when you think about it but when things are going merry, never forget to plan for the days that things appear thick. That is is the circle of life, the difficult situations help you appreciate the good times. Your friends life has not ended until he decides he wants to quit, people have been in his similar situation and even worse and are doing better today still, he just has to get himself together and plan well with his wife.He can take loan from close friends and family to start up something if possible, that is if there is already a plan to start one but money has been a hindrance. He can also declutter and sell off somethings that his family can do without for the time being to raise money, these are just a few options.",
