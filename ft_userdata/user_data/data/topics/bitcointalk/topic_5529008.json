      "body": "the words buying and 'trading to acquire' mean the same thing, as the acquire part indicates a buy, not a sellbut just the word 'trading' is the action of selling or buying which is where it discusses 2 people trading (the buyer and seller)but just the word 'trading' is the action of selling and buying which is where it discusses 1 repeatedly trading (buy low sell high repeat)seems you are now asking silly questions google can tell you answers to in seconds in regard to grammar and definitions. please use a dictionary and not spam the forumas for today \"buying at a fixed price\"people (mostly wealthy people) dont use publicly open exchanges to trade, but instead do private deals using contracts which stipulate a fixed pricefor instance doing a deal with a mining pool or an asic farm, whereby a investor does a contract to pay fiat upfront to cover the miners costs, to then be given any/all/some of the block rewards for the next X months at y fixed rateother things called 'darkpools'(not confused with darknet), OTC platforms, private contract brokers. allow for private trades to be done to buy or sell outside of public price discovering exchange markets",

There are a couple of major things that actually differentiates them and one of them is actually risk to reward ratio. You will find out that buying bitcoin puts you in a position of way lower risk in term of profit and loss compared to trading. In addition to this, you need to be able to make proper analysis to be able to get the most out of your bitcoin trades compared to just buying and hodling.Nevertheless in general hodling bitcoin is way more easier than buying bitcoins. This is the reason why most people prefer to just buy rather than taking risks they can't guarantee by trading it when they don't have sufficient knowledge about it.",

If early buyers were able to make a decent profit, then following their strategy isn’t a bad idea.At the end of the day, only you know your own skills in investing. But like I said, keep it simple, buy and hold. It’s a proven strategy that has made investors profitable, especially those who trust Bitcoin and don’t panic when the market goes bearish.",

So, whatever is the best way for you to have bitcoin then you do it. If it means you buying using your fiat, just do it. But if you have a better strategy by trading it with someone with whatever you own in exchange of Bitcoin then you have to do it as well.Quote from: robertcarlyle on February 05, 2025, 03:34:56 AMHow did \"buying\" bitcoin a really long time ago change from how today people buy it at a fixed price?

Your questions are not well aligned, you should have make it proper for people to understand. However, the question I expected you to ask as a newbie on the crypto space is \"bitcoin investment and trading which is the best to do\". Buying and selling is also part of trading because you send to someone and get fiat, so it's called trade.If you looking forward to make gains through Bitcoin, you must invest for long term, maybe 2 circles or more.",

Maybe you should clarify the exact question you would ask since you cannot do trade if you don't buy Bitcoin.But will assume that you talk about long term holding or HODL vs Trading.Long term holding require patience or consistency since the only thing you need here is to buy Bitcoin at whatever price it reach. Your primary target is to accumulate as many Bitcoins as you can since usually the target years set by people engaging with this type of invest will last minimum to 4 years and maximum to 10 years.Trading usually it goes with short term activities and I'm not actually comfortable trading Bitcoin for short term since usually we would never get any good result with it. But if you want to try just to experience things maybe try to work with those things and see for yourself on what methods or investment type you want to execute.",

Bitcoin isn't bought at a fixed price,  the price varies due to the increase in the value as the day goes by, buy Bitcoin differs from trading Bitcoin,  you only trade it on trading platforms and exchanges but you can buy from individuals and on those trading platforms too.When buying on the trading platforms you see the real time price as it moves with the variations and you can actually convert from one cryptocurrency to another on those platforms before and after trading,  but with buying you just acquire these assets and keep in your wallet and you get only small effects of the market volatiles affecting your assets when volatility is high but while trading u experience it real time, so the difference is just clear.",

Buying Bitcoin and trading it is interrelated but doesn't actually mean one side because we have people who loves trading and we also have people who do more of storing Bitcoin, so both parties couldn't have attained any Bitcoin without buying it, so the only way for a trader to do their trading is after they bought Bitcoin while the holders also buys Bitcoin but with no intention of selling it as soon as they bought it. However I don't remember the days you are talking about only buying Bitcoin for others to trade for them, it has never been a custom for Bitcoin but is only for individuals who had the need to.",

You might have gotten a bit of confused, I guess you mean buying Bitcoin (HODL) and trading (leverage) “acquire” means to (own) which involves holding Bitcoin, whereas trading involves both buying and selling of Bitcoin, you trade, buy or sell to make profit, basically when the price is low (buy) and sell when the price is high (sell).Therefore, if you're looking for the best way to profit from Bitcoin, HODL got you covered. Don't trade leverage if you are a newbie, leverage is meant for experience and pro traders.",

Trading bitcoin with someone on the other hand means agreeing on price with that person. Long time ago people mostly traded bitcoin with each other at prices they agreed on mostly online. This was because there were no big websites to buy and sell bitcoin safely. As time passed these websites appeared making it easier and safer to buy and sell bitcoin at fixed prices which is how most people do it today.",

Trading and investing are different, if you are engaging in the margin, leveraged and futures markets, you are trading. This is different from buying on the spot market or directly into your wallet. In the former, you risk losing all your money to liquidation if the price moves too much against your position. But in Investing, you can never lose all your money even if your asset devalues and it will gain back for you if it moves above your buying price.QuoteHow did \"buying\" bitcoin a really long time ago change from how today people buy it at a fixed price?This is a good question which shows you are thoughtful. Bitcoin moves in price and the lower the price, the cheaper it is and the more money you can make from it. For this, Bitcoin is better bought in the past than now and it becomes riskier to buy with decreased possible gains as it progresses.",

The thing is most members here or on the crypto space have usually tried to separate the two with buying simply means you purchase and hold for a longer period of time while the regard trading as the buying and selling over a short period of time like daily, weekly, monthly and so on not just having hodl. Also the word trading most used by traders here are for most likely future trading or leverage trading which I think is what OP is on about.For me the better option between the two (buying and trading) is basically buying which means you hodl your coins for as long as you want, as long as it is a coin like bitcoin which promises profits after long term hold the risk of losing is definitely so minimal. As for trading it is way too risky and more so not a place for a newbie without knowledge most especially those leverage trading",
