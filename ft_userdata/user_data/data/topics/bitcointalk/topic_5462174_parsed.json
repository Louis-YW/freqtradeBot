      "body": "Firstly, this is not only the problem on Indians, the condition is just same all over the world.That is why they are called as influencers, they have the power to manipulate mass people into their way of interest for two reasons, one is they may get financial benefits, or they don't know anything at all.Actually, India is not really worse in the adoption rate as per the reportSource: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/But we can do a lot better if government try to be supportive for crypto investors instead of hammering them with 30% tax.Finally, about the YouTubers there are some really knowledge ones too, but they don't have huge subscriber count as others but they know about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, so you are looking at wrong persons.",

All these create a negative aura around bitcoin and people can then not think of buying cryptos. Also, another fact is the cyclic nature of bitcoin itself. Indians always have that tendency to be very safe with their money. For them even stock markets was for long just a way of losing money and most of the people started investing in last 4-5 years only. So cryptos which gives quick returns but also falls very quickly is a nightmare.",

But unfortunately Indian government is quite negative about cryptocurrency and had imposed 30% tax on it. Honestly I didn't sell my bitcoins after this law came into effect. So with this mindset of the government, adoption cannot grow. However, India has a good amount of population of cryptocurrency users. But they want to keep it secret because of all these nonsense tax imposition.",

Many believe it is a bubble that will explode when it is ripe. Many are not capable enough to understand its technology and many do not have the capability to use it in their favour. That I believe is the most significant reason people in India stay away from crypto. The next probable reason is the government of India which has now made it look like an illegal technology by using mainstream media. In the end, the new tax slab is another reason why people in India are afraid in investing in crypto",

      "body": "India is a combination of different people with a lot of differences in religion, beliefs, and ethnicity. There is more than one reason why Indians are not investing in crypto. The first being without crypto investment people are still coming out of poverty. This is nothing but upskilling and uplifting everyone with the government policy. Another reason is crypto is not easy to understand for everyone in India. Being Indian does not mean everyone here has a technological understanding. That being said according to a survey a lot of crypto investors in India are from the age bracket of 20 to 25 years. We cannot expect the generation above 50 to understand cryptocurrency now and neither they will agree to it. There are a few who are still tech-savvy and do know the benefits. We need another 5 years and you would see a lot of change. I strongly believe the government policy would change and more Indians would be into crypto. All we need to do is wait and watch as this is not America or a European country.",

If every Indian woman reveals the amount of gold they have then it would be more than the US reserve. Yes, I agree Indians do not buy gold for an ROI but as per my understanding, this gold is kept as a reserve in case of financial emergency. I still believe the only reason we Indians do not invest in crypto is because of the risk. As an Indian, I am aware of a few friends who are aware of Bitcoin but won't risk an investment.

The first thing they do is find a decent job and after that take life insurance. Some of them do take medical insurance apart from what the company is providing them. Then they start with SIP wherein they set a goal for every SIP, an example of a goal: a bike, a downpayment/full payment for a car, and a down payment for a house. When they reach middle age they are surrounded by EMI which barely gives them any space to think about other investment options. At this age they have kids and they want their kids to have good education. The next set of SIPs is for their kid's higher studies, although in order to have higher education they would need an education loan. The SIPs only provide support for the education expenses of the kid. By the time they are free of all kinds of burden they retire and does not want their retirement amount to be invested in private bank or mutual funds. They would invest in schemes run by the government. How can you then ask them to invest in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies? The trend is changing but it will take another decade for Indians to go neck deep into Bitcoin investment.",

But, like me there are others who have questioned the existing financial system and have joined the Bitcoin band wagon. There are others who by taking risk have made a good amount of money through trading. There are people in our country who have started investing in cryptocurrency and this number will increase gradually. The problem that the upcoming generation is facing is uncertainty. Only the government can give more clarity and when it happens we might see a good amount of Indians investing in Bitcoin or other crypto.",
