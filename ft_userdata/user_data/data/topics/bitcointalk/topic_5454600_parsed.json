Let me explain it by my own experience on latest attempt to have business with CEX (I don't want to give it an add or spoil the impression so I will avoid to give the exact name for them). From the very beginning I knew absolutely nothing about how and what is bitcoin. So to give it a try I've put not more than 20USD into CEX and made several transactions with newly created account. That was the case when I saw the fee going up to 8-10$ to complete transactions by moving out assets or transferring them. So I had an idea that moving huge amount of assets on the blockchain could potentially solve the issue. As anyone could see there were quite big transactions made by US authorities recently. It even affected bitcoin rate for a short period and everyone has seen it at the market. Suppose I accumulate enough assets in bitcoin so that a need will occur to spend or transfer it for some reason will it be independent on the fee amount to save the earned or we have to feed miners with fee that will rise along with bitcoin value? More is the price - more fee you have to pay?",

If bitcoin prices do rise, then the fee in USD will also rise, because the fee is not calculated in USD but it is calculated in Bitcoin. Since the value of your bitcoin holdings will also rise this will not affect you at all. What you can also check is the transaction prices and how they changed in the past. There were already several halvings and still the transaction price is pretty low. This is also because the bitcoin payment system is constantly improved. So in my opinion you should not worry about that.",

If technically Bitcoin developers can reduce size of transaction, with a same fee rate, transaction fee will become lower or the same even if Bitcoin price is higher.QuoteCould it decline the profit in bitcoin investment to the extent when we are not able to pay the gas anymore?It is always a problem if you have too small bitcoin capital. If you have a big capital enough, transaction fee will not be what you care. Like if you have $1000 in bitcoin, $1 or $5 will be transaction fee you can afford to spend. It is not a good transaction fee with many people, I know.If you care about transaction fee, want to save it as most as possible. Use Segwit address (Bech32m, bc1q). Consolidate inputs when fee is cheap because later with less inputs as 1 input, your transaction will have smaller size that is helpful to save transaction fee [1]. Make your transactions in weekends when fees are cheapest compare to other days each week.[1] Transaction size calculatorshttps://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-transaction-size-calculator/https://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/",

Only thing that does that is congestion on the mempool like we have seen in the last few weeks. Transaction fees are only high during halving or after it, because of the bull run and this means many investors would have met there profit limit and the massive withdrawal of funds then leads to congestion which in turn leads to higher transaction fee. Apart from that the transaction fee remains unaffected.",

There's a variation, but bitcoin is the one that really decides whether a transaction fees would rise, not the other way around. And there are other reasons why transaction fees increase too, just like what I said about the Ordinals, it could increase due to high volume of transactions brought about by network congestions, among others (I forgot the other reasons lmao), this I think is a little token of gratitude we pay for these miners who helped bitcoin.

More is the price - more fee you have to pay?Two points that may help to answer your question:- Gas is not the term used for Bitcoin. The concept is similar, though it's not the same. Bitcoin charges satoshi (sats) per byte for network fees that are incurred on transactions. You do not need to pay a higher fee for the transaction to be confirmed, and the transaction will not be dropped if the fee is low. It will stay in the mempool until the network will confirm it. - The fees will not nullify your Bitcoin unless you choose to pay a high network fee while network fees are high. This usually happens when the price spikes. So, the best way to mitigate this is to keep a small portion (1/20 of your holdings) in a CEX or 10-20% in a P2P exchange so that you can still take advantage of high prices without having to pay for high network fees to move coins there during price peaks. Bitcoin fees have never really effected anyone with more than 0.1 BTC, who are trying to sell during peaks. If you have a significant amount you should not need to worry. What you should worry about is keeping your coins secure in a self-custodial wallet.",
