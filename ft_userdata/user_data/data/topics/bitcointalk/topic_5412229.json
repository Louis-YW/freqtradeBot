In the country where I live, there are local sellers who only have wallets on the exchanges where they have a single address that they can't change and they take all the bitcoin they buy at one address. Which means that if there are many transfers that reach that address, there is a hypothesis that the banned member is a reseller who buys Bitcoin from the suspicious member every week. As long as this hypothesis exists, it is not possible to confirm the connection between the two accounts based on transactions only.Of course, almost all of us are sure that the two accounts belong to one person, but from the point of view of the moderators, all possible assumptions must be taken into account so that no one is wronged.",

But sending your weekly paycheck to someone else's account does not make much sense, either, unless it is a very close friend or family member or you know them very well and trust them with your money.

Do you have any evidence to back this up? Is it someone you got in touch with through the forum or in some other way? Do you know him personally?Its not confusing at all. You have no authority here, and they owe you no answer. If you feel this person committed a sin of some kind, either report them to the mods or leave the appropriate feedback and move on.",

Most chance are there for this account to be OP's alt or friend or something because this is their 1st post on this reputation board on the exact same day when OP is inactive.",

But the irony of the matter is some of the accounts hunting for alt accounts are actually alts who might want to rank-up in a more smart way. Again, if they report to moderators, moderators will surely dismiss the report as bad because the evidences presented are not clear enough. When they decide to tag such accounts, the feedback won't have effects because they are not on DT.I believe this is the reason they create topics upon topics for similar cases trying to drag the attention of DT members to do the tagging. I saw one the other day who has not made any other post than commanding DT members around to do the investigation and tagging for them.",
