It's not a pressure for you to try increasing that amount and at the end, you have less than your initial amount.",

There are certain things in life that one has to keep private but three among them are the most important. These three are your earnings, your next plan and of course your investment. We live in a society where we are surrounded by enemies who do not like seeing others to prosper. Revealing your earnings, plan and investment to public is unhealthy either online or offline. You might become a target for evil minded.Those influencials elite that media is publishing their net worths have been a victim one way or another either having more enemies or criminal attacks on their companies.",

If they announces how do you know is the exact of what they said?So it's better to stay private than exposing oneself of the total amounts you (we) are holding. Although there are few people here who don't own enough volume of bitcoin rather just some fractions they got from few task over here so these sets of people may easily open up with their holdings since they attach no much value rather than selling for some personal expenses.",

Not even the last one. I'm still proud though. I mean if we pull out numbers I reckon holders would be at the top (single digit) % among the entire population of the world.
