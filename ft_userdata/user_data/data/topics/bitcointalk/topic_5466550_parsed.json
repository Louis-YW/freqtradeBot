While some months i've learned how to code Pine Script on Tradingview and backtest with it. But i can't get good results even if many combination of indicators.    When i look at past data manually, it works smoothly but this data retrospective and indicators can't drawn in future. I wonder is there anyone who succeed on trading with indicator/combination of indicator/special strategy.I'm open to discuss all ideas.",

If you win, you close the position. If you are losing, you will wait until your indicators tell you to increase the leverage. You can start a trade with 0.2x and increased it to 1x. That is averaging.Averaging may still fail, you need to not let emotion to control you. Trade with the amount of money that you can afford to lose.",

You must have thought that by doing TA (Technical Analysis) you can predict or guess the future price of some token easily. But the prediction of the market is not solely dependent on TA instead you have to do FA. And if you think that QuoteWhen I look at past data manually, Past data works fine for you then you should follow the methods that work for you. But keeping an eye on the Fundamental elements is most necessary. As if I am trading in BTC then I prefer to be dependent on FA more and less on TA. But just clarify, if this idea works for me then it does not mean that it will also work for you too. We all have different mindsets and different solutions to problems. Then try to do it your own way and do not rely solely on TA or any indicator. Because at the start things are not that straight that you just have to draw some lines here and there and you can time the market accurately.",

      "body": "Whenever there are big investors coming, it's somehow difficult to see the patterns of the indicator's reaction. Normally when RSI says oversold, it has to bounce but it just keeps rolling down, and comparing it to its previous bear market, it's not following the timeline. The market is unpredictable and you'd be surprised if it is instead dwindling down while you go long.Combined with more indicators, you may find yourself analyzing it too much when in fact you just have to wait and hold. Having too many indicators will prevent you from executing your trade for you will overly analyze the market. They call it Analysis paralysis.",

For example you will be riding on the market like you are on the sky with some gadgets giving you hint on where you are, that is just like trading with the right kind of indicators but to cluster your trade with indicators is to confuse yourself. It is better with few combination of indicators than to cluster yourself with indicators.",

Generally, indicators are not useless rather your profitability can depend on how well you use or apply them to your chart. For instance, I love using Fibbo and RSI indicators. Just by merely looking at the Chart using the market structure and patterns you would have difficulty identifying when the market is oversold or overbought but using an indicator like the RSI spares you that stress, and there is even a way you can twist the settings to your benefit.",

Most of the time you should not be fooled by the indicators as not of the indicators guarantee efficient results. If the indicators and your implementation have not worked for a long time maybe there is a need for an upgrade in the strategy, or maybe according to the market sentiments you need to review the strategy.If still does not work buddy you should add a few points to track a few of your old trades and try to analyze what's going wrong, One of the points you are already following asking for mentorship or guidance, lastly you can even consider the diversification on a single position.",

Via pure guess? Via intuition and guts? Of course you would really be needing on having that kind of tools or whatever you would really be using which you would really be needing on making use of these technical indicators or else you would really be just simply doing gambling if you do have that kind of behavior on doing trades without using any of those. The most common things which you could really be able to make use in speaking about analysis then it would be TA+FA and since this market cant really be having that news or sentiments anytime then this is the time you would really be using about technicals. It doesnt works? Yes not all the time but taking up some entries and exits basing up on those indicators is much more better rather than on making positions without any basis because it is really just that pure gambling.Bare in mind that it doesnt really give out guarantees that those analysis would be precise or not, market is unpredictable always because if those indicators shows precise analysisthen all of those people who do know on making use of it would be rich by now.",

In my opinion. Let's say there are 1000 people who that believe when ema 100 crosses above ema 200 is bullish or what we usually call the golden cross when there are a lot of people who believe it tends to bring the prices up. so when people do not believe it much or there is another thing the golden cross could actually fail.
