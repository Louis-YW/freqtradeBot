  "content": "Everybody believed that when Craig Wright made his wrong cryptographic proof he was cheating. But this was a deliberate hoax, making a fool of us all. The video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIvqn87iAz8  reveals it all (but apparently nobody understood what he was saying):One needs to look at the message he claimed to sign but didn't sign:\"  Wright, it is not the same as if I sign Craig Wright, Satoshi.\\n\\n\"which was a variant of the message by Sartre by which he refused to take the Nobel prize:It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-PaulSartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\"So in essence he was a saying: If I sign the message that I'm Satoshi, then I betray myself because then I'm no longer the person I was before. I refuse to sign.So he didn't cheat because he didn't have a key, but because it is against his anti-authoritarian conviction.This doesn't prove of course that he has the keys, and doesn't prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, but for me the mindset this is coming might indicate he may indeed be Satoshi Nakamoto.",

This argument that intentionally refusing to prove to be Satoshi proves being Satoshi is just totally devoid of logic. It's just some mental gymnastics for CWS cultists.",

He should live by what he talks about – \"There is no glorious leader\" but was actively parading himself as Satoshi. When people called his bluff, he should have submitted a valid proof instead of looking for loopholes in a word game. This should be the end of all Craig Wright shenanigans since it's obvious that he can't walk the talk.Conversations involving Craig Wright, Roger ver about Bitcoin are unnecessary in 2023.",
