  "content": "In October 2020, I almost fell victim to this Ponzi scheme. Someone who I looked up to was one of those who promoted and endorsed this scheme. He and his clique of friends had made it big. Some had bought exotic cars, acquired some landed properties in the city and even gotten married. I admired them. Who wouldn't? They were young and rich. Of course, at the time, I never knew it was a Ponzi Scheme. One thing that discouraged me was that I hate any referral-based project or any project that was promoted with the keyword \"make money\". I had learned my lesson from MMM, a Ponzi scheme that was so popular in 2011 but crashed in 2016. I would later find out that Forsage was a Ponzi scheme. Today, I read on the internet that theSEC had charged 11 people in alleged $300 million crypto Ponzi scheme.  Guess which Ponzi Scheme? That's right.QuoteThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday filed a civil complaint charging 11 people for their roles in creating and promoting an allegedly fraudulent crypto-focused pyramid scheme that raised more than $300 million from investors.The scheme, called Forsage, claimed to be a decentralized smart contract platform, and it allowed millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the ethereum, tron and binance blockchains. But under the hood, the SEC alleges that for more than two years, the setup functioned like a standard pyramid scheme, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the operation. Last month, I received a WhatsApp message from this friend I admired a lot. He asked me to join a group which I did. Apparently, they have rebranded and are now called Meta FORCE. Pretty much the same model and modus operandi with Forsage.When I protested my inability to recruit anyone he forwarded the following as a means to persuade or better still motivate me. It is crazy how this guys never relent. I already saw a thread on the forum from a newbie asking questions about this project. I hope everyone becomes aware of this scam project. My question. Can the SEC go ahead to investigate and charge the folks who are playing several roles in creating and promoting this fraudulent crypto-focused pyramid scheme now before it crashes?Please move the topic if it is not in the right board. Thank you.",

Show them how they operate and see what happens next. I've done the same thing before and they were quick enough to post a memo warning people not to invest in that ponzi group I reported. I'm just not sure if they were able to apprehend the main people behind the scheme and their promoters.About your friend, I would probably tell him directly that it's a ponzi scheme and explain why. He might react in a negative way but he'll stop inviting you. That could affect your friendship though",

The issue probably comes with trying to investigate and find people (especially if they're using WhatsApp).The other issue with this is it just stops one ponzi scheme from continuing, it does nothing to eliminate the others that might open up in its place (possibly with teams close to the ones thst could be prosecuted - it might also not even touch the schemes inner circle of scammers either).",

If SEC investigates and ascertain that they have a case to answers, a warrant of arrest would be issued. If they are found anywhere in the world and such nation has extradition treaty with the US, they can be moved to the US and tried. But the countries that were last known to live in (Russia, the Republic of Georgia and Indonesia) might make the case more complicated. QuoteThe SEC has also charged three U.S.-based promoters who endorsed Forsage on their social media platforms. It is very nice to hear that most promoters of this ponzi scheme would be charged. Recently in my country we have had a rise in celebrities promoting ponzi schemes and other scam related business. And when this firms run away with investors funds these promoters that have large follower-ship in the social media would not be held accountable for aiding scam.  QuoteThe scheme, called Forsage, claimed to be a decentralized smart contract platform, and it allowed millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the ethereum, tron and binance blockchains. It is really disheartening to still see that people are still falling victims to these fraudsters. One of their greatest tools to attract people is high return on investment. Out of greed and get rich quick syndrome these innocent people invest only to become financial losers at last.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/01/sec-charges-11-people-in-alleged-300-million-crypto-ponzi-scheme.html",

      "body": "It might be hard for the SEC itself to investigate every single person involved including those who are doing the menial tasks on the ground. But if you want to include them, you may try reporting them to the SEC. The problem with these people is that they could claim that just like you they are also victims. They could tell the investigating authorities that they're also recruited to the scheme. So the ones who are usually investigated at the top are those who planned, built, and managed the operations themselves.",

Always do your own research.Quote from: Davidvictorson on August 02, 2022, 01:16:59 AM Can the SEC go ahead to investigate and charge the folks who are playing several roles in creating and promoting this fraudulent crypto-focused pyramid scheme now before it crashes?I think before the SEC turns their attention to a certain scheme to be investigated they must have been flagged off a couple of times from individuals who have been defrauded and vuctims plus the amount has to be a huge sum, I don't think the SEC goes after every petty Ponzi scheme.",

It is possible that they do not see it as a Ponzi scheme rather as a way to \"make money\" since they are all unemployed. Promoting and endorsing the project is their source of livelihood.",

It just goes to show that even the extremely stupid have lots of money sometimes.I mean how hard is it to do your research on potential investment opportunities? You could even outsource the task by simply asking around or even posting a question on Bitcointalk. You would immediately get warned by even the newest of our members not to put your money into such scams.",

Thank you. if he is already under investigation due to a previous ponzi. and he is upto it again.then yes report himit does not have to crash to be proven a ponzi.the very fact that he is recruiting is a bad flag. the fact that he is probably under some restraining order that prevents him from operating a similar business model is a red flag. they would be very interested in this even before it does crash as they can atleast start their investigations now before its too late rather then letting the shoe drop first and then have to work in retrospect after the fact. this does not mean he is/will get arrested now. it just means that the SEC can atleast start to build something against him or add charges to existing court filings that show that he has no remorse or desire to rehabilitate himself. and that would affect the sentencing of current case against him.",

Even the projects that gets created these days are a basic form of ponzi if you ask me, how? They create this fake token, sell it to people, and to make sure that others come in, they pay out of pocket small by small, either via staking rewards, or liquidity or any other 146 methods.So, if you ask me, this isn't a big deal, it is something quite normal and understandable. We shouldn't be shocked about this at all, people could realize they are getting scammed all by themselves and if they do not, SEC is not bringing their money back to them at all.",

And after that I heard several Ambassador of BitConnect in several Countries is legally sued, I don't follow the case whether they end up going to jail or paying back the investors money, but from this case I think SEC should be able to at least freeze those Ponzi scheme you are talking about.
