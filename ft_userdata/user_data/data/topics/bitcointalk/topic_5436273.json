      "body": "I downloaded and installed the wallet a few months ago to see what all the fuss was about.I remember that it gives you a choice on the length of your seed. You can use any of the standard number or words from 12 to 24. There is a button to enable and disable TOR and seeds can be extended with passphrases. I didn't like that you can skip the seed backup step because lazy people can lose their money that way. And then they will blame Bitcoin, Unstoppable wallet, the world, and their mothers for making them the way they are. However, before you can generate a new BTC address to receive coins, the software asks you to backup your seed. I didn't check how this works exactly, but I am guessing the words will be displayed to you and you will have to prove you wrote them down by entering them back into the software. Some other things I noticed is long sync times with the servers. I only tried it with bitcoin and it took several minutes to sync. If I was using this as a multicurrency wallet with 5 or 10 different coins, where each new coin requires 5-10 mins of syncing, it becomes a problem for people with slow internet and old phones. The wallet doesn't support the same number of alts as closed-source clients. It can happen that the coin or token you want to use this wallet with isn't supported. The official website doesn't mention which assets are supported and it really should.",

Just that this one does not work.2) If there is a way, I could not find it to have more then 1 account per coin. Might just be a Dave thing but I have BTC1 and BTC 2 and BTC 3 along with LTC 1 and LTC 2 and so on all on my phone. All small amounts since it's a hot wallet but it helps with the disaster I call accounting. (mining goes here, raffles go there, other sales go someplace else and so on)3) As others have mentioned it can be slow.Not a bad wallet if it works for you, but since it did not work for me I passed. But in the little time I had it that is what I noticed. I just tried again when I saw this post and the screen shots for the can't add just came from now so it's still an issue.-Dave",

Because ANY wallet on a phone is hot and not at all secure. As for it not being supported, if that is the case then don't display the option to add it. I can see that being an issue as people try different things to see if they can get it to work before they give up and search for help so now they have created a bunch of wallets with a bunch of seeds for no reason. -Dave",

Although I don't like them in general, for a few dollars of coins theywork well enough. As I said, storing real amounts in a hot wallet is just asking for trouble.

The size of the apk file is about 70 MB. So if you use this wallet for a bunch of altcoins, you might soon run out of internal storage on your phone. Having to download 3 GB on my phone to work with just one asset is far from optimal. Especially if we consider how many regions still don't have quality and affordable mobile data tech. Zcash has a relatively big block size plus a block time of just over 1 minute. That could be the reason for the storage requirements. Still, Unstoppable Wallet isn't exactly a light client.",

Would be great if the numbers could be adjusted through the settings. At least then you would know the minimum number of confirmations the transaction has.I believe the confirmation status changes to Confirmed after the third block confirmation.  Your suggestion would be great indeed.Quote from: Pmalek on January 25, 2023, 05:46:25 PMThat means you can even skip and ignore the warnings when you try to generate a new BTC address. I remember they ask you to make a backup first, but since you have avoided it and still used your wallet for transactions, they obviously don't ask you to reenter the words as proof they are backed up.You know what!  I created a new account to test this out and you are right!  I can not even get a Receiving Address unless I back up my Seed Phrase.  Yet, I can use another Wallet I already have.  Does this mean I have already done the Backup someday?  Now I am so confused!-----Quote from: dkbit98 on January 25, 2023, 10:16:48 PMYou can also use open source AuroraStore if you want to use some apps that are not open source, and there are good alternatives for F-Droid as well, like IzzyOnDroid and Droid-ify that have more apps.I chose not to install Closed Source applications on my phone.  I did test Aurora Store before and it works just perfect for some body who wants just to move away from Google.  IzzyOnDroid and Droid-ify, I have no idea about.  Will have to check them out.Quote from: dkbit98 on January 25, 2023, 10:16:48 PMI don't know what degoogled phone you own, but Pixels with GrapheneOS work almost with everything, they even have imitation of all google services.The issue is not about having or not having GS or replacements for the Services installed.  It is that Open Source is not a very demanded type of software today.  So if I want an actually good Wallet, I have little options.  How many actually useful and good Open Source Bitcoin Wallets are there?  Count Mycelium and Unstoppable and you got to about half of the truly decent ones already.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Electrum is good option if you don't care about it's dated UI.[1] https://github.com/horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-ios/issues/3984[2] https://samouraiwallet.com/download/fdroid",
