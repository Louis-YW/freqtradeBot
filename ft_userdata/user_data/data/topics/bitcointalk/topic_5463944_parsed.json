If only fewer people would doubt it, we would see good results just like this one and wherever you look when you are downtown, you will often see those cryptos accepted here signs.",

This is a good thing especially if this keeps up as it would signify that no country will need the backing of any international standard currency to survive, and everything is a lie up to this point to control countries and governments into subservience to a \"more powerful country\" like the US and China. In El Salvador stuff is not looking that good, things could be different with Turkiye as the situation called for it.",

Even if they are able to exchange the local lira or peso (depending on the country we are talking about) they are still getting a currency that is losing value day after day. Bitcoin is really the only option they have, of course there is the volatility problem for the moment, if the future I'm sure bitcoin will be more stable.",

The same has been already observed in another countries like Venezuela and Nigeria, so we can see it's a global phenomenon, which is present in different continents around the globe.What I think interesting on these cases is that we are seeing Bitcoin supplying a real necessity faced by people. It's the real usecase many talk about, but can't connect it to cryptocurrencies, assuming they are just speculative assets. However, they are wrong, as Bitcoin is being useful on the daily life of many citizens living in countries troubled by economical crisis.",

And bitcoin is one of the best alternative for that, so those countries leaders who understand the value of bitcoin adopt it to sustain their economy. Using bitcoin with local currency will make the economy more stronger. US dollar has weakened many currencies in the third world countries.",

They are a different country so they have different law about crypto.It's disappointing that Turkey isn't behind this adaptation. I was pleased to see updates suggesting Turkey's positive stance on Bitcoin. Allowing Bitcoin transactions in shopping malls would've been a smart move, but it's unfortunate to learn that Turkey doesn't permit it. I'm uncertain about their crypto regulations, but based on what I know, it's puzzling why governments, including mine, are against Bitcoin despite its potential economic benefits. Their concerns about money laundering are raised, even though it's challenging to prevent in both digital and traditional currencies.",

Any of the shop that say they accept crypto payments is breaking the law.Bitcoin trades are not illegal. You can buy and sell crypto currencies in both online and physical exchanges.On 16 April 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey issued a regulation banning the use of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, directly or indirectly, to pay for goods and services.

In UAE particularly. Turkey's policies on the crypto market are not that good enough to consider it Pro-crypto. Even in my country where most of the population is in Villages until now the Grand generation and Parent generation are still not familiar with Bitcoin maybe they just heard of it as digital currency from their children.Even there as well in cities I can easily find a store or conceive a retailer for Bitcoin payment even if it will be hard but possible to find already exiting Bitcoin payment for the goods. The adoption or growth will be considered when the treasury bill or any government institute level Bill will recognize Bitcoin as a tender.",

So I can only imagine the living conditions of those with financial insufficiency which hinders them from taking the opportunity with bitcoin under his inflation period.",
