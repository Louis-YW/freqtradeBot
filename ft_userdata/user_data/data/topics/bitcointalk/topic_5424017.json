I've been reading in the faq of your service that \"maybe\" you can ask for the accreditation of our identity (KYC) if it is requested by your partner (simplex)? So, although your service clearly states that no document will be requested for the purchase of coins, this will not actually be the case in most cases (mainly european union citizens), right? Obviously, if this is the case, it is clearly a kind of backdoor scam, since in fact the identity will be claimed by means of legal accreditation.",
