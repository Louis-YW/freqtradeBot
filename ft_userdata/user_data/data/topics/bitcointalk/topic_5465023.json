You just need to set a passphrase,  and you will have multiple pins   for different wallets.For trezorhttps://trezor.io/learn/a/standard-hidden-walletsAnd for ledgerhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-How-to-set-up-a-passphrase-?docs=trueIt is important to note that setting up a passphrasee is highly recommended. It is an additional word to your seed",

All those child SEEDs fit BIP39 standard thus can be imported into any BIP39 compliant  wallet of you choice. For instance ColdCard is able to create up to 10000 child seeds. The similar feature to create multiple child seeds from single  deterministic entropy has Passport2. It is very convenient for SEEDs management as, for instance, there is no need to backup multiple mnemonics for bunch of wallets. It is enough to backup master SEED and you will be safe.",

If you want to switch to using a different seed, you have to go through the recovery process and then select generate a new seed phrase or another than before.As far as I know, the Keystone 3 Pro hardware wallet (https://keyst.one/) has a feature that can accommodate up to 3 sets of seed phrases at once.",

So you don't have to have one hardware wallet for every single Bitcoin address. My golly, you'd end up having a full bag of hardware wallets if you do it that way. Moreover, most hardware wallets can only support one seed phrase. In which case, you cannot generate a new seed phrase every time you generate a new address. If you want to generate a new seed phrase from a single hardware wallet, you need to reset it, wipe everything off, and start all over again as if the hardware is new. But is there a need to have one set of seed phrase for every address? That sounds crazy. That's possible, though, but your room will surely be filled with back ups. Imagine, you'll consume tens of addresses, if not hundreds in your entire lifetime, and you need to have at least 3 copies of each seed phrase.",

And, believe me, the way you suggestion above will make you confused itself if each address you create uses disparate seed when have problem to recovery it.",

If your device is lost, damaged or stolen, you can use your recovery seed to restore access to your entire wallet, passwords and other data associated with it. The process is simple; you only have to enter the words of your seed into your new Trezor device. (You may also use any other wallets or applications that use the same standard as the Trezor.)Quote from: lombok on October 11, 2023, 11:52:21 PMIn my experience https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467802.0, I have 4 BTC wallet addresses in one trezzor with one seed phrase, because there was a problem with my trezor, I was forced to access it in the BIP39 wallet (I use a trust wallet here) where only my main BTC address appeared.Instead of using a Trust wallet to transfer the seed phrase from your damaged Trezor, another alternative that I think is safer, even if you don't move it to a hardware wallet again, is to use Electrum, which is installed manually on Tail OS which is stored on a USB flash disk.

It's the same as having to reset the hardware wallet for that.Quote from: https://trezor.io/learn/a/use-new-address-for-each-transactionA fresh address is a newly generated address that has not received any previous transactions. It is recommended to use a fresh address for every transaction, as this benefits user privacy.",

This is done in anticipation as a backup so that the funds we store there can be accessed safely and well in all conditions.You are confusing seed phrases with regular private keys because the latter kind of sensitive information can't have more than one address of each type. For example, from a single private key, you can generate a single public key, from which it is possible to get addresses of different formats (legacy uncompressed, legacy compressed, P2WSH, P2SH, etc.). If your wallet generates a different address from the same private key, you specify which format you want to get. But if it is impossible to tell the wallet what you want from it, you should switch to a more advanced wallet. In contrast to a private key, a seed phrase can generate a virtually unlimited number of addresses of any format you want: a single hardware wallet with one seed phrase and several passphrases allows for separating your funds into completely unrelated sets of Bitcoin addresses. Some wallets like Coldcard even allow for generating dozens of seed phrases from a single seed phase, but it is overkill for most users.",

In Trezor, your create a Bitcoin account and there you get your first address. After you fund it (optional) you can generate a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on.

You can access all your BTC in all the accounts you created in Trezor at the different derivation paths if you point your Electrum software to the correct account (derivation path). It doesn't matter if it's your main account, as you call it, or any of the other accounts. Their difference is in the derivation paths. If it's a native segwit account, the derivation path for the first BTC account should be m/84'/0'/0'. If you created a 2nd account, it's at m/84'/0'/1', etc.  Quote from: lombok on October 11, 2023, 11:52:21 PMIn my experience https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467802.0, I have 4 BTC wallet addresses in one trezzor with one seed phrase, because there was a problem with my trezor, I was forced to access it in the BIP39 wallet (I use a trust wallet here) where only my main BTC address appeared.
