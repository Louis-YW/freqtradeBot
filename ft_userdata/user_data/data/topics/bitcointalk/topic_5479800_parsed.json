You should always not trust anyone who approaches you with an investment doubling offer because there is no investment anywhere in the background of that discussion. The last mistake you might make is that if you use it because of how you lost your bitcoin and stop accumulating, then that might put you in a state of regret, looking at how the price has moved over the years since you first invested in it. My first contact with bitcoin was amazing, and I was lucky enough to learn things I needed to know before getting involved in it. I have not lost my investment to anyone, although I made some buying and selling choices, but that was what prepared me for where I'm right now.",

Those who have a long time dream of one day investing in bitcoins and for that purpose get a lot of peace of mind when they manage money and invest in a stage of money management. I have heard many stories on forums who have struggled and invested in bitcoins. You started investing with $25 and of course you have invested a lot of money over this long period and sold your investments but still you show the beginning of your investment and want to know how other people's beginning was. The initial phase on your part is as exciting as it is for most investors and a lot of fun.",

This things happens to many of us that first invested in Bitcoin in 2017, that year there are numerous third party websites that claims to double our Bitcoin if we bring referrals that would join us to create privileges and opportunity for others too. Many people lost their assets that worth more than $80 million to Ponzi schemes.",

Many of them never believed that Bitcoin would be this big so they handled the Investment carelessly. I don't also blame them because Bitcoin was a radical shift from the status quo and it will take more than faith and determination to believe that something good will come out of the cryptocurrency. Many of them lost the investment because they misplaced their wallet password or seed phrase. While others were driven by greed and were enticed to invest in a get-rich-quick scheme. These scam projects promised great returns from Investment and many people lost their funds. But the good news is that there is still a great opportunity to still invest in Bitcoin because it is still in its infant stage. There is no need to dwell on regrets but we have to focus on raising funds that can facilitate our Investing in Bitcoin because the price will keep increasing in the future.",

You have a point but it depends on the illegality level of Bitcoin in the OP geographical local. It may be illegal for institutional banking to provide services for it and I'm sure the OP already understands the gravity of getting involved in BTC investment.Quote from: AbuBhakar on December 30, 2023, 05:25:47 PMAlso there’s no way for you to benefit on this because you can’t convert it to fiat without having a risk of exposing your identity even with P2P transactions.There are many ways to benefit from Bitcoin even when from a restricted region and the P2P trading of BTC is there to solve issues like this. I remember when I traveled to a country where BTC is illegal I had to sell my BTC p2p and the buyer sent funds to me through WU.Quote from: AbuBhakar on December 30, 2023, 05:25:47 PMQuote from: wtsimis on December 30, 2023, 05:01:34 PMHow did it feel when you first invested in Bitcoin?My first time to acquire Bitcoin is not through purchase but rather by doing faucet and PTC site that pay Bitcoin but small fiat value that time.

For beginners, losing Bitcoin is due to various mistakes caused by not knowing how to store and maintain it.I didn't immediately enter the world of Bitcoin investment even though someone told me about Bitcoin on one occasion. I learned slowly what I had to do before I entered it.The first thing I learned was about wallets and their security. If I have a lot of money and can afford to buy Bitcoin, if I don't know how to store and maintain it, then I think it will be a waste. And for me, when I was still a beginner, learning about wallets and their security was the foundation for starting activities in Bitcoin and other coins.",

Buying my first bitcoin got me a giggle, it is memorable how the bitcoin stored in your wallet.

But no worries, all investments are actually tested at first and once you have learned your lesson, that's the time that you will be more capable to invest and gain more promising profits. People lost their bitcoin probably because of scam due to lack of security or its just that the investor itself is not knowledgeable enough to secure his bitcoin.Whatever the reason, that will teach you to be more cautious and more careful every time you decide to invest. And once you start taking investments, be responsible to provide high security of your coins so you won't end up regretting due to lost bitcoins.",
