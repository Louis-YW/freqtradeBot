This has been especially apparent in the gaming industry over the years. There's a few particular games which have had success with it over a number of years. So, we know if implemented correctly it can be rather successful. I think the issue is, calling it NFT has got a somewhat negative association, due to the vast amount of people who have basically jumped on the bandwagon, and tried to sell anything, and everything as a NFT.",
