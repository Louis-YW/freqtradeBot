  "content": "I write this post on behalf of the Satoshi Spain company. We have the possibility of recovering BTC wallets that are missing some words from the seed. If you divided the seed into parts and you have lost some, perhaps we can help you. It is done legally and an invoice is issued, if the recovered BTC is exempt from taxation, it is not taxed but in any case they will have to be declared. The company takes a commission of 12%,21% or 50% of what is recovered. There is also the possibility of decrypting the file where the seed is located if you lost access to it. Each case must be studied individually, for more details send me a DM.Actualization 05/10/2023:In order to recover the seed words:-Give correctly the order of the words you have.-This service is designed to help people get their money back. Not having the correct information in the order of the words will make our work difficult and cause us to suffer unnecessary delays-Know if the private key is 12,18 or 24 words.-Language in which the wallet was made.-Why were the words lost, how and when. What condition was the person in when they lost them.-This only works if you have missed some words (no matter the position). For more than certain words it can take dozens of years.-It can take 1 minute or years to recover them. You must be patient.-Documentation must be brought in person to avoid hacking.-A contract will be filled out between the two parties to certify that the person who brings the seed words is the real owner.-An invoice with VAT will be issued for the service provided. Everything is taxed.-Once the words are recovered, we will charge a 12% commission if the wallet have 0,5 btc or less, 21% if have 1 btc or less and 50% for more than 2 btc. The rest will be transferred to the wallet that the client provided us when bringing the documentation.-It doesn't matter how much money there is (1 satoshi or 1000 bitcoins). This service is carried out to help people get their money back.-Everything, absolutely everything is done with pen and paper to avoid hacking.-We do not require any advance paymentWe do not ask for any advance payment, we only charge a commission in case we recover the wallet. At this moment we can offer this service for wallets with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum classic and Litecoin.We are a public company with several years in technology sector, we don't need this service to continue with our business and we want to be a bigger company with legal businesses, like this. Our intention is to help and win a comisson from the clients wich have lost his wallets. We are currently accepting test wallets to build trust in the service as our regular customers are reluctant to testify to protect their privacy.https://www.satoshispain.com/All the best",

What are your technicalities in achieving this because to the best of my knowledge people who specializes  in this act are hackers (please do no mind my words and I stand to be corrected) who can do this job very well. Could you please show us your license since you claim you are legit and licensed to operate.",

I saw it not to have any details and the post seem more unprofessional which is a way to recognize a service as a scam. Most scammers are lazy to research up to the extent that they can convince people and prove themselves legit, but ignorant people still fall for them. Let us see where this will end. He should prove me otherwise.There has also been a similar service not quite long: Recovery of Stolen/ Lost Crypto. I reported five of it as spam, but this was left by moderator, but which is also definitely a scam. Although, I am not sure, but likely both are controlled by the same person and looking for who to scam. I hope they will prove me otherwise.",
