  "content": "Hi all, wondering if anyone knows how to get Electrum address generation & transaction signing to work with hardened addresses. I actually got it to work a few months ago, so I know it's possible. Just messing something up now. Here's the setup:BIP39 seed used with Ian Coleman's tool to generate a number of hardened child addresses (m/84'/0'/0'/0/xx').Online device (Windows, Electrum 4.4.5) with watch-only wallet generated from a hardened child receive address.Offline device (Linux, Electrum 4.0.9) with wallet generated from a corresponding hardened child private key.Transaction generated on watch-only wallet, then transferred via QR code to and from offline device for signing. I am pretty sure this method of using a wallet with single imported child addresses is what I used previously. But now it breaks down when trying to generate the public child address from the private child key on the offline device. The public address generated is completely wrong; it starts with 1 rather than bc1, so not even BIP84. So of course when I go to try to sign the imported transaction, the sign button is greyed out.It seems like Electrum auto-updated to a newer version on the Windows device since I got it working previously, but that shouldn't matter since the receive address generation on the offline device is the problem. I did try rolling back to 4.3.3 on the online device, but then the offline device generated an error when trying to import the transaction QR code.I did also try to generate the whole HD wallet from seed phrase, blowing past the BIP39 warning Electrum gives, but the resultant generated addresses are also incorrect. At least these ones I recognize - they are just the unhardened addresses associated with the seed. I messed around with the derivation pathway, such as by pasting the pathway from Ian Coleman's tool, but that just made the addresses unrecognizable. Also tried generating from account extended private key, but got the same unhardened addresses.Any ideas?? Electrum documentation doesn't mention hardened addresses at all.",

This tells electrum what sort of address to generate. You can start the process again in a new wallet file by going to file > new/restore",
