Don't forget these centralized exchanges allow people to easily buy and sell their crypto. P2P is just not that easy. Yes this is true. There is a severe lack of decentralized P2P services for fiat services that are anywhere near as convenient or easy to use as centralized options. Once this gap is filled the chance might grow stronger.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on December 27, 2022, 01:02:44 AMQuoteAs new perpetual/margin trading options become available, like GMX and Dydx (which is unconvincingly completely decentralized, however a seemingly better option than CEXs), the possibility to boycott CEXs becomes more possible.Centralized exchanges are fine but we need to understand that a monopoly business model is not good for anything. I see some exchanges are having large share of exchange industry which is obviously bad. They will start manipulating the crypto users very soon if they have not started yet.In my opinion, manipulation would be a well-versed activity for centralized exchange \"elites\" (if you will) by now. The discussion and suspicion of these activities date back as far as I remember. We should be suspicious that there is no talk about it now.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on December 27, 2022, 01:02:44 AMQuoteDo you think an effective boycott campaign against CEXs could happen?

Decentralized exchanges are greatly improving in terms of usability. Your point about P2P services/fiat-related services are definitely a strong point of improvement if CEXs were to be able to be boycotted successfully.",

      "body": "I'm pretty sure this won't be even remotely possible as the majority of crypto-users are still dependent on CEXs for their day to day trading. It's where the most volume is, most services offered as well such as P2P and Fiat on-ramps, etc. Some CEX even have flexible savings while most DEX platform that offers similar service just locks your coin/token for a specific period.I also feel like main problem is that most DEXs only offer a limited amount of services; trade, vaults, farms and that's it. Although you can use various services, they are not on just one platform, you would need to have multiple tabs open on your browser to use them. CEXs offers plenty of services and in some instances, all top services are in one big CEX; not to mention perks for just trading on their platforms. You basically get more bonuses out of CEXs than DEXs.Unless crypto-adoption is in a full swing, meaning, we can just go to a store and pay with any crypto or trade freely with it without the need of a P2P service that some CEXs offers, and DEXs caught up to all the services and perks offered by CEXs, this is not possible as only a limited amount of people would end up participating.",

That's just to feel less guilty.Preaching decentralization and privacy, and using centralized exchanges, accepting the taxes and laws,......Very efficient decentralization </sarcasmIf you're using a CEX, I hope you won't complaint when the market will be even more regulated as it is currently. You won't be eligible to complain because you think you're paying too much taxes on your gains. You can't complain because you helped to get such situation.Why should a group of devs create something while people aren't interested in decentralized stuff?5$ to join an airdrop on a CEX5$ to watch a video on coinbase.10 cts to RT a cuntAnd voilÃ , people are happy.",

At the same time, they are ready to boycott for a long period of time, often to their own detriment. it is certainly not feasible.I personally think the problem is that currently, all CEXs offer many options they don't just stick to their exchange priority. For example, Binance has many features like Spot Trading, Margin Trading, Derivatives Trading, Leveraged Tokens, NFT Marketplace, Strategy Trading, OTC Portal, Binance Convert, Auto Invest, DeFi Staking, Dual Investment, Binance Pool, Binance Card, Binance Launchpad, Binance Launchpool...I think they can certainly be removed from the CEX list, they are more of a trading/investment platform. yes, this is not the case only with Binance. All so-called CEXs use a similar business model.",

So if they have to put in effort to make it work they will push back.With the push back the people who know better can only go so far after that it's just talking to the wall.So, the more knowledgeable people will try to educate people about not using them, but they are just too popular and any real effort to boycott them will just fail.Once again, all the above in my opinion.
