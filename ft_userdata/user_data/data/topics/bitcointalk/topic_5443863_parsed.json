Keep collecting garbage further, creating the illusion of moderation. That's all I wanted to say.Do not worry about your accuracy too much; one accurate report is worth many inaccurate reports.Adequately handled reports are a motivation to report more, but we would try to focus on the action and not the result.If in thousands of reports you've only had a handful of issues, doesn't seem like a reason to quite sending out reports.",

      "body": "I processed a lot of the reports, and removed the threads, not just from this user though there was several others reported at the time, and not just this user. Probably handled 100-200 of the reports. However, I only removed those that did not have any replies at all, had not trust references directed towards the thread itself, i.e one's which basically offered no value whatsoever. I left some in the queue towards the end of the night, due to needing to attend to some real life things as well as further investigation on a few which had trust ratings which I would've looked at later if they were still in the queue. Having said that, I wasn't the one to mark any of the reports bad. In fact, I left the one's which did have replies as a soft bad, by just leaving them unhandled, because I can see it from both points of view. The global moderator who handled these reports, must have thought they could've been significant to the history of the user, in some way I imagine. Generally, we don't allow users to remove their own threads, and I guess this could potentially be abused, and whoever marked them bad could be thinking along those lines. However for me, since there was no replies or any trust references/flags left on the one's I handled, I thought they were insignificant enough to be removed. Maybe, whoever handled them had a different point of view to that, however it depends since the examples you've given all that activity from other users.  Also, the user in question has clearly tried to hide his post history. Now, there's nothing stopping users from doing that I suppose, but they can't remove the threads themselves. I usually, weigh this up, and generally if the threads don't have any replies, and they've been inactive for years, and has no scam accusations or trust references left, I usually remove them. Quote from: Ratimov on March 07, 2023, 09:45:54 AMCan someone explain to me the value of these posts:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3584928.msg36587529#msg36587529https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3585802.msg36588874#msg36588874https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4473798.msg40145465#msg40145465https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3523653.msg36582223#msg36582223https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3527283.msg36555924#msg36555924These are the exact one's I was thinking about leaving as unhandled, as a soft bad. Since, technically many would agree they're spam, insignificant, but because other users have posted, there is some significance there. I imagine the moderator who handled these after me, thought along the same sort of line. Even though, an argument could be made that the posts that have replied themselves, are pretty bad quality in certain circumstances.Here's some examples where keeping these around might be a good idea:1. Users that want to research old projects that they had interest in2. Scam report, multiple years after 3. Users who've asked substantial posts, when at a time the thread itself was substantial enough getting punished by the thread being removed. Since, technically most users wouldn't be bothered by this thread since they'll never stumble upon it, I think it feels a little harsh on the users losing posts because of it4. Anything with replies from users generally isn't removed.",

Quote from: Ratimov on March 07, 2023, 12:41:36 PMI repeat that the reports were sent just to empty posts, and not to delete the entire topic. Only on edited posts that I marked as a low quality post, point 1.Yeah, I see that. Although, there were a few threads in there that you reported which had posts from other users that I left unhandled. I don't know how many, I just remember one or two. I left those unhandled at the time. However, I do believe you might've continued reporting after I had gone offline so may have not seen all examples. Generally, for a few of those examples I'd delete them. Some of them are reserve posts, which could be fairly useful to have around...maybe? Especially, if they've been quoted in the thread, with the existing content, since upon clicking on that quote it'd take you to the now edited post. Although, things like:Quote from: Majestic-milf on February 06, 2023, 10:35:45 PMDeleteUsually get deleted. In fact I reported several of these types of post in that exact thread recently, all deleted. Some sections do tend to vary in how they handle certain situations though. Myself, and Mprep should be fairly consistent on most things, since I know they dealt with a ton of my reports back in my reporting days, and I got a feel for how they take action on certain reports. Obviously, there will be difference of opinion from time to time. For example, I've reported empty threads in the past, and they were always removed.",

Hopefully, this doesn't put you off of reporting too much though, since it would be a huge miss. I know you're actively reporting elsewhere on the forum also; so it would be a big loss to those sections too. I don't think I've seen you quite as active on the altcoin sections recently, until yesterday. Where I was like Oh, Ratimov is back . It's one of the reasons I left the below reports unhandled, one of them because the other replies might be worth reviewing, but the other because it did have replies. Therefore, I thought giving you a soft bad would be the better approach. Obviously, other moderators always have the ability to decide to take action though. Quote from: Ratimov on March 07, 2023, 01:02:01 PMYesterday there were 2. One of these threads contained about 8 edited replies and low-quality posts that were not related to the topic itself, for example: idiot, this is not an announcement, stop polluting the section with your spam. Right, I believe these are the one's I was referring too. I do remember that the one thread had quite a lot of low quality replies, that might have needed deleting in themselves.  Quote from: Ratimov on March 07, 2023, 01:02:01 PMThe funny thing about this is that if I see that mprep is active and I send these reports again, on which someone has stuck BADs, then with a high degree of probability, all this garbage will be deleted, just like yesterday.Yeah, it's one of the downfalls to having no hard rules, and allowing moderator discretion. I believe the system is better than hard rules most of the time though.",

Did you pay attention to the number of threads he opened? Pay attention to the time between these topics, he created them almost every minute. He was not a scammer, he was an ordinary shiller who promoted the ICO here. There is no value or concealment of fraud in his posts, there are continuous announcements and questions about ico. Not surprising, why some users began to insult him, simply because he polluted the sections with his non-stop spam.Yeah, I noticed. Although, unfortunately I couldn't find any archives which showed exactly what the threads were about, at least one's I checked. Since a lot of the scraping sites used today, weren't around or didn't scrape the content in time. I'm wondering how it went unnoticed for so long. I personally didn't see it at the time. Especially, considering the bumping system back then was like every other part of the forum if I remember correctly. I mean, you don't create that many threads, that quickly, and not be considered a spammer. Generally, users make more ordinary posts, rather than threads since threads are generally more substantial when made. That's a huge amount of threads opened. Although, the curious part for me is why they decided to go back, throughout all their history, and edit every single post.",

But I understand that soon the low-quality posts will end there, since I have gone through almost all sections, and now I am preparing for new sections. I am looking at the marketplace, altcoin section, sections with announcements, there are a lot of garbage posts and topics, so I will have something to do full-scale.I've made it a personal goal of mine to remove as much spam in the last few years within my sections that I can. I've finally been able to setup a workflow that helps moderation, and finally tackling some of the problematic issues in the Altcoin section, mainly my sections at the moment. I'm hoping to have done most of it by the end of the year, so everything is much more clean. I've probably removed over 10,000+ posts this year. I know there's a few other users reporting also, so I do think we'll eventually get on top of it, and only deal with current problems. I'm hoping we can get the community back to reporting like they used too. I know the reasons why they've stopped, but hopefully that'll change in the future, and I know the Altcoin sections are some of the more criticized due to the amount of spam there. Hopefully, I can somewhat alleviate that opinion, and show there's a massive effort going on behind the scenes, which hopefully in return encourages users that their efforts are also not being wasted.

Each one does it based on their common sense and their notion of what is of value or not. There's definitely criteria/guidelines that most moderators are aware of, but there is a element of discretion. theymos has made it quite clear in the past that he doesn't believe in set in stone rules, because they're easier to exploit or abuse, which I'd agree. Unfortunately, a trade off of that is sometimes we have situations like this where some moderators view things differently. However, if anything this can encourage moderators to have a little talk about how to deal with these things in the future, and establish some sort of general view on it.
