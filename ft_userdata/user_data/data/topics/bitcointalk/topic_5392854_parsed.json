  "content": "Bitcoin is often accused to be completely useless but of course we know it is not true. Because Bitcoin is useful in various ways already and it will continue to be useful for many more cases when Bitcoin gets more established. A very famous usecase for Bitcoin are already donations and Bitcoin as a medium for donations is gaining more support currently. Bitcoin has a big advantage to make it an excellent choice for donations: Bitcoin is easily accessible, it’s fast and it’s a global network. Especially Bitcoin’s global network is a big game changer in favor of Bitcoin because it can be sent boderless from country to country. It can be sent from Australia to Europe, from Asia to Africa, just everywhere, Bitcoin is accepted. And Bitcoin will gain more popularity as a medium for donations when Bitcoin gets more established because more people will know and accept Bitcoin. Some experts say: a network is multiple times more useful if it’s used by more people. And that’s what happening to Bitcoin currently, it’s getting more useful every day, especially for donations. Donations on Bitcointalk where Bitcoin is used / was used recently Bitcoin is known for various Bitcointalk donation projects already, where members from Bitcointalk were organizing donation campaigns and used Bitcoin as a medium for donations. Especially right now, some donation campaigns are currently active and hosted at Bitcointalk: 1.   Support for Ukraine, organized by @derBowler [active]Ukraine is currently suffering from a full-scale russian invasion, when Putin decided on February 24 to invade Ukraine and Putin’s final goal looks like Ukraine’s defeat and additionally the defeat of freedom and democracy in Ukraine. Putin is commiting war crimes every day because russia’s military is targeting not only military targets but also very often civilian buildings and normal houses. A very high number of war crimes was documented already. As a result, a very large number of people is leaving the country to search a safe place and survive the war. In Europe, many people are helping to organize transports of refugees, many oft them starting on the polish border. DerBowler from Germany is also offering local support where he organizes help, transports of refugees and food. He and his friends have already rescued a few hundred of refugees to Germany. Quote from: derBowler on December 11, 2022, 12:58:21 PM          Pictures are currently not loading, I'll notify derBowler...Quote from: derBowler on March 06, 2022, 06:58:49 PMMore from his efforts can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387906.0He’ll post updates and new picures frequently. Donations can be sent here: QuoteBitcoin : bc1qcatsxvw057khlcazrzpl33rje8lvjnyz6ryxxhEthereum : 0xD7638eb545678a58A9Fd77B12eb7dF5C30Cec0D5Monero : 4958PhVdtQGTpgdpC2VUhv94MvnCSrA4E77aVmViwfdzbTrU5VGfYRtPTNSjcwtJgNhGzyVw9AqTMG4 A5Upv623cEPesXaU2.   Support for Ukraine, organized by @icopress [active]Organizing to help Ukraine at the frontlines is also very important and icopress is an Ukrainian, who has set up a donation campaign to help near the frontlines. He’s located aroud Nikolaev, where he provides food to Ukrainians resisting there and troops deployed in that region: Quote from: icopress on March 01, 2022, 02:58:09 AMI have no experience in managing charitable funds but I know how to help my city here locally, maybe this initiative will help pay for additional power generators, food or gasoline, since all the largest wholesale food bases of the Nikolaev region are located in the regional center, which is currently located on the line of demarcation, (the situation is also complicated by the fact that stores use various tricks and speculate on prices, adding a markup of 20 to 35% on all goods).I immediately want to say that I will not keep a spreadsheet, all I can do is publish here in the thread photos of the work done and checks, if any (very often checks are simply not issued because speculation on prices during martial law is equated to a crime). I am not eager to do charity work, but because of this incident, and because my city is in the path of advancement of Russian columns, I decided to post a bitcoin address.Donation address: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qx4mhrpq8fjpppt62gv83vqlaqqwuwqqxjuupeuCode: (Electrum)Messege: icopress / 01.03.2022Donation address: bc1qx4mhrpq8fjpppt62gv83vqlaqqwuwqqxjuupeuAddress: bc1qx4mhrpq8fjpppt62gv83vqlaqqwuwqqxjuupeuSig: ICHWFcChnivJL6PN3NgfQdI8RVd6vkSCMZ5FK0fpWTE8N101PQvLE6WTnn4jmc95BRpfRkDFOzObPHtGvsUrO30=Here are some pictures how donation funds were used: Quote from: icopress on March 01, 2022, 08:14:01 PMCooking for a local checkpoint.QuoteQuote from: icopress on March 07, 2022, 10:47:41 AMMy wife is just smart [Continuing to cook food for the guys at the nearest checkpoint] Quote More from his efforts can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.0He’ll post updates and new picures frequently and in my summary here I've only given a short overview about his donation campaign, icopress is doing a lot and I'll quote his reply as a reference: Quote from: icopress on April 03, 2022, 07:27:28 PMIn addition, you cited only routine tasks as an example.

Donations can be sent here: Bitcoin : bc1qx4mhrpq8fjpppt62gv83vqlaqqwuwqqxjuupeu3.   Building rice farms in the Philippines [finished]It was only a very limited donation campaign where a small amount of donations was involved but it was enough to set up a rice farm and distribute the rice after harvesting to everyone in their small town. It was located in Isabela Province, Phillipines, by a local farmer who sent me updates regularly. Our donation campaign was documented here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5334727.0Bitcoin was proven once again as a solid medium for donations. I’m sure we’ll see more donations campaigns also on Bitcointalk for various opportunities where Bitcoin will show its usefulness as a medium for donations.  If you know about a currently active donation campaign hosted at Bitcointalk, feel free to share it here and if at least 2 DT1 Members vouch for you and your donation campaign, I’ll include your donation campaign below.",

People must change their mindset about Bitcoin.Aside from that, donators who do want to be anonymous and not disclose their identity will be encouraged to place their donations. This is another advantage as you can send and receive anonymously. This is why a lot of crypto donations are pouring to Ukraine, anonymous donors sending their crypto to this country without the danger of exposing their identity to the public. You don't need to go to a third party institution just to send money and fill-up a form. If you have your crypto in your wallet, you can directly send it to them. But definitely, make sure that you are sending to the right people not to scammers.",

Anyone anywhere in the world can easily donate money in bitcoin without any hassle. We have seen recently how conveniently Ukraine collected donations in bitcoins and crypto which otherwise was not possible. Anonymity can be another reason but for me, it is the ease in transactions in bitcoins which encourages people to donate in bitcoin.",

The outpouring of support for the cause can be heartwarming and is a big reminder to all of us how Bitcoin can be a big tool for the good of humanity. Bitcoin can be the best tool for humanitarian concern and I am sure that people will always remember this into the future.
