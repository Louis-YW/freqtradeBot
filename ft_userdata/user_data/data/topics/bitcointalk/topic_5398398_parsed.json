I think all connected with Luna will faced bad trouble later and better be careful for every one keep holding Luna coin assets, not working yet if try hold and save coin like Luna but I don't agree Waves will be the next Luna coin. Keep potential with every time Waves ever drop lower price and have chance back to the top price again.",

Yesterday USDT also lost peg but then everything is back to normal looks like someone is looking for a total market crash. The market is going through terrible days, I hope it ends soon.",

I do not think there will be another instant death from the top 100 cryptocurrencyyes you are right, after all the case of luna and UST are different. their main problem is the absence of a real 1:1 backed. from the start maybe UST didn't have backed, and that's why when there was a big selloff they couldn't return the peg. in the end it's a real ponzi project, made for just a moment's profit.",
