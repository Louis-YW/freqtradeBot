As long as you possess the private keys of the \"coinbase output(s)\" and are able to move your coins, you're likely in Bitcoin heaven. Wish you all the best! Always have backups of the original old wallet files before you start to migrate them to newer versions of Bitcoin Core (sole official website is https://bitcoincore.org; always carefully verify any software wallet file download, never skip this step!).Be careful though, don't do anything stupid with your wallet or wallets on your daily driver computer. Consider it unsafe. If you don't know much about wallet and computer security, you might risk losing your coins!Quote from: help411 on August 15, 2023, 01:10:42 AM15 years I was sitting on this.Ha, to make your point, I guess, it's ok to round years up. Well, I bet it's just right as it happened to you. In the end you weren't tempted to sell at much lower rates in the past. What we've seen 2017/18 and especially 2021 or even this year at about little less than half of ATH is much better than in the first handful years after Bitcoin's inception. I can't tell when, but I strongly believe we'll see new ATHs in the future, surely with ups and downs, but the big picture will likely be more in the up direction. Fiat has inflation (government's slow but deadly poison), Bitcoin has deflation and growing scarcity when slowly more people see its benefits and freedom compared to goverment money.Sorry that \"coinbase\" confused you, I thought that you as a miner knew the term \"coinbase transaction\", my bad. There was no need nor any intention to attach your topic with a commercial exchange like Coinbase is.Pay attention to the security of your wallet(s). If I were you (btw, I have two), I'd get one or more decent hardware wallets (like Foundation Devices Passport or maybe Coinkite Coldcard, definitely not the Ledger crap) and transfer coins from software to hardware wallets. Not going into much details here, don't rush it, don't be reckless, make yourself well familiar with hardware or air-gapped wallets and secure self-custody. See e.g. https://www.smartcustody.com",
