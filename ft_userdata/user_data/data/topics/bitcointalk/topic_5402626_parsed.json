I am sure you know what is seed phrase that is mentioned by Upgrade00, BRD use 12 word recovery phrase which you can import to other wallet like electrum and other wallet you know that is trusted or you have been using for quite some time.",

So it is better that once you have done this step,  make a new wallet at electrum and transfer your funds to the New Electrum wallet. Now you will have a different seed phrase.By doing this , you will have a piece of mind as its not very wise to trust the close source coinbase wallet.",

Close-source software is a danger because you have to rely that the developers have good intentions.Open-source gives you the chance to verify everything yourself.

From my experience, debugging is the most difficult part of making software. Keeping the source code hidden, not only forces the users trust your intentions, but your coding skills as well. And that's why closed-source OSes like Windows keep conjuring new updates that supposedly make things work better, but very often actually work worse.You can't compare an open community like Ubuntu, wherein to become a developer you only need the skills and the intention, with Windows wherein there are far less developers and aren't allowed to reveal their work and goal.",

So it is recommended to use the Trezor hardware wallet instead of the ledger?  Why do people trust Ledger wallet even though it's closed source firmware? I tend to agree with BHC; Ledger is great at marketing and tend to pursue the latest shitcoinery fads to remain at the top of the hardware wallet market.  But just because their firmware is closed-source it's not necessarily unsafe to use their hardware wallet.  The Ledger is probably not as good of an example as the ColdCard, which is also closed source.Due to the way the ColdCard works (or can be configured to work) it may be (arguably) the safest hardware wallet on the market despite the fact that the firmware is closed-source.  It's not perfect, and has had some vulnerabilities exposed in the past, but so to has the Trezor and other open-source hardware wallets.",

It's closed-source nature is not a protection of any kind. Windows is closed-source and it has been vulnerable to many different attacks in the past and new ones will be found in the future as well. I am in the mood of another comparison. Imagine I gave 10 people a pill with instruction manuals detailing how it was made, what powders and ingredients were used, which symptoms it reduces, how it can be misused, what side affects it causes, who shouldn't take it, etc. And instead of reading it or looking at it but not understanding what it says, everyone just swallows their pill. That's open-source software for you. It doesn't do anyone any good if no one takes the time or knows what that pill is good for and if they should use it at all. However, its advantage is that you have that manual and it's up to you to inspect it. I repeat, open-source software that is widely used and has a big community of people who can be trusted with verifying what the code does is always better than a closed-source software that leaves anyone in the dark. But open-source does no one any favors if the code isn't independently checked thoroughly and every time code changes are made.",

Using open-source software above closed-source is a better choice, pretty much always. Hiding the source code doesn't mitigate the problems, but worsens them instead. If no peer can review the code, they can't respond to vulnerabilities as well. Furthermore, a hacker doesn't need the source code to accomplish an attack. There are dynamic attacks that are executed by observing the outputs from the inputs, static attacks that can use pattern-matches against binaries and attacks with the use of decompiler. So, even for non-reputable software, having it open-source is a better choice, because hiding the source code does more bad to honest reviewers than to hackers, regardless of the reputation.",
