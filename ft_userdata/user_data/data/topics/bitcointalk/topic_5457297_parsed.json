      "body": "Welcome to bitcointalk.One thing I have learnt from this forum and since I got into bitcoin is that you don't need to know everything that has to do with bitcoin like the advance technical part before you can inveest in it, all you need to do is how not to lose the money you have invested in bitcoin and how to keep your coin safe. And by \"losing your money\" I mean how to prevent selling below the price you bought.Since you're new to bitcoin I would you learn about security and privacy because that will enable you prevent some stupid mistake most of us made before realising it. Next is to learn about wallet so that you can easily distinguish between a non-custoial wallet and a custodial wallet, an open source wallet and a closed source, etcetera. As for the bitcoin itself it would be best if you learn how to do DCA because that the best way for newbies to get started without having to regret why they bought their coin at this price or at that price. But to effectively carryout DCA you're going to need discipline.https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works[General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?",

But it doesn't matter if you want to ask here because this is a very common discussion forum for everyone and at this point I will give the answer \"YES\" now is a very good time to invest in Bitcoin.But if you still don't have experience for such work, it's better for you to find out some tips about investing and also the risks first so that you can have some extraordinary understanding even though you still don't have experience for this. Because learning and practice are always needed for those who want to try it, but it must be remembered that every job is risky so everyone definitely needs their knowledge before trying it. By the way, what recommendations do you want now besides investing in Bitcoin? So that people here can provide a broader explanation for you.",

I remember when I joined the forum in 2017, honestly I thought I was too late in the game, but I made some money I think would never make if I had not known about bitcoin. I have also learned a lot about trading over the yearsJust so you know, it's all about persistence and learning something new. Do not go in with a mindset of getting rich quick overnight. Even the Bitcoin millionaires from the earlier days are millionaires today because they believed in Bitcoin and held it for years when it was still of no value.This should be good for a starter like you BITCOIN INFORMATION & RESOURCESThe forum also has so many educative threads if you use the search button and want to know about something",

You are experiencing what is called FOMO(fear of missing out) and this is driving you to want to invest in Bitcoin. Â  I just have one advice for you, it helped me too back then. Just because you feel intimidated by your friend who keeps talking about cryptocurrency or own them should not make you rush into investing without proper understand of the theories behind Bitcoin. You have to take your time, do research, study everything you need to know for now and as time goes on, you will get to know more. Dont rush into investing in Bitcoin and end up loosing everything. Remember Bitcoin is not a get rich quick program. Also it's a good thing you found your way here to this forum, as we have Bitcoin experts here who are willing to help you all through your journey as a bitcoiner.Here's a topic you can check out  introduction to Bitcoin",

So it's a perfect time to enter the market. But to maximize your investment try to do DCA(Dollar Cost Averaging)Quote from: esinka1903 on June 23, 2023, 11:04:35 AMWhat would you recommend for someone who has no previous experience? Do any of you have resources that you can recommend to me that will explain cryptocurrencies in the shortest and most simple way?I will suggest first to learn about crypto, know how it works and about it's potential. Then gather some experience and analysis the market. Because almost every newbies do wrong while investing in Bitcoin like they don't think about security issues or they do FOMO buy or fall into BullTrap. So better to analysis about Crypto , Bitcoin and Market then invest how much you can afford to loss. Again there are many resources to learn about crypto you can watch YouTube videos, read articles etc. To know about Bitcoin then read this article: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/To know about Cryptocurrencies: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-how-does-it-work/ read this one.",

To invest is the problem, and the problem is how do you understand the crypto market? Can you face the consequences ahead?

And another thing say is, how much do you have to buy bitcoin now? Because the more you buy and store the more you make profit when the bull market will kick start. Bitcoin is still on it bear market so it is the best time to buy and store in the non custodian wallets. But before you buy you have to set your buying time plan. Is it a long term purchase nor short term investment? These are things must be put into consideration.",

I guess all your friends are talking about how to get rich by investing in cryptocurrencies, and they're not interested in anything else. Such an approach usually means that there will not be too much success, because without knowing what you are investing in, it is only a question of who will fall into what trap. Learn first, understand the basics and don't invest more than you're willing to lose.Quote from: esinka1903 on June 23, 2023, 11:04:35 AMIf you have any success stories you would like to share, I would be very grateful if I could benefit from them as well...Don't go in that direction, because the internet is full of \"success stories\" of those who promote various crypto projects and want to catch you on their hook.

And it is not actually too late to invest in Bitcoin as no knows what the bottom is right now. Early this year the price was at 15k for sometime, then pushed through to 30k and later retraced to 24k. Currently, it has corrected itself to 30k price mark. There are lots of speculations about the price in the coming months but the truth is no one truly knows. We might be in for a bull run. The bitcoin halving is around the corner, which is actually a year from now and If you can grab a bag and hodl, I'm pretty certain you will be in profit when the bull season finally kicks in.
