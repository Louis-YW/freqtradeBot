Credit Suisse had some problems in previous years but this time it's wild. They delayed their annual report and announced that they have weaknesses in internal control which is awful for the bank. And the largest shareholders started saying that they won't give any money to Credit Suisse. People are withdrawing from this bank for the last 3 months but now it's got even worse. Because risk is getting higher, people move away from banks to invest in more stable assets. The US is helping banks to bail out depositors but banks still have to keep credit flowing which is pretty hard considering the loss of trust in this sector.

Most depositors probably won't get their money back, unless their deposits aren't guaranteed by the government. Credit Swiss will get help from the Swiss central bank and they will have enough liquidity to payout some deposits(and maybe some short term debts) so that the possibility of a bank run will be neutralized.2.The Federal Reserve could lend money to whoever they want, even to foreign banks. I don't see a problem here. Lending money isn't the same as giving money away for free.",

The situation does indeed seem concerning, especially with the delay of the annual report and weaknesses in internal control being identified. It's important for investors to keep a close eye on developments and assess the risks carefully before making any investment decisions. It's also good advice to exercise caution and wait for more information before taking any action, as the market can be unpredictable.Overall, it's important for investors to carefully evaluate the risks and potential rewards of investing in the banking sector, and to stay informed about developments that may impact their investments.

Credit Suisse has not had anything under control for a very long time. They've always been in one scandal or the other. When they're not in scandals they're in one financial trouble or the other. This is not the first time they're in a mess, the only difference is this time around they're in a very big mess. It's a surprise it took them so long to get to this level because they lost the trust of the public a long time ago.",

This bank has been a living dead for many years because of issues like financial management, poor decision, and fines due to tax invasion scandals. The constant increase of interest rates reveals the emptiness of the bank which led to the withdrawal of funds by its customers. The banking system is not transparent and truthful. Even when it is clear that banks need help, they will keep giving customers false hope that everything is okay. Every day it is getting clearer that the solution to this banking mess is decentralization. It is too risky to put the financial destiny of millions of people in the hands of a few corrupt people.",

When a large financial institution stumbles, the effects reverberate across the entire sector.It's interesting to see that people are withdrawing from Credit Suisse for the last three months, and now things are even worse. It makes sense that when risk is getting higher, people would move away from banks and invest in more stable assets. The US is helping banks to bail out depositors, but it's still a tough time for the banking sector.I think you're right that it's best to wait and see what happens next. Trying to predict where the market will move next is a pretty tough game, and it's always changing. But one thing is for sure, this situation is exciting and keeps us all on our toes!",

Even the government is not able to provide help because of the prevailing global crisis. Thus, I still believe that the banks failed due to poor management and the prevailing financial crisis in the world.  These banks aren't all new and are top-ranking in their countries, providing good interest rates and loans to their citizens. Most citizens now are struggling with debt and are unable to pay it back, resulting in an unbalanced financial situation and bankruptcy",

So, it is unlikely to have a major banking crisis in 2023.In my opinion, the banking system is now under threat.  This is due to the development of modern communication technologies.  Not a single bank in the world can avoid bankruptcy if all depositors simultaneously demand the return of their deposits.  At the same time, earlier the return of deposits was a lengthy bureaucratic procedure.  The depositor had to personally come to the bank, stand in line at the cashier, write a paper application, and only then his money was returned to him.  However, now everything has changed.  The depositor can get his money back from the bank by pressing a couple of virtual buttons on his smartphone.  At the same time, panic can theoretically be provoked by any blogger who writes articles on financial issues on the Internet.",

The Credit Suisse incident highlighted the importance of good risk management practices and the need for transparency and accountability in the banking sector.Credit Suisse has faced backlash and criticism for its involvement in high-risk investment strategies, including the collapse of Greensill Capital, a supply chain finance firm in which Credit Suisse invested. This led to financial losses for Credit Suisse and possible legal and regulatory consequences. The incident also raised questions about the bank's due diligence and risk management practices when dealing with high-risk investments.",

Luckily the Swiss government stepped in to back the bank and then UBS was in a position to take it over, restoring an element of calm around the recent banking crisis. The real problem is how lazy central bankers and governments were, taking the easy ride by keeping interest rates low for so long, allowing cheap money to flood into all sorts of places while stable government bonds were sidelined. They looked really clever, but in reality they got away with doing very little when rates were sub 2% and were praised as genuises - it was bound to cause a disaster eventually, especially now raises are so fast.",
