Bitcoin nodes from miners can have their own setups to exclude transactions with fee rates lower than a number like 1 sat/vbyte or whatever.",

      "body": "That’s pretty hard to tell because miners won’t reveal their fees threshold publicly. The default implementation rejects fees below 1 sat/vbyte and by extension, most miners won’t be able to see these transactions in the first place because they’re so poorly propagated.As of now, most miners to my knowledge require transactions which are directly propagated to them to be paying an extra fee directly to the pool. These transactions are not rare.",

Perhaps transactions with fee below 1 sat/vbyte can be accepted but that's basically the choice of the miners whether to accept or reject it but its practically possible.",

Not sure what your purpose is for asking this, OP, but considering transaction fees are very cheap right now, 1 sat/vB is fine. Just keep in mind that the confirmation time might take longer than usual.",

Or do they all just reject such transactions even if mempools are empty?Minimum miners are paying these days is 1 sat/vB, but we usually see in mempool.space is something around 5 sat/vB, so I would not risk going with bear minimum.Back in the days it would be possible to sent bitcoin transaction without any fees, but mining today is more about profit.You can however always start your own mining operations even with solo miner, but don't expect it to be very profitable.",

However, its probably difficult to tell given that mempools are often filled with txes paying above the minrelayfee.",
