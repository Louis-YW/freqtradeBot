Most of the buyers of video cards are miners. If the payback of this video card decreases to 1 year, then it will be in good demand in the market. And if we see a payback of 6 months in mining, then gamers will not be able to buy this video card in stores and will again scold the miners.",

The cost to reach that level may not pay off for AMD. They certainly made that calculation and it would be irrelevant to have the top gpu of this generation.Maybe next time it might be worth returning to the high-end market.Besides mining, there is still the fact that the gamer market has no game pushing the generation, as it was last time with Cyberpunk 2077. It is very hard to convince someone to change a 3xxx generation card for a 4xxx one or a 7900xt from AMD.Of course I also know that there are enthusiasts who always buy high end hardware and change every year, but the majority, where company makes more money is in the average user.I hope the next generation of cards comes along with an improvement in mining and we can have another race for cards hehehe.The only observation I make is that AMD can't stop in chip development in order not to be so far behind in the next generation.",

The problem is that 600W is too much, the RTX4090 was designed for 600 W. According to problems with the manufacturer, the cards were produced in a smaller manufacturing process and therefore the RTX4090 only need 450 W. and the AMD RDNA3 cards were not as good as AMD predicted, not bad, but also not at the point they wanted. An AMD 600W monster could beat the RTX4090, but it can also happen that this is not enough and that would be so bad for AMD.",

The professional tier cards could see 4x or more design to come quite quick.",

The reason why they made LHR was because if you went to any gaming forums you would see that people were extremely pissed off how Nvidia GPUs became unobtainable and were pissed at all the people who were trying to flip them. You basically were screwed if you were a hardcore gamer. PC Gamers HATED miners for this. And they complained to Nvidia that they will abandon their loyality for AMD if they don't do something soon.So the only reason LHR was implemented was to please those gamers.
