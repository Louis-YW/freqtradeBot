There are images that the forum is against, and if you try uploading such an image, it won't be visible on the forum. If you don't mind, sharing the image here or the link could be helpful. It will make it easier for others to identify the possible reasons for that.Edit: information from  joker_josue few minutes ago, the site is down for now so you should try and using other alternative QuoteINFORMATION: We are having a problem with DNS, which is already being treated.
