  "content": "I've read about this new L2 scaling solution for Bitcoin called \"Ark\". Supposedly, it's better than the Lightning Network since it's private by default. There isn't much info about it on the web, only a short explanation of how it works. It'd be interesting to \"play with it\" after launch. You can read more about it here: https://ark-protocol.org/Will this new network replace the LN in the future? Or am I comparing apples vs oranges? Do you think privacy-oriented off-chain scaling solutions for Bitcoin will succeed in the long run? I'm having my doubts about this, considering the recent government crackdowns on mixers.Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",
