Hello there,We have noticed some exposure to high-risk services on your wallet, and we would need to do a quick verification (KYC).Since I've done the verification a few months ago, this email  surprised me a lot. Anyway, I've uploaded my data a second time and the wallet balance just disappeared after right away. The answer is:Hello there,Your funds are frozen and will not be shown on your wallet until the verification is not completed or is still ongoing.I wonder are they logged in into my account and withdraw the money ?

They don't have access to your wallet, but when you initiate the exchange, you basically sent them your BTC.The issue has nothing to do with Exodus wallet though, it's the exchange (a third-party service) they were using that blocked the transaction because they detected suspicious activity with your address. If you submitted your documents, what I would suggest you do, is to try and reach out to the exchange's support directly and give them your order/TX IDs.",

Any suggestions?ThanksStop using Exodus, and stop using centralized exchanges.  There have been some recent efforts by centralized exchanges to preemptively comply with regulatory agencies by contracting with blockchain analysis companies.  Blockchain analysis is a joke, and an arbitrary one at that.  Their methods are not coordinated with each other, and findings are inconsistent.  They have no legitimate leg to stand on in their claims.The regulatory agencies don't care about bitcoin, and the efforts by these greedy blockchain analysis organizations are hurting bitcoin.  Any exchange that contracts with blockchain analysis companies should be considered bitcoin saboteurs, and they don't deserve a single satoshi of your money.More details can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401468.msg60292655#msg60292655",

They will probably ask you for a proof of income if they haven't already.Next time, If you want to avoid KYC when dealing with large amounts, I would recommend going with an exchange like OKX where the KYC policy is more clear. You only have to submit your documents when you want to exceed a certain withdrawal amount. It's less convenient than trading within the wallet obviously, but at least you know your limits ahead.",

Did they logged in into my account? I don't think so. You tried to swap the coins. That means a transaction was made from your wallet to that of the instant exchange that was used. That's where the swap happens. When it's done, the exchange sends you your new coins to the wallet address you provided. This all happens in the background and you don't see it. Since your assets were flagged for whatever reason (my guess is because the amount is quite big), the instant exchange froze your crypto and is now asking who you are and how you got it.",

The question is how did they withdraw the funds from my wallet?Did they logged in into my account? As I previously mentioned, they can't access your wallet. If you used the built-in instant-exchange (and not FTX)... It should be something like this:You send them the BTC (to their personal wallet) -> You wait until the transaction gets confirmed -> They run KYT[1] (or something similar)  -> If everything is good, then they send you the ETH. If not, they ask you to verify your identity first.It was you who sent them the bitcoin when you initiated the trade. Everything happens automatically in the background without you having to copy/paste the address and amount. But If you check your BTC address on Blockchain.com, you'll see that the bitcoins were sent somewhere else.[1] https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-kyt/",
