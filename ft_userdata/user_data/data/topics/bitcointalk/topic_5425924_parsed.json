I see your commitment to this activity.But I know that on freelance sites today, many different offers are paid in bitcoin. If you have the skills of a translator or know how to write articles correctly, you can offer yourself there. In the same way, some sites offer to test games that, after the test, are also paid in bitcoin. But here, you need to undergo training to competently look for errors. Therefore, in our time, finding additional income is not a problem; the problem is the lack of skills people have.",

OP obviously already has a way of making money and is happy with it. here he just wants to hear how others earn bitcoin. considering that he introduces himself as a \"hunter-manager\", I believe he knows everything about ranking on the forum and the potential opportunities from it.I don't think that someone who makes good money in a specific way will just share details about it. why would he attract additional competition?as in some previous similar topics, most of the comments will end with the same answers. it all comes down to bounty hunting and airdrop.",

You could get lucky if at least one of them would give you bigger rewards. Trading is a common way to make money, but you need some capital to start but there will be no guarantees or promises that you’ll get profit daily because of the market uncertainties.Joining testnet tasks is also another way, but most of them aren’t worth it and it’s time consuming. Only a handful of testnets are successful and gives higher payouts.You can also become an ambassador by joining multiple ambassador opportunities. There are some play to earn games who are actually looking for beta testers and ambassadors too.For long term, I suggest you start building your own crypto community whether if it’s Telegram, Discord, etc. Once you have gained big numbers organically, you can start entertain paid services like pinned post, AMAs, etc. Also for long term, be a crypto content creator either Youtube, Tiktok, articles, etc.",

If you are satisfied with the $100 per week that is good but you can increase your earnings through the suggestion above. However, you can increase it by looking at other options like investing your earnings into bitcoin or trading when your salary arrives. Freelancers are thee most common at this day, if you have skills then, earning in crypto is not that hard for you.",

Second, you must have the skills needed for the job to do it because if you don't have the skills required then you are most likely not getting that job. The easiest one is to join bounty campaigns and get paid later. The problem with bounty campaigns are most of it are scams and you can hardly find a legit one to actually get paid.",

In fact, this day be sure to get malware from links you will click while hunting airdrops. I don't encourage anyone to indulge it. Talking about trading, how do you earn passively on it when we all know that trading is an active engagement?QuoteAnd there is one more option that is staking.

I have an Upwork account as  well, but we all know that they just allow USD payments and not crypto, unless they do support it in the future which is I doubt will happen just how long it was suggested before in their community page.
