  "content": "How does the ZAP feature work on JediSwap This are questions many of the crypto community are asking.I am going to put it in layman's understanding....Zap on Jediswap for example is providing Liquidity from a single asset to a liquidity pair.Normally, for anyone to provide liquidity like USDT/USDC pair on any decentralized exchange, the user have to swap ETH to $USDT, swap ETH to $USDC, approve both assets and then add the pair as liquidity. Paying for transaction fees on each action. Ordinarily, users are supposed to first bridge their $ETH from layer1 to Layer2.But with #ZAP, it a one-time click and you will be a liquidity provider for the USDT/USDC pair on #Jediswap. Eliminating all those extra manual actions of bridging ETH from Layer1 to layer2, swapping and providing Liquidity, including eliminating those extra fees.Thanks to Wido Finance and Jediswap, to provide this fantastic feature.Visit jediswap https://jediswap.xyz/If you like how I have explained the ZAP feature on JediSwap , kindly like, share so other can learn. And don't forget to follow me for more thread in the future.",
