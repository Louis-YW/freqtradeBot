      "body": "So you basically want a bot which will read out certain events such as CPI prints, employment numbers, etc and take a trade based on that info?A bot like this is very professional grade and you will also need a quick connection to your brokerage for it to work, since you are going to be trading against many other high frequency traders out there.Generally you need to build this from scratch if you want it to work perfectly. Can’t buy such a bot for $50.",

I just don't understand why the data should be taken from cme?",
