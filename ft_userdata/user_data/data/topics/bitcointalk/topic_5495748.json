  "content": "The relationship of every human being with the economic system of a country is continuous and acts as a driving force. Through individual efforts, the recognition of his work at every stage is definitely through the overall welfare of the country. Recognition of good deeds of people can reward him in various ways and even take nobel.I would like to quote a man named \"Nayib Bukele\" who is the President of \"El Salvador\". We see from his personal history that he was a businessman and has been serving as president since 2019. He adopted Bitcoin as legal tender within 2 years of coming to power. This is certainly the first case in the world that the first recognition of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. But we also know the historical price history of Bitcoin before that, how high it has been in just 15 years. BTC can act as a hedge in favor of a country's development which can contribute to controlling inflation in that country. Citizens of every country can use BTC to protect their wealth in times of financial distress and inflation. Many developing countries lack access to traditional banking services, but bitcoin provides an unprecedented way for everyone worldwide to participate in the economy without a bank account.I am saying that many countries will continue to recognize bitcoin in the future as a result of individual efforts and concerted efforts. As a result of individual efforts, it is accepted as legal tender in \"El Salvador\". This is possible because of the efforts of \"Nayib Bukele\". So many may emerge in the future in an effort to have bitcoin accepted as legal tender by many more countries. I also know that it is capped at 21 million coins and 18.7 million of them have already been mined.What do you think the overall situation could be if more countries recognize Bitcoin?",

Recognition of good deeds of people can reward him in various ways and even take nobel.The Human Right Foundation last month launched the Finney Freedom Prize,  it is an award designed in Hal Finney’s memory to celebrate global achievements in the area of Bitcoin and human rights. Hal Finney is the first to receive this award posthumously. There are nominations for other individuals who have contributed positively to the growth of Bitcoin. If we wait for countries to do this, it will never happen so organizations, CSOs, NGOs, NPOs focused on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are taking up the initiative.QuoteLaureates will be recognized for their contributions to Bitcoin and human rights within specific halving periods and will receive a monetary prize of 1 Bitcoin (BTC) along with a physical award.Nominations and selections for future laureates will be managed by the Genesis Committee, composed of notable figures in the Bitcoin community, including Farida Nabourema, Lisa Neigut, and Obi Nwosu, among others.The committee will evaluate candidates based on their educational efforts about Bitcoin, contributions to its technology, promotion of decentralization, and efforts to enhance Bitcoin’s accessibility, particularly under oppressive regimes.https://cryptoslate.com/human-rights-foundation-launces-finney-freedom-prize-to-reward-contributions-to-bitcoin-for-110-years/",

My prediction is that more nations might invest in Bitcoin for profit making but not many will make it a legal tender like El Salvador. It is on record that some countries are holding Bitcoins because they intend to make a profit from them in the future. However, not many nations will want to make Bitcoin legal because it will make them lose control of the financial system of the nation. It is also important to note that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against inflation only if it can be kept for a long time since its price also fluctuates. We have also taken note that only BItcoin cannot protect a nation from inflation. Other economic solutions must be put in place to curb national inflation. If more nations adopt Bitcoin it will increase awareness and adoption. Bitcoin's use as a currency will also increase because more businesses might begin to adopt it as currency for the payment of goods and services. Bitcoin might also be used as a means of payment in international trade. This might also lead to an increase in the value of the coin.",

One aspect of it is for the government to be interested in adopting bitcoin as a legal tender, another aspect of it is in seeing people going for bitcoin irrespective of the government decision towards it, which i think the second aspect is what is happening currently with the world as at today while the first instance is what is happening in El-Salvador and the president whereby they have the right leader who is so interested in the affairs of the people and bitcoin adoption in other to help them achieve their financial goals.",

The economy of a country will not be saved from inflation simply because the country adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. If the nation adds bitcoins to its reserves it will gain from the appreciation of the asset, but if the country does not export goods or services or attract investors and tourists, the economy will be disposed to inflation.Even if businesses choose to pay workers in Bitcoin, it will be adjusted with changes in inflation.- Jay -",

There likely won't be any notable shifts in adoption.  Similar to what occurred in El Salvador, there may be resistance from certain people due to their distrust in it as a currency.  This could potentially steer people towards stablecoins and altcoins like Monero.  However, I doubt people would conduct Bitcoin transactions in its current form.  They would probably be directed to create a wallet account, such as Chivo, which lacks self-custody.Interesting statistics from El Salvador:  https://www.statista.com/topics/8401/bitcoin-in-el-salvador.

I think Bitcoin is good as it is at the movement and we don't want countries to recognise t as currency but as an alternative to the fiat. There is a thin line between recognition and trying to control which I am afraid may happen if they hold huge chunk but they will never be able to control completely.",

And accepting bitcoin can bring a huge amount of attention and awareness to how it works and the applications it brings to life. But the truth is that things are perfect, it's just the way we use them that creates opposition/support, like last year people tried to label money laundering activities through bitcoin. In fact, the fiat system is something they don't talk about much and especially the ethical issues in using it.So no matter how things turn out, it is a journey that we may or may not know along with bitcoin's development, but from a personal perspective, I still really support this special  with bitcoin.",

Many developing countries lack access to traditional banking services, but bitcoin provides an unprecedented way for everyone worldwide to participate in the economy without a bank account.You are 100% right about btc being a hedge against inflation but the main concerns should not to use it as long-term asset or to save your funds value for the long term in times of financial distress or inflation but as it can serve that purpose so we should definitely use it. You are right about BTC availability but to some extent only as many developing countries still face trouble in buying and selling BTC for fiat. For example, where it's banned, not legalized, banks are not safe places. But still, people come up with alternative ways to get their hands on BTC. Quote from: laijsica on May 08, 2024, 12:29:54 PMWhat do you think the overall situation could be if more countries recognize Bitcoin? More countries will recognize BTC means more adoption and more demand while the supply is lesser due to scarcity and till 2140, everyone is going to be in profit as fee won't be that high till then at least that's what I think. Overall that would be a great thing, I have seen many people are making efforts individually at bigger level as there are many influencers in Pakistan struggling to make it legal, and I have seen many efforts by Nigerians as well. I am not saying other's don't make efforts I just wrote what I watched.",

This question can be answered personally even without asking anyone, IMO.  By knowing the law of supply and demand and how citizen reacts on any item recognized by the government.  It is obvious that when an item, company, stocks, or any other stuff is recognized by the government, a massive adoption or massive interestest will be poured in on that stuff.  And with the nature of Bitcoin having a fixed amount of total supply, there is no other way for the market of Bitcoin to surge in the long run.Quote from: bluebit25 on May 08, 2024, 06:41:16 PMQuote from: laijsica on May 08, 2024, 12:29:54 PM(...)What do you think the overall situation could be if more countries recognize Bitcoin?

Yes, that's true, but for Inflation to be totally eliminated, Bitcoin is not the only tool for it, as though Bitcoin helps individual's fund not to depreciate with inflation, but it can not safe the entire country from been hit by inflation if basic measures aren't been put in place, such as control over wages, inflow and outflow of funds and increase in productivity.
