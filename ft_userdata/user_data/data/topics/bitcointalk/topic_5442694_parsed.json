You can't send funds from your channel to bitcoin addresses.The funds has to be on-chain first to be able to send to paper wallets.For that, you'll have to close the channel and proceed to create an on-chain transaction with multiple outputs (if Raspiblitz doesn't support 'pay-to-many', use a wallet that can do so).Since you only have 1 channel open, \"close all\" will do: https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz#close-all-closing-all-open-channels",

I have 7 channels opened and I had tried the \"close all open channels\" option, but I think the funds had been locked-up after using that option. I only have part of the fund on chain now , 60000 satochi and the rest are locked. the ballance looks like this. Yet, I could not send the on-chain fund, because of the locked funds.

I created them offline. Your suggestion about Bech32 addresses (Native Segregated Witness - SegWit) is nice and I'm trying to work on it right now.I noted that segwitaddress generate the public key without the QR. How can I generate the private key alongside with the public key alongside with their QRs as well?Is there a way to do that ? Below is the format of the paper wallet I am giving  to the tenagers See image here:",

But doing that 20 times is painstaking and it's easy to make a mistake.Your suggestion is a great option and the best way to put the security consciousness into the practise from the start. So, I get the Electrum wallet installed and start preparing the 20 wallets manually. I downloaded the Electron to my desktop to have the wallet on my local network.But as I was checking the detail of each adress I generated through Electrum, I saw that type of script is on \"p2pkh\" and not p2wpkh which is the Bech32. And on the aspect of the interaction to Ligthning network it stated that - Not available for this wallet, \"No disponible para esta monedero.\"How do I adjust the setting to permit payment from LN and to interact with my LND Wallet? Side question to broaden my understanding:The Electrum wallet I installed, by default created 30 adresses and each adresses has unique public key and private keys. There is also this  Derivation Path \"Rutas de Derivación\" that starts as : m/0/0  for 1st  adress  and run up to  : m/0/29 for the the last one.I thought that the wallet has one public key and many (30 ) adresses to keep the privacy of the owner. I just hope to clear this so that 30 adresses  will not end up been to same wallet and adress after giving it out to various users...Is it normal that the adress assigned to each public key to be one to one?",

Those (12?) words are enough to recover everything. I think you confuse the master public key for public keys: with the master public key it's possible to create a watch-only wallet for all addresses inside your wallet. You don't need that, what you need for your case is just the individual private keys an addresses.",

The Breez wallet has some impressive functionality that really serves the project, because one of these functionalities permits users to buy Carrefour gift card with their Bitcoin. The Carrefour gift cards can be used for full or partial payment at any Carrefour hypermarket or Carrefour Market stores. Remaining balance will be stored on the card and can be used on future purchases with 1 year expiry from the activation date. At the absence of a truly endogenous ecosystem in the crypto world, this type of cash out could be good as transitory phase to a complete endogenous ecosystem.This week, we will be doing a test run with BREEZ, as the team has won their first prize in bitcoin, they did the 3 straight win with clean sheets to claim the prize.Stay tune  to read the post about the test run...",
