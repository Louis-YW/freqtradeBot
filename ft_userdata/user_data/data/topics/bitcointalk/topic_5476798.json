I believe the dump will be slow because it will be hard to lose 20k on bitcoin",

It doesn't even come close to doubling the previous ath with that figure, so that's the minimum we expect because not to do so would be catastrophic in terms of expected future returns. But I see the latter as a very unlikely scenario.",

      "body": "It looked little bit skeptical up until few months ago but if we look at the pace with which Bitcoin is approaching $50k it won't take longer for Bitcoin to achieve $100k,  If Bitcoin continues to pump at the same rate then we may even see Bitcoin touching $100k even by the end of this year but end of December has usually been disastrous for Bitcoin hence If we are able to overcome this then we could see Bitcoin achieving 6 figure by end of this year of early 2024. I am making these prediction based on current market trend, but if we have correction phase before halving or by the end of this year then we would be achieving this number somewhere towards second quarter or last quarter of 2024.",

The price could go through the roof.  Now hitting six figures by 2025 isn't guaranteed.  but with more companies and regular folks buying digital coins, Im feeling pretty optimistic about Bitcoin's path ahead.",

Whether it's right or wrong, no one knows, we're just predicting and don't know if it's accurate or not.You know some of the big guys in bitcoin have predicted a lot ranging from $100K - $500K even $1M worse Saylor predicts bitcoin will reach the $5M mark, that's a crazy number but we never know how high the price of bitcoin is which is obviously quite positive that bitcoin will soon go to $100K.",

I think what you meant was people predicted a new ATH next year and not this year, although there were some predictions towards it but most people didn’t predict a new ATH a year or months to the halving. Base on past halving trends some even predicted 2025 as the new ATH year but with the recent developments and FOMO narratives around this the ETF approval I think we will actually see a new ATH even if we don’t touch the $100k next year. New ATH should start from the price of $70k and with hype of ETF approval causing this price rise then it’s approval next year will cause more pump so we can actually touch that new ATH but should it be rejected or delay then a new ATH will either be late next year or 2025",

This leads me to believe the price is artificially depressed and looking for price discovery. So it could break $100K next year, but by the end of 2025 anyone should be expecting at least a $140K Bitcoin price and if you believe the market will play catchup due to Fatal last cycle, it isn’t absurd to think it could hit $400K by the end of 2025.",

      "body": "This is is also what I'm thinking giving the latest market behaviour. If I'm asked what could be the reason for the recent surge in price, I have nothing to point to other than the fact that many people are buying and holding in anticipation of a bull run next year. What is strange is the fact that a move with the momentum we see in the market of recent is usually propelled by strong positive news but this time around, just forces of demand and supply is driving the market without any strong news. This is an indication that the move will be very vigorous when supported by strong fundamental such as the halving and ETF approval. So, the chances of Bitcoin reaching $100k before 2025 is high and I'm looking forward to it.",
