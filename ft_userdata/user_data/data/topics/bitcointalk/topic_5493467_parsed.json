Because if the market trajectory is correct, they'd still be able to make a profit out of mining since the price will only get higher even if the rewards have been halved, I'm sure that we will reach a floor price eventually and quitting isn't the right thing to do especially if you've been doing good as a bitcoin miner in a while now. What are you talking about earning less? That's not a problem in the long-term, it's going to balance itself eventually, this happened back then with the previous halving, and with less and less rewards, it's going to make bitcoin more scarce than usual.",

Because one thing I have come to understand is that the more the reward for Bitcoin is reduced to half (i.e Halving) the more the price value of Bitcoin skyrocket due to it's limited supply for the increase in demand.",

They usually hodl on for a long term and when they sell it usually causes a market dip or correction. Smaller miners after halving will simply sell off their mining rigs because it wouldn’t be profitable again or may merge with other pool miners to continue. Anyone that happens I don’t see miners been greatly affected like we put it out. The reward will be halved and base on past events price of each bitcoin will go up too",

If you want to ask anything about the miners I know comparison creates a reference but in the context of reference, you are eliminating the core of the question.Hmm, from the established question what I've got is you are asking about the future of manners, bro on every halving event the Bitcoin production rate decreases the cost per Bitcoin increases as a reverse proportion, and with the increase in production cost the market value also increase, so if your concern is about the profitability of the mining Bitcoin then bro its already covered in much detailed stuff and references which available on many source but keeping it restricted to a few words I would say as far as the equilibrium of the demand and supply exist in the crypto market the mining is profitable, also its not only block reward which miners get there's a major portion of incentive n term of fees which miners earn.",

Small miners who will face difficulty are those who pay for their electricity. Maintaining mining operations when the rewards are reduced and electricity bill hasn't will not be sustainable. However, small miners who generate their own electricity using renewable sources will be able to maintain their operations. It will be difficult but they will manage because there will be no heavy expenditure on electricity. Small miners plan ahead on how to stay in business. And electricity is a major concern for them.",

There are very few miners or solo miners due to the level of competition in the industry. It is what the whale miners do that is of consequence to the entire industry and it should be more of the same they have been doing already - try to consolidate more hashrate and get more blocks/profits. It is a company and they function as such with sectors allocated for keeping the miners running and adjusting to changes in the coinbase reward.- Jay -",

But one thing's for sure, regardless of what happens after the halving, large miners from centralized pools will continue their businesses as usual, there's nothing that's stopping them anyway, and it's too late for them to quit now especially since these types of miners in particular are the ones that dished out millions of dollars to set up sustainable mining rigs.",
