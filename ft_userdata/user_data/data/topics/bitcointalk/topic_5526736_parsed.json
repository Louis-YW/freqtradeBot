By the way, it is not still technically clear to me how the achieve this image inscription and I guess there are a lot I don't know yet.",

Recently, I saw an old xFiles - from 1993 - and the young boy produced a huge, hand-coded, multi-page, stunning image of his sister who had been abducted by aliens. Can we be certain Mara pool and/or Trump are not controlled by aliens?",

Whether it was the government of my own country when they decided to first blame their own incompetency (power shortage) on bitcoin miners only to regulate and restrict mining to tax it. Or the US government (not any particular administration) which categorized internet as a military battlefield decades ago and has been assigning 4-star military generals to it with tens of billions of dollars budget dedicated to mine people's data on it, running the biggest surveillance operation in the world!Quote from: Poker Player on January 18, 2025, 05:02:09 AMQuote from: pooya87 on January 18, 2025, 03:47:30 AMFuture is starting to look darker for Decentralization...It would have been much, way much darker in this regard with Kamala in power.I don't see it that way. I see a trend of increasing surveillance, regulation/restriction, crackdown and shutting down anything decentralized that may help improve privacy like mixers, etc. That trend started a long time ago and is only getting worse every year as Bitcoin grows. Different administrations in the US may take a different approach but that trend is unchanging. Trump is just more radical than Harris but they both operation within the same regime...",

I choose to see this from different angle actually, I dont think the reason for mara pool deciding to mine the portrait of Trump into a bitcoin block is to necessarily call for more control and regulation from his (trump) administration.Trump like we all know is the very first crypto president, and alot of people in the crypto space are honoring him in different ways for that, any body can decide how he or she chooses to honor the first crypto president, and if this is mara pool's way of doing that, I see nothing wrong in this, it's a very creative way actually, and I commend the effort and money spent on this.For some of us, this actually is showing us that cool stuffs like this can be done on the blockchain aside transaction confirmation and all that.",
