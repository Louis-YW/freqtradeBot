  "content": "Well, as the title says, US Congressman Warren Davidson has filed legislation against SEC and to fire Gary Gensler. He shared this news on Twitter at 10:13 PM · Jun 12, 2023.This legislation will force SEC to rebuild its laws against digital assets and will reconsider its acts against tokens declared as \"securities\". Well, no wonder, last week was full of attacks from SEC and the market has bled a lot, many people are saying they have misused their power and some said they were just following orders from other congress.Quote from: https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-102.pdfCongress enacted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) in part to provide for the regulation of the national securities markets. And Congress charged the SEC with protecting investors, preserving fair and orderly markets, and facilitating capital formation, in part through a series of registration, disclosure, recordkeeping, inspection, and anti-conflict-of-interest provisions Well, the point is, What's good in all the steps against declaring those tokens as securities? (note* i am not in favor of any of those tokens just interested in the story). That's still a mystery for me, but now it has become more interesting, like how things will move now against them and what reaction are we going to see from them, i personally have no information about Congressman Warren Davidson, like how much potential his words and case will put against SEC and Gensler? it could be a trick (artificial case/fake one to take more severe steps to make the market bleed more, as i think these are all the tricks to buy more BTC at a lower price! (i might be wrong and open all ears) or this might be a true case and Warren Davidson really stands for his words. (Or i am being too skeptical?).Well, its looks like, he really wants Gary to be out of this even though he filed against SEC to reconstruct their laws, and still the main aim is to fire Gary. SourceThere are many ifs, but what if the next SEC chair is the next level avatar of Gary Gensler, (haha) well i think that's why he mainly focused on the structure of making commissioners to follow the Executive Director.",

The SEC's actions look too strange. It is unlikely that America is ready to really show the world its weakness in terms of combating cryptocurrencies, because the SEC decisions offered now are characterized by their inflexibility",

I think unless he is actually fires then most likely it’ll go nowhere.It’s not that easy to fire him. It’ll have to go thru legislation which will take time. And keep in mind that Gary has a lot of power from many people in the high ups. You can’t just easily fire him like you would a McDonald’s workers.",

      "body": "Resistance to declaring certain tokens as securities may require the intervention and regulation of financial regulators, such as the SEC. This can require attorneys and financial professionals to make the right legal choices to prevent abuse or risk to investors. Regarding Warren Davidson's advice and filing against the SEC, this could also be his objection to the SEC's regulatory process in the crypto space. However, it is your right and this must be respected. Focusing on the structure and commissioners of the SEC to comply with the right legislation can be a fundamental solution to the problem associated with declaring tokens as securities. However, some questions still need to be answered and the process needs to be done carefully and methodically to ensure transparency and fairness for all stakeholders.",

AFAIK, Gary Gensler isn't the biggest crypto hater in the world.Not exactly a conspiracy -- lobbyists groups are behind most legislation in U.S. politics, going so far as to writing bills for the U.S. congress to rubber stamp not having actually read the proposed legislation. That's normally how U.S. politics works anyways. These congresspeople don't have the technical knowledge of the markets or crypto to rely solely on their own knowledge and intuition.Even if it's a lobbying group behind Warren Davidson's efforts, his reasonings for wanting to fire Gensler are not unreasonable: https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1648379560122105882?s=20As a side note, are we really surprised a former Goldman sachs executive appointed by Joe Biden is anti-crypto? He doesn't have to be the biggest crypto hater in the world to do some damage unfortunately.",

Even if they had a great one, it's quite important to spread the power into multiple people instead of having just one person.This way it would allow the SEC to be controlled by multiple people and that will benefit the nation even more. If they are aiming at 6, that means you would need 4 people out of those 6 to decide on something to act like Gary did, in most cases I would agree with that because that is the majority and you have to accept the wishes of the majority even if you disagree with them, that is democracy and even with its flaws, there isn't anything better so far. I believe that the best thing to do right now is to change the structure right away, would be lovely.",

The SEC has gone wild while making their decisions on the digital assets. I mean if you keep reading about the SEC directory then you will see they have declared every other crypto currency as security one after another and making it worse now with Bitcoin too. They are trying so hard to put down bitcoin too and keep trying to collect the bad evidences against it to make it look like as more of a security. I’m not sure how far this is going to be but it has to end now. This is why the decision by OHIO chair has taken is right on the path.

The SEC's mission is investor safety and market integrity. The only thing Gensler is doing is enforcing the rules of the game. To be sure, Davidson seems to be the hero who stands up to the wrongdoers. A more tamed version of this market might be Gensler's goal. Keep in mind that despite their prominence, even Coinbase and Binance are not exempt to the law. The government's minds are not open to us, agreed. But assuming anti-crypto conspiracies so soon is unrealistic. Perhaps this is a sign of increased oversight rather than a cryptoslaughter!",
