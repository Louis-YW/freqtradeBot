  "content": "There are many ways to earn money in crypto. DeFi is full of new projects every day. But now in the bear market, probably the safest way to earn money is staking.Itâ€™s better to diversify your risks, if you are trading or investing in IDO, it is appropriate to put part of the portfolio on stake. And then you go minding your own business. Meanwhile you will be rewarded with tokens for your commitment to the project and their token, and for the liquidity you provided, which you can always get out of the pool and get back at any time.If you are looking for an inexpensive token with an impressive interest rate for staking, then bRing Finance https://bring.finance/ is just that.It is a staking platform that specializes in liquidity staking and farming pools. Those guys have a pool on BNB Chain with a wild APR for staking. In order to stake, you need to buy a token, add liquidity (DEX) and throw the LP token in the pool.They also have their own Bridge, through which you can transfer BRNG from network to network.All mechanics are described in the Lightpaper (https://bring.gitbook.io/bring/). There is an audit of the smart contract and a decent number of partner projects.What about staking? Where do you stake and what is important to you in staking?",
