It might be considered spam and might be deleted in some board. If you have an information or or idea you want to share, learn how to write it in an engaging and matured way so as to pass a comprehensive information to the reader.Understand that it's not everyone that uses kuda and so, some might not even know what had happened to kuda and just making a one lined statement like the one you just did won't give someone the right clue on the subject you are writing on.I found this post bellow very helpful while writing and I think you should go through it and come back next time with a matured and more enriching thread.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5136703.msg50793983#msg50793983",
