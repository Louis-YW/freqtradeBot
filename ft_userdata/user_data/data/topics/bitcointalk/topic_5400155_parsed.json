  "content": "Hello readers, I don't know if this is for here, but I want to tell you about netreputation.com and its scheme for taking money for nothing. If you ask me it's a total scam! I wanted some bad links to be removed and I paid them a lot of money to do it. They promised that in 6 months period all will be taken care off.. After so many time spend in waiting, nothing was done, nothing was suppressed, nothing was removed, but my money was taken. Nobody wants to return the money, because in their words - they have worked during these 6 months, but even if they didn't succeeded with the job, it has been written in their website, that there is no guarantee that there will be a result. At this point there is nothing that I can do, except for telling my long story in short and informing the people about the outcome of their ''services''. Maybe they will try to remove this thread, but seeing how they work I doubt they will be able to. If you ever need this type of services, this is not your website... netreputation.com is a scam and you will be truly disappointed.",

More details are needed such as proof of payment, chat screenshots etcSecondly, always use trusted escrow service providers whenever you are carrying out such kinds of deals so that when they don't meet their end of the bargain, you can always get back your money.",

Any form of scam or fraud can pretty much be reported here.QuoteWhat bad links you wanted removed? If you're so innocent, let's be fair and share those bad links.Why don't you just speak up and say you are part of Netreputaton.com inside of hiding behind a brand-new account and attacking someone.Quote from: TopGun2022 on June 06, 2022, 02:44:57 PMYou're an idiot.If this is how you Netreputaton.com communicate, then I have more doubts about your so-called service.",
