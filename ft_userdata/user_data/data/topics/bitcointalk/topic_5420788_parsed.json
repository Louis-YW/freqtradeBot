  "content": "After a fourth reduction since I deposited my stablecoins on Binance's savings and staking options, I decided to withdraw all my funds, provided that I find a decent alternative, preferably decentralized. Binance is now offering only 6% APY on BUSD and 5% on USDT, for up to $1.000 on each option. It's honestly too little to stay; it used to be 10% of $2.000. I found a few vaults on Beefy ranging from 8–12%, which isn't too bad. However, the one that struck me the most was OKx's saving plans.The OKx exchange is offering 10% for up to $2,000 per stablecoin (USDC, USDT), but on one condition. That you submit for Level 2 KYC, which includes your personal details plus a photo of your ID. Surprisingly, the KYC process requires far less information compared to Binance. What are your thoughts about this? 10% isn't bad; it doesn't state for how long it's valid, but it's quite competitive with Beefy's vaults.https://www.okx.com/earn/stablecoin",

By just depositing your coins, you get 6% APY. Ain't that too good to be true?  Even the youtuber financial advisers know it's too good to be true but they are promoting staking on CEX. They weren't even aware of the risk. Binance is a trusted exchange we just don't know when they're gonna flip until we lost it all like the celebrities promoting FTX.",

Don't get me wrong, I'm not supporting the usage of OKx for staking; I'm mostly concerned that they're offering a significantly higher APY (10% instead of 2%), just by verifying your ID. Why does it make such a huge difference?My main question is where you'd stake your stablecoins now. The only decentralized platform I have used and am comfortable using is Beefy, but I'm pretty sure there are others out there. I'd prefer if a user here could recommend one, not because I can't do my own research but because sometimes blogs and websites might be promoting a specific one on purpose.",

Whatever the reason behind it, it is not reliable to leave money in centralized exchanges nowadays, after the FTX crash, most of the investors massively withdrew their entire assets to their personal wallets. As a top priority right now, assets should be stored in a non-custodial wallet and not invested or left on any exchange.",

This is also what I am thinking, lol. This is not the first time. If you remember Terra Luna, they have this platform called Anchor where you need to stake LUNA's stablecoin UST with high APY. And shit happens, their APY is 20% which you will get the 20% for a year but in just a day you will lose more than 20% of its value. Really not worth, and now this FTX exchange happened. It's totally devastating.",

Will they use user capital sent to their platform for staking in order to join Ponzi scheme or use it as collateral for their high leverage bet?",

The thing with staking is that you practically have a semi-steady source of income every month, no matter what. It feels similar to having money in a bank account but with much higher interest. However, back when I was actively trading Bitcoin, most of my trades yielded an average of 7–10% return, which was approximately 30–40 dollars per successful trade. Even with two successful trades per month, my profit was way higher than what stablecoin staking is generating.",

      "body": "Oh, so Binance has already changed their APY for staking stablecoins. Before it was like 8%-10% for a $2k maximum deposit, I saw it too, and then the rate will drop when you get to deposit and stake more than $2k.Now, it's like 5%-6% and $1k maximum for that interest rate. Well, that's a sudden change and that's why we should be careful where we're staking our assets even if they're the most known exchange worldwide, still, those rates/APY will change at their will. I guess that's normal for them to still sustain everyone's deposits.",
