Comr. your talk na correct one. You see as the policy be, na gradual process wey everybody go take adapt to the system. All this kind of policy dey take time before e dey fully come to actualization. During President Buhari military regime, he changed the naira note and he did not put pressure for the naira swap not until the old note gradually was removed from existence and the new naira note was fully in circulation, Buhari never pressure any bank or organization to inact  any law and punishment for the change of note compared to this current situation. The CBN governor is bereft of ideas to run the affairs of the organization he is incharge of but I believe it will take time for Nigerians to adapt to the new policy which came to existence last year.For the fact that kaduna state governor made a statement as regards the old naira still accepted in kaduna is not a big deal although he is in the main stream government and currently likely to go against the president's directives but he is doing it for the sake of his people. People are going through lots as there no funds in circulation. Let me tell you do you think it is every purchase you do that accepts transfer? How about the market traders? Have you gone to the market to see for yourself? Now tell me will you make transfer for good worth #50 and pay for transaction charges worth #30 and above? These are the things we are talking about. How about the farmers? How about the commuters? So you want to tell me that you will do a transfer of #100 just from junction to junction with almost half of the pay as transaction charges?  People are stranded, go out and ask questions then you would know what people are really going through mate.I am not in any way criticizing your point but just the reality we are currently facing in the country. The policy is a good one but I just think the country is neither matured nor ready for that now as we can see the banks for a long time now been dealing with network issues as banks are shoting down.This is the reality of Nigeria now.",

What is he trying to prove? Why is going against the Supreme court. What is he afraid of? His political career? We have always known that he is a man that doesn't obey court orders. Right from the time that he was the FCT minister up until now that he is the governor of Kaduna state. Sadly, in Nigeria, the law and punishment is only for the poor and those without any political godfathers because I cannot imagine that a many who has flouted the orders of the court in Nigeria over and again would have the effrontery to go against his boss, the President and the commander of the armed forces. On the other hand, it is obvious that something is terrible wrong with our judicial system. It is obvious that their wings have been plucked off. They are in bed with politicians and so they have no power. They are no longer independent. What then is the hope of those undergraduate law students who will spend over 5 years reading for a degree in law?",

The matter surprise me oooo, the governor of Kaduna state Ahmed Nasir El-Rufai is a big shame and I do believe say a person who claimed to be a technocrat will speak against a policy like this and order his people to go against presidential order but I trust federal power, them no born El-Rufai well to do otherwise and the question be say the old naira no dey like that again even as he says to make people for Kaduna accept old notes, the question be say how many of the old naira note still dey people hand, bank don already collect most of ammm from people unless those politicians were donned stash large amount of the old note before this swap policy. -I no expect this kind of level of criticism to be coming from members of the rolling party and I no expect strong party nan like El-Rufai to make such a negative outburst against a federal policy where many within his state are sacked from their homes due to terrorism, kidnapping and banditry which is one of the major areas were the currency swapping is targeted at.",
