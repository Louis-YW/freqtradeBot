This board runs on evidences, it'll be very much appreciated and helpful if you can give proper materials to back up your claim for the DTs to tag them [you do aware that you can tag them yourself too, right?] if they're proven to be the wrong side here, because the current evidences you gave is... very limited and didn't give us enough insight.I will also urge you to inform them [preferably after you edited this thread with proper format] about this thread. Your post on their ANN did not direct them to this accusation thread and they probably didn't know where to address your issue. I can do that for you if you want to [though I don't see why], but I'd prefer to do it after you made this thread \"complete\".And lastly, no, I am somewhat sure that shasan is not working for them.",

First,  if you see your deposited amount, try and withdraw that one out first in order not to completely be on the losing side, as the Casino has quoted above that they will refund your deposit. If they do, just withdraw it, and then you can continue pressing your charges.And for TrustPilot, I will not even entirely depend on the information that comes from there, as many companies now run a TrustPilot review campaign where they require their promoters to go and drop a positive review about them there, which is why there are very few projects that you can see with less positive feedback unless those who have actually scammed people decided to go and drop a few negative reviews, which I doubt can make any difference.",

But it's worth stating that dexsport didn't ask this.Moving up, I beg to differ for the part, \"crypto users encouraging this kind of dishonest practices in the scam accusation section\". Most of the users overseeing scam accusations section and accustomed to the scam accusation resolution will give every side chances to defend themselves by asking both parties for evidences. We even go to a length to notify and invite the involved parties to attend to the case and give their side of the story.And last, it is true that decentralized betting platform usually just need the users to connect their wallet, no \"registration\" or username needed, but some still asked for the user to create a \"profile\", and apparently dexsport is one of them, Quote from: https://dexsport.io/documents/DEXSPORT%20TERMS%20AND%20CONDITIONS.pdf3. PROFILE3.1. Creation3.1.1. To participate in sports betting and online games using virtual currency or any other potential product on the Platform, the User must create a Profile.3.1.2. Upon creating the Profile, the User must connect their own virtual currency Wallet to the Platform using one of the available Partner integrations. 3.2. Confirmation of Actions within the Platform3.2.1. The User's activities performed within the Platform, including any Deposits, placement of a bet, playing games, instructions, and communications – shall be conducted by the User, who is connected own virtual currency Wallet and shall be binding upon such User.And even though the profile creation is basically like what you said, connecting our wallet through metamask, walletconnect, and the likes, it seems the deposit and the winning are not directly tied to the wallet as it seems need to be manually withdrawn; at least that's what I can conclude by creating a new wallet just to get better understanding of this platform, as I don't go as far as depositing, betting, and withdrawing.  While for how they detect multi-acc abuse with what supposed to be pseudo-anonymous setup, it's an entirely different topic",
