That's why there's no accurate estimation when it will be completed because it depends on each people to calculate it.",

Because it is the same as knowing the day the next half bitcoin occurs and I think it will be very difficult for many people to know, and for example it can be known from now on. Of course there will be many people who want to wait for that date and there will also be many rich people on that date. And of course in the article that you read is also not mentioned about the date for the next half bitcoin right?",

It only goes down once the Bitcoin network hits a specific block height, which happens about every 210,000 blocks or so, give or take. And while we can't pin down the exact date and time of the next halving, we can make an educated guess based on the current block height and average block time.Now, I know y'all are eager to know when the next halving's gonna happen, but hold up, it ain't an exact science, my dudes. We can only estimate that it's gonna be around April or May of 2024. But don't go bettin' your life savings on that date just yet, cuz fluctuations in the mining network can still throw a wrench in our predictions",

We all know that blockchain halving event is based on the number of blocks and not the time. The time of block being is dynamic so it means that the date for the specific block to be mined is impossible to determined especially if it’s still far. Maybe it’s only possible if there’s only few blocks away to have a few margin of error on the ETA. But for now the date is indefinite.",

Because even if there is research from various articles in the end everything will end in wild speculation or maybe some analysis will still end the subject without a definite date.After all, it doesn't matter when it happens because there is no point in not collecting Bitcoins.

Therefore, as the number of blocks on the blockchain increases, this date can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy.Currently (as of 2023), the next Bitcoin halving can be expected to take place around May 2024.

Even two or three blocks before the next halving block #840,000, we still can not know exact time when the halving block will be mined on the network. Three blocks can be mined in a little more than 10 minutes if there are two blocks occur in a few seconds and a third block occur after about 10 minutes (an average block time). Three blocks can be mined in more than 30 minutes if all those three blocks are mined around average block time. It can be to 40 minutes if one of three blocks needs 20 minutes to be mined.We can not know it exactly.The Average confirmation time shows the uncertainty of block timehttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/avg-confirmation-time",
