How would you make Bitcointalk better if you were the Boss ?To me, I don't see need for having bitcoin wallet embedded into the forum reason is because bitcoin transaction is cheap and cost less and wallet already available. Forum here more like other social media platform whee people with specific goal meet and chat over a topic. If you ask me, This ecosystem is wide and there a lot to be considered here; 1: Bounty Area need concentration, a lot of company coming go host project need to be screen because a lot of them are scams and they end up bringing negative feedback on the forum.2: Merit Earning: Before anyone can earn merit this day it's seems the person need to be identified with any higher rank that can give merit. Because I have come to discovered people don't longer give merit or either people sell it or greedy with it or does this mean people are no longer interested in reading peoples post?. I urge theymo to look into that3: it's true this forum have over stayed and it's high time for us to have web Application build on playstore.4: I think there is abuse of the forum maybe as result that it cost nothing to create an account. So to avoid traffic and illegal use of the forum I suggest there should fee to attach to everyone new account creation.5: Newbie are not longer given positive attention rather all they got is negative feedback and these scaring. If I am the Boss I will remove that barrier and rather make users with high rank to read newbies post in other to give them merit.",

Signature ban 6 month, 1 year, 2 year.- Transit the SMF forum to Epochtalk forum software. We are waiting for the new forum- Require altcoin projects to run their bounties with Bitcoin, not with their tokensCheck the to-do list and rework: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4893744.msg44432901#msg44432901If I was theymos, I would turn off my computer when I see this list. Headache  Quote from: theymos on August 21, 2018, 12:18:08 AMI'm not going to respond here in detail to all of these ideas. It'd be extremely long. I will classify them as OK/maybe/no:Quote• A newbie welcome message or link to a welcome thread upon sign-up explaining the basic rules and links to everything they need to know including the full forum rules, helpful guides and FAQs etc. No excuses for not knowing the rules then.• Dedicated sub board mods for most boards that don't have any mods or non-global mods already assigned (Bitcoin Discussion, Beginners & Help, Off Topic etc).• More patrollers/mods who just handle sig spam or farmers.• Restoring the memberlist search and stats (very useful for finding huge farming abuses).• Enforce the sig campaign guidelines. If a campaign is spotted that is doing little to nothing and is abused en mass by spammers, farmers, bots and copy and pasters they are warned. If nothing changes then they are punished with such things as bans, threads trashed, signatures blacklisted site-wide etc.• A 'bump button' for the marketplace that only allows you to bump your thread once every 24 hours. Manually bumping by posting will then be disallowed. As mentioned above, posts by lower ranked accounts could not be able to bump threads thus curbing potential abuse.• A report queue for reported messages. Currently every global and admin are spammed by any reported message and half of the time when you go to handle it it has already been handled, thus wasting everybody's time.• More admins or demi-admins added to help with account recoveries and other admin duties.• A captcha added to a user's first post or two/three etc to curb bot usage (purchasing a Copper Membership could remove these).• Require email verification for new accounts.• Require email verification first before passwords/emails are changed.• A Beginners and Help board for the Alt Coin section (the bitcoin one is mostly swamped with alt coin and bounty-related issues).• Add badges as a reward for high reporters and/or merited users (some perks would also be nice). Maybe we could have a 'most merited' user of the month badge. Prizes or awards could be given at the end of the month/year for the biggest rats/grasses/ass-kissers merited users or reporters.• More options for self-moderated threads (being able to limit participation to certain ranks ie no Newbies or Juniors etc or banning certain users from being able to post in your thread at all to stop trolls and personal attacks etc).• Signature bans. Bans that remove the signature for x amount of time or even permanently (actually proposed by theymos but never followed up on). Being able to blacklist an entire campaign's signature would also be helpful for those campaigns that refuse to do anything about spam.• Certain sub boards shouldn't count to post count or activity (Bounties, Games & Rounds and possibly Off Topic).• Awarding merit doesn't take you to a new page. Clicking the merit button multiple times could pump up the merit one by one. This would make awarding merit much swifter and less annoying.OK in principle, would require thought/adjustment/implementation. Many of these things are more complex than they look at first glance.Quote• Charging ICOs a fee to make their ANN here. You could even get rid of the ANN board completely and give them their own sub once they've paid the fee. If there's no Ann board then there will probably be no paid bumping because it will be useless, but let them spam away in their own slum and squalor.• A dedicated Marketplace for the Alt Coin board that would be used for currency sales/exchanges and advertising/requesting services etc (the current one has no description and is being used as catch all for anything and everyting and not what it was intended for).• Requiring manually whitelisting of all new accounts before they can post. All new users will essentially be shadowbanned until they've been verified by a mod. This will eliminate 99% of bots and spammers before they even start. Spam threads can be trashed on sight before they even become spam megathreads.• Press board locked/archived as it's served its purpose• Some local boards have Press and Off topic subs. They should be removed as they're hotbeds for account farmers/spammers and are not necessary here.• Warnings in red displayed to lower ranked users when they go to post alerting them to the most commonly ignored/broken rules. • A sub board for highly merited users to encourage constructive topics only by users who have proven their worth here over time (or make the Ivory Tower merit requirement much higher [OMG ITS LIKE SOVIET RUSSIA GULAG]).Maybe.Quote• A publicly displayed 'banned' rank under a person's username for permabanned accounts (people are wasting both theirs and staffs time reporting already banned users and bots).• Implementing a redirect notice/landing page for when users click an external link urging them to double check the url for phishing and possibly warning them of the dangers of buying things from autobuy links and that they should likely use a trusted escrow etc).• Require at least one merit to become a Junior Member (bots will never rise past Newbie status then and can be nuked once spotted).• More donator ranks such as Silver and Gold Member that come with additional perks such as avatars and Full/Hero member-sized signatures etc (which will severely curb account farming and sales). You could also even have an expensive premium 'Platinum' rank (bling bling) that comes with further benefits (for example: image banner in signature, animated gif avatar, custom title, ability to change username etc).• Remove signatures completely from everyone (or everyone only has a basic signature) and to get one you either need a very high amount of activity & merit or:B) Buy them via new donator ranks (theymos did initially comment: \"This may be a good idea. Though I do think that people who don't pay should be able to get a small signature.\" [though Newbie signatures have been removed completely since this comment was made]).• Posts from lower ranked accounts don't bump ICO threads to the top (which would then render paid bump spam useless).• Two report buttons/queues: one for sig spam and low quality posts and one everything else that is more urgent (hundreds of reports on spam posts are currently burying more important reports).• A new member rank after Legendary as it is becoming far too common now and will only become more so as time passes. I would suggest fixing Legendary at 960 activity and the new rank is double that at 1920. You could also make the merit requirement very high for this rank so it's only for the crème de la crème of users [OMG NAZI RANK ITS LIKE THE RICH KEEP GETTING RICHER].• Additional perks for Legendary accounts or a higher rank if added (for example: custom title, image banner in signature, clickable link in personal text, access to exclusive sub board etc).• A captcha added to deleting a post.• Disallowing lower ranks from posting in Off Topic (this is bitcoin forum, why would they head to that board straight away other than to easily farm their accounts (alternatively, posts not counting towards postcount or activity there would also work).• If a post is removed then so is any merit awarded (I think some users are deleting posts to hide evidence of abuse).• More advertisement slots. This forum is badly under-monetised in my opinion and we likely lose hundreds of thousands in lost revenue to signatures and lack of ad slots and visibility.No. Or not yet. Or the idea would need to be significantly modified.Quote from: Benkbeny on July 13, 2022, 11:52:13 PM-snip-Your account was created 2 days ago and all 7 posts are in Meta.

How would you make Bitcointalk better if you were the Boss ?-Security would be the top priority so maybe 2FA or some OTP that will be sent in the email would be the first one. I've experienced my account getting hacked already without any notifications whatsoever and luckily I got my account back after a week or more. This will prevent hackers hacking accounts here especially those high ranked ones.-Maybe a mobile app would be nice as well. Though we can still access the forum through our phones, having a mobile version of it would be better .-A local forum for each nationality would be nice as well.-Maybe a section where users can be updated with what is happening with the crypto world. On that section, we can put some sub sections like for Bitcoin and some altcoins where we might put articles or videos out there like documentaries. It might help newbies as well since they can watch documentaries at read articles there. -Users with negative trust will not be able to wear signatures. Well, there are some exceptions to it like for example, the user who put negative trust to you permanently left the forum forever. I think this might be hard but I think it's doable.",

On desktop mode it's somehow fine with me but this is probably the one I will be removing or changing. Changing it to failed multiple login attempts then having a incremental cooldown would be sufficient.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on July 13, 2022, 08:45:47 PM-Will you redesign the forum?, what color(s) and designs do you think would suit the forum better?Adding night mode would be enough I guess. If we need to be fancy, Adding such user-preferred color changing schemes would be nice just like what google chrome browser customize profile colors.",
