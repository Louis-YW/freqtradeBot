All those who want this category, Please vouch this post. I think this topic is more suitable for Meta since this is about the forum discussion. And also most of the meme posted in the forum is on the Bitcoin WO or on off topic since moderator will count a single meme post spam if it was made on other topic besides off-topic or WO(or other board which no one cares about post quality) when user report it as spam. Paid post abused by shit poster is what makes the forum forced to removed memes or humor post on a discussion topic since this doesn’t add value on the discussion.I believe this Meme category will be a good addition to the forum as lounge for user that want some light and funny discussion.",

Altcoins go to their respective board (Altcoin Discussion). If it is non-crypto related meme, just do it in Off-Topic board. We do not need a \"Meme\" sub-board.",

Bitcoin only has a limited amount of memes anyhow. I think Reddit would be a better place for that type of content, as the way it displays posts suits it. Not necessarily a subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin, though. Maybe, a more meme centric sub reddit or maybe Twitter. I'd say with a high level of certainty you won't be seeing a section dedicated to memes any time soon. This forum is primarily a discussion based forum.",

Maybe so, but much, if not most of the time, a meme isn’t going to contribute meaningfully to a discussion, especially when it is all that’s in a post. I also don’t think it is realistic to have a discussion using memes. People could create memes for each post, but that would be bad for people who don’t speak English — it would be very difficult to translate the text on each picture.",

This must be a big number unless you count the quality over the quantity. All shitcoins are more or less pump and dump schemes anyway. Exactly most of them are pump dump scheme to manipulate the market as you can clearly find out that major portion of supply is linked to some main wallets and they paid influencers to shill their project on viewers and then dump over them in the market taking out their profits.It is easy to create shit tokens out of thin air and you can clearly see many on CMC so they all fall under this category only.Quote from: The Pharmacist on October 08, 2022, 10:06:15 PMA whole section?  There's that one thread Mbitr mentioned, and I think that's more than sufficient.  I hate to say this, but it's almost like you're asking for there to be a kiddie's section of bitcointalk where finger paintings can be displayed, and if Theymos has ignored all the other requests for new section additions (NFTs, for example), there's no way in hell he'd go for this one.There's no need to have a separate section for the memes because many will start spamming up the board with lot of meaningless memes and this forum is setup for open discussion about bitcoin and market as a whole.The memes can be limited to one or two particular threads only and you are right on the part that there are many updates that need to be implemented on the forum first by @theymos before he checks all this meme stuff.So probably not a good idea though in my opinion to have separate meme board for this.",
