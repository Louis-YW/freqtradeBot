  "content": "If you hold Bitcoin, you should install one of the Bitcoin client software implementations, such as Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots, on your computer. For example, if you have hardware wallets, especially those for scam shitcoins  like Ledger or Trezor, you cannot be sure if you truly own Bitcoin when connecting to these wallet applications. These applications may show you numbers on the screen, but that doesn't mean you own real Bitcoin. Gold stopped being a medium of exchange and a unit of account in the 16th and 17th centuries precisely because counterfeit gold coins appeared, and it became difficult to verify whether the gold was real. Gold was placed in bank vaults, and banks issued IOU certificates (banknotes). Thus, banknotes became the medium of exchange and the unit of accountThis marked the beginning of the fiat standard. Bitcoin is much better than gold because it is easier to transfer and store without any costs, but most importantly, verification is very simple. Anyone can verify if they own Bitcoin by running a node. Don’t trust, verifyInstalling a node on your computer is very simple and doesn't require many resources. The Bitcoin client doesn't need to be online 24/7; you can use it only when making transactions or occasionally activate it to sync with the network. The easiest way to use it is with the Sparrow wallet.",

Start with investment in Bitcoin is good, for investors and for Bitcoin adoption. Then Bitcoin investors will do their investment safer if they store bitcoin in non custodial wallets. That's enough for them.

Don’t trust, verifyIn as much as this is part of the essential of running a node and also a the best form of staying anonymous amongst other means I think this isn’t the most important reason why people should run node, verification of bitcoin transactions and such can be done anonymously without having even to run a node so when telling someone to run a node I will rather convince the person to do that just because it is a way to add to decentralized nature of the network which holds their precious assets, this is even more important than verification advantage.

The easiest way to use it is with the Sparrow wallet.It’s not simple like that requires you to actually spend some funds on the device, for a starter the amount of data bundle need to even download the data is huge and also the spec needed on the device for running the node is still somewhat a substantial amount. Many will prefer to hold more coins than actually doing that",

Not everyone can run bitcoin node.Know that if you run SPV wallet, it can make privacy more difficult but it is still your coins on blockchain if you use noncustodial wallet.To be honest, yes, it's simple to run Bitcoin node despite the fact that it takes 500 gigabytes. Why? Because it's very cheap to buy HDD and SSD. The price of brand new 1TB SSD can be as low as $50 and sometimes even lower. You can buy Raspberry Pi 4 8GB for 70 dollars + SSD and that's all. Or you can buy a second hand laptop and run a Bitcoin node. It's not really expensive. It might be expensive for those who live in a very poor countries and can't even afford a smartphone or computer but overall, it's not expensive and is pretty simple.P.S. Another reason to run your own Bitcoin node is the security. When you connect to other nodes, there is a big chance that when you broadcast a transaction, they collect your IP address. When you run your own node, your security is enhanced and it also helps the community to have many running nodes.",

For example, Ethereum (ETH) had a 70% premine, which they sold in 2016 during their IPO. They falsely advertise themselves as 'the world computer' or 'ultrasound money'. Try running an Ethereum node, and you'll quickly realize that almost no one does it because it's too expensive and too difficult, except for the founders and insiders who hold 70% of the premine and can do whatever they want.I've already explained why running a node is important , it’s the verification that you own real Bitcoin. For instance, wallets that support scam shitcoins can easily trick you with fake Bitcoins. They could, for example, show you in Ledger Live that you have Bitcoin, even though you don’t.I've already explained the problem with gold and why gold coins stopped being used as everyday money, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account , precisely because it's hard to verify if you possess real gold. I recommend you read some books on the history of money and do your own research on this topic. Bitcoin is easy to verify if you run a Bitcoin node.
