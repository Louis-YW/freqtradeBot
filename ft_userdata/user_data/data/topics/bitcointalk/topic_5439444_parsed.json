They are the ones who hold the majority of the world's wealth and rule the world. As Jawhead999 said, without those studies, just looking at what happens every day, the news in the media is enough to prove that there is a deep divide between the rich and poor. Society will always develop that way, there has never been and never will be justice, the rich will continue to be rich, and the poor will continue to be poor.",

We all live in a capitalist society where money is power. The politicians in government are puppets to the billionaires whom in turn pull their strings according to their whims and interests. I think it’s pretty obvious that the total wealth of the world is in the hands of a certain few. The wealth gap between the rich and the poor is only getting wider.

A kind but naive fairy tale about universal equality. As much as you would like, but cryptocurrency will not change the standard of living of anyone. Cryptocurrency is no different from fiat currency in terms of its distribution and \"availability\" for everyone.I will prove it very simply, and you will do it yourself if you answer my question Tell and describe the processes that will take place in the community if tomorrow we replace fiat currencies with cryptocurrencies? In relation to reality, please? Believe me, even while writing and thinking about the answer, you will understand how \"fairytale idea\" this is ....",

It is probably 95% - 5% or smth.Even If what you said (or I said) was true, the govs simple can't do to fix this because there isn't anything to fix. The rich are getting richer because their ancestors did the right stuff, made the right investments and passed down their wealth to their children.The poor is getting poorer because most of the time they are dumb as f. They shouldn't manufacture more children than they could afford and yet they do the exact opposite. While the rich make 2-3 kids at most, the poor manufacture 5-6 sometimes 10 children and they become poor like their parents too.Why would the rich share their wealth with these dumb fucks?Makes no sense.The nature rewards smart people and punishes dumb people.

Its been as such from the beginning of time where wealth was defined by sheeps, goats, cows and even wives. Of course times have changed and it is now in the terms of assets, investments and luxury items.There is absolutely nothing the government can do to close in on the gap between the rich forks in the society and the poor once. Ideas are the bases to wealth generation. Some might have it and not even able to bring it to a physical manifestation while others can conceive it and still have the ability to. This becomes the definitive factor for most and is apparently what everyone can't have in equal. There would always be a class in the society and those that are already ahead will always sort means to remain ahead.",

But the fact is true. And I don't think that there's any solution to this. Rich will always take from the poor and become more rich. That's how the whole world works. Poor people will always look up to rich and try to be like them. And in that process they end up giving more to the rich. And the education system is the main problem. It will teach you to never think out of the box. You are trapped inside. Have a look at the rich people. 99% of them are who broke the box and made their own decisions.",

A more fair version of this situation sounds like a formidable obstacle to overcome, yet it is still a fact of life in the world we now inhabit.
