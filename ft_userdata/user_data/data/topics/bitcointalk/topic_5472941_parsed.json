  "content": "I think that currently the politicians in democracies do not understand how they should confront authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. It can be very simple – threatening such regimes a war unless they choose political liberalization.When Hitler started oppressing mass media in 1933, the France could threaten him – stop this unless we start a war. I am sure this was an easy way to prevent all horrors of the WW2. The Germans were eager to fight for their country, their “fatherland” as they understood it; but could they fight for political repressions in Germany, for closing independent mass media? I am sure that no. The same could happen in 2003 in Russia, when Putin started to take away the TV channels from Russian Oligarchs (NTV Ren TV).And it is not too late to perform this now. Possibly soon Putin will block youtube in Russia (if not – eventually youtube will destroy the state propaganda in Russia). If the West threatens in this case the missile strikes on Russian centers of state TV channels – this will easily end the rule of Putin in Russia. The Russians surely will not fight for blocking youtube, for supporting the Putin’s lies. The same with China. If I am not mistaken, the Chinese people are quite unhappy with the digital totalitarianism (state social rating) and surely will not fight for it.I don't plagiarize",

There is a good reason neither the United States nor the Western allies have considered to do such thing like demand political change by directly threatening the Kremlin or Pekín; even if a big percentage of people in those countries are not willing to fight for their leaders, it does not mean those leaders won't force them to do so, the military there is pretty much in the side of those regimes and whether we agree with it or not, destroying key infrastructure like those used for communication could easily devolve into a causus belli. Just think about it, North Korea is of the size of a fraction of both Russia and China but USA does not dare to deal with them directly, because their weapons and the human cost of it would be too high to try to break a fragile peace.",

From what was written about hilter, it seems he was a globalist-nazi whose sole agenda was to conquer and rule the world. Putin doesn't seem like that kind of person. He doesn't have that kind of lust for power, and I don't see much desire to conquer or rule other nations in him. He's more interested in Russia and very defensive of her against nazis that tried to conquer/weaken her via choas. The evil entity behind hitler is actually thesame entity that is behind those fighting to conquer and weaken Russia. The way Russia behaved in the conflict between her and Ukraine is quite opposite of what hitler would have done.In regards to encouraging democracy and liberalization in Russia, I don't think Russia needs that. What every nation on Earth needs is rule based leadership/governance, with golden rule of Love for GOD & man. The rule has to be good or atleast fair to work in different countries & their own unique circumstances. Whatever ideology you want others to adopt has to be according to the good rules that factor in  their unique circumstances. You would be surprised how well the countries progress when they stick to good rule-based constitutions.",

China (unlike Russia) is a giant factory of a country which needs to keep the inflow of money from USA companies to stay thriving and alive, the same way USA needs to have a clear comercial relation with China, because USA manufacture their products there. Hence the reason USA cannot impose sanctions on China, the same way it has been done against Russia. If China isolated itself it would translate into a high damage to themselves",

People talking about war and geopolitics on Twitter have not idea on the human implications of the deployment of troops and the supply of weapons to a country (regardless on what side one must be) in the end, we could argue that those who move onto Ukraine because the wishes of Putin are being pushed to their demise and because causes and ideals they may not even share with the Kremlin. On the other hand, people who stay and take arms to defend their country would also likely to find their demise, but unlike the invaders, is their families and friends who are being put at risk because of the selfish ambitions of people in positions of power in Russia.",

However, there is no easy way to stop Russia and China because these nations are superpowers and have great influence in the global economic and military space. Declaring war on Russia or China is like starting World War 3 and the effect of such war will take centuries for the world to recover.      The only people that can bring Xi Jinping down are his people the Chinese and if you want to stop Putin instigate a mutiny. So the easiest way to overcome these two leaders is to facilitate the overthrow of these leaders because history has shown that great leaders can easily be dethroned internally rather than through external aggression. This option is also very difficult to apply because it seems that these two leaders enjoy the support of the citizens of their respective nations. Let's just give peace a chance and stop the killings.",

What do you think could happen if US supported this movement in 1940th (if it didn't take part in the war against Germany)?That's an interesting question. First of all it was in 41 that the US joined WW2 and the date is significant, because it was in December, the same month when the attack on Pearl Harbor happened The US did not join the war like that, out of the blue. They were attacked and in a way participated in the conflict before that by sending aid to the Allies. OP is talking about one country attacking another to change the political system. That's more comparable to what Nazis were trying to achieve in Europe, especially in Russia, since they were driven by hate towards communism, while being socialists themselves. This is a joke when we look at it today, since communism and socialism are very similar systems, based on the same principles and in 1940s communists hated imperialists and socialists hated communists. Nowadays, socialists hate capitalism, and new evolved socialists that call themselves democrats hate conservatism. I'd say it's a comedy but it's not, it's a tragicomedy.",

Still, I still agree with you in the indirect approach to deal with authoritarian regimes like those in China and Russia, sanctions are restrictions around the world banking system are better than pushing those regimes towards the edge and risk total destruction of both sides.Whether we like it or not, we live in a sort of cold war, but now between capitalism systems instead a Soviet vs capitalist scenario.",
