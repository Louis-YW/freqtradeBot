      "body": "I believe in using Bitcoin, but there are barely any opportunities to do so, realistically, unless one makes it a special task to find places that accept Bitcoin (and that also depends on a country and city one lives in). So, unfortunately, spending Bitcoin often means selling it for fiat, one way or another. As for holding, it can increase in value long-term, but there are also risks associated with it if one cannot afford to keep hodling and needs to sell when the price is bad. I think that both holding and using are appropriate and make sense with Bitcoin, but the former can be risky and the latter is quite limited for now.",

Of course, this does not apply to all situations. But without a doubt, in the case of Bitcoin it is one of the cases in which it most applies.Why 'or' when it can be both? If you live in a very inflation-ravaged economy with no prospects to be better in the future, I think it makes a lot of sense to be both at the same time. You have BTC to hold, but you also use it on a daily shops when you have the opportunity.What could be better than a world where your currency is also a store of value?",

Why do you buy Bitcoin initially? In order to get rich, get profit so let's take profit whenever you see whatever price is good for you. But remember one thing, don't take profit all you have. Always reserve part of your initial Bitcoin to wait for higher price after you take profit and get capital, you are safe.QuoteAnd why are we happy when we see someone buy something from btc?We should feel happy and congratulate others if they succeed in their lives.

And now, if you have bought at a lower price like $20k and sell it for $40k it is obvious that you will have your profit. People have learned on storing value than use it as a payment system because they know BTC will potentially make a profit once the price will go up high. You should think about the demand and supply which give the value of BTC.",
