  "content": "I was browsing YouTube and saw this new Vice News video about lost bitcoins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_OPJMoLVdw. I found this video interesting because it has interviews with quite different people, so I thought I'd share it here. Perhaps you could comment what you found new or weird about it.One guy had a password written in a notebook, but he was pick-pocketed and the page with the password was ripped out of the notebook.It also features people who work on helping others recover cryptos (they need a client to remember or have at least something, of course).There's also this very bizarre guy who has implants in his hand to access his stuff, including Bitcoin. That was something I had no idea people did.It also sheds some light on how 'lost bitcoins' number is estimated: if the coins aren't moved for 5 years, apparently they're presumed to be lost, which seems like too big of an assumption.",

You should hear about the guy who implanted a mechanical eye to his brain so he can see colors, chip implants will only get normal as time goes by though.",

But however, watching this YouTube interview video, I'm really amazed seeing the level some people take trying to secure their priceless possessions such as \"David Webb\" did, going the extreme of placing an implant in his hand to enable him access his Bitcoin through a hardware wallet. And also knowing that out there lies a father and son @ \"Davecrypto\" offering a service which helps people to crack the password of lost Bitcoin wallets, because that is actually not an easy task.",

In the video, they mentioned that implants work most of the time, and the guy actually needed a few times to swipe his hand to unlock a safe... Also, it's not like it really gives any particular protection IMO. If anything, it makes a person more vulnerable to violence because if someone comes to rob you, they'll actually need your body to cooperate to open things for them, and if something doesn't open on first attempt, I don't think they'll like it.Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on September 03, 2022, 04:18:36 PMBut the fact that a coin isn't move for a period of 5yrs doesn't actually means such coin is lost, because considering the way Bitcoin is, one could either decide to leave as an investment for a period of 5 to 7yrs in a secure Bitcoin wallet.

It's perfectly reasonable that big hodlers would have most of funds out there somewhere without touching them for a long time. As for Davecrypto, I heard of them before. It's great there's a trusted service that helps people out, and they do it for a cut from the recovered funds, which is a win-win situation, even though 20% isn't a small cut.",
