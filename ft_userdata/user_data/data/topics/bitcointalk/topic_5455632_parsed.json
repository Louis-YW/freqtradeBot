Have you used the forums before so that you can say that it is difficult for you to decide on the direction?There's no need to be cheeky to a new member. It's not news that the forum can be a lot to grasp for someone who is used to modern social platforms and it's not a surprise that a new member needs guidance.Pointing them to the forum rules and other sticky threads would do the trick, even though majority don't stick around to read them.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on June 07, 2023, 04:02:04 PMPlease be more confident and independent; there is no need to create a new topic, showing your helplessness.

Just hover on different boards and read each description they've got for your interest upon looking for those topics that you're captivated with.

You can learn many things from this forum if you are wiling enough to learn form the forum.really good advice, I'd like to add some additional advice. First, joining a forum does not guarantee that you will get what you want right away. Many newbies mistakenly believe that joining a forum and being promoted to a higher rank is very simple, which is why the majority of newbies complain about their lack of merit or inability to rank up. Similar to the forum, you must gain more knowledge about bitcoin because, from what I can see, many forum members do so in order to do so.However, if you come to the forum as a newbie thinking that you want to become wealthy or have money, you are mistaken. Although many forum members have money, you still need to study more to become successful. If you pay attention to many forum members who are higher than you, I'm sure you won't regret being here.",

Thanks.First of all, welcome to bitcointalk.What I noticed though is that almost immediately after you created this account you came here asking how this forum works. While there is nothing wrong about asking anything, I would suggest you to give it some more time and explore forum by yourself and do it at your pwn pace  because newbies often feel like they have to know everything and now which I don't think is a good thing to do as it may feel overwhelming.",

This is also applicable here and I believe from the posts and links provided in the previous post's but other members, OP can be able to navigate through the platform.OP should not this; that every thread or board has its own guidelines pinned at  the top of the thread so it would be in your own best interest to make sure you read them so as to get aquatinted with the boards very well.Do well to always attach your refference if you copied any post from anywhere so as to avoid being banned for plagiarism. For instance if you copy from the internet, you can paste the link from the source after you have made your write up.Lastly, as a newbie here, you must have come across so acronyms which you might be familiar with and those you have no idea about.

We welcome to newbies on this forum who really want to learn and earn something else. There is no matter what you choose or how much you invest in if you have a sound understanding of crypto trading. However, if you have money and want to invest in trading, you need first learn and gain experience before making a decision. Because you cannot evaluate the behavior of the crypto market or generate money from it unless you have a thorough understanding of fundamental and technical analysis, risk assessment, and so on. So, do your research thoroughly and start with low-value tokens rather than high-value tokens. Furthermore, you must remember the loss first.",
