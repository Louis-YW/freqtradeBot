Pretty hard to beat Europeans, and in my opinion it's not fair to start at semi-finals.But talking about south americans, the last champion was Corinthians in 2012 against Chelsea, it's 10 years without any title for South AmericaTake a look, since 2013:2013 - Winner - Bayer / 2nd place Raja Casablanca2014 - Winner - Real Madrid / 2nd place San Lorenzo2015 - Winner - Barcelona / 2nd place River Plate2016 - Winner - Real Madrid / 2nd place Kashima Antlers2017 - Winner - Real Madrid / 2nd place Grêmio2018 - Winner - Real Madrid  / 2nd place Al Ain2019 - Winner - Liverpool / 2nd place Flamengo2020 - Winner - Bayer / 2nd place Tigres2021 - Winner - Chelsea/ 2nd place PalmeirasSo, in, 2013, 2016, 2018 and 2020 South Americans were eliminated in Semi Finals",

Now it's 4.Like I said above, Fifa is trying to sync the calendar.The champion of the World Cup will earn US$ 5 million, while the second will earn US$ 4 millionConmebol said if Flamengo win the cup, they will receive another US$ 5 million from the confederation, so there's a lot in play to Flamengo, I suspect they are more motivated than Real Madrid hahaha.",

They still need to think about the qualification and playoff system for the teams besides the tournament itself, which it would take another schedule for teams to play that. The shortest way is to take 4 teams that played in the semifinal of their main competition in each confederation. But it will be unfair to UEFA that have many high quality teams if they are allowed to send 4 clubs only. Uhm there is a lot things to do for FIFA and I dont think 2 years is enough",

The last nine tournaments have all been won by European teams. It would be refreshing to see a team from another continent win for a change. Who doesn't enjoy an underdog triumph? Perhaps if teams like South America's Flamengo or North America's Seattle Sounders FC improved, they could challenge Spain's Real Madrid. It's fascinating to witness the skills and abilities of teams from all around the world as they battle against one another. Let's hope it's a thrilling and close tournament!
