Well, to correct your take, Trump is not the first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin payment via lightning network since Robert F. Kennedy was the first to do this  but others have started accepting payment in Bitcoin and the person to bring this pattern in was Kentucky Senator, Rand Paul in 2016. Back then, to accept payment in crypto was regarded as \"wading into strange waters\"Most of these politicians are not really against Bitcoin but will not be bold to stand up for it when it matters, to them anything that will sway the public into lobbying for them should be used to their advantage and it will be wise to not trust the words of politicians.",

Perhaps that would enlarge his electorial teams speculations and gaining him hope to achieve his political goal of winning the US presidential election. Yes quite agreed that politicians are not reliable as they could make unfulfillable promises.",

You didn't hear about Rand Paul because back then although he started accepting crypto, particularly bitcoin as means of payment for his political campaigns, he still had some misgivings about the currency, preferring it were backed by a more stable commodity like gold. Also despite his bid to get into the good books of business magnates who have soft spot for the Libertarians so as to help his aim of being president, the best he could achieve is being a senator of Kentucky till date so its normal for him to take back seat against Trump and Biden who have served as presidents and the latter is still serving. Trump is more recognized as having started accepting bitcoin as payment for his political campaign as he was one, if not the first, president to be pro bitcoin which kind of pushes him to the forefront whenever crypto activities are mentioned.",

But that doesn't mean we absolutely hate politicians or governments because without government approval, bitcoin wouldn't have become as popular as it is today. If they do not legalize bitcoin and issue a harsh ban on bitcoin, we will certainly have many difficulties in using bitcoin. Governments may be bitcoin's biggest barrier, but they can also pave the way for bitcoin's global adoption.",

Otherwise, everything remains just electoral propaganda for the presidential campaign.For my part, I hope that this is true and I believe that it is possible because I see a lot of change in the United States’ policy towards cryptocurrencies, and even President Biden a few days ago passed a resolution in favor of cryptocurrencies.",

The knowledge that a leading presidential aspirant is associating himself with Bitcoin gives the currency more publicity and possible adoption. However, his intention is just to accept donations nothing more. Politicians are like chameleons that keep changing based on circumstances, so they cannot be trusted.
