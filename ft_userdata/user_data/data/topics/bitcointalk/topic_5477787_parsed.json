In my opinion, it's very simple for them to know. On the aspect of payment, most managers pay per post, which is counted at the end of every week, and everything will sum up to the required maximum number of posts, which is being ranked by member rank, as all ranks are not being paid equally. Some managers pay a fixed amount for each week and require you to do a particular number of posts before the week runs out, with a daily maximum, and if you meet the requirement, you will be paid a certain amount based on your rank at the end of the week.",

For your first question, the campaign manager checks it and then pays them accordingly.I think there is no fix amount to what member are paid, I think that jurisdiction is base on how the company and the campaign manager decide to work it out as I believe some company pay their for advertising their work than others and I think the campaign manager also has a way to influence the payment rate for each rank depending on the ones he is working with. Aslo some company start with a low budget for marketing their pay while later is the case for other. Well for how they track campaigner wearing their signature code to earn payment, I think the manager has the responsibility to do that as he can also work with special people to keep track of these that's if he really wants to be district.",

Companies who run campaigns on bitcointalk do so with the intent to promote their brand/service and they know they will the value for their money. Each campaign has its own rules to ensure the company is well represented and they get the results they want from the campaign. Only member rank upwards can wear signature and yes the higher you rank and style of posting the more attractive your account becomes to campaign managers.

Each camping is run by a campaign manager. The campaign manager is responsible to check the post and ensures the rules of the campaign are being followed. Anyone found not following the rules will be removed from the campaign. The amount of weekly pay depends on the rank of any member. The higher the rank the better will be the pay for that member. As your rank is still a newbie you won't qualify to participate in a signature campaign as of now.

CM checks all the posts ensuring that a participant wore the signature, avatar, personal text and whether filled the weekly quota or not. And as for pay rate, it totally depends on your rank or how reputed you are around the forum. Normally the pay rate starts from 1$ to 6$, as far as I have seen. You can earn up to 150-200$ a week. Those who are very reputed in this forum can make custom deals for renting their signature space. As I am a full member, I earned around 20$ a week after joining a mixer campaign. Later I moved to another mixer champaign where I earned 35$ a week. It also depends on max post per weeks. Some allows 20 some 30 and some 40 posts per week. Apart from mixers, gambling campaigns pays more if we compare the numbers.",

It is helpful if they see good effects from the campaign.If you see a campaign starts and stops shortly, it means the company sees it not right financially for to do this more.Oppositely, if a campaign is run very long, it means something actually are good for the company and they decide to run it in a long time.

You can click it and it will redirect you to the website of the sponsor. By this, they get to keep track of the traffic we send to them and also know the converting ones.The above style is general which most campaigns use, but it could also be more than that where each participant has a unique link that can be tracked to them.",

It's basically the campaign manager that looks after the participants who are into a campaign and the company pays manger for that hard work.Quote from: ltcltcltc on December 13, 2023, 11:06:47 PMDo they pay a fixed amount per post or a fixed amount per week?In most campaigns the amount it fixed per post but not all of the posts will get paid. Someone campaigns pay 20 posts of a users while others pay 50-60 posts that a member makes. The paid posts should be constructive and should contain valuable information.

In some campaigns merits also play a big role, in a few campaigns the members with 3k or 4k merits get higher pay as compare to other Legendary rank members. They get that pay because they are the most active and contributive members of the forum.",

Or is it not the rank but the merit which determines your income?I will try to give answers to each query in the respective sequence in which you have asked them. These companies don't check that you have pasted their website links in your signature they have hired professional people who do that work for them and it is the headache of these professional people who have to give them results, and they don't pay us directly in most cases they did but they hired a professional person to check our posts, links, quality and to pay us after week. That person is known as the campaign manager,They pay us a fixed amount per post per week, the payment is different for different ranks and on different signature campaigns, and ranks or merits are indirectly the same thing, which means the more merits and activity you will have the higher your rank will be and most of the campaign only accepts member who is senior and to gain senior rank you have to get 250 merits and activity of 240. If you want to know what rates does these signature campaigns give to there which rank then you should check this topic and the post I am mentioning will be of help to you. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=615953.msg63299594#msg63299594",
