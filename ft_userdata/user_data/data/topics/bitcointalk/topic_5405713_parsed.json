  "content": "Few days ago ledger announced big partnership with FTX exchange that enables easy coin swap using Ledger Live app with FTX.Self-custody is preserved in this process and they say fees are low, but I am not sure if they are the same like if you would use only FTX exchange without ledger. I first thought this could be a good idea because FTX is still offering kyc free tier for limited amounts, but than I saw that for use with Ledger Live is demands that your account passed KYC.WHat confuses me is this statement written on ledger blog:QuoteIf you already are an FTX customer, thereâ€™s no need for an additional KYCIn theory that would mean that swaps could work even without kyc, so it would be nice if someone could test if this is working or not.All you need is non-kyc FTX account and ledger hardware wallet with latest version of ledger live app (2.44.0 and newer).https://www.ledger.com/blog/you-can-now-swap-your-crypto-with-ftx-through-ledger-livePSUnrelated with FTX, but I would like to warn everyone to STOP using Coinify exchange with their ledger wallet.Coinify is owned by Voyager that recently went bankrupt and stopped all their withdrawals.",

      "body": "This is useful. But FTX is still a centralized exchange. I can remember many crypto exchanges were not requesting for KYC in the past, but see many of them that are now requesting for KYC. FTX at any point in time have the power to enforce KYC. In the process while some people want to swap one coin or token to another, it is possible that FTX may freeze the coin that the person want to swap and request for KYC just like instant exchanges. Centralized exchanges are always looking for ways to attract customers, the customers use the centralized exchanges trading platform, later the exchange will look for ways to make KYC more possible and mandatory. Is this not another way noncustodial addresses will be linked to real identity of exchange users in the future? We all know what exchanges can later make mandatory.",

I remember doing a similar check without doing an actual swap with one of their other partners in the past. I just checked the rates. The offered rates in Ledger Live were worse than what I was offered on the exchange website. There is no reason to think that things would be different now with FTX. I can try something similar with FTX just to check the rates later. I am not doing their KYC though.",

I am not doing their KYC though.I don't mind paying higher fees if it can be done without kyc, but I would think twice if I had to wait for hours for swap transaction to complete.There are options for atomic swaps that can be added to ledger Live with lower fees, but I guess ledger wont earn so much money with that.I see there are some troubles for people who rushed to try new FTX swap feature with their ledger devices, and it's not working like expected.Swapping coins is taking hours in some cases so don't expect quick exchange, and I saw they are charging higher fees for this service: https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/vuxkvg/why_does_swap_via_ftx_take_so_long_so_frustrated/Other people are reporting unknown error messages when trying to swap coins and there are no explanation from ledger support:https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/vumycd/ftx_error_when_trying_to_swap_on_ledger_live/",

      "body": "Judging by this source from their help section, FTX has 3 different account levels when it comes to KYC. Unverified accounts where you only submit your email for the registration process, can't trade, deposit, or withdraw coins. The first level KYC requires personal data such as your name, date of birth, full address, and phone number. That limits you to $2.000 of crypto-only withdrawals per day. So that's the minimum you have to do. The YouTuber in the video has probably reached Tier 1 or 2 in his FTX account, otherwise it wouldn't be possible to make the swap. The positive thing with FTX is that you at least don't have to submit pictures of your ID/passport for Tier 1. I am sure that many other platforms require pictures of your ID, a selfie, etc.",

FTX is a custodial and centralized exchange, like many others, but this partnership is somewhat different. You don't lose custody of your coins if you swap them through Ledger Live and FTX. That's what the official documentation says. There is no need to deposit coins into FTX, make the swap, withdraw from FTX, and send the coins back to your Ledger. The swap is apparently non-custodial in nature. Time will tell how true that claim is. If users get their assets frozen for whatever reason, we can no longer talk about self-custody.",

I don't agree that you don't lose the custody, neither that you don't send the coins to ftx.The swap itself happens when you first send your coins to FTX (Authorizing the transaction in your device). At this moment you don't have the custody,Â  even for just a few minutes.Then FTX will send you back the coins you just exchanged.I don't think this is risky.Â  But you need to provide all your KYC details to trade more than 2000 usd, and all your ledger live data/history will probably be shared with ftx.There is very little convenience gain, very high privacy risk and also you are getting a worse exchange rate compared to using ftx itself.",

I don't believe it myself because similar terms or lies (if you want) were also said by those instant swap platforms that are around. They claim to do the swap process in a non-custodial way. But then we have cases of people being asked to undergo KYC, provide origin of funds, or the coins simply disappearing. Users have no way to get to those coins without getting in touch with the support of that centralized entity. If the process was non-custodial, a request for KYC could be answered with \"yeah right, bugger off\" and you just import your keys elsewhere and take back your coins. However, you can't do that.",
