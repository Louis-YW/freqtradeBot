I want to hear from all of you...If by safe you mean guaranteed profits or no risk of loss, then there is no investment that is 100% safe.If you do adequate research and understand the underlying value of Bitcoin, and plan out how to buy so you are not tempted to panic sell; you'll be able to hold till your desired profit range.What causes people to lose is when they rush into investing as the price rises and panic to sell if it drops, cause it's a volatile market. Or when they invest more than they can afford to lose and eventually need that money soon after to settle real life problems.Quote from: Charmekkd on February 11, 2023, 04:45:35 AMand what is a good application for buying and selling crypto, and is it safe?..............Bitcoin is a decentralized, immutable, unregulated form of transacting from one user to another. It frees one from the control of centralized authorities.",

I want to hear from all of you...and what is a good application for buying and selling crypto, and is it safe?..............Depends on your perspective to define \"safe\".In terms of security:Investing in Bitcoin is really safe as long as you hold your coins on hardware wallet or cold storage, but if you leave your coins on web wallet, closed source or exchange, you have a chance to lose all of your coins in the future.In terms of price:Bitcoin have been proven to recover from dump market for multiple times and most of the time you will make a good profit after holding for around 4 years. You might lose in the first 1-2 years, but the next 2 years you will make money, although there's no 100% guarantee.",

Before you decide to invest in bitcoin you should gather lots and lots of information about it, as from what you are asking it seems you have no idea. Deciding to buy bitcoin should not be based on what we tell you but on what you are clear about:1) Why you are buying (because they tell you in a forum or because you have understood what bitcoin is?)2) Where you are going to buy (DEX are usually better than CEX for privacy).3) How are you going to store it (online or are you going to keep your private keys?).4) How much you are going to buy and what system (are you going to buy a lump sum all at once or are you going to make recurring purchases, known as DCA?)5) How long are you going to HODL and on the basis of which system (again, do you plan to sell all at once in the future or do partial sales in bull markets?)",

Bitcoin could be used to send and receive money, you can hold it, in which your gains or losses will be proportional to the market price, and you can decide to trade it. These three categories have their benefits depending on what you want, and they show that Bitcoin dealing is not useless in any ramifications.But trying to make money through Bitcoin is technical, you need full knowledge of trading and investment which anyone cannot single-handedly teach you here. So investing now when you don't have basic knowledge is too risky and will surely make you lose. Invest only when you are fully prepared for the task ahead.",

Don't judge the quality of the investment based on the returns you get or don't get. You know, a Ponzi scheme can give you 100% returns at the right time, but that doesn't make it a sound or recommended investment. If you buy bitcoin now at $21k and it drops down to $19k, that doesn't make it a bad investment. The market moves in cycles and right now we are in a negative one. If you are going to need the little money that you have (because you said you don't have much for investments), in 1-2 months, it's better not to invest it. A good investment is a long-term commitment. Look at 2 or 3 years from now. The global economy is in a bad spot overall now.  Quote from: Outhue on February 11, 2023, 08:10:51 AM...and I can guarantee you that in the comings months, your invested money would have doubled or triple No, you can't! You can't possible know where Bitcoin will be a few months from now. I think we are in for new drops and shake-outs before things get better towards next year hopefully. Everything is speculation, while the market has its own rules.",

I want to hear from all of you...Firstly welcome to the forum, there's so much to learn and you shouldn't rush any of them. Take your time and make sure you understand properly what you're learning and not stopping halfway as that can be very dangerous. When it come to exchange to buy Bitcoin, we have centralized and decentralized ones. Personally I don't care where you buy your coin but make sure you're holding them in a decentralized wallets that gives you full control of your coins by issuing you your private keys. Bitcoin investing is actually safer than other investment out there as it gives you a chance to be incharge of your investment and not trusting some broker or centralized service providers to handle your portfolio for you.As for the price fluctuations, that's what make the market very interesting and entertaining to follow. You can avoid all this by just been a holder in which you just buy and hold unto your coins but if you want to partake in the speculations of the price through trading, that too is safe if you understand what you're doing. If Bitcoin investment wasn't safe, it won't have gotten as big as it currently is and lasted more than a decade, so no need to be scared of the market.",

Only use money that you can afford to lose when investing to avoid panic,if the price drops below the amount you bought.",

Everyone has at some point. Some people here have owning bitcoin when it was only worth a few hundred or thousand dollars. It wasn't that long ago that it was just $4 or $5k. And look where it is now compared to that! However, many have also bought their first coins due to FOMO (fear of missing out) at $50k or $60k. Their portfolios don't look as healthy as they did back then. We often say that if you don't sell, you don't lose, and it's true. The times of BTC being at $60-70k can one day return and if you don't sell earlier, you don't lose anything.Patience and strategy. If your world will fall apart because your BTC investment isn't going in the right direction, then you are doing it wrong.",

But what you need to understand here is that this is not a group, but rather a forum which has some rules and that must be understood by all users here. And regarding crypto knowledge, actually you can rely on several other sites too without having to always rely on this forum, because knowledge about crypto is very broad and has several paths that you have to choose yourself when you understand it.Quotebut is investing in bitcoin really safe or not? and do many lose from investing in bitcoin or not? I want to hear from all of you...Investing in Bitcoin in general is of course very safe as long as you use a secure wallet to store your own Bitcoins. And for those who have ever lost on Bitcoin, actually it's just about the patience of someone who is still immature and very often there is panic when they see bad news through the media so that he or some people prefer to sell Bitcoin at low prices. Even if he doesn't sell at a low price, of course he hasn't suffered a loss as long as he still holds his Bitcoin very safely.Quoteand what is a good application for buying and selling crypto, and is it safe?..............To buy and sell crypto, I don't think you need to use any application, because you and everyone only need to use certain exchanges that they have entrusted to buy and sell crypto. So you don't need to think about which application is suitable for buying and selling crypto because all trading takes place on the exchange, although several exchanges have developed applications for their respective users.",
