If you import Electrum seed phrase on Bluewallet, the transaction you make from Bluewallet will not support RBF.Likely because of the full RBF. Let me quote these:Quote from: PawGo on April 24, 2023, 07:08:27 AMQuote from: LoyceV on April 24, 2023, 06:38:39 AMQuote from: nc50lc on April 21, 2023, 07:31:33 AMQuote from: satscraper on April 20, 2023, 02:51:31 PMThe  wallet's \"Preferences\"  have missed \"Transactions\" tab, so plenty of useful features like \"Advanced preview \",  \"Spend only confirmed coins\" and so on are missing. Those settings are moved to the settings icon in \"New Transaction\" window. (After clicking \"Pay...\" in the 'Send' tab)For \"Advanced Preview\", just click 'Preview' instead of 'OK'.I was searching for this yesterday, and couldn't find it. So thanks  I didn't try that icon because I instantly clicked Preview.One thing which is missing (or I cannot find it) is RBF switch. In the previous version I set switched off RBF, in config file (json) I see Code:\"use_rbf\": falsebut when I prepare transaction RBF is enabled and I have no idea how to change it.Quote from: LoyceV on April 24, 2023, 07:38:59 AMQuote from: PawGo on April 24, 2023, 07:08:27 AMbut when I prepare transaction RBF is enabled and I have no idea how to change it.I guess that's part of the new Full RBF?So, there are now 3 Settings-icons per transaction:1.2.3.That's not confusing at all",

What happens if I ignore this requirement?AFAIK, for the wallet, it'll only mark it as RBF and show a warning that it can still be replaced by the sender.I recommend to test it with a small amount first though.For BIP70 payment requests, I don't know how it'll handle it.",

BitPay has been applying shady tactics in the past[2] and using alternative services is always a great choice. The second option would be to use a wallet that supports RBF on/off option (I think Bitcoin Core still supports this option).[1]https://debitpay.directory/[2]https://debitpay.directory/anti-bitcoin/",

If the user use a BIP39 seed phrase on Bluewallet as an example, as he wants to broadcast the transaction, the RBF is enabled by default which can be unchecked.If Electrum seed phrase is imported into Bluewallet and transaction made from it on the Bluewallet, the transaction is automatically not RBF enabled.",

According to this article, unconfirmed transactions that have been flagged as RBF are highlighted in pink and they display a message saying \"Be careful. Until it confirms, the transaction could be replaced/redirected by the sender\". ilib, are you sure that Bitpay doesn't accept RBF-enabled transactions?",

I just checked it and the option to mark the transaction as rbf or to mark it as final does not exist anymore. Not sure when this change has been introduced, but for sure it was before V4.4.0.Not sure why people are still using Bitpay, though! They enforce kyc, don't accept rbf transactions, don't accept transactions paying fees less than xx. Everyone should stop using them and move to a better service.",

There is no logical reason for that, and they do not accept zero confirmation transactions.The feature of not activating RBF is always found in casinos, as they try to speed up the deposit process so that the transaction is accepted with zero confirmations and wait for withdrawal after confirmation, and thus the user experience is fast, for the success of this, the transaction must not support RBF.In the case of Bitpay, and because the service is a payment gateway, you must obtain one confirmation before doing anything, so using RBF will not change anything.@ilib Bitpay has a history of shady activities try using an alternative company.",

The only option is to get the previous version as you advised. That's why I'm always reluctant to make updates unless there is a security threat.",
