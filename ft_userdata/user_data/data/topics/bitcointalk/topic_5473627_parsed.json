  "content": "I've been using Wise for years and sometimes use it to make transactions. Yesterday, I sold 26usdt for $25.78 on my Wise account. And today, to my surprise, they told me my account was closed and gave me until February 8 to take all my money. And once my Wise account was closed, I could appeal. In your opinion, is it a good idea to send them an email and acknowledge that I used Binance to make the transaction yesterday and that I will NEVER do it again? Will they accept this excuse, since I didn't know they refused this kind of transaction from someone who owns Wise?Here's the message I'll send in the email:Dear Wise Customer Service,I am writing to appeal the closure of my Wise account. My account has been closed because of this 25.78 USD transaction I received from Dmitry Soloviov for exchanging or trading crypto-currencies I had in my Binance account in order to get this money to pay my bill. You know I'm doing this because you don't have the MonCash payment system, because the money was in my account. And from what I understand from reading this, this constitutes a breach of your customer contract.I am truly sorry for having violated the customer contract. I didn't realize that exchanging or trading crypto-currencies was prohibited. I know this now by reading your rules. I have been a loyal Wise customer for many years and have never violated the customer contract before.I promise never again to trade or exchange crypto-currencies using my Wise account. I fully commit to the customer contract in the future.I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and I am confident that I will not make the same mistake again. I would be very grateful if you could reconsider your decision and reinstate my account.Thank you for your time and attention.Yours sincerelyRichardson OgeNOTE: Please take the time to read this and let me know if you think they will reinstate my account so I don't have to wait all this time to appeal?",

      "body": "I do not think that any service that banned you because you violated the TOS will give you access to your account by simply apologized. Unfortunately, I think that after you posted your data publicly, they already have evidence of the reason for locking your account.The best thing you can do is ask them about the reason. It may not be because of Binance, and now you have given them an additional reason. After confirming the reason, you can wait. They may allow Binance transactions in the future and then you can ask them to reactivate your account.",

      "body": "Are you sure it is because you make transactions on Binance? According to their faqs, they do allow transactions from a platform that deals with crypto as long as it is registered in the UK [1]. If you successfully appeal your ban, maybe stick with a locally registered platform for crypto transaction in the future.[1] https://wise.com/help/articles/2932118/incompatible-accounts-and-payments",

      "body": "They will most likely reject your apology, so it is best not to waste time. These services have strict laws and are completely controlled by governments.But what I wonder is why you insist on using the Wise service since they prohibit dealing in cryptocurrencies and you want to get some transfers from there. You can look for a better option to transfer money through services that do not ban cryptocurrencies, and this will be much better for you in the future.In my opinion, you should look for an alternative service and you will certainly find many services in your country.",

Maybe it’s completely different, and you’ve already told unnecessary information about yourself.",
