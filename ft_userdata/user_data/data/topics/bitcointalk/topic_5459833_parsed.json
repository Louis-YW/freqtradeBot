Can you guys share your thoughts on what will happen if mining stops today? What kind of sentiments will it bring to the market and those above questions remains the same.",

That only means that there's still interest from the people and money is still there. Miners will keep on mining because they have to confirm the transactions. The price will still be dependent to the demand of the market. At the end of the day, the answers will just give you satisfaction from knowing what could potentially happen but then, we won't be existing by that time if we tick in the reality.",

Positive impact or negative impact?Will people still be interested in Bitcoin?I can not shake off this curiosity in my mind. So let's talk about that. Tell me your thoughts. What this event is going to do to the crypto world.First of all that thing is not going to happen in our life because most of us will already be dead by 2140 because no body is yet known to live over 120+ years and that's why I think almost all of us will be resting in peace before 2140. However, if we just want to make a scenario to predict that what's going to happen if that day happens in the life of our grand-children then still that's not possible because things will be very different in 2140's, and who knows that humans will still be using this finance system or they will have moved even beyond quantum computing.Let's still make a prediction for curiosity only, I believe that if all bitcoins are minded then things will be different in crypto market. In that time the price of a single Bitcoin would be over $10 million in value, and anyone who holds a Bitcoin would be among the richest people of the time. The value of $10 million will be of this day, and not of the time where the value of fiat would go so down that $10 would not be sufficient to buy the good that it can but now. There won't be any miners, and that's why everyone would be able to send and receive bitcoins without any issues. There won't be any mining fees for the transactions and that's why anyone could be able to send/receive bitcoins without any  delay issues. There is a chance that the miners will live with the transaction fees because they won't be able to mine any more blocks or bitcoins. However, if the mining fee is gone then the fees of transactions could be somewhat higher than today's rates. Other than that nothing will be changed in the ecosystem of Bitcoin, and anybody would be able to use it like today's time.",

Then miners will not get block rewards and they will get only transection fees for every confirmed transections. Then transection fees are expected to rise. But the demand will surely increase as the adoption will grow over time.Quote from: tjtonmoy on July 14, 2023, 06:25:26 PMWill we be able to see stability in Bitcoin prices? Or price dump? how will this play out? Positive impact or negative impact?Will people still be interested in Bitcoin?1. Halving manipulate price of Bitcoin and push up harder but it's not the only reason why Bitcoin is volatile. It's volatile because of its demand and usecases, user sentiments and hype. So we can't say how the situation will be in that time. 2. We will face both positive and negative impact. Because then probably transection fees will be much higher and also the demand will increase. 3. You just imagine about the advantages of Bitcoin and how much secure it is. It's still illegal in almost every counties but still people have too much interest. And if governments start legalizing Bitcoin then it will create new Era of Currency system.",

Bitcoin will still be in circulation as there will still be demand and supply. The major difference is that many will be unwilling to sell and many will be willing to buy. This gesture will try increase the price of bitcoin and also the price will be somewhat stablized.I have long stopped thinking about bitcoin future because it is now in the hands of the people and the people will do whatever they want to do with it. Bitcoin has passed the stage of skepticism. We should just concentrate and enjoy it.",

Less stability makes it ideal for trades. 2. Positive. Scarcity is always good, as long as there's demand. Bitcoin is in demand, so if it becomes more scarce it will only increase its value. 3.

What this event is going to do to the crypto world. Welp. Here's the misconception about \"miners and validators losing their jobs soon as all bitcoins are mined hurr durr\" which could not be any farther from the truth. The fact of the matter is that not only do these miners get money from mining bitcoins, they also earn money through contributing computing power, which we then pay them through transaction fees. So just cause all bitcoins are mined doesn't necessarily mean these people who spent thousands of dollars on their rigs are left to eat in soup cans and beg on the streets. They'd have a prime avenue to take advantage of. Furthermore, the economy will be even more empowered if all bitcoins are mined as there's nothing left to do by then but to hold, buy, and sell bitcoins, which will open more opportunities for people from outside the industry to get in and see bitcoin for themselves!",

How this will impact the whole crypto world?I wouldn't imagine it - so let the next generation figure out how to do it. The current developer will switch to another developer - something good is to be expected, but if it's bad then obviously the impact will be really bad.So far bitcoin will continue to grow and cases of its adoption will also increase along with the softening of government regulations. Bitcoin has become a means of payment in various places [online and offline] and will continue to grow from year to year.
