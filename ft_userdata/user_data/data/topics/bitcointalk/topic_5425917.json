Some people may generate a paper wallet directly on a website (online) which make it an online wallet, not offline wallet.Paper wallet supposed to be an offline wallet, using the source code of paper wallet site like bitaddress to generate it on an airgapped devices, or using iancoleman or wallet like Electrum to generate the wallet on airgapped device.Quote from: FinneysTrueVision on December 06, 2022, 03:47:06 AMA paper wallet requires you to keep it in a safe place that nobody else has access too. By default the most popular paper wallet generators have the private key printed on the wallet so if anybody finds it they will be able to steal your BTC. Not only paper wallet, other wallets too. People backup their wallet seed phrase on paper, laminated paper or metallic sheet which can be stolen if not properly saved in safe locations. If you buy a hardware wallet, the backups for seed phrase are still paper, or you get yourself metallic sheets which still do not mitigate or eliminate the risk of such offline attack.You can use BIP38 passphrase (encryption) as an additional security if generated on sites like bitaddress, or use passphrase or extended word to use a seed phrase to generate different keys and addresses on HD wallet so that only you that know the passphrase or extended word can access your coins. Quote from: FinneysTrueVision on December 06, 2022, 03:47:06 AMThere is also a possibility that the ink will fade or the paper will deteriorate and you will lose access to your funds.The backup can be on metallic sheet, it does not necessarily mean the backup should be on paper. The backup can properly be stored on USB sticks that has no connection with online device, but having connection with only airgapped device.Quote from: Husna QA on December 06, 2022, 04:23:34 AM- It still has to be connected to another online wallet to use bitcoin.It depends.Safest wallet and method to sweep a paper walletMost Secure Method To Sweep Paper WalletAs long as you can create a watch-only wallet on an online device to create unsigned transaction (PSBT) and signing it on an airgapped device and broadcasted it using the the watch-only wallet, you can use it to spend some coins or the coins on a paper wallet without connecting the seed phrase or private key online.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on December 06, 2022, 05:04:17 AMHardware wallets are best if you can have money to buy.No. How? Why? Although, hardware wallets are good for people that do not know much about how to setup and use wallet on an airgapped device, also good for frequent transactions.",

Honestly I didn't hear people saying that and I got impression that people rather use hardware wallets in that case. Paper wallet is fine if you wanna store your bitcoin safely and for some reason can't or don't wanna invest in hardware wallet. About biggest disadvantage, beside obvious one (easy to destroy/loose, not practical when you want to send bitcoin) I would also say that paper wallet is only safe if its done in a proper way and taken all precautions, and that's something that many fail at.",

      "body": "I'm afraid that everyone saying the biggest disadvantage of a paper wallet is the fact that it is stored on paper are wrong. The biggest disadvantage, by far, is that most people do not set them up and use them securely, or indeed, are not even aware of how to set them up and use them securely and the many risks and pitfalls they are exposing themselves to.I would not recommend using bitaddress or any other website to generate your paper wallet. Javascript is a very poor choice for generating private keys. It is often very buggy or poorly implemented, it is open to attack even in machines temporarily disconnected from the internet, it often draws on poor sources of entropy, and it is often untested and unverified. Simply downloading bitaddress and turning off your internet is not a secure way to generate a wallet. Similarly, most people would try to spend from such a paper wallet by simply importing it in to a hot wallet, which opens you up to all the same risks of any other hot wallet.To properly generate a paper wallet, you need a permanently airgapped computer, formatted with a clean OS or running a live OS, running tried and tested wallet software such as Core or Electrum, connected to a dumb airgapped printer with no internal memory, and you need all of this again when it comes to importing your paper wallet to spend from it. Doing all this is both time consuming and complicated, and most people will mess up somewhere, often without even realizing it.",
