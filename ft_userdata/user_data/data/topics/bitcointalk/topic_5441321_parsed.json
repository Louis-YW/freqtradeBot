  "content": "After partnership with  Bitt Inc  to launch it's new CBDC, the E-naira a year ago seemed not to be getting the traction it envisaged, the Central Bank of Nigeria is seeking the services of a new tech partner. The aim is to plan a more effective method in which they have more control over the digital currency. Experts have suggested that user experience be improved as this may help for a faster adoption. Meanwhile, Nigerian banks seem not to have contributed much to this exercise due to alleged hitches that marred the usability of the digital currency. Surprisingly, even with the cash crunch that seem to be holding Nigerians ransom, they still prefer to use BTC for transactions more than the E-naira even after it promised to improve retail payment.Sadly, even though Nigerians chose to turn to the E-naira, transactions with the CBDC will be limited. Now where I need opinions on is; should Nigeria dump this project and focus on other important things like possibly expanding Bitcoin hubs in more places other than the two locations it is in now (Lagos, Ibadan) or is there something a new tech partner can do to revive the E-naira?? link1 link 2",

      "body": "Before entering into any analysis, I think it is important to distinguish between some details :- Bitcoin and CBDC are two completely different things and the Nigerian government's choices range between both or as if it is in an experimental phase between the two. And instead of circulating Bitcoin to more than two states, it is considering a completely different option, which is CBDC. It seems that the government understood from its short experience with crypto that it would not be able to fully control and the matter would escape from its hands.- There is a huge difference between the choices of the government and the choices of users of the Nigerian people. This is given that Nigeria is the African country where the wave of crypto adoption is accelerating. Of course, people will choose Bitcoin, and they may need to use CBDC in official transactions if the state adopts it, but they will definitely prefer Bitcoin.",

I think the Nigerian government delights in going for projects that won't profit anything other than wasting time and resources. If I can remember vividly, the E-naira was introduced in Nigeria in October 2021 and statistics show it's just 1out 200 Nigerians that use it. It would be a wiser move to stick with BTC like El Salvador since according to Nairametrics, it was found that the country's Bitcoin peer-2-peer transactions for the Q2 of 2022 totalled up to $34.4m and this record is gotten even while BTC is not so welcomed.",

They would have known the best mode to operate it and make it user-friendly with a reasonable transactional cost. Unfortunately, the e-naira lacks all these.This would have guided them better. In a few years now, they are looking at a different thing entirely, why then rushed for the former? The issue with the Nigerian government is that they are not always prepared and strategic, which is why their lapses are all over the place.",

CBDC which they currently claim is a perfect innovation is actually a failed innovation and the concept will be difficult for society to accept, especially in a country that has a bad political climate.As one of the largest countries on the African continent and with a dense population, the Nigerian government should not play around with CBDCs because what they hope for is the level of public trust in the government.",

That's why the country is where it is right now, rotating just in one place. They don't bring up ideas based on the betterment of its citizens, but on their selfish interests and what they are to gain from it. The plan for this E-naira was just a means to loot funds since after a proposal is made and the funds are handed over to the bodies in charge, they use little of what they proposed and do what ever they feel is right for them to do since they believe they can't be checked and asked to give a proper account of what the funds were actually used for.",

Besides a comparison would mean having access to government data, and those have not also been revealed, not even mentioning the last week when the ordinal hype raised the transaction fee to at least 10sat/b, close to half a dollar for a simple tx, not something really appealing for a country with a minimum wage around ~$100.Plus, if you are unable to use a debit card hard chance you are knowledgeable enough to use a Bitcoin wallet.Quote from: bittraffic on February 27, 2023, 04:38:08 PMThey should just focus on BTC instead and do what El Salvador did.Nigeria doesn't have the $ as a currency to not care that much about the exchange rate or conversions or capital outflow, for Salvador it was simple, the central bank was not involved in money printing, money security, or anything else.",

The recent strict implementation of the cashless policy led to the breakdown of the mobile banking servers of most banks in Nigeria. People have been unable to electronically transfer and receive money. People are attracted to Bitcoin transaction because it is more reliable than these CBDC transactions. The constant fall of the Naira also discourage people to save with the currency or put them in fixed deposits because inflation will make these funds worthless. Presently people prefer using Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, that is why the youths of Nigeria are attracted to the coin. New partnership might be effective in the area of quality service delivery like hitch-free financial transactions. People may consider dealing with the e-Naira if they get quality service from service providers. But except people start having confidence on the Naira, they will never be comfortable to transact, invest or save in the Nigerian currency.",

If they truly are committed to launching this type of virtual currency, then the central bank should take complete responsibility for it, at least at the setup stage, just as they dictate fiat currency policy. It's another gimmick and a bit of a cop out that they announced it such a long time ago but have made zero progress on it so far.",
