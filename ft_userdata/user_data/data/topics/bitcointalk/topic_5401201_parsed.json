If it's free then take it but you have to be updated when these free rounds will be given. (just to correct, its \"free slots\" not \"spots\" according to the blog) I guess it's just a typo error from the OP.Number 2 is an important thing if you are planning high-stakes betting. Most of the online gambling sites do offer a lot of things for VIPs, platinum holders, or whatever they call them. Like freebies for hitting a bet amount, bonuses, and more. Surefire strategy? I don't think that exists unless you are cheating.",

In order to maximize and utilize your winning profits, you must know to assess whether to stick or explore other games to play. If you know you mostly win in skill based game, then go for skill based games and improve your knowledge with it. Just like what you said, the most suitable gambling type would be sport if someone is into analyzation and luck. Chances of winning sports betting is higher if you know the team's background and its players capability. The rest you just believe and hold tight that the odds will be on your favor because sometimes the tables just suddenly turn around.",

Discipline is some what we need in gambling because if we have this for sure we will not get hype up and frequently we will always think to take profit once we are winning already.",

I quite agree with it. In gambling, trying to play every game may be the fastest way for you to loose your money, the best approach should be playing games that you are skilled at, and improving your skill set on that particular game to ensure that your probability of failure reduces considerably before trying out other games. Jumping around and trying to gamble on every game will do your pocket no good.",

These promotions could be in a form of a contest, lottery, giveaway, etc. Also, some of the good ones only appear once or twice so you really need to be active and take advantage whenever the opportunity appears. One of the downsides with promotions is that you could miss out on some of them if the promo is related to a game provider like evolution or pragmatic for example and you're from one of the geo-restricted countries.",

Most casinos are generous enough to give out free rolls if you meet certain wager criteria, but that also forces people to shell out some money in order to get those bonuses. Regardless. it is still a good strategy to take advantage of these bonuses when they are on, but is not wise to shell out all your funds just to get them for one session.",

When I was only starting, years ago, I thought I was skilled in dice game.  Really, I thought I'd figured it out. And, amazingly enough, it was kind of \"working\". For weeks! I wasn't making a fortune, but 2-3 bucks per day was big money for me back then. Then, of course, it stopped working, because it was never working, in the first place. Only later I learned that you can invent any strategy for any purely luck-based game, and it can be \"working\" for some time. So, before starting playing \"the games that you’re skilled at\", find out, do those games depend on skill, at least partially.",

      "body": "2 is the strategy used by most people to win against the house afaik, there was even a case where the player talked with the casino to remove the house, not really sure for the duration(since he was a usual player and played in the casino for so long, so can be considered as a user perk). Plus, it gives free plays for you to do, so it's something to naturally take advantage of. 3 is something you do in anything that involves expenses imo, and 4 and 5 are pretty much dependent on what you yourself play. And in the case of 4, it doesn't necessarily increase the chances sometimes since games like slots aren't really skill reliant.
