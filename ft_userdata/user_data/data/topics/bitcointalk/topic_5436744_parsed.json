  "content": "Honestly, I'd say he took quite the gamble. Maybe the gambler of the year for 2022! This man bet his marriage on making it all the way to the super bowl. He also bet the majority of his wealth on the FTX scam. Unfortunately Mr. Brady has lost it all! You have got to feel bad for the guy. I am a huge Brady fan, and can sympathize with his losses. Surely many people that don't like him for whatever reason may be happy with his current predicament, which is honestly pretty sad if that is the case. We are all human here, and dealing with tremendous loss is difficult. Especially when you're in the lime light. I recently heard on a radio talk show a clip from a reporter asking Tom Brady just the other day what he was going to do now? Tom replied, \" You know *name of the reporter* if I knew what I was going to do I would have already F$%king done it!\" Poor Tom. I would bet that Brady stays at it, he is not going to end his career like this, having one of the most brutal years personally 1000% affected his game, I would bet that he gets picked up by another team soon, hopefully New England! Any thoughts on this?",

      "body": "I feel like his choice of investing in FTX was influenced by big money that Fried gave him. When a celebrity advertises something you can be sure there was large money at play just like with Kevin O'leary, They got a lot of money, saw that SBF was loaded and this clouded their judgement. They were victims of a scam rather than gamblers.

If we agree that his investment choices were indeed gambling then the topic should be here, if we don't and say these were more of a career and wealth choices, it should be in off-topic or maybe politics and society. It's like those threads asking if investing in bitcoin is gambling. It can be considered a gambling discussion or not, depending on how you see it.",

FTX is an investment that not everyone thought would go the way it did, because SBF was very open to whatever questions the media has in the exchange and was a very likeable guy, not until all of his secrets were uncovered and all of his poor decisions exposed. I wouldn't blame Brady for believing in FTX, as other renowned investors also took their chance on the said exchange. It would have been a good decision had it not been for SBF misappropriating the funds of the exchange and using it for his own good.Anyhow, that's gambling for you. You win some, you lose some.",

Any thoughts on this? For sure he has made a big gamble on FTX, if I'm not mistaken, he is one of those who had the laser eye viral for crypto? So he really went all in with his money or with her wife Giselle (than time), and now ex-wife. And he has been seen with SBF in public many times with picture of both of them together.So I guess he has been in this game for so long that for sure he will bounce back. And yeah probably since a one year contract on whoever team is willing. It will be sentimental if NE will pick him up again, but who knows.",

And he's quite active in the movie business, he definitely gets a few million per movie he's in. But you don't know if he keeps gambling or decides to stop now. It is always difficult to verify such stories. Often things are hyped up in the media to get ratings. Incidentally, there are many more movie stars who become addicted to drugs, alcohol and that is regularly accompanied by a gambling addiction. But the difference is that these movie stars can miss the money quite easily since a lot of money comes in again over time.",

I guess this dude was high on something, I don't have the full gist of how all this happens and the details of what led to his divorce.Did he gamble his marriage as a bet, or did he just riak all his life savings on acquiring some FTX token and assets or did a hard a large pool in the trading and lending platform that has been suspended with investors' funds locked?",

Any thoughts on this? While nobody should take any sort of happiness out of others misery, he absolutely brought this on himself and it was done out of greed. If he had approached a proper financial advisor and took their advice, he would be sitting on a diversified income stream from the huge salaries and endorsements that he has earned over time. Instead, based only on the way you described it, he took a punt on one major investment which has turned bad. The only reason people do these things is that they were sold the idea that it would double, triple or otherwise multiply his money in a short period of time. Wise money invests in the long game and expects small but steady returns over time. Either way, he has enough history to work a smaller fortune back up because he has a massive fan base who will sustain him.",

It's one thing to be an investor and another to be promoting this for other people to see and making them lose their money alongside of him and his wife. Of course we don't know if he really lost money and how much because it appears that most of the money allegedly defrauded by SBF is still there, so there's a chance most people will get their investment back.
