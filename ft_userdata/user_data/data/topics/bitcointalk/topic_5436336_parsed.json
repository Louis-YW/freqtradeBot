      "body": "The problem is that Nigeria is not having good electricity. Nigeria is a developing nation and we can expect low cost of electricity usage if compared with developed nations, everything produced in the country (not imports, but electricity bill) would be cheaper in a developing nation if compared to a developed nation, that would have been an advantage to run miners in Nigeria but no constant electricity. In Nigeria, most people either have to depend on generator or solar as backup plan and as alternatives. It will not be a surprise if you see Nigeria to be among the first 5 countries that import generator annually.",

However, as Charles has explained, the cost of electricity is low, but the light is unstable; therefore, if you must run a mining back, you will need a solar, inverter, or generator backup to avoid blackouts.Mines or mining farms are not illegal in Nigeria, as far as I am aware.Quote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on January 22, 2023, 09:31:39 AMIs there any information about taxes for cryptocurrency mining here?as a foreigner, if you make a profit from a business in Nigeria, you are subject to taxation based on your annual earnings.",

If you want to establish Mining Farm in Nigeria, it is a developed idea but the country can offer you large place of land if you need it. But electricity is zero that you have to buy your electric power generator. And also you will pay tax to the government. Then before you come you have to have a friend friend Nigeria who will direct you where and what to do.  So that if you want to do in the room he will provide for you or in the public place. The cost of electricity is very low but undependable.",

Yeah I can understand now, with in all the answers here that electricity is globally not stable  in Nigera.Quote from: Igebotz on January 22, 2023, 01:46:59 PMThe average household cost is $0.05 per KW/h, while industrial usage costs $0.08 per KW/h.

About electricitym despite unstability, the price is quite good.

The cost of electricity is very low but undependable. Yeah absolutely. The main idea is to replicate what we built in Bulgaria and Algeria.The idea is to find the cheaper Th/s per ASIC. For example, I bought palets of used S9 and S17 which are not the best and updated ASIC. But the cost per TH is great compared to other servers (at least when i bought them), and with some cheap electricity we can do some profit quickly (ROI in less than 2 years in Algeria, now we are almost doing full profits)Depending on the place, I don't organize things in the same way. For example in Algeria I had the opportunity to rent a part of a factory and to pay for my electricity in cash/BTC every month, without any contract needed. In Bulgaria I found 3 guys interested to host the servers and to manage them, it was difficult to build a \"trust\" and confidence between us but it is now working very well.I am wondering what would be the best thing to do in Nigeria. Reading all your answers, I think the best thing to do would be to rent some industrial location, and to share the electricity with someone which already own a huge electrical contract.I hope that I will have the opportunity to discover your great country in the near future",
