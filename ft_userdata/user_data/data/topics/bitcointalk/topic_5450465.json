Then you have 479001600 possible combinations.However BIP39 consists of 2048 words. So, If you want to guess 12 words out of the 2048 and try to arrange them in the correct order gives you a huge amount of possible combinations. It's a huge number!!!Just don't (I repeat, DON'T) ever think of letting someone know your words even if the order is incorrect.",

This topic brought me back to Block-size FUD from bitcoin.com when BCH increase the block size.I remember that a user on Reddit put the 12 words unordered with a prize for whoever reaches them, and yet no one was able, so you are safe as long as those words are true randomly arranged.",

      "body": "if you have 12 given words, there are 12! possible combinations of those 12 words (given you cannot re-use the same word).12! = 479.001.600Let's round this number down to 479 millionThe number of possible 12 word seed phrases is 2^1282^128 = 3,4 e38. That's 340282366920938463463374607431770 millionI did some googling, and found a benchmark of somebody claiming to be able to test ~150.000 combinations per second. Now, this was with a GPU and a highly specific derivation path and pre-known address that had to be derived using this derivation path... A best case scenario...Let's assume you get to 0.1 million combinations per second... It would take you 4790 seconds if you knew all 12 words... That's an hour and 20 minutes.If you don't have the 12 words, it'll take you 3402823669209384634633746074 seconds @ 0.1 million seeds/second... ThatsÂ  107.902.830.708.060.141.889.705.291 years....There's a huge difference between getting 12 random words and hacking a seedphrase where you don't know these 12 words...",

But I guess you misinterpreted the meaning of the 12 word brute force wrong. So if you keep your words secret there is nothing wrong with 12 words. I however also prefer 24 words, just because I can.",
