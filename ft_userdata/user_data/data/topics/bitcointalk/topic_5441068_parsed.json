If both handle the heavy works really well then you could choose between them which to use mostly for light work... while the other mostly for heavy works. This could depend on different factors: *Which do you want to be more mobile or stationary *How often do you want to use them*How much energy do both consume *etcIf it's something you want to use regularly, you are concerned about how much energy both consume and you want something for mobility then go for the laptop... Otherwise you may stick to the desktop. People typically use desktop for heavy work while laptop are typically used for light work but lots of laptops have become as capable as desktop even though they are smaller. However i have noticed that desktop can still be more powerful than laptop of thesame specs. So you really have to be sure. You may even test how powerful both are via websites that do that kind of testing. But I'm not sure how reliable such tests are.",

      "body": "I would choose the mini desktop. I just would much better use a desktop compared to a laptop. Those specs 256nvme 16gb ddr4, and i5 6500t cpu will enough power for cloud compute.I think this will be enough and cheaper then laptop with ryzen 2500U. But the ryzen 2500u is newer  I think so it will have to decide if its in your budget.",
