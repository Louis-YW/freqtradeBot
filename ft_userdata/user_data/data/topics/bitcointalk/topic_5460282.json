Indonesia is not a big country in cryptocurrency so this news is locally hot only and it does not create big impacts globally.The market will be warmed up more in coming months and I believe its bull run next two years will be related with Bitcoin Spot ETFs. When we have a first Bitcoin Spot ETF, Bitcoin will take that big news and fly over the Moon. When will it come?I guess some late months in 2024, a few months after the halving in April 2024.",

Because the adoption or i must say the demand for BTC will increase once the exchange will launch and then it is obviously a sign of bullish trend but of course not so long that we or the most of the people expecting in 2024. Because, a slight up trend can be seen here to like when XRP declared as security. I have read so many bullish trend news spreading all over the social media that is saying the next bull run will be in 2024.But, how can such small news like this one and other like XRP, would streamline the adoption of BTC. Or how the impact of such news will be equal to the impact of halving going to make on it will be equal. The point is, MT gox's funds are also going to release (of course some of it in batches) around September or August. Which, might included with other factors, like I heard a platform has to pay its loan but they only had some BTC so i think they might sell them which would dump the market and the deadline is also in those dates of MT GOX (i was unable to find the source because i read the news a while ago).",

I hope this doesn't happen, and not forcing available exchanges to join their scheme. Because as far as I know, when the government has entered any exchange, they will organize the price. So when the price goes up and down significantly, they will cut and close the pair. They will make the exchange like the stock. so, if happen, we don't see the reality again like we did trade like spot exchange before.The government tries various ways to make crypto can be controlled by 1 hand.

For those who prefer to use centralized exchanges, they will turn to government centralized exchanges rather than private institutions because of its safety. I think they will outperform and prevail over other exchanges in terms of safety. But when the government launches its own exchange, will it continue to license other exchanges or will it find a way to get rid of them?Quote from: dansus021 on July 20, 2023, 01:06:19 AMtapi good news nya semisal ini beneran terjadi ya mungkin bisa ditiru negara lain kalau berhasil dan at the end  mungkin kalau berhasil banyak masyarakat yang akan ikut berinvestasi ke dunia crypto I don't know if this will be good or bad for the market. I don't expect this to happen, although it will be safer for us but again the government will have complete control over us. Moreover, what I fear more is the government monopoly, they will find a way to get rid of other exchanges and force us to use their exchange.",

Which will increase the demand and we might see another uptrend. This uptrend will be helped with good news of ETFs etc. Because such news will help market to boost up. This might not be the bullish start, because the bullish cycle will be started after the halving. So, we have to wait for proper bullish cycle. This will just be a small up trend in market. But real up trend might start in the start of 2025 or end of 2024. Indonesia is not a big or progressive country like USA so the impact of such adoption rate will be low.",

I saw several officials in government as owners of specific crypto, so there will be a conflict of interest if crypto he has owner dump or not to his liking.
