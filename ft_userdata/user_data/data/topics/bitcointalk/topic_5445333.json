  "content": "It’s sometimes easy to forget that Bitcoin(BTC) is just a teenager, launched in 2009 by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto.Since then, Bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise, increasing from fractions of a penny to an all-time high of nearly INR 56,96,689 in November 2021.The big “B” was the best-performing asset class of the decade preceding that all-time high. Bitcoin returned more than 230% during the 10-year period ending in March 2021. For that reason alone, it’s now firmly entrenched in the mainstream.But Bitcoin’s price journey has been far from smooth. The original digital currency has experienced many violent dips and pumps. Let’s take a closer look at the ups and downs of Bitcoin’s price history.What Price Did Bitcoin Start At?Bitcoin was originally worth next to nothing.The transaction that first gave Bitcoin monetary value was in October 2009, when Finnish computer science student Martti Malmi, known online as Sirius, sold 5,050 coins for around INR 414.65, giving each Bitcoin a value of $0.0009 each.The exchange took place on PayPal. That can be hard to believe, with so many crypto exchanges dedicated to buying and selling BTC nowadays.Bitcoin’s Early Years: 2009 to 2012The growth in BTC adoption in the early years started slow. If you look at Bitcoin’s pricing data on Google Finance, it only goes back to Nov. 20, 2015.Source:https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-history-chart/",

      "body": "Bitcoin is here and has come to stay, it's such that has gained prominence in just a short time, and I can only wish the best for it in the nearest future. This is because of the way the world government are now trying to shift their focus of regulation on cryptocurrency. I know that nothing will tamper with the integrity and principle of operation of the coin, but more could be enforced regarding its usage for more transparency.They've clamped down on Chipmier, who knows what's next?",

      "body": "Agreed, with your point that good history brings confidence but I would like to add something here that experience is more important than confidence as History brings Experience whether it's good or bad and experience brings confidence. Let me explain it with an example a person with a good experience with the market will stay calm in a panic situation but a person who is new to the market and just experienced a bull rally can't stay long in the market when a huge crisis arises because he has not faced such panic situations but a person with good experience knows that this is the beauty of the crypto market, especially BTCBTC.Signs of a good trader and investor ConsistentStubborn with crisisDiversifierAnalystQuote from: Zorigi on March 18, 2023, 02:52:39 AMindeed most people invest in bitcoin among them because they are confident because they see the history of bitcoin, which fluctuates and always sets good price records.but of course everyone has different reasons for their interest in investing in bitcoin.It's not at all about the price it's about awareness, about freedom, and revolution. Personally, I don't see BTC maximum times on a Price basis actually I judge it by the adoption potential.",
