      "body": "Well, it's a nice opinion to reckon, but just think of these; if every opinion that's made was to be granted, imagine how clumsy/voluminous the forum' will look like....and that'd make the whole navigation process very difficult, so I think right now, Theymos -- even if he had to consider an appraisal like this one -- would only go for the fact that it hasn't enough content to be made a board independently.How's the update gonna be made? Cus for sure, it needs to get busy with activities on point, so what happens when you run outta od threads to re-link? .....you see the point now? Everyone's good If we could have it as a sticky thread.Edit: Gazeta, it actually does help but I think it'll be properly arranged I'd it's made to be at the top of an outstanding board, prolly META.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

The threads will do, I guess.However, if you're interesting in the history of Bitcoin and the forum, why don't you create detailed and comprehensive thread/linklist which features the most important milestones/threads/posts of the forum. Other users would surely help you with that. While there are various threads that already link other historic posts and threads, to my knowledge, however, they are not comprehensive and/or are not regularly updated.A good start would be xtraelv's historic and educational topics, which @GazetaBitcoin linked already.",
