First question --where is your ToS? this is very important to look at if you want to use any of the online casinos. Second is, --since your gambling casino is legally operated it means it requires KYC verification? My suggestion is to purchase a copper membership, this will be able for your account to post images that look catchy to every gambler who will open your announcement thread or ANN thread.",

But does it's have any difference between sports bookie via operators and sports bookie via contest? Because I see it's same, you need to pay to the winners and you get the money from the losers. Perhaps without using an operators, you're earn more as the house?",

I think we should be able to know which countries are restricted on the site or in this thread just like the other gambling sites.",

We know how boring p2p is and not everyone uses this since the chances of getting of bonus is not that wide. However, probably I have a wrong understanding.",
