  "content": "Hello Am looking for a self hosted betting script preferrably opensource  As long as it has the functions to save me time am fine, feeds if integrated or needs to be bought no problem, I do have my own feeds Please do not recommend basic ones like prophecy or betlab they only allow single bet with no betslip or any useful functions If you have a script to show, please note that a demo will be needed, including backend demo access and frontend to try before buyScreenshots are not enough, and links to demo sites that some scammers use to sites they do not own are useless  again, if you propose your own script or platform be willing to offer backend/frontend user demo access to try. Thank you",

There are many scenarios here where those who bought gambling script becomes suspected of copy-pasting into other gambling casinos become their reputation were ruined. Think about the future when your gambling casino becomes popular, there are too many possible troubles that you probably encounter if you will force yourself to buy gambling casino script.",
