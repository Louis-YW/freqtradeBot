And, if you want a tutorial in the form of a video, I've made it for you all my friends, here: https://youtu.be/tGBEYob_f44Follow the following 3 easy steps Guys :1.  Please open the site: https://app.celia.finance/register , then register on the site by entering your e-mail and password, and the verification will be sent to your e-mail, check your email inbox for the verification code. For an example, the image is below. 2. Then you are told to log in again to the Celia site, and please enter your e-mail and password that was registered earlier. After successfully logging in, you immediately get 2 CLT Tokens  as a registration reward, and you can see it on the Total Balance menu.3. Then, you click the \"Mine CLT\" menu which is under the \"Dashboard\" menu, and then please click the \"Mine 0.5 CLT\", and you get 0.5 CLT Token, and you can check it on the \"Dashboard\" menu in the \"Total Balance\" section. For an example, you can see in the image below.  Fyi : Total Supply of CLT Token is 200 MillionNote : Actually the mining this time is not part of PoW/PoS mining, it looks like it's just like a centralized web mining. And, you can claim or start mining again every 24 hours, so, every 24 hours (from the time you started mining) you have to start mining manually by logging in to the site to do mining.[/i ]",
