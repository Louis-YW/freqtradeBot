You can use the search feature and refer back to topics until 2010, which was the early days of Bitcoin and most of the deals that were made were P2P, as it was easy to mine Bitcoin with computers and therefore there was no urgent need to buy. People started buying Bitcoin with the first HALVING and from 2011 The platforms began to appear until 2013 as the first Bitcoin exchange rates to take into account the average price from several platforms.",

I wonder, how far these Banks can go in the hatred of Bitcoin,? Quote from: wtsimis on December 28, 2023, 05:56:38 PMI have not bought bitcoins directly from my bank account. Currently I use Binance Exchange p2p. I order directly from the buyer and send money from my bank to his bank and confirm it from Binance. The seller checks his bank account and gives me bitcoin. I think the bank authorities here don't understand whether we are buying bitcoins with this money or something else. As the bank transaction is completely a normal process.Yeah, P2p is a good option. but I think some Exchanges which are regulated in countries provide purchase details to banks and govt. also some P2P traders who buy/sell bitcoins tells their banks that the money they are receiving comes from Crypto trading. so you still need to be careful when buying in p2p.",

Clearly, Satoshi Nakamoto is being portrayed as someone who implemented a platform by developing the Boclkchain with the use case of a platform for financial transactions within eBusiness - let's travel back to 2006 / 07 to see exactly what was offered there on the subject of payment - who is said to have acted criminally.Tell Gensler he's crazy!

It has access to something legal, while individuals can invest in the shares of these funds or buy Bitcoin directly.There is an overall misunderstanding here. #BitCoin is a use case for the BlockChain technology. Another use case would certainly have been possible. The idea of mapping services - hence the concept of the Proof of Work - directly between two counterparties, thus creating a value equalisation *without* monetary transactions, was the actual background to developing a coin as a transaction value, which then gives both counterparties the opportunity to trade *directly* with other counterparties. We do not need to discuss the basis of the technology and the fundamentals of eBusiness payment systems here. This is sufficiently well known today.Of course, this idea also has a social and societal impact. Labour and services in general then belong to the person who provides them. He or she then sets the price with a counterpart. This is based on how valuable the corresponding service in return is deemed to be. In 2005, when the first ideas were developed, this was a novelty. In 1995, nobody would have believed that the Internet would become one of the biggest trading platforms and marketplaces of all time. From that point of view, sponge over it.What we unfortunately didn't develop or underestimated in 2008 was the fact that peer-to-peer would be corrupted. In this case, this means that not everyone who wants to participate in the Bitcoin network will also provide a terminal device. Only then does the peer-to-peer infrastructure make sense. The #BitCoin itself is merely the reward for a person making a computer available to the entire infrastructure. The idea of building data centres in order to then run a business based on electricity and fossil energy suppliers, which supposedly mines this coin worth its weight in gold out of nothing, makes this idea absurd.That is why we have decided to intervene! And to publish two still open fragments of the idea in a timely manner. Among other things, there will be a new consensus procedure \"Proof of Knowledge\" to give the one or other #SatoshiNakamoto fairy tale its rightful place.Larry and Gerry, boys, get warm!

It is not the #BitCoin network that is corrupt. The idea of the #Bitcoin network has been corrupted. So, repeat after me: The idea of the #BitCoin network has been corrupted by exploiting the idea by establishing it as a market platform for speculative financial transactions.Does that make sense to you?Proof of knowledge?Gödel, Shannon, Wittgenstein!Let's just say that it's not easy for a clever mind like yours to work out what that means in terms of computer science and was basically the \"next project\". It's really not difficult, you just have to be able to do the puzzle. Can you do that?",

Decentralised does not mean that an average of 15,000 full nodes in a maximum of 25 data centres are \"mining\" something. In terms of the idea of the #BitCoin network, decentralised means that 2 billion end devices distributed worldwide and installed as full nodes represent the entire #BitCoin network.Today, Blackrock and Vandguard are invested in the main data centres, which clearly means that the #BitCoin network has been taken over cold.
