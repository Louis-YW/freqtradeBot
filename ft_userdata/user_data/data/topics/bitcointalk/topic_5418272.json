      "body": "Good find, OP. The website is a mirror image of the official daedaluswallet.io site - which should be cause for suspicion. But, as the examplens above pointed out, the wallet file is definitely a scam because download link doesn't lead to the official download repository. It feels as though someone has taken the official code and repackaged it – even going so far as to use an identical site layout. As for the download link on the website – I don't advise clicking on it. It could be anything.",

I think there are reports of the post/posts that's why all the post has been deleted but could not understand why the account has not yet been banned.Quote from: examplens on October 25, 2022, 11:58:31 AMI will definitely tag him in red.edit: Flag createdI have also supported the flag as well as provided negative feedback though the account holder has no loss as the account is a newbie account.",
