It's likely a scam. Maybe one of those exchange or services that steal private keys or tokens from wallets once you connect your wallet and grant some permissions. Be very careful when connecting your wallets to such sites, or else everything in your wallet will be stolen.",

I think a legit DEX doesn't work like this but it will let you look around on their site first before you decide if you will try them or not so maybe you are right that this one here is likely a scam and only wants to empty our wallet.To make the attempt more successful, they use the term free Busd. Never heard, a legit exchange which gives free coins to be honest but they only offer some discounts or coupons for the new users but anyway, if we want to interact with a new decentralized sites, its always better to prepare another disposable wallet and don't use your main wallets, just to be safe.",

The day people will tame their greed and do extensive research before getting involved with such platforms is the day scam will reduce in the crypto industryQuote from: lixer on January 20, 2023, 06:55:11 AMits always better to prepare another disposable wallet and don't use your main wallets, just to be safe.This is very true",

When you go directly to the site, there is no automatic launch of Metamask or other wallets.However, now I see that your service has been in existence for several months. However, your site is still incomplete with some terrible design solutions and I would honestly say that there is a 99% probability that it is a scam.",
