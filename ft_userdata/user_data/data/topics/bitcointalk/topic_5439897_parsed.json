  "content": "Hi,First of all I apologize if this is not the right section for my post.Straight to the point - I run a small e-commerce store and I want to accept BTC payments. As far as I know I need a payment gateway for that.The more I read the more confused I get, so I was wondering if someone can recommend me a good gateway / other payment solutions to accept crypto payments on my site?So far these guys look good, as far as I understand the customer don`t have to leave my site to process the payment, which is nice...I guess:https://coinlabz.com/crypto-solutions-for-cross-border-payments/Thank you in advance!",

      "body": "Based on the article, they suggest to use 1x widget, this is the first time I heard Bitcoin payment processor offered by this site and based on the benefit, it seems this site is really bad because it's contradict one to another. How's the journalist can say the payment provider offer anonymity while they do ask for KYC verification? lol, it doesn't make sense.I'd suggest to use BTCPay server because it's the best solution for Bitcoin payment processor with a lot features, they already support lightning network too.Quote from: https://coinlabz.com/crypto-solutions-for-cross-border-payments/Benefits of the X1 widgetÂ  Â  The client can conduct the payment procedure without leaving the website. And KYC information can be taken automatically from the customerâ€™s account on the X1 exchange.Â  Â  The transactions wonâ€™t be denied due to local restrictions.Â  Â  The X1 crypto exchange offers fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat currencies exchange services, which makes cross-border payments faster and easier.Â  Â  The latter statement also means that people can take advantage of online gambling services without needing the issuing bank to confirm or deny their transactions.Â  Â  In the crypto world transaction fees are minimal.Â  Â  The anonymity aspect of the crypto market makes it preferred by those who seek privacy.Â  Â  The merchant can customise the trading pairs â€“ crypto to different fiat currencies as per their personal choiceÂ  Â  Crypto exchange procedures are completed in very short time periods, which means that both the customer and the merchant wonâ€™t have to wait a lot, in order to each get what they agreed on in the online deal.",

      "body": "Try BTCPay server as suggested above. They are open source, you can modify them depending on what you need, you can also use a plug-in for fiat conversion if that is required to run your business. It might take some time to set up, but you have complete control over how the process works. AFAIK most members also recommend them if you are open to setting up your own software. The only downside is probably the lack of altcoin support (you don't need them anyway if you want to accept BTC only). Don't rely on articles like that. Most of the time they just list whatever website offers payment processor software and list their marketed pros and cons with no in-depth review. I can even argue that the threads linked above contain more discussion/in-depth reviews of each platform compared to articles on a random blog.What makes you confused btw? We can probably help you answer some of your confusion if you post it here. Asking for more suggestions on which payment processor to choose is not going to help you if you are looking for a specific guide on how to integrate an API into another platform, for example.

It's great that you've found a potential solution that you're interested in. But, I'd recommend looking into a few others as well to make sure you're getting the best fit for your business.Some other gateways that you may want to consider include BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, and GoCoin. Each has its own unique features and benefits, so it's important to do your due diligence to see which one aligns best with your needs. I hope this helps.",
