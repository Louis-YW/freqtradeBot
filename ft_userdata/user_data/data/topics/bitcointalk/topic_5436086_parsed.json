It doesnt seem bright enough to me. And the amount you are playing with is also quite large (atleast for a major portion of the countries in the world). Be safe mate and atleast make sure you enjoy a bit or help your family with those winnings you made today. Dont bet all in with it again. Thats all I can say!",

One mistake can empty your account just like that in gambling.",

Do you always do this? Normally, chasing losses isn't recommended but it looks like it works for you.Such things are indeed often done by some gamblers with the aim of returning the lost capital.I myself also did the same when I was playing and suffered a loss.However, before continuing to play again, you must be completely calm first and pay attention to the course of the game to be able to analyze the correct positioning.In fact, it is true that chasing losses is not recommended because it can add to the feeling of emotion and curiosity which has a negative impact on gamblers experiencing more and more losses and losses. However, every gambler has a different way when they are experiencing defeat, not all of them are like that.",

First, you come with doubling the ETH story in the dice game, again come with BC game dice game is better than the stake. Now again come with another story.So what I want to say is that I think you should create a specific topic for it where you can create a new post for your every story, no need to create a new topic every day. And I also believe this topic should be on Gambling discussion section. Keep this board only for announcing new projects. Thank you.",

I've never experienced such a big bet because I'm not addicted to gambling, but of course, I want to win big money in the casino and I haven't experienced that yet.The biggest I've ever won was around 316$ playing casino slot games. But obviously, there is an addiction to gambling in reality.",
