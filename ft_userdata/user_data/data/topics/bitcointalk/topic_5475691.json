      "body": "Short answer; do the one that actually fits you and brings you profit. That is the safest option.Accepting bitcoin as a means of investment is definitely creating awareness to it and increases the adoption rate but it definitely has to been only when both parties (buyer and seller) are each benefiting. In the case of this high transaction costs it is not visible for small scale business. It is an alternative means For your question about investing to bitcoin it has been said before that one should invest what they can afford to lose do not just focus on having more bitcoin only and neglecting other things, hold some other currencies too Atleast for day to day activity and invest into bitcoin when you have the funds to spare.",

Your investment funds should be different from those you plan to use for charity works. Or except you plan to get some kind of reward from helping them I’ll suggest you look for other means  to generate money like I mentioned.  And as we normally say in my local language “Nor go put hand for Watin your power nor fit carry”",

So that it doesn't become a burden, just do it based on your abilities. If you can do both without financial constraints, continue holding it long term.If I misunderstood what you meant, please correct me.",

I’m a strong believer of hodling but also understand the importance of having a business with constant cashflow. With cashflow, you can buy more bitcoins from the profits you make from the business. You didn’t tell us the business you’re into, only that you accept bitcoin as payment. In this case, I don’t think it matters whether or not your business accepts bitcoin. The important thing is the product or service you’re selling and how profitable the business is.",

How do I find a balance between supporting this business that just started accepting Bitcoin and adhering to my investment strategy of long-term hodling?In the real world, very few people will stand up for others. So when you say you want to support businesses that accepts bitcoin as a payment method, what do you mean? Do you mean that you want to invest in those businesses? If yes, you can go ahead with 50% of your bitcoin reserve. But never ever spend 100% of your reserve. Helping others is a good thing, but you need to secure your position first. Never compromise on your own financial security.",

      "body": "IMHO, there's no need to get confused by having your long term holding plan focused as what it is and also by simply supporting a business that accepts Bitcoin. Think of what is important to you now? Holding can be done with other activities that's going to make you productive. What are you thinking then? having to slash some BTC holdings for you to support that business? If you don't have any other money from other sources that you have and you're thinking of helping that business through taking a part of your holdings to support it, don't take all of it. There's more to business and you shouldn't put full force of your assets or resource on it as you start. There's a period that you need to study on it during the operation before you fully expand or see if it's worth it to continue it.",

And see what you think the business income is if it is possible for you then support your business.Another way maybe if your portfolio is already large try to take some capital from what you keep the BTC, the rest you can accumulate again from the results of your business profits into the portfolio, but if you take everything that has been invested in BTC then just to support your business then I think it's very unfortunate especially soon BTC will halving will trigger a higher increase.This is a personal opinion but you can consider other things that you think are relevant and in line.",

If you think that the business, the people you'll get to meet and work with --the ethical satisfaction in general-- outweigh the capital appreciation over the long term, then you gotta sell.",

Holding is also part of the support, in my opinion, and accepting Bitcoin in your business is also part of the support. Supporting businesses that accept Bitcoin by patronising them is also another means of showing support. What matters is, that there is a transaction going on in the network; there's enough support for it. It is important to think carefully before making any decisions, whether personal or business-related. When it comes to your business, make sure that you are not blinded by your love for blockchain technology and are not taking unnecessary risks. Remember to stay focused on your goals and make sound decisions that will help you achieve success. If you run out of business and there is no longer a stable cashflow, your holding life won't be strong again, as a strong holder is backed up by a stable inflow of income, which will be enough to foot bills, and the need for the holding to be spent won't be there.",

How do I find a balance between supporting this business that just started accepting Bitcoin and adhering to my investment strategy of long-term hodling?I don't know how you intend to support the business but there will always be opportunities to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem. If the business will not collapse because of your failure to invest or patronise them, I suggest that you keep holding and support the business after you have sold your coin and made some profit. Like others have said there are also diverse means of supporting the business than liquidating your investment. Introduce the business bitcoiners and you can also convert your spare cash to bitcoin and patronise them. You could offer other services like training staff on how to process bitcoin payments and you can even expose them to the Lightning Network and how to protect wallets. I don't think anything should prevent you from following your investment plans except for emergencies. But if you think assisting the business will give you much joy and satisfaction you can go on and sell your coins to support them, after all, everything is not money. But I must also compliment you for considering contributing to the Bitcoinspace above maximizing profit.     Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 27, 2023, 06:40:12 PMI must say I understand your plight and want to iterate that the business should try to survive on it own for at least five years before considering expansion that might require you to invest more Capital into it.

You will never find balance in your heart if your plan for bitcoin remains to hodl 100%, you have to find and create some allocation for it in percentage in your plan, not just 100% for Hodling, and then 0% for use as currency.",

If you are okay with budgeting 10% to 20% of your investment to build your business, then do it. But personally, I have a reserve budget that I should be able to use to build my business without ruining my investment plans. This is why you need to have a reserve budget regardless of your investment in bitcoin, obviously this will help you stick to your main plan.",
