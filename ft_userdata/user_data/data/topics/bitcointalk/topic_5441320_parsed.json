Two topics fit dey related but with different write up from the OP point of view. We are just two page into this board and about one month of board creation. If we no get anything to show of the activeness of the board e go make theymos disregard any requests for a new board for other locality and might even regret granting this one. I understand say the issue of duplicate topic go become an issue since everybody go wan create threads and things happening over here are the same so they'll be similar but later understand say e go hinder the growth of the board if we put everything into threads and some people no sabi create a reasonable thread self. If you see duplicate topic wey look like 70% alike DM the OP to lock the thread and write in the other topics or report the topics to moderator and when doing so highlight the original topic wey e dey duplicate so that way dem review, them go get better judgement. I dun report like 5 topics and they have been removed from this board, even though they ignore others no mind, still report when you see new defaulter posts.  so na di expansion we dey so, Me I don see di future of di board before I created that thread to cube di scenario. Nd I was ready work fused political  discussions to di thread but since boss has said it, I have to lock di thread for everyone to air their views on different threads. And d result is getting better every day, at least we have entered page 5 now. So OP, what you are saying is Atiku and Obi, Tinubu has already won the election, so follow di Government to develop di board and allow di kwantri (board) to expand. If u can't beat dem u join dem. Igebotz, Charles-Tim and Agbe e don tok tire but no avail so dem don leave. Dis board spamming 4 no dey like dis if caution was given from beginning.",

If all those low quality posts been started where on that thread, it would had still been a spam thread because they're all spam and if the thread was reported to be locked for spamming, it'll be locked or discourage users from engaging on the thread. The topic causing a nuisance is election matter and not politics entirely because there are so many quality politics related threads that have been started by different high ranked members dat doesn't fit to be in one thread. Before your thread I raised the attention since with this; Should Sub-Threads be created or we should freestyle the whole thing? Election matters could have been easily handled by putting everything in one thread but not politics entirely. Politics is a broader discussion and that's why it has its own board on the forum. In future we'll get a politic sub board. The issue here is low quality posts and repeated topics which I'm surprised same members complaining are still responding to those topics.If a repeated topic is created and we join hands to report it, it'll be locked or send the OP DM to locked since they're similar. Putting all election matters into one thread is OK but putting all politic matters into one thread isn't, it'll obstruct the flow of conversation and many of you won't even visit that thread just as we were complaining with the hangout thread..",
