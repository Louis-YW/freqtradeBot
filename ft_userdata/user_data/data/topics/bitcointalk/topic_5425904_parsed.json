  "content": "Hello everyone,After a lot of coffee spent on developing and finally launching an Ethereum bridge last week, I'm happy to do my own announcement post here now.Andy already did an announcement for the bridge in the Altcoin channel: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5425902.new#newWhile working on the project, I was interested in implementing a bridge for Bitcoin to Ethereum with wrapped BTC from the wbtc network. I developed a deadbeat simple swap between the two native base currencies BTC and ETH. Before going deeper into the WBTC bridge itself, I wanted to get some early feedback first.Features:- No KYC- Fair rates and fees IMO- Change of slippage to your likingBTC to ETH: https://swapbridge.io/btc-eth-bridge/ETH to BTC: https://swapbridge.io/btc-eth-bridge/I did a comparison to Changelly, in which they gave me a quote of 1.3398 ETH for 0.1 BTC. SwapBridge offers 1.3416 ETH. The rate is directly taken from Uniswap's ETH/WBTC pool with 0.25% and transaction fees deducted to cover costs.Currently, I'm writing some blog articles, like the one I did on different Bitcoin address types while getting deeper into the bridging topic.BTC address types: https://swapbridge.io/blog/different-bitcoin-addresses/I'm hoping to build out the project, for it to become a one-stop platform to easily swap and bridge all common tokens and native coins between different blockchains.Feel free to ask me any questions you might have.Your feedback is greatly appreciated!Best, RobSwapBridge, made with â™¥ in Stuttgart and Barcelona",

I am happy to read it because this is the major drawback of most swap bridge exchange sites because they provided wBTC which is just a token, not real Bitcoin.In the meantime, you need to buy a copper membership, do a marketable ANN thread, and if you thinking about doing an advertisement campaign on this forum to be ahead of competitors just like Crypton Exchange, Best Change, etc. You can contact me for both the advertisement and ANN and I will be glad to help.",
