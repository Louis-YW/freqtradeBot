I kinda like this Goldshell mini - doge asic, any users on here? If there are better ones can you drop names? Thank you I think an ASIC with low power consumption can be a good option for home mining but keep in mind that even with a GPU rig you can mine several coins that are not normally mineable with GPU-s but you can use the unmineable website in order to point your GPU hash rate to their pool or use their easy miner and get paid in every currency that they support mining and they support all the most popular ones.There is no real one which is better than the other,for some users they may prefer ASIC-s and some others GPU rigs.I personally love GPU rigs because of their flexibility,but maybe other people may love ASIC-s it is all personal choices in the end that makes us decide which route to go.",

      "body": "There are pros and cons for both.ASICs unless they are outdated or used are usually very expensive. So the entry price is much much higher. Another reason is that they are extremely loud. Basically as loud as a vacuum and you need a special area for them. You cannot sleep next to one. Another issue is that many of them require 240V which most don’t have set up. GPUs are just easier, cheaper to get introduced into crypto. They however are more technically involved. ASICs are just plug and play pretty much. You don’t need to worry about it crashing as much.",

I made a post here a few days ago for a user using 2 rigs in a room, and I wrote about having my rings in my room in the past, it's bad to sleep, you can hold some days, but midterm is hell. Noise, heat, dust, light...and asics is something else, the noise of the fans is annoyingAnother thing to consider, it draws more energy, maybe a room will not be prepared to power your rig + asic",

Otherwise, in the event of a breakdown, you will have losses.That mini is really costly.he is far better off with old used bitmain L3+ gear.just down clock them to a good level for sound and power use they are close to the same efficiently and the L3+ is about 30% of the price.Also L3+ are fairly reliable due to the lower power draw they do. 800 watts for 500 mh is the normal setting but on down clock you can do 350 watts and 250 mh and they would not be very loud at those settings.",
