So I think that the best way to go about this is to say,  invest an amount that you can put aside for a long time because you don't lose money while holding Bitcoin but you may lose time because there is no specific amount of waiting time when it comes to bitcoin investment,  you have to be ready to go in for long term base and not short term speculations.",

I don't know any decentralized exchange that it is possible to buy with Naira. Even if there is, I feel it is a long process because of the challenge of accessing dollar in Nigeria.  There are also notable people even in this forum that one can buy from at good rates, however, it is always best we consider options that are fine for us.",

In long term, bitcoin is a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Quote from: Gideon66 on November 02, 2023, 06:18:38 PMThat's why it's more advice able to invest the amount you are comfortable losing.as Bitcoin price go up and down this season by hundred of dollars.My advise is to invest at the appropriate time. Like this time. Also to invest an amount that will not affect you. Assuming you are earning ₦200,000 weekly, you can invest ₦10000 to ₦20000 using NCA. Bitcoin holding is not gambling that you can use the amount that you can afford to lose to do, bitcoin is an investment.Quote from: adultcrypto on November 02, 2023, 06:43:08 PMBitcoin ETF have not been approved so that option is not available yet. There is expectations that it will be approved by January and only then will that option be available.Remember this is Nigeria, not United States. Although, there is also nothing called bitcoin spot ETF in Nigeria for now. There is bitcoin future ETF, but which can not be referred to as an investment, unlike bitcoin spot ETF. Bitcoin future ETF is approved in United States. Bitcoin spot ETF has not been approved by United States SEC, but it has been approved in countries like Canada and Europe. What makes United States bitcoin spot ETF very important to people, especially bitcoin enthusiasts is because United States stock market is dominating by over 60% in the world.",

But if you invest in Bitcoin and hold it until the bull market, you will make a profit. But if you invest in altcoins alone, be aware that it's not all of those altcoins that will pump like you speculate; some of thos projectan you invested on can even fail. \"Invest what you can afford to loss, \" Could also be used on traders.",

It is advisable that one should not keep their assets with third parties ie decentralized exchange as they are not safe and cannot guarantee asset safety. Not only that, if you keep your asset with them, automatically they own your asset not you because they have the keys to the wallet holding your asset and not you so if anything should happen to the exchange, your asset is gone too. It would be in a better position that you buy and  transfer to your own wallet in which you hold possession of the private key.Quote from: Mate2237 on November 02, 2023, 06:46:29 PMAnd add it to what op has said.

Investing in bitcoin is not about one risking their funds as we all know investment itself is one taking a risk to making profit either on a short term or a long term so therefore, it depends on the nature of the investment one is willing to take either ways and it all calls for patience if one must invest because a tree doesn't grow in one day but with time for maturity and growth.",

Beginners just enter the market and predict thinking that they will be able to make the amount of money as they have wished. I think understanding Bitcoin better will make people to take a better decision before entering the market,  knowing that the Bitcoin price is unpredicted which beginners needs to be patience to hodl to achieve their target.

An uncertainty can emerge out of the blue which can vaporize your investment to zero. The only dissimilarity in all is that every investment has its own level of risk and which for bitcoin the risk isn't that high but that doesn't mean it's doesn't possess a risk.",

I believe that viewpoint is outdated, especially considering Bitcoin's track record as a less risky investment in recent years. Many individuals can attest from their experiences that Bitcoin, among all cryptocurrencies, holds significant profit potential, making it a prime option for investment. You can steadily acquire Bitcoin through various methods, including Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), a strategy recommended by many community members. The key is to select the approach that suits you best, depending on how much you can sustain. The overall goal is to hold onto Bitcoin for an extended period and possibly learn how to secure your funds.",

You can buy Bitcoin on a number of different exchanges, and you'll need to choose one that's reputable and secure.Once you've found a reputable exchange, you'll need to set up an account and fund it with your chosen currency. Once your account is funded, you can place an order to buy Bitcoin. You'll need to decide how much you want to invest and how you want to store your Bitcoin. Some exchanges offer built-in wallets, while others require you to set up a separate wallet. It's important to choose a secure wallet, as there have been instances of exchanges being hacked and funds being stolen.You'll also need to decide how long you want to hold onto your Bitcoin.",
