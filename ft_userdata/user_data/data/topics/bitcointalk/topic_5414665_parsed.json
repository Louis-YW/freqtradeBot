The turbulent events of recent times inevitably carry the galley to the rocks, threatening to smash it into chips, and hung on the mast, instead of the flag blown away by the wind, foul-smelling, although washed twice, cowards, completely drive away all potential rescuers. The passengers of the galley, who have relied too much on the slave Pynya, now have neither time nor chance to avoid disaster. But from time immemorial it has been known that in no case can a slave be trusted, and even more so in such a matter as management. And everyone followed this truth, from the emperor to the smallest boss, but the Russian people, due to their pathological unwillingness to engage in active organizational activity, and possibly their ability to do so (1), handed their fate and well-being into the hands of a slave, and now nothing save the galley and its passengers.  1. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/28564.html    27.12.2020",
