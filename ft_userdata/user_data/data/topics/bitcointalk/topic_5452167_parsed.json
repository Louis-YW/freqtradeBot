I'm not really a technical guy, but if I were to calculate based on a common man's understanding,If the average block confirmation is being reduced, let's say, for instance, from 4000transaction per block every 10 minutes to 4000 per block every 5 minutes. This will speed up the clearing of more transactions in less time and, as such, pave the way for other transactions to be executed if the transaction completion time is faster and more blocks are being covered than usual. Then there will be a less unconfirmed transaction, which will equally reduce the work load on miners and, as such, won't require others to pay more in order for their transaction to be upfront. Yes, it will actually reduce the fee charged per transaction.",

      "body": "Lowering the average Bitcoin block confirmation time could have several potential effects, both positive and negative:Faster Transactions: The most obvious benefit of a lower confirmation time is that transactions would be confirmed more quickly. This would allow users to send and receive Bitcoin more efficiently, which could improve overall transaction throughput and user experience.Higher Transaction Fees: A lower confirmation time could lead to an increase in transaction fees, as users may be willing to pay more to have their transactions confirmed more quickly. This could make Bitcoin transactions more expensive, especially during times of high network activity.Increased Risk of Double Spending: A shorter confirmation time could increase the risk of double spending, where a user spends the same Bitcoin twice. This is because a shorter confirmation time gives attackers less time to launch a double spending attack before the transaction is confirmed.Increased Network Congestion: A shorter confirmation time could also lead to increased network congestion, as more transactions would need to be processed in a shorter period of time. This could lead to longer wait times for users, higher transaction fees, and a higher risk of transaction failures.Overall, lowering the average Bitcoin block confirmation time could improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions, but it could also lead to higher transaction fees, increased network congestion, and a higher risk of double spending. Any changes to the Bitcoin protocol should be carefully considered and thoroughly tested to ensure that they do not have any unintended consequences.",

I believe that in order to change the average block time, the way difficulty and bitcoin rewards work would also need to be adjusted...and probably would cascade into effects throughout all features of Bitcoin which would then either require adjustment or would raise the question as to if Bitcoin is still economically viable or not. Whether or not this is possible is one thing, though I would be almost certain that it would not pass consensus, as this kind of change would not just effect the speed of transaction times, though would extend all the way from the codebase to the economics of Bitcoin and its viability to operate in the future. While some solutions seem simple in writing, generally they turn out not to be in practice.",

This process is done when the miners increase the hash rate (which is expensive and somewhat not profitable to the miners) and the interval between mining blocks are reduced, but once the 2016 blocks are all mined then the difficulty will adjust. The difficulty adjust in such a way that when the time to confirm a block is less than 10minutes, it will increase just to set the block average time to 10 minute again. For the miner to get transactions confirmed faster again then it has to increase the hash rate yet again",

If you lowering the block confirmation time, attacker will need to spend less minutes to control 51% of network hash rate for attack.Like now, with average block time is 10 minutes, most of exchanges and platforms require 1 confirmation for your deposit to credit it to your account; and some require 2 or 3 confirmations. If block time is like 5 minutes or 1 minutes, they will require 15 or 30 confirmations to accept your deposit.Compare Bitcoin confirmations (6) with altcoin confirmations to have similar security.https://howmanyconfs.com/How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?Quote from: How many bitcoin confirmations is enoughIf you are patient enough to wait for at least one confirmation then you are no longer vulnerable to race attacks or Finney attacks. Now your only concern is 51% attacks. What's the rule of thumb for an acceptable number of confirmations?1 confirmation: sufficient for small payments less than $1,000.3 confirmations: for payments $1,000 - $10,000. Most exchanges require 3 confirmations for deposits.6 confirmations: good for large payments between $10,000 - $1,000,000. Six is standard for most transactions to be considered secure.10 confirmations: suggested for large payments greater than $1,000,000.",

(not sure how long that lasts before core devs soften that rule too.)however on LN.. which you must treat as a separate network.. when creating channels where a SUPPOSED uxto is used to then create a child transaction that is then called a commitment. the rules on the LN side are WEAK AS F**K and not really rules at all. and yes the LN devs blame user error for accepting a channel open session with zero confirm txid as the funding. and close session with bad unlocks as user error, even though its devs fault for making such a crappy project with such lack of rules, lack of auditing, lack of controls. lack of checksthe reason i bring it up is becasue you seem to care less that bitcoin devs already did mess with bitcoin transactions. but dont want them to mess with things that can affect a broke OTHER network.. which i found amusing and strange, ..and after soo many months/years of chances you have yet to learn how broke LN is to realise its not worth caring about as something that does not securely secure/hold value. but just presumes tojust skip a few months/years and come to the realisation that LN is broke and a completely new subnetwork bridge needs to be created from scratch to service bitcoiners. rather then waste months trying to hope bitcoin does things to entertain and recruit lightning lemmingsLN has many many issues which is why more people have decided to avoid LN and use other subnetwork bridges to lock their bitcoin value to. anyway. back to the topic. what bitcoin devs need to do is stop with the radicalisation of sponsorship deals to just make bitcoin messy to promote corporate patented subnetworks as the saviour. and actually get back to making bitcoin efficient. where every byte of a tx counts and has purpose where actual checks are done. as was the case years agoidea's such has messing just with difficulty lasts 2 weeks. idea's like messing with block per adjustment and thus reward amounts per block to compensate to try to force it to last..  overall messes with too many other things including the scarcity and value proposition. thus not the fixthe real fix is to get code to actually check tx data like it suppose to do. as that was the integrity promise of blockchains. to have data which all fullnodes fully verify and meet standards",
