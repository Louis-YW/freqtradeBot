      "body": "Yes i think this is what most people are expecting to happen. $30K was strong support and it will most likely be strong resistance.Depending how Bitcoin acts when we reach the area could determine whether we will bottom out at $17K or head lower. $29K would be a perfect short since most want to short at $30K.",

      "body": "We will soon hit the strongest resistance and that’s the time to tell the future trend, I always look at a longer time frame and with that TA for long term, I’m very optimistic that we can hit that before the year end. Short term TA looks more volatile though we are not about the resistance level and trying to break another one, its good for the day trader. Corrections might still happen, this can be a perfect timing to buy again, so watch out for the corrections once we failed to break resistance.",

      "body": "I have been following this reference as my crystal ball on predicting Bitcoin and one of my references in guessing the price for how many years which I think OP technical analysis is most likely relevant.It shows not only $30k but it's $31k at the start of the 4th quarter of this year. But it seems not good, after that resistance, it will bounce back again which I think will happen as we noticed that after the Bitcoin price is pumped it will have a correction.",
