  "content": "In this game, unlike the previous one, you only have to guess which two cards your opponent had. You can try if you don't know anything about poker, just say two cards, you don't need to say the suit. Those of you who know more, apart from saying the cards, I would appreciate a brief comment or analysis and especially about how well Hero played it. The hand that the opponent had I have written it in an encrypted message.-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE----------BEGIN SIGNATURE-----bc1q2z248q6kaasd549pjunjd6740hlf50wkvcu9s0H4HG3oVK1kVAVH2+ruHI7/zsQN8h7V/0VqxtolDs205LMVItczEjcOYDjPeFNZ1jE52n7ZEqcBRoYS+FpbmZ0cU=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----The hand:Rules: to participate you must be at least a junior member and don't have net negative trust.Also, if two people say the same hand (two cards) the prize will go to the one who guess it right first.",

      "body": "I like to give it a try.When Villian calls your 4-bet I would narrow down his range to a strong Ace, Broadways, suited connectors, high pair.I think he would 5-bet (or jam) his AK,AQ preflop vs your btn 4-bet.AA,KK,QQ,JJ all possible combos he can have after his call as non of them necessarily have to 5-bet vs your presumably weak btn range.Would assume he folds out a big part of his weak 3-bet bluff range after facing your 4-bet (even though he get a good price when you make it 13bb instead of closer to 20bb).On a very coordinated flop he decide to go for a 130bb (110bb effective) check raise All In which screams a naked Ace of diamonds a ton of the time.AA and KK without a diamond is possible. QQ/JJ/TT (with or without) a diamond is also a possible, but I would expect all of these top pairs to want to see a turn instead of sticking it in on the flop. Hard to see any value combos he is going to over-bet so big with. JT without a diamond is one of the few.77-88-99-TT is possible, then we are back at how would he play those preflop? And would he really check a set on this board instead of leading out for protection?I think Ace of diamonds is by far the hand we see most often after the huge shove on flop. He shouldn't have many offsuit Ace-rag combos after calling the 4-bet preflop so I go for AJ.",

      "body": "Nice to see another poker analysis from our @PokerPlayer here on the forum. First of all it's another 6-max game which are pretty common these days, it's also the regular tables I like to play. All of the players have pretty healthy stacks and BB is our chip leader at the table. We should always keep that in mind when raising or trying to steal the blinds of him, because the pots can become very large quickly and he might be more inclined to call our bets. Pre-Flop: Our hero gets 85s dealt, which is a decent hand to be played on a 6-max table. You have chances to hit a straight, flush or even two pairs and it also makes it harder for your opponents to put you on a hand. There is no action before him so in the button spot he has to make a raise here. The 2.4x bet is pretty standard and I would do the exact same here to put pressure on the SB and BB and maybe even steal their blinds here. BB now makes a reraise to 10 BB already signalling to us he has a strong hand. In most cases defending my big blind I would rather call than to reraise large. Now comes the second reraise from our Hero to 23 BB, which is insane in my opinion. We know that the BB has already something and for him it's only  13 BB to see the flop. I don't like the reraise because it makes the pot even bigger and we didn't even see the Flop yet. If we really want to see the flop and represent a monster hand we need to raise bigger or even go allin. Same goes for the BB, he only calls the reraise and doesn't push us allin. In case he had AA or KK he would have likely reraised us allin preflop. In my opinion our hand is too weak for the reraise and we should rather have called to see the Flop and hope to improve there, right now it seems that our Hero is behind.Flop: Now comes the flop which gives us middle pair. It's not a great flop and also not a very bad one, we should keep playing here. The chances of the BB to have flopped a straight or at least a draw are there and we need to take them into account. Same goes for expecting some kind of poker pair from him raising&calling preflop. The BB checks the action back to us which is pretty normal again, since we where the last raiser preflop. Now the Hero bet 19 BB which is not a good idea in my opinion. Our hand is not that strong to go to showdown, for that the bet is not big enough to get the BB out of the hand. The BB has only to pay 19BB into a 65.4 BB pot to see the Turn. The potodds for the BB are too good to pass on this hand, any single diamond card would likely make the call here. I would have rather checked back here. Also the raise from our Hero makes the pot even larger and gives the BB another chance to act. At this point the BB pushes us allin which seems a bit of trap to me. Now we know he really has a strong hand and we got into a very bad spot for all our chips quickly. This is nolimit poker at it's finest, with any hand you can find yourself be playing for all your chips. We don't have any additional information on the two players, so we don't know if they play more tight or lose in general. Reacting quickly and making a decision in this spot is hard, but given that we only have middle pair with a gutshot straight draw I don't think I would have called here. My pick for the BB hand: Pocket Queens It feels like the BB had a pretty strong hand to begin with any let our Hero happily bet into him.Good Luck to all",

For me it's fold or push with those hands.I will give two more hints.The first can be understood by everyone: the ones that have come closest to it so far are malcovi2 and dittoup.The second for those who understand a bit of poker: the opponent's hand is in the lower part of the range.All of you who have written can try it a second time.",
