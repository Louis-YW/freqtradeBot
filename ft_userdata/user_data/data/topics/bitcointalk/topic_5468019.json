I think you have to make the correction that Bitcoin always see a new ATH the year after halving. If you Check your data correctly,  you will notice that Bitcoin made new highs in 2013, 2017 and 2021, the next years after the first, second and third halving respectively. Going by that record, selling next year will be a poor decision to make because there are chances that 2025 will see BTC at an ATH. This is my suggestion based on historic data, it can change anyways.

I stand to be corrected.Rather than cause devaluation, the halving will reduce miners reward and this will reduce the quantity of Bitcoin in the hands of those that are willing to sell at any time for a profit. This reduction in supply will invariably lead to imbalance that will push demand up. So halving will surely lead to a rise in price and  not devaluation.",

But know one thing that as halving keeps going in every 4 years the more the circulations of bitcoin keeps reducing and this could possibly leads to scarcity of bitcoin whereby making price exponentially double above what we thought, but still only those who HODL could enjoy the benefits so is either you choose for profits maximization or hold for decades.Though don't quote me wrongly because people are using it trade and that is of their benefits which I am not against of their decision and choice of action. I think everyone with their ways and views of how they sees bitcoin so, they are actually taking it that way.. Let say some people use for investment purposes, some uses it as a store of value, some uses it for day to day scalping which is also trading, while some tends to hold for decades which I can say those are the whales maybe yes maybe not but they often buy's in very larger quantity when the market seems to be extremely dip and beyond our expectation.",

With that record, l think bitcoin will continue to increase in price and value as halving continues.

It’s not really about price increased but rather decreasing the reward of miners into half. It creates disinflationary pressure to Bitcoin value since less Bitcoin can be mined and added to the circulating supply. Halving is literally the solution to avoid inflation on Bitcoin market.I believe the problem is how you view halving as some sort of price pump to coin every 4 years which is not the real essence of halving/halfing.",

If you notice that the price throughout this period was stable between $20,000 to $30,000 and in the past between $3,000 to $6,000. Thus, halving does not only lead to an increase in prices, but to the stability of prices in a new range that is often higher than ATH for the previous session, so instead of starting to speculate that the price will exceed $100,000, let us be realistic and say that in the coming years the average price of Bitcoin will be higher than $70,000 to $90,000.There are also connections to price and mining. If the price drops below the cost of mining, the number of miners will decrease, and thus it is an opportunity for more to buy and vice versa.This topic has been discussed a lot, and using the search feature[1] you will find thousands of similar topics.[1] [Guide] Searching effectively",

What will happen is a raised valuation of the coin, and the currency that will be most affected is the USD which will also not fall in value as people might seem but will have an adjustment against Bitcoin due to the appreciated value. This is not a currency devaluation but an asset increasing in its own value.QuoteWill the effect of these not be inflation of bitcoin in every four years?

So play only with what you aren't afraid to lose. And who says the next year will be profitable? You did do some research on finding when the halving took place but you did not check how much time it took BTC to reach ATH after every halving. For your easiness, every ATH took almost 1.2 years after halving, and if we take this factor in mind, then we can also say, that the halving will take place in 2024 and the ATH might occur in 2025. But who knows, because the market is so unexpected. All we can do is take measures to book as much profit as we can and should accumulate as much BTC as we can do but don't forget to manage some emergency funds for you.

And why do you think that BTC will gradually lose its value due to halving, because due to halving their will be more demand over supply and the value will increase. And BTC is a deflationary token --> A hedge against inflation. Then how BTC can become inflationary in itself? Please elaborate more.",

I stand to be corrected.As far as I can see you don't understand the basic principle of supply and demand. Bitcoin demand has been growing since its inception, with some ups and downs, but over the long term it has clearly grown. If demand remains constant or increases, which is what will continue to happen for the next few years, and supply decreases, the price increases. Halving reduces supply. Therefore, Bitcoiners expect the price to continue to rise, albeit with volatility because this is not a straight line. So far Bitcoin returns have far outpaced inflation because it has proven to be the best financial asset in the world since 2009. And so we expect it to continue to be. I don't know if something else will be created in 10 years that will be better than Bitcoin but as of today it is unrivaled.",
