Hence why coins like ADA are rallying as a result.This is a huge win but it’s crazy how long this lawsuit took. Millions of dollars wasted on legal fees but we finally won. This is incredible bullish news. Coinbase is already announcing they are resisting XRP for trading.",

I'm doubtful it does a huge impact but as we can see, their issue with the SEC has been for many years and we've passed the 2021 bull season already. Meaning, it was not the XRP that could lift up the current market situation or the SEC but it was the trust of investors and new adapters. We seek bigger demand in order to fill the declining gap and I know people are not only investing in XRP but mostly in Bitcoin. Whatever will happen to XRP it doesn't really matter as the market will become bullish without this project - IMO.",

XRP is not like other cryptocurrencies. They do not promise that their currency will have more value in the future. On the contrary, I find them closer to the concept of the Chinese yuan, as increasing the value of the yuan is harmful to them because in the end they want very fast transactions with low fees. If the value of XRP increases, this means an increase in the value of the fees.We will reach a stage where the price of XRP will be stable with a large number of transactions, then we can say that this currency is successful, which is a different scenario from Bitcoin, as limited supply and higher demand will make the value of Bitcoin stable somewhere between $500,000 to $2 million.If you are betting that you will be rich by investing in XRP alone and waiting for its value to rise, then you are probably missing out on the alternative investment opportunity. XRP is suitable for short-term trading as you can benefit from fluctuations in the medium and short term.EDIT:I thought you were talking about XRP.When the lawsuit against XRP occurred for the first time, the market was not affected, even if XRP price fell by 30%, so why would the market be affected when the opposite happens?The XRP case will open the door to many lawsuits filed by the regulator against crypto companies such as Binance and Coinbase according to which many staking currencies were affected as securities, so its impact will be limited to pairs such as Polygon's MATIC and ALGO, and these currencies will not cause a change in the price of Bitcoin. No matter how expensive it is, it will not affect crypto market (because Bitcoin is what drive the market) or speed up events.",

I guess everyone has it's own opinion here, although for some bitcoin enthusiast, it should happen. I mean the effect should be BTC to altcoin market and not the other way around. I can't remember though in the past, or at least since 2017 (when I join the market) that we have this kind of effect. But in any case, it's good to hear Ripple winning here, and look at the change of the price of XRP in the last 48 hours. And maybe we can compare it to BTC when let's say a Spot Bitcoin ETF is to approved, maybe a jump of proportions will also be felt not just BTC itself by the whole crypto.",
