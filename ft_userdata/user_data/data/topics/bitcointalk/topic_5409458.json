Without it, the adoption would never be able to realise its full potential.The crypto payment industry is continually growing. Nonetheless, recognition is not at the top of the list. As is customary, there are Bitcoin maximalists who refuse to spend their cryptocurrency on things.Some people, however, are taking advantage of the cashback chances offered by cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency cards. I realise that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are only a small portion of the public, but why are those who are currently interested not using bitcoin for payment?So, do you use cryptocurrency or crypto cards? What are your thoughts on it if you use it? If not, what's the deal?",

Crypto is the best payment gateway and would have solved the money transfer issues that many are facing, with a lesser fee.  Although the decentralization has a lot of advantages but gives lower room for regulations, which is the fear of many people and the world government.",

While I'm holding for long term, I allocate some for spending for the things that I want to have and need.Whilst we're using it for purchases and holding, people that don't have an idea on it will never use it and also those people who have doubts about bitcoin, they won't just come out and use it if they're hearing negative hearsays about it.",

      "body": "I used Bitcoin (and in one or two cases, Litecoin) in a few cases (less than 20 overall) to buy cheap IT services like hosting and domains, and in one case I also bought food from a local merchant.From my perspective, in the countries I lived, Bitcoin can be used (if you really want) for a lot of expenses, but not always for everything. I think the main problem is that you develop buying habits, like going to a certain local grocery or so, and you don't live in a \"crypto hub\" like the central areas of some US and European cities, then you will have - very likely - to modify these habits if you want to pay with Bitcoin. You'll have to drive to a supermarket at the other end of the town, or have to choose from a handful of relatively expensive shops which do not really offer the products you want, etc..The argument that your waste your \"precious coins\", instead, isn't that valid for me - once you're KYCed on an exchange you can always re-buy what you spent. If at least one of my preferred groceries/shops would accept Bitcoin, then I would certainly do that. Fees are currently also not a problem (at least if you buy more than a coffee, and Bitcoin isn't really for coffee ...) , and much less if your are willing to create a Lightning node.",

With the constant prospect of getting rich on the back of crypto, laser-eyed goblins talking about 100k or lows and highs, people still, for the most part, view crypto as a long-term investment than a payment method. It's always in the back of our heads, the notion that if you buy something for 100$ worth of BTC, in a year that could have been 500$ and then you basically fucked yourself over 400$.

People see its potential in the other way as an investment that seems to be more fit rather than a currency. I actually have no claim why and asking it because I know the reason already and that is the volatility of its price. Not all are able to lose a few cents but fortunately, many people can afford to take risks through investment where they can earn more. Adoption can be improved, it will just take time, not an instant.",
