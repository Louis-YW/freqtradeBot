  "content": "BitcoinX [BTCX]BitcoinX is a cryptocurrency that was created as a result of the inspiration between Bitcoin and Litecoin. Users can run a node in the bitcoinX blockchain network using the BitcoinX Core software. For the Proof-Of-Work ecosystem, BitcoinX employs the Scrypt algorithm. Bitcoinx is based on the Bitcoin Core and Litecoin Core cryptocurrencies.Miners are awarded 50 Bitcoinxs per block, the halving period is every 4 years (every 420.000 blocks). The total amount of available coins that can be generated by miners is 42 million bitcoinxs which is less than 50% of the total supply of Litecoin.This project aims to create a coin with value, for example, if you compare bitcoin with Litecoin you would notice that bitcoin is slower than Litecoin however in terms of the total supply of Litecoin you would find that they have a large amount of 84 million coins which is a big number, bitcoinx can provide only 42 million coins, a double of bitcoin total supply but faster than bitcoin and Litecoin combined. A block is generated a minute and a half (1.5 minutes) with a difficult retarget change every 5 minutes. A transaction is confirmed after 6 confirmations.If you compare bitcoinx with Dogecoin you would notice the total supply of Dogecoin is Unlimited which is absurd, this is equal to printing money forever nonstop.I would consider Bitcoinx comes between Bitcoin and Litecoin. Currently, there are only 52 mined blocks, the difficulty is very low and I invite you to start mining.Main web site: https://bitcoinx.spaceWindows Wallet: https://bitcoinx.space/windows.htmlLinux Wallet: https://bitcoinx.space/linux.htmlmacOS Wallet: https://bitcoinx.space/macOS.htmlWhitepaper: https://bitcoinx.space/download/whitepaper.pdfBlockchain Explorer: http://blockchain.bitcoinx.spacePool 1: https://coolminerz.hopto.org/Pool 2: https://luckydogpool.com/Pool 3: https://www.murkapool.it/Pool 4: https://solopools.netPool 5: http://mining-coins.comSource code: https://gitlab.com/bitcoinx/bitcoinxTelegram: https://t.me/+f_UBo-gf1xM0NTk5  OR https://t.me/bitcoinxGroupContact: info@bitcoinx.spaceFor security and integrityLinux Walletbitcoinx-qt    SHA256    26221E565C3B7CC0F4A64EF07904D5D7F7D5007F0ACD0251513007842E75BF64MD5         F5D218ADAAA216FCF03EF87D760A4B4Fbitcoinx-cli    SHA256    F7A1AD66453531AF9D9CB69977AD77BE57B7883CC5335F86D9C6D34A50FD5C73MD5         F6E07796D0E1F56B30BB98AEAA880540bitcoinx-tx   SHA256   CA4CD5DFB5B576B4ABE88E43359D2DCCC049BE7BF1764AEDEEF7D14A516D470DMD5        8267E86DDAF0952432D45B15E7438FBCbitcoinxd   SHA256   472C44B403A859971C3CBBF9531BB64862BA870F5AE6DC178F67D3DD15049879MD5        1A1BD8C4D31BFEDDB1F77803B35B10C6Windows Walletbitcoinx-0.18.1-win64-setup.exe   SHA256     8E39F34B8C62E56661A73101B6CC8B922722D3C8452C2013CB2FC37503074AF0MD5          16BA8A2DCB206A1F0BBD446CD441696CmacOS WalletBitcoinx-Core.dmg   SHA256    F1B2178033094227BDF1DCE44D869FEEF18DDBC495342C724E7BA336A856F29EMD5         4840E1820EE17E22CA836B8D6CA2366A",
