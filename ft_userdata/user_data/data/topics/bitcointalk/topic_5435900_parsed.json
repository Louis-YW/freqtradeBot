From what I know that old versions of Electrum are not handled by the servers.I am not familiar with how Electrum 1.7 was, but, based on the UI of current Electrum maybe you can try some things:* one direction could be to check if you have the seed symbol on bottom-right, or in menus (wallet->seed maybe?) and try to recover the seed, which then you enter in a new Electrum (which you should verify before you use, for your own money's safety, see https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-verify-your-electrum-download/)* another direction could be to enable Addresses tab (view->show addresses) and for each funded address right-click and get the private key. Those private keys then you add into new Electrum (import addresses or private keys, see the info at the next step, ..)If one of these works and you need more help, ask more precisely.I will add that keeping your wallet or seed online can get your coins stolen.Even doing this kind of operations on a computer connected to the internet is risky.I advise you get a hardware wallet as soon as you've recovered the 0.6 BTC, then move your coins into hardware wallet's safety.I also advise you ignore help on private channels (private messages, telegram, whatever) because they can easily lead to you getting scammed.",

I started receiving an error when i open my electrum saying \"A problem occurred when attempting to sync with the blockchain. Try manually running resync.cmd\" When was the last time you opened your wallet? I am curious to know because versions older than 3.3.4 (if I'm not mistaken) can not connect to the network and this has been the case for more than three years.The best thing you can do is to import your wallet seed or wallet file into a newer version (the latest is 4.33) and make sure to download it from the official website and verify its signature. You can also, in case V 1.7 allows exporting signed raw transactions, create a transaction sending all your coins to a new wallet you own, sign it with the current version then broadcast it using any online tool such as coinb.inBefore doing any of the above, make sure to make more than one copy of your wallet file and save it in a safe place. Newer versions of Electrum will change the wallet format and if something goes wrong it will be almost impossible to fix it.",

After making some safety backups/copies of the wallet file (since it may get updated/modified) maybe you try your luck with newer versions, one step at a time, until you get , with some luck, to one that allows you do more with your seed of private keys.The download page from Electrum.org has a \"previous releases\" link containing versions from 1.8 onwards.Plus, I've also read that Electrum has change it seed types from 2.0 onwards, hence I guess that you'll need to recover private keys, not seed.",

Just make a copy of your \"electrum.dat\" file and load it to the latest version of Electrum.That's your actual wallet file and it's still supported by version 4.3.3. (latest as of now)Since it's a portable version, the file should be in the same folder where the portable electrum executable is located.To load it, simply download Portable Electrum from electrum.org/#download and verify it (guide);Open it to create the \"electrum_data\" folder in the same directory, leave it, open that fodler, create a wallets folder inside it then paste the copy your electrum.dat that \"wallets\" folder.Go back to Electrum 4.3.3 portable and load that wallet (Choose...) instead of creating a new one, if you somehow pasted it in the wrong directory, browse manually to that dir.But I have one concern, the error that you get doesn't point to a valid \".cmd\" file plus you said that it's v1.7 while the screenshot doesn't look like that version.I'd suggest you to check your PC's security and verify the current version of Electrum that you're using so you wont risk the funds by running a fake version or using a compromised system.",
