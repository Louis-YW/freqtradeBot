My question is, clicking on your site it was said to connect our wallets before whatever action. I am not against it but my concern is that how are we sure of the site we are visiting or even trying to connect our wallet and looking very closely we can't entrust our funds to a newly site coupled with the fast growing scam rate. However, Just as first poster already suggested, you need to move this topic to the altcoin section since it doesn't accept bitcoin deposit.",
