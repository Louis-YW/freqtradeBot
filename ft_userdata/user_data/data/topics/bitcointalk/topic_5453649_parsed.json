Only just a couple of people though that I know, it's not that huge affiliate or something. And it's easy to talk to them, and obviously, gambling is very easy to learn as well as there are no learning curves.",

      "body": "Most altcoins investment is like gambling because many of them which are not scam are still very risky to invest on. But there are many people (ahat use to gamble by) investing the amount of money they are capable to lose but turned out to be good investment. The recent example of this coin is pepe de frog or so. There have been many of them in the past. If you are able to do research, investing is very good, but bitcoin investment is the safest among them all.Although altcoins investment are gambling, but they are not still the same as gambling. Gambling is gambling. Investment is investment. There are still chances that investment can give better return if you make good research before investing. You should be talking about all, not only gambling. There is success in investing if you can find the right coins and tokens.",

They don't care/fear (whatever the description) if the coins they are holding are on a downfall as they will think that this is part of the process and they are acquainted with losing more than winning so if their coins, their level of happiness is not like that of an investor (many might disagree) but that's how I feel, just like winning in a game.",

      "body": "Well, when it comes to my own experiences, it's been quite a mix with gamblers and investors. Yes, at first glance, bringing in gamblers seems appealing because they already get the whole risk thing. But here's the deal: it's just as important to educate them about responsible gambling and the downsides that come with it. Novice gamblers are often very impulsive, which can lead to serious problems. If they're not educated on how to manage their money, they can easily overspend on betting and lose everything. Now, when it comes to investors in the crypto world, it's a whole different ballgame. We're talking about discussing market trends, future prospects, and managing expectations. Yeah, it may require more chatting and addressing their fears and confidence levels. But hey, it can also lead to some really valuable insights and long-term growth. So, when it comes to helping investors, I'm more of a coach than a financial advisor. I don't just tell people what to do with their money; I help them make the right decisions based on their personal goals and risk tolerance.So, what's the point? The point is that it's important to know your audience and how they're approaching their investments. If you're dealing with investors who know what they're doing, then it may be best to leave them alone and let them do their thing. But if you have people who are new to investing or have been burned before by the market, then it's time to step in and help them out.",

This mentality arises when they need to have patience to experience the growth on their investment. There are people who are successful as well as failed ones. The success rate used to be low against the losers.Maybe the friends who have got into gambling rather than investing haven't experienced massive loss. Over days this can cause big loss. By then most of them will realise and starts to think of holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If they've got prior experience in gambling, this might not affect them much. When we introduce someone to gambling, we should let them be aware of after effects. If not the thing we do could cause problem between our relationship.",

Never really done referrals before, and most of my friends that are non-gamblers aren't interested in gambling. Those that do though, are already doing it so nothing to refer to at all. Back in the days then yea maybe, I invited a few of my friends in the past to gamble (I was one of the early starters of gambling in our circle) and that pretty much brought about what we have right now with my circle. And to the topic of gamblers and investors, I actually would do the opposite, gamblers can be quite, well, gamblers. Regardless of how they know about risks and whatnot, it's a lot easier to handle it when it's games (which is what we consider gambling is) but if we go towards investments and whatnot? Kind of a different story imo.",

But with crypto investment, you can advise newbies to go and read more about Bitcoin themselves and later come for extra lessons, asking questions and all, this is way better and crypto is not a losing game if you do things right.",

Do you feel this sense of accomplishment that you influenced them in this kind of activity? Personally, I would feel somehow bad for letting them into this kind of addicting activity. Though that may be the case, I do agree on the last point you mentioned. The essence of investment means that you invest for future profit. If one is in a hurry to gain a quick profit, chances are that they would probably lose on their investment.",

I recruited a lot of gamblers in our local group in social media because Bitcoin that time doesn’t have much value and we collect it on faucet so we use it as play money only that time. It’s easier to invite back then since everyone is willing to risk their earnings on faucet because it’s fee.Quote from: Outhue on May 22, 2023, 10:46:16 AMI know many will find this hard to believe but I kinda prefer bringing in gamblers than investors into crypto, why?

I know many gamblers in our local that is very open minded on risk since they always doing it when they are playing unlike newbie investors that is very cry baby on every minimal losses even though you already explained the risk involved.Gamblers is indeed more matured than investors since most of the investors only think about profit while gamblers think profit and at the same time the possibility to lose it all.",

Most of them have already had experience with crypto and gambling in their past.Obviously when it comes to comparing gamblers with non-gamblers my experience has been that almost 100% of the time, unless they trust you, non-gamblers will not take up any offers to try out an online crypto gambling casino. They always seem to think that its some sort of trick or scam. And even more so if they have no experience with cryptocurrency in the first place.Gamblers without crypto experience are surprisingly cautious of cryptocurrency, as well. But they do tend to be more persuasive than non-gamblers (with no crypto experience).",
