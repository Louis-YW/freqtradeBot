  "content": "Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has burned 2.65 billion Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens in its 11th burn round.The total LUNC tokens burned by Binance now exceed 35.5 billion, with the community’s burn surpassing 68 billion. Traders have reacted positively to the burn, with LUNC seeing a 3% price increase.Based on a transaction executed on July 1, Binance transferred 2.65 billion LUNC tokens to the burn address, reducing the circulating supply. The transaction also involved a transaction fee of 13.25 million LUNC.The Terra Classic burn mechanism automatically burns tokens whenever a transaction occurs on the network. The number of tokens burned is relative to the number in circulation. This ensures that the total supply of tokens is constantly decreasing, hypothetically increasing their value over time.As reported by Coingape, Binance conducted a burn of 1.04 billion LUNC tokens in June. Although Binance reduced its contribution from LUNC spot and margin trading fees from 100% to 50%, the community expressed gratitude for the support provided by the crypto exchange and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao.Over the past two months, the LUNC burn rate has improved, thanks to initiatives from projects like DFLunc, Terra Casino and Cremation Coin, which burn millions of LUNC tokens weekly. As a result, the community has successfully burned 68 billion LUNC tokens.Following the successful completion of its largest upgrade in May, which aims to align the chain with Terra 2.0 and other Cosmos chains, the community’s current focus is on decreasing the supply of LUNC and TerraClassicUSD (USTC) tokens. Additionally, the Joint L1 Task Force and “quant” team will collaborate on the USTC repeg initiative.In June, LUN struggled to surpass the $0.0001 mark and declined below the support level of $0.000090. Despite Binance’s burn, the LUNC price remains under pressure, showing continued downward movement.According to CoinMarketCap, LUNC’s price has jumped 3% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.000087 at the time of writing.NEWS SOURCE",

Look at the recent price of lunc. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/It's consistently dumping to the bottom even deeper than before. The burn meant nothing as there are 6 trillions of supply now. You can use LUNC metrics https://www.luncmetrics.com/You can't count a small jump as a signal. It takes 1 year to burn 64 billions while total supply was 6 trillions. You can imagine how many years needed to burn 1 trillion worth of lunc coin. There will be no change in the price.",

They have a huge supply and some negative histories, which will not gonna be good for their advertisement in the future, and because of this, this event is nothing for the investors because they are not gonna take risks for some altcoins that don't have any assurance to survive in the next year. there are lots of choices out there, and to invest in this one seems hard right now, especially when you decide to invest lots of money in it the return on investment is not assured, and a gamble when you still pursue to do it.",

And most of the investors are now refraining from investing in Luna Classic or New Luna because it is now difficult to trust them. However I think people trading it now are mostly short term trading. So I don't see much hope for them even after this burning",

I don’t understand why Binance let this shit token available in the public while there’s real development happening behind. They are just continuing to list this token and ride this ridiculous token burn mechanism to get fees from traders that wasting money from false hope that this project will be revived soon while the team clearly scam everyone before.This is a SCAM token and abandoned project. People must stop dreaming now about the success of this project because Luna made a lot of investors suffer due to Do Kwon poor management and exit scam.",

It's like beating a dead horse. Anyone from outside sees this as a doomed project, but i can imagine i would be shilling it too if i didn't manage to sell my bags in time. These guys are probably DCA:in this to the end and hoping they make their money back with just a tiny pump.
