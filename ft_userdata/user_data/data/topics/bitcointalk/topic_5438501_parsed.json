  "content": "This one na very interesting piece wey I read. The person wey write am try wella. Personally sef, I see say e make sense. Wetin e talk be say despite the new monetary policy wey oga Meffy don put for ground e nor go fit stop vote-buying during the election. Wetin be some of the new monetary policies? Una don already know that one . For this article, the writer talk say why this new policy nor go stop vote buying na becasue of the dollarization of the Nigeria economy. Wetin this one mean? See him summaryQuote...the CBN’s monetary policy reforms are not expected to exert a fundamental change on the Nigerian dominant vote-buying culture. While it might minimise the use of the local currency for transactional politics of vote-buying, the policy is unlikely to stem the entire gamut of the thriving vote-buying “industry” in a heavily dollarised liberal democratic milieu as Nigeria.To understand am better. Make I ask, which currency wey PDAPC(PDP and APC) been use during their presidential primaries to take buy key electoral officials, delegate electors, voters? Na Naira or na dollar?Anyways, I hope say una don see small reason too. We fit still discuss am. Make una shook mouth as e dey hot?Una doh o",

Okay look at it from this angle, now there is no money in circulation to the poor masses but nobody will tell me that no politician has enough cash in their houses for the forthcoming election. We know sae no politician and stand on the queue we stand. They only make calls and have their ways with millions. Ok now when di election kick start and in di polling unit APC or PDP gives you 10k with this hardship to get cash to vote for them won't you collect it? Time will tell, let us wait and see.

I doubt there had been a time in this country when during election the prices of things become cheaper or cash flow become free. The hardship and unavailable cash is more political than economic. The election is just some days away, and we would hear and see cases of vote buying more open and undisputed. Let's vote wisely so we can from now secure the future of generations coming up.",

I believe say this political dey work with banks already to hoard cash wey dem gi use in vite buying. The only thing this new policy do na to make am very difficult but e no make am impossible. Banks na thief and bank managers ready to work hand in hand with any politician wey go cut them better percentage.No be story we dey hear say one governor dey withdraw millions from banks meanwhile dem dey claim say banks no get money to dispense. Okay abi you wan tell me say the like of Tinubu no go get access to any billions wey him wan received from the banks while giving dem a juicy percentage? Abi we dey forget say politicians get shares dem fir must of this banks and dem gi wan dey on their good side incase of anything. The policy no go stop anything as agents for still dey do electronical transfer to use buy the vote without it been linked to the politician.",
