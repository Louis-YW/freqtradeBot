  "content": "One question bothers me a long time and I am not sure if there is anyone that thinks about this before. Let's say you invested $10K in Bitcoin when the price was $20K,  and some time later the price pumped to $40K, which means the initial capital is now worth $20K. For some reason, you need cash urgently so you decide to sell the Bitcoin you own for cash. You do it and now you have that $20K on hand. In this process of trading, your profit is $10K for sure, regardless of whether the Bitcoin price will pump or dump. If you won't invest again, this beautiful success should be what you are proud of. However, 99% of us will choose to buy again and hope for the next success. However, now you buy at $40K and the price may drop to a new low below $20K later, and the profit you gained from last trading may be eaten up gradually by the market dump. Connect the two dots(two extreme conditions) and draw a curve, high chances are that at last, your profits from all investments may not be that much, at least much less than what you expected when you first gained that $10K. Therefore, all the occasional profits between investments may become fixed or variable costs that these investment must pay.Does this sound logical to you ? What do you think of all the interval losses from the investment gains ? Please let me know.",

Even if the price drops at intervals, bitcoin has shown to always rise in the long run, so after another bull run or two, the value of 1BTC could be as high as $100k, and they would have a total of $50k, with a profit of $40,000 from their initial investment.Selling and buying back at intervals can work when you try to sell at the top and buy back at the bottom, but does not come with guarantees.- Jay -",

Please let me know.It's definitely a blindspot that many people have when they come to determining how successful they are at trading and it's a similar effect to what we see with gamblers. There is a tendency to hone in on the few large wins, but overlook the many small losses which often wear down your investments. It is only when you completely cash out that you can judge your profitability, in the scenario you've highlighted, no profit was made by the trader at all - they probably also lost money because the value of what they invested was being inflated away in fiat terms during that timeframe as well. These sort of assets are also not producing anything of value, so you don't naturally get an income from dividends or profit reinvestment like you would with a share of a company.",

Please let me know.What you are describing is not investment cost but rather you flip-flopping between selling and buying at the wrong times, which eats away your profit in two ways:the first way is that you obviously get scared of the dump and sell lower than you bought. Then the price rises and you buy again because you think it will continue going up, without you. Repeat process until you have no money.The second way, which most people underestimate, is you grind away your money with trading fees. 0.1% and 0.1% and again and again until you have grinded away 10% from your repeated and unnecessary back and forth trading.The only real investment costs should be the withdrawal fees and the one-time buying fee. Thats it. After that you hodl.And if you are susceptible to panic-selling or panic-buying, then walk away from the computer and distract yourself with something else at least for a few years.

Please let me know.There are different types of investment strategies followed by investor so the scenario may have different outcomes depends on what strategy we are following.For example you made 10K profits which is 100% return so I will cash out the capital alone and let the profit to sit in the wallet for long time so you can utilise the capital on other investments since you have nothing to lose with your crypto investment.Accumulating more Bitcoin is another strategy and it is more suitable for very long term investment like 5 to 10 years atleast by that time surely you will be in profits.",

Please let me know.Yeah statement is quite logical to me because it doesn't matter you are re investing your money there will be a factor of risk present at every investment opportunity. All you have to do is to do your proper study before investing your money. Like if you follow the sequence when you made 10k profit at first investment and you thought you would made another tank a profit in another investment but that's a sequence that you should avoid.What you should do is to do the same level of study that you have done when you are investing the first time and there is one more factor that investing and trading are two different things so if we are investing then we should have to wait for longer period of time and if we are trading we can see result in lesser time. Ultimately risk factor and risk management are the main component of investing and trading that we should not avoid even if we made profit in the first try.",

Please let me know.In my opinion, it is a very bad strategy to sell at a low price ($20,000) and then re-buy an asset that has already doubled in price ($40,000).You need to buy bitcoin in a bear market (at a low price) and sell it at a bull market (at a high price).  Now that's a good trading strategy!  If you are selling bitcoins to buy things that are vital to you, then this has nothing to do with trading.  In this case, Bitcoins perform the function of money (monetary, payment function).  Bitcoin is both an investment asset and money, it can perform both functions.",

At some point, when you have a lot of bitcoin and it's worth a lot of money in fiat terms, you stop watching the market. You no longer bother yourself with this little \"oh I gained 10k now\" and a month later \"oh I'm down 2k today from that 10k profit\". Think of it like this:You have all you want as an average person. A house, a family, a job, cars, bikes, computers, phones, all that normal shit. I'm not talking jets and lambos, but all the average stuff. You once got bitcoin for maybe 1k USD and it's now worth 1 million. It was worth 2 million a year ago, 500k 6 months ago, now it's a million, you no longer care. Your investment was 1k and it's never going back to 1k. I know a lot of people with a lot of bitcoin and a similar mindset. We just want to have an alternative and we're fine with whatever is happening because when we spend bitcoin, it's because we're happy with the price. Coming back to the point. You're bothered with the investment cost because to you it's 10k and you have 10k profit. If I had a million and reached a million in profit for the first time, I'd redeem my million in profit and satisfy my need to show the success \"on paper\" and then kept the other million in bitcoin for the next 5+ years. That's where I'm at right now. The investment cost was redeemed somewhere in 2017 and now there's no more \"cost\" to think about. It's all profit, whether bitcoin is at 10k or 100k.",

Of course not. So what you are going to do in that case, then HODL and wait for the price to go up again.Sooner or later you will understand how this variables will affect your profits or what you term variable cost, and so you will have to advise.

      "body": "The simple adage in Bitcoin is buy low sell high. If you bought at $20,000 and was compelled by some reason to sell at $40,000, and you're planning for a buy back, at least choose the right entry point. If you think that $40,000 is still a right entry price because you foresee more increases in the near future, then go ahead. But if instead of an increase the price corrects and even went down below $20,000, do not sell. Sell only, if you must, when the price goes above $40,000. Instead, buy more. It's an opportunity for you to buy back at a much lower price. On a side note, though. This is why DCA is the better approach. Also, you don't invest all your savings in Bitcoin. Always keep aside savings for emergency and other unexpected expenses. Finally, Bitcoin is best for long-term. Corrections and sell-offs are temporary. In the long run, you will make profit.",
