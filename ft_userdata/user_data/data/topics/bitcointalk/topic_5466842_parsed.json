Have you face any problem with current theme? from 2009 to until now everything working well and no one has filed a case about it. If this forum were any magazine or news website then it would be useful to use front-ends for better look. As EFS mentioned this forum is just to express our idea and we are doing well in current theme. If wee see the primary goal of front-ends then I think everything is fine and no need of any change Quote The primary responsibility of a front-end developer is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of a website or application are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functionally efficient.

I don't thing that improving the design of the site or upgrading it in anyway will be a good step. The forum is based on SMF (Simple Machines Forum) code and that's known for the simplicity and faster loading times. If it's upgraded in anyway then it will lose the way it was developed because this forum works even on older devices without any lagging issues and if it get bloated with new design something that social media sites have then it will lag for some users who still used low end systems.",

This is possible with web3 and the new internet, SMF on the other hand is not at that level and probably won't be for a long time (if ever)...and even if so, BitcoinTalk is still on SMF v1.x.x...while SMF itself is way past v2.It would be a great to have this option to extend usability to those used to other platforms.

Also, regarding theme liking it's subjective, you like current better maybe just because you are used to it. The themes contain alert/notification icons, what's reason they are not included in bitcointalk/why is backend not developed?

I would assume that there would be a lot of work on BitcoinTalk as it is currently to enable support for creating alternative front-ends.
