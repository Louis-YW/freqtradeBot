Anyhow, takes for giving us the warnings this early and hopefully no one will fall for this exchange. 0.025 ETH for transaction fee is really high and maybe they think that they can get away with this kind of fees.",

Using unknown and unreputable exchanges was taking risk with our money. With high transaction fees , it is more like decentralized exchanges which is required high fees. Maybe use reputable market could avoid us from this kind accident.",

So can you tell your story why do you use this garbage exchange site? If you have so many choices to trade azbit exchange site and why do you need to use this exchange site to keep your tokens? it seems like the fault is yours. You have no choice other than paid the transaction fees.",

Before starting trading on a new exchange, I now always check the cost of the withdrawal fee. Where the commissions are high, I no longer trade, for example, on the STEX.com exchange, the withdrawal fee is 0.02 ETH and I left this exchange forever.",

I think that you can do nothing to save your money. that's shit exchange site and you will never get your bluesparrow if you will never pay them the fees, They are forcing you. This is the typical of scam exchange site when they have your money and they didn't let you to take it for free",

Azbit,Coinsbit,Latoken and some other are very bad exchanges. They offer IEO and token listing very cheap price but after that they create fake volume and made withdraw very hard for users. Bluesparrow token withdraw is very Costly in Azbit exchange but why BM elect this exchange for bounty hunter. Token already listed on top exchanges and azbit price is very low. It's better to wait ,maybe price up in Future.",
