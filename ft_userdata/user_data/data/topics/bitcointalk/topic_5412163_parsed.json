As far as I know, Binance does provide this solution, you can put a trailing stop loss on Binance by setting the Gap price from the high of that very rally, which means if you put the order of 19500 and it is executed and you put a trailing stop loss of 5% so now if the price reaches 20500 your stop loss will get changed to somewhere around 19480. Similarly now if the price comes down for a bit and then again breaches 20k mark to reach 22k, your stop loss will now become around 21k. So this will be carried on until it drops 5% from the high of that rally. You can refer to this guide to understand the concept: https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/339635f6260d43c5aefa4c3c921728ec",

I advise you to read about this kind of order and how you can set it up depending on the exchange you are using.But OP seems to build something using API, which seems a trading bot something that is created via some coding logic.I found some articles about Binance's API: https://dev.binance.vision/t/how-do-i-set-a-stop-loss-stop-loss-limit-trailing-stop-loss-or-take-profit-order-via-the-api/2612/2https://dev.binance.vision/t/how-to-implement-otoco-tp-sl-orders-using-api/1622https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/faqs/trailing-stop-faq.mdhttps://docs.ftx.com/#get-open-trigger-ordersOverall these kinds of functions will depend on Exchanges.The articles above will help you to achieve those via API especially using top exchanges like Binance and FTX. This is very helpful, just check and read carefully their API documentation for this.",

Try alternative exchanges like OKX. Last time i used it, their KYC verification was not yet that strict.",
