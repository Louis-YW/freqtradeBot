  "content": "...I was not really very happy with either my mobile wallet nor even my desktop wallet (after the Wasabi betrayal of confidentiality), so I went looking for an alternative, especially one that would work of my mobile device as well as my desktop.I already own (and am very happy with) both a Trezor T and BitBox02 hardware wallets.So, I decided to give blockstream.com's offering in the space for both my Win PC and cellphone: https://blockstream.com/green/All in all, I am pretty happy.  It's easy to use (important for me).  You can adjust the TX fees to whatever sats/vB you want, which is nice (neither of my hardware wallets allow setting EXACT fees).  I like the Green Wallet more than my ancient blockchain.com and bitpay.com wallets for everyday mobile use.  I use the PC version if I want a quick'n'easy transfer from \"bcq1...\" to/from \"3...\" addresses (mobile version allows that too).  Another tool I like is that Green can delete wallet info once you're sure you don't need it anymore (uh, do make sure you REALLY want to do that).EDIT (see below post on August 24): The only thing I would change would be to add a coin control feature, which I could not find anywhere there.So for quick and easy receipt or purchases of BTC, Green is good!  Of course I quickly send on most BTC from there to a hardware wallet.",

Personally,  I think it is a better optionWhile Electrum is wonderful on the PC segment, afaik it's still missing HW support on smartphones. And if somebody wants hard to have pretty much the same application on PC and smartphone may avoid Electrum, no matter how good it is.While I do like Electrum for PC, for now I am stuck on Android with Mycelium. And I would not mind some \"fresh air\". So I might give this green wallet a chance, especially since it does support HW and it's also open source.I'm also eyeing Blue Wallet for its easy LN capability (although unfortunately custodian, I know), but I'm not convinced if it would work with my Ledger Nano S and I didn't have the time for proper tests.",

      "body": "...ETFbitcoin and dkbit98Hey, thanks for your comments, I will reply why I still like Green as my easy-to-use, everyday mobile wallet.First, as many of you longer-term members know I am not particularly adept at technology (not trained, not a programmer).  Simple is good.  I do not use multi-sig (no way).  Nor am I interested in shitcoins or even Lightning/Liquid (both of those are still very fuzzy concepts in this old guy's head).  Some of the off-chain technologies do look like they have great promise, but they're not for me until they become easier to use.I have looked at Sparrow, but it looks complicated and there was some issue (which I forget at the moment) that make it a no-go for me at least for now.  I am hoping that Sparrow will become easy to use as it DOES have features that look very interesting especially their version of coinjoin.Nor am I capable of setting up my own node, using LINUX, etc.  It's too late for me to tackle those learning curves.Simplicity matters.  For me, Green offers me enough features with simplicity.  I get BTC onboard with Green (better for me than blockchain or bitpay), then move them to hardware wallets.  Works for me.",
