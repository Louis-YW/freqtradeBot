If you are holding Bitcoin and missed chance to take profit nearly $50,000, don't feel bad.BecauseHalving is only three months aheadBig whales have been accumulating bitcoin for their games.The point of this thread is the 10+k Cohort just started their accumulation. See the top blue row in the chart and now we have three top rows (whales) are accumulating Bitcoin after long time of distribution.Accumulating more bitcoins like whales or if you can not do accumulation, just hold and wait for a bull run.",

But what does that really give us? If I understand the chart correctly, October-December of 2023 were the months of active accumulation, and the price gradually grew as well. But there was also some accumulation in April 2023 which was followed by only a modest and temporary price increase. Also, during the gradual fall of the price in May-June, the richest cohort was in accumulation phase.For now, there's only a tiny bit of blue if we consider 2024, and it's hard to say if it's going to actually be a major accumulation trend like in November 2023.",

By \"like whales\", I meant that we can follow the game making progress of whales, if they are accumulating and we see it, have spare fund for investment, let's accumulate bitcoin like them but with awareness that whales always have long term plans so don't follow them and expect to get profit in short term.\"like whales\" does not mean we are able to buy big amount of BTC like whales.

They will shake their hands in a bull run with correction because they will believe in fud like, the bull run is over.If we can hold, we belong to small percent of diamond handed investors and we will have chance to take profit at better price.",

As the market rallies to new highs, sell pressure is re-activated, as investors bring dormant supply back into the market to satisfy the inflowing demand.As spot price reached new ATHs in mid-March, the same pattern of local distribution occurred, which was intensified as news around the conflict in the Middle East broke, causing a correction to $60.3k.Bull local distribution break-downIf we inspect the breakdown of this metric by wallet sizes, we can complete a more detailed assessment. Here we see a distinct uptick in net outflows 🟥 across all cohorts throughout April, suggesting a consistent sell-side pressure across the board.I really hope to see this healthy correction and local distribution lasts for a while, like some months to help NUPL to drop further.https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/relative-unrealized-profit--loss/",
