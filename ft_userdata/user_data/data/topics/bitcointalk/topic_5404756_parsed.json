It must be eye catching and interesting for the readers.I checked Fiverr and Upwork, and tested one guy from Pakistan. The result is confusing, but it was \"only 6 $ my friend\"  . The good(better) ones wants 10-50$ per article, or even more and they wants to get paid in their platform (which is completely normal).We will pay in crypto, monthly - to FaucetPay. Let me compare my Fiverr gig with our plans for the future:The guy wrote me the article in 30 hours, i paid 6$ (more with some taxes) at the beginning with unclear resultsThe effect: the guy got 6$ at the very first day, we got the article, we won't get too much income from it , because it's grammarly OK, but on the other hand, it's not professional at all.:Our vision: The publishers will write an article, we will check , approve or reject for correctionOur publishers won't be paid at the very beginning, but they will get a lifetime revenue share from all of their articles!In comparation; Fiverr guy took 6$ immediately, our publishers will get $$$ / article every month (depends on engagements based on Google Analytics)Traffic / promotion is our business, we will keep our publishers to work without disturbing   That's it in a nutshell. I got not so much responseso far, maybe we are doing something wrong...",

Since your blog is brand new, there may be no traffic on this blog and perhaps google AdSense (or any other ad network) is not yet active to get any revenue. In this case, how will you pay your clients as you told payment will depend upon the Google Analytic engagement?Also if you don't mind can you share the name of your blog /site / domain?",

The publishers will be paid by this formula:  total _ad_revenue * 0.5----------------------------  * your_engagements_for_all_your_posts_that_month    all_engagementsThe traffic (of course organic) is our secret and it won't be less than 100k organic visitors / dayThe website is still not pretty, so i will share the url later, when the fronted will be done.",
