Any bitcoin address that do not start from 1, 3 or bc1 are not bitcoin, they are altcoins.My advice:If the amount you want to transfer is not much, you can convert it an altcoin that have low fee, send it to OKX. Move it from OKX to you bitcoin wallet. OKX charges $2 for bitcoin transaction.If the amount is much, you have to take note of the trading fees. Trading fee is in percentage. Which means that trading fee may take higher amount if you are dealing with huge amount of money.Edit:I have just checked this, the fee on OKX has also increased recently, about $9 now with bitcoin at $28000. Bitcoin fee on exchanges are usually expensive.",

It's better to try and send a small amount to make sure that everything is working properly.Now, I get that you want to use this to save some fees, but as mentioned above, you should understand that WBTC and BTC are not the same thing and there are certain risks that come with using BTC on other networks[2].[1] https://community.trustwallet.com/t/kcc-kucoin-community-chain-integrated-to-trust-wallet/510424[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5420769.msg61281800#msg61281800",

If you don't want to pay many fees, consider using P2P where you can change the transfer fee. If that's not an option wait until the mempool becomes free. Unless you use a terrible exchange that doesn't update the fee according to the network condition, that should be an okay option.Quote from: NIrish on March 21, 2023, 09:12:40 AMAs for the tether it's a long story from another thread, I have GBP on KuCoin from Bitcoin sales which I now realise I can't withdraw, trying to switch to tether at a decent rate and go from there ... prob transfer somewhere else to go back to GBP to withdraw unless the market drops in the meantime ... all more tricky than I'd hoped!Make sure you do some research first if you decide to use another exchange to process your GBP. I'd also check if there is any USDT to GBP P2P trade available on this forum or other P2P marketplace before you decide to do KYC on another platform. Or, you can also just buy more BTC with your available GBP if you can afford the risk (unless it is not possible for one reason or another).",

There are features some exchanges offer that are misleading. You may notice that certain exchanges offer you a menu of networks you can use in moving funds. These networks' respective fees are indicated. Exchanges make them appear as if you can easily switch between them. In avoiding high fees, the tendency is that some users choose the network with the cheapest fee, therefore ending with the wrong network. Funds are lost in the process. Indeed, in avoiding high fees, you may lost everything. QuoteAlthough partially reassured by moving USDT from KuCoin to Kraken successfully and having been told the fee to transfer out of the wallet should be less than the fee to transfer from exchange.These centralized exchanges are imposing high fees. This is just one of their numerous disadvantages. But if you want to move Bitcoin from one exchange to another, why not trade it first into an altcoin with a much cheaper transaction fee and do another trade as soon as it arrives in its destination?Anyway, I haven't tried it but Trust Wallet has made announcements almost a year ago that it already integrated Kucoin Community Chain (KCC) to their wallet. Did you not proceed with this option?",

I can't remember if Coinbase wallet allows you to do that but if they do, you can check mempool when choosing the fees: https://mempool.space/Or you could just use the priority option (low, medium, high).But either way, the fees will be much less and would depend on the transaction size as well as how congested the network is. Coinbase wallet won't take any extra fees (unlike centralized exchanges).",
