This is not the first version of the logo and not the last one that is still in use today (the same logo with an orange background and a btc character tilt to the right). It seems to me that first need to decide which day should be considered BTC logo day appeared.And if some new and updated version appears, then what day to celebrate then?Usually in such cases, the day of the very first appearance of the logo should be considered.",

Even though it's different with the current version that created by bitboy, that logo is still being used as favicon of bitcointalk, as you can see above.

[/quote]I have a big respect to roslinpl as he and medUSA were my role models in my early time of designing on bitcointalk. Too bad both are not on this forum anymore. Well we can't blame the article's writer though, perhaps he doesn't have an account on Bitcointalk, and that twitter user doesn't either. But yeah, some correction on his article would be great so everyone will recognize that most of important moments in bitcoin history were from Bitcointalk.",

He originally unveiled the Bitcoin logo by inscribing BC on a gold coin. Then the Bitcoin logo changed step by step.Logo used in first Bitcoin (2009-2010)The logo was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto below which ran from 2009 to 2010. This design was originally done by engraving BC (bit coin) on a gold coin.Bitcoin's second logo (2010)However, in 2010, the Bitcoin logo was slightly modified to create a logo with only the ₿ symbol, which was running in the market for a very short time.The third and final logo of Bitcoin‌ (2010-Now)If the second logo doesn't take off very well in the market, another logo is created for the last time which is still running.  The coin has been modified slightly by keeping the ₿ symbol of the last logo as before, which makes the logo look much more attractive than before, which is why the last logo of Bitcoin is permanently in the market until now.",
