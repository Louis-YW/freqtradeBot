      "body": "You have made a great effort in compiling this article and it is really comprised of useful points which not only newbies but experts should also keep in mind. I mean, I am a senior but sometimes, fall prey to a FOMO just because I trust some person, like on Twitter AKA X or on Discord, and I know that the posts from that person are accurate but unfortunately, the same person (I am following) if fall prey to FOMO then he will make a post accordingly and I as a fan of his accuracy will not doubt for another second and abruptly follow him. And end in FOMO as well. The above example shows that we should do a search from our side, even though if we are following a top Ultra Pro Max expert. They (pro) are also human and they also make mistakes. But the point is they make fewer mistakes because they have more knowledge about the industry and newbies don't even newbies lack the main factor of objective. They think of BTC and investment as quick rich schemes. But it is not?I recently, read a topic in which OP received a phishing link, I mentioned the story of Vitalik's hacks, which resulted in the loss of almost $691k dollars. If you wanted to read it check out some recent posts of me. The point is in Vitalik's case people also got into FOMO and thought that they might not get another opportunity like this and go straight into a trap. And end up losing money. So better to remain sharp in the crypto industry.",

It's good you are using colors in the Heading.  You are adding necessary Photos it's not a blog, we use photos to show some useful large set of data or to show emotions and from both of these there's nothing in the images you are using. Becasue the motive for writing a post on the blog and writing a post here in the forum (I think you can get my point).It looks like you've created all these images by yourself because I cant see any source references, yes then it totally fine if not buddy better to add a source link because you can be careless anymore with the rules.Quote from: snowpega on September 21, 2023, 02:39:36 PMDCA (Use Dollar-Cost Averaging):For the rest, I think your post is effective but a couple more errors as you are suggesting DCA here I'm giving the benefit of the doubt due to bounding the topic to a particular length, as you are just explaining the DCA in much more generic way as it's not that simple you really want substantial gains. Due to the lack of experience and limitations strategic implementation and personal choices. On DCA you need to work    as per my observation and are pretty new to it, I'm getting bossy but I think while guiding someone we need to figure out a lot of factors, and the strategic implementation of the DCA holds a significant role while execution.",

      "body": "You have created a good topic, and it was very useful for me, as I didn't know that to avoid FOMO we can use the DCA factor, it is a very creative method by the way. For example, if I am getting into the FOMO of buying BTC at the price of $29k and I do know that in the long term, BTC will make a new ATH but still get into the FOMO just to buy BTC at a lesser price. Unfortunately due to my greed in me, I also did not have that opportunity of $29k and did not take the entry and now the market is not coming down. But we can avoid that if we would do DCA, like if we take entries in small parts while keeping some funds in the save zone to deal with the market when it dumps. I do have some idea about it before, but I am just agreeing with your method and you really learned a lot, in your time here. I can see you are almost 1 year old here but you are not that active. I would love to know from where you learn the above things. And you should try to add some facts too along with the source links. TO create something more interesting.",

And as already suggested, you do not need images within texts, this forum is majorly text based so we should only use images when it is really necessary to relay a message.- Jay -",

Once you have some assets into bitcoin mostly an amount you can lose then it is best to diversify into other assets outside the crypto world such that even if the market of cryptocurrency becomes unstable you can have other assets to fall back to and this way you would have beaten FOMO too. The only place you would think of diversification is when you have some set amount that for only Alticoins then I wound also say you shouldn’t put them into one but rather into the top Alticoins. But be rest assured that even if you diversify in Alticoins it doesn’t save you from losing because they didn’t have guaranteed returns and are seeing as just pump and dump coins. So for long term holding prioritize only bitcoin as cryptocurrency asset",

While you will notice that with such individual, whether the price of Bitcoin rises of fall, they never get worried, simply because they already got a plan, unlike a non-experience member who might invest all his funds, and if the price of BTC starts falling again, he/she start getting panicking.",

Most of the things I learned from here like from senior members of BTT  which I also mentioned in my article. I put those learned things into my topic so those who are junior to me may learn easily some of my points.To be very honest I have never seen the link you shared in your post which is somehow relating to my post. If you have any concern about those pictures I used to increase the understandability of post I edit them from Canva on my own. In the end, I would say I did my best to add/compile those things into one post which i learned from my senior members of bitcoin talk. i hope you understand my points and show some positive response.

As beginners, it's easy to fall victim to the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) phenomenon, making hurry decisions and emotional decisions that can lead to financial losses which is guess not good at all. Indeed, FOMO is something that can really trigger someone, especially newbies, to do things in a hurry, even because they are so afraid of being late, they don't even study in advance what they are going to do. So, maybe not all, but many follow it blindly, without any knowledge or preparation. So the results will actually be dangerous for yourself. Like when investing too, when they are FOO on the hype of a project that they don't even understand, they just follow along, then they probably won't know how the project will continue, how to take profits and so on. As a result, the danger of this FOMO will actually create they more easily experience major losses. This will definitely happen without good knowledge and preparation.",

Newbies should avoid taking action in hurry or being emotional because they need to work on their knowledge and be ready to enter in the market to understand the market sentiments. In this way, first they will have some good knowledge on which they can be able to take some good decision to overcome their major losses as well. and second thing i don't think so anyone should be rigid on anyone opinion like i mean to say there are many people who are trying to spread signal kinda knowledge related to market sentiments. i would say newbies should not always be rigid on that kind of opinion instead they should work on their DYOR  right?  like sometime they follow these kind of personalities blindly and have to face many losses due to the rigidity on other opinions they follow.",
