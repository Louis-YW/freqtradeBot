  "content": "I have seen several topics here and other discussion thread where many people talked about gambling addiction. So many procedures been stated to follow sequentially to reduce the rate at which one frequently visit online gambling sites and possibly their application if they do have any of them.I remember in one of the threads I raised up a point which was long hidden as the thread became too numerous and lengthy to continue the conversation on that topic. It was my opinion to add up in profering solutions to gambling addiction. I believe not too many people saw it to to say something about it so that is why I had to bring it up as a topic hear. I want to hear your opinion and ideas towards it.Here is it; I am of the opinion that since gambling sites are mostly online and some has adds that pops up as advert on visited site, one should be able to disable or change their browser settings  by blocking casino adds and as well disabling  gambling sites on their browser settings so as not to gain access to it anymore till the number of days they deem fit to their resolve. This was just a little tip I gave as a possible solution. I had to put it up here for further discussions so that the bigger community can see it as  well.If you feel or think here is not the right place for this you can say it. I am open to corrections as we all are here to learn.",

Responsible gambling comes from inside you and how you discipline yourself, it is not about ads or anything. But generally you should block ads, not just gambling ads, but because they are all frustrating. You can use ad blockers to block ads.",

      "body": "While it is a good suggestion, there is more needed when one is really addicted to gambling. I think the only effective rule is that you put yourself on a blacklist to exclude you from all online casinos. All casinos should have an option to block yourself so you can not play there, but I doubt a general list or something similar exists? I know in Belgium this exists, but only applies to physical casinos. As Oshosondy mentions, limiting yourself by only depositing small sums is always a good idea as when you start tilting, you will have the urgency to bet crazy and going all-in (been there, done that).",

      "body": "One best solution is to cut the internet connection.  Without online access, that obviously stops online gambling addiction. A person who is willing to stop his gambling addiction is ready to compromise everything just to enable him to regain control of himself.  Without internet access, until fully recovered is a small price to pay, IMHO.  It is not like the person is spending his whole life without the Internet.  He will only deprive himself of internet use until he is fully recovered.  After recovery, he will then be free to access the internet again.",

You can use ad blockers to block ads. You should also have other important things in mind, and playing gambling games should just be like your stress reliever,and not because you are relying for possible passive income. Because depending on this activity would give you so much trouble sooner or later. With ads or not, the decision is indeed from your end. And should not click them randomly because some are phishing sites. And much better if before you start your gambling session if you have allotted budget, and you can stick with such budget.",

Although you are right when it comes to self discipline in restricting ones excesses.Do you not think disabling gambling sites on ones browser settings could be of help also?",

      "body": "The best solution to people with onset gambling addiction is to redirect their focus and attention to some other things. The reason why people gamble is because they have nothing to do with their lives, or their current hobbies and interests aren't cutting it out for them anymore. it could also be due to the fact that they are pressured by outside forces like debts, money problems, and so on and so forth which leads them to resort to gambling in hopes of finding the solution there, redirecting their attention and investment into something else that would take up their time is perfect as it keeps their minds and hands off of gambling, and it replaces it with something that's more productive. Intervening with a gambling addict is very important in the early stages to avoid bigger detriments from happening. As soon as you see a friend you know is gambling but has suddenly secluded himself and all that, you might wanna reach out and talk to them.",

Yes you can but we know that on the time that you do hover out on internet space or even on socialmedia on which there's still those probabilities that you could be able to see or able to encounter those gambling ads on which it would be able to trigger out your emotion or interest on playing again.This is why i could say that it all comes emotions and control it would really vary on each person on which means that we would really be reacting indifferently to each other on the time we do encounterthings which is correlated to gambling.It would really be depending on you whether you would be playing more or wouldnt really be doing such thing just because you do have that control towards yourself.Addiction is something that comes or would happen on the time that you wont really be able to resist on playing more. No matter on how you would be avoiding those odds but still your mind is thinking about on playing gambling then in the end of the day you would really be still playing. It all matters with your self control and seriousness on how to quit or avoidbecause if you do meant out then you would definitely do it.",

This actually forces casinos to become limited in terms of their audience, and this isn't something natural like underage people not being able to see gambling ads, it's something that people CAN choose to stop seeing them. It's not like only gambling addicts are the only ones who don't want to see gambling ads, there's probably a lot more, which would stop the casino from receiving their new customers. There's also the chance that whoever hosts their ad would lose the contract they have with the casinos to advertise them, since well, it doesn't return enough traffic after all. There are a LOT of self-exclusion ways, some of which are extensions that block casinos themselves. Just smash your keyboard if they ask for a password, self-exclusion done. Really, anyone who wants to stop gambling will do anything to do it, even if it was gradual. Those who don't? They simply find a new way to bypass the exclusion they did themselves.",

Any gambling platform can't do about that even they have so many features and programs to avoid it.Since we are talking online where every click can be monitored casino should have- can set hours of online, or a maximum limit for every person say 9 hours a day, - user can set a maximum daily loss- can set maximum daily bet- once a user reach one of these limits for such there is a warning note to the user, and will be forced logged out after finishing the  current game its playing later on.Actually there are lot of this kind of self-exclusions, but like i said its all about discipline, you can bypass everything but its also like lying to yourself, and at the end of the day, you will end up lossing and having a problem once you get addicted.Quote from: CryptSafe on August 02, 2023, 09:50:30 PMIf you feel or think here is not the right place for this you can say it.

So instead of saying that gambling addiction is influenced by the popularity of online casinos without taking proper account of what amount for the percentage of gambling addiction and its relation to self-control,  so for that ultimately gambling addiction is more of personal activity rather than casino related.",

Because I don't think so, since such individual can still visit such site even when ads have already been blocked, as blocking ads do not stop a site from loading. So I think the only way one can stop from gambling addiction is simply when someone recognize the harm his/her gambling addictions is causing him, and personally decide to change by himself, while any means that will tempt him to gamble being taken away from him till he fully recover.

Gambling addiction is like any other addiction, and just as it is a bad idea for a recovering alcoholic to go to a bar, it is also a bad idea for a gambler in the process of recovering to watch ads related to online gambling.However blocking those ads is not going to be easy as they are literally everywhere, and even if you could block all the pop-ups that could appear, at the same time you will be unable to block all gambling discussion that comes naturally on the content you are watching, this is what makes overcoming addictions even harder than on the past, as the ease in which we are able to obtain almost anything we may want now plays against us at this critical juncture.",
