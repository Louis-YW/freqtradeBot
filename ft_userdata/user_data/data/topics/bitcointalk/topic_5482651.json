  "content": "Life can be all rosy at times then the other becomes a pain in the ass. In the process of every man's living, he is bound to meet lifetime opportunities that will elevate him from his present financial status. Most people still believe that opportunity comes but once, it might not be true at some point but if we interpret they are clearly letting us know the importance of grabbing every opportunity that comes our way, grabbing it as it may fail to reoccur or may not come again in the same state. Relatively to how we must have known about Bitcoin, it's relevance and how profitable it is, yet most people are still on the verge of procrastinating. It will be a big slab if we miss this opportunity of buying and accumulating Bitcoin as we still are in the DIP, more convenient to accumulate Bitcoin. We all know how the Economy of the country is going, it seems like everything is going the wrong way and not any tendency of it going back to normal, anyone who fails to plan might have also made out plans to fail. We can see some business crashes due to economic instability, not what we pray for but at least making a digital investment that the unfavorable economy will not hinder is something that we should consider of utmost priority once we are financially stable. Bitcoin inflates with time, every necessary action of accumulating Bitcoin now will yield a much better profit and those who knew and failed to join the moving train will only regret and hope for another opportunity to come again which might, but not in this much convenient state. Many who took the risks of investing are clearly on the happier side, as some hold their Bitcoin investment as a generational asset which can be passed down, seeing the future possibilities of Bitcoin ahead of time.",
