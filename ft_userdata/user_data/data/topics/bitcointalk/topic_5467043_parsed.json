Regardless on what one believe on religion or politics, all positive leaders are supposed to bring peace and order onto the people of a country, the problem appears when both religion and centralized politics have a very different view on what peace, law and order is supposed to be or look like. It does not take much to realize that while following the news from the United States, for example. Or even India, where the Struggle between religious factions is pretty real and violent.",

The current social conflicts are rooted in the dogma of political and religious leaders and as a result of these conflicts the problem is shifting from national to international level.People are more interested in religious aspects than political aspects, nowadays, political leaders make various schemes just for survival which serve themselves more than serving the state and then hold on There is a conflict with religion, so both the leaders should lead the society by doing right and welfare work. At present, some religious leaders have also started religion business for the sake of various advantages and this religion business The result is chaos in the society which is spreading from one state to another only for hypocritical decisions.*That is why political leaders have to think about people's opinion before making decisions and religious leaders have to try to accept the decisions in the light of religion and these two leaders have many Works is for society we should help them, and we can get a lot of good from them, they act as our guide these two leaders are very important for a country society and state They do important work by removing conflicts in the society, doing social welfare work, imparting knowledge about social security, working in the field of education, working for social security, working as policymakers of the society.Acting as a social mobilizer takes the society to a higher level and helps people to learn morals and values ​​and many more.",

Both the civilian and politicians are under the voice and respect of the religious leaders even the holy books give so much direction to them and by saying the people rejoice when the righteous is on the throne meaning they are suppose to do the right thing but whether they have done the right things is questionable and another argument entirely. Even those who hold religious offices who have found themselves in political offices have turned total politicians with impunity as it is with the ordinary politicians.There have been many submissions that religious leaders have not played adequate role to lead politicians into doing the right things because some religious leaders are just answering whatever religious name ascribed to the office without really doing the work of God and so they also deceive the people which the politicians are part of the people. Most religious leaders are interested in what comes to them in tithe and offering so that even when a politician embezzle money from the community, he offers tithe and offering and the community is left to suffer.",

I believe, like my religion, every other religion is up to date with the contemporary world today, in other words, the religions are aware of the future and have made provisions for such eras in their scriptures. This is to say that, whether we are in democracy or otherwise, or in a first, second or even third world country, every true religion is indiscriminate of any of those and have created guidance on how its believers can live a life in such climes. For instance, in the ancient times, there's practically no dresses or such that will cover one's nakedness, regardless, the religions have identified and made rulings to those people. Now that there's enough garments to sow clothes with, there's also rulings made to it's effect and that goes round every aspect of human life.I believe if you find differences between the political and religious leaders that have escalated to conflicts and crisis, there's a pursuit of personal interest in it.",

According to my belief, both the politician and the cleric practice politics, and most of the time they are in complete agreement, since each of them serves the other’s interests in one way or another. To note, when we say a politician, this does not only mean those in power, because the opposition can also support itself by appointing a cleric.With the exception of some modern democracies, the cleric has his weight in society, regardless of the nature of the government. The matter usually does not depend on the will of the people themselves, but rather on the will of the politician to where he wants to direct public opinion.",

Firstly, I consider the role of political leadership in this case to be state officials. they have extraordinary influence in influencing the society they lead, with their policies and power they are able to create anything through their political movements with adequate access and funds. such as creating an issue that makes an epidemic worse, which causes people to be more wary of what they buy and consume, which results in increased or even decreased public health conditions due to excessive anxiety.Another thing is the influence of religion in society, religion can be stronger than political movements in terms of group solidarity. There are many cases in this regard, some produce movements and others produce lifestyles in society.Furthermore, everything I am trying to explain goes back to the aims and objectives that are used as a basis for politics and religion.",

Like you have rightly said those countries that are not dwelling on the side of religion are doing good because the people will go on the streets if those in leadership positions do not deliver promises they made during elections and if they don't provide good leadership and overall proper and accountable governance. But citizens of religious countries can't stand up to their government and force them to step down in their bad leadership but to all pray for help from God.
