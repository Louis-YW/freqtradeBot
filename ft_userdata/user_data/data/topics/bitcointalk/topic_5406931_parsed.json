A token becomes a coin when it has it's own Blockchain that other tokens can come under. The blockchain is a key determinant of the status of a crypto as either a token or a coin. Both the tokens and coins cannot exist outside a Blockchain, this is a notable similarity between them both as well",

If a token project gets a lot of usage, the users of that project would need the blockchain's coin to be able to do transactions, hence increasing demand of the native coin.",

It uses its own Blockchain and keeps track of the data, store value, validates transactions and keeps the Blockchain secure. They are used for governance, transactional fees and other related use cases.  Example: QuoteETH is the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum Blockchain, there are many other different tokens that also utilise the Ethereum Blockchain. Crypto tokens built on top of Ethereum include MATIC, LINK, andUSDT.What tranthidung said was right. There are many blockchain network that we have now like BSC, ERC20, Terra network, etc. and each of them has tokens created under their network. If the coin that supports that particular blockchain collapse, then the token under it will lose its value unless they create their own blockchain or migrate to a different network.",

I'm just asking out of curiosity.Yes thats possible. They just need to set up on a new chain like token swap for the tokens that are present on the old blockchain. Usually this is happening when the team decided to change their or expand their chain on others. I dont know which cases happened with this kind of scenario but if they are using main blockchain such as ethereum and bnb then its possible to die.",

They would pick big and trusted chains to start but big chains have own issues like overloaded, issues with scalability and transaction fees. Later, these teams have to gradually build up their own native blockchains and move their tokens to third party chain to their own one.It requires lot of resources to build it up, testing, audit etc. with lot of risk during a complicated progress.",
