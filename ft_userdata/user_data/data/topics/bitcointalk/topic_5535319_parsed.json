You can have just one job and be using 10 to 30% of your income to buy bitcoin every week or every time the price dip a little which occurs often. You do not need to have huge amount of money or multiple sources of income before you can DCA.Quote from: Pablo-wood on March 15, 2025, 12:10:47 PMNow for an average investor, one who is hoping to take profit soon, I don't mean those who have enough to spare.  It's best we don't lead people into regrets and pains with our contributions.

Of course not because everyone can and may do the DCA strategy in their own way and version. Even if it only lasts for a minimum of 1 or 2 years. For me DCA in any way will always be a great step to be appreciated.On the other hand investors have their own targets to find profit points and they clearly always take the method that has been planned long ago because money turnover is their priority to survive in market.",

I think you are mistaken. If you have huge capital, why don’t you just buy bitcoin all at once instead of doing DCA and potentially missing out on the best time to enter the market? People who might still be saving up but wants to buy bitcoin now are the ones who are implementing this strategy. Quote So my question is judging by the range market we currently experience is it every dip and average Bitcoin investor should buy?No one is forcing you to buy bitcoin at every dip but that would be ideal.

No one should copy others without understanding the strategy they adopt. Otherwise, frustration from their inability to utilize such strategy will set in. With DCA, it gets to a point if the market continues to dip that it doesn't make sense embarking on it anymore.

So my question is judging by the range market we currently experience is it every dip and average Bitcoin investor should buy?OP, what you need to understand is that it is not every time the dip market happens in the crypto market that an investor would have spare money to invest in Bitcoin. There will be times when the dip market happens, and there won't be an availability of funds in one's hands to spare at that time. The investor needs to wait till when they have funds at hand to spare. The funds at hand can come when the market has bounced back or fallen lower. It will then depend on them to choose what their next move would be. Buy Bitcoin at the price they met Bitcoin at, or wait a little longer for a dip fall",

DCA isn’t only for those who have huge capitals. while it’s true that DCA is for people who has other sources of income, even the average investors can also seize the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin using the DCA strategy, because it’s not about your financial status, but your decision not to attempt targeting he market, because like we already know, the market is super volatile and other strategies, including buying the DIP can be classified as attempting to time the market which can be sometimes misleading because you’d never know what the future of the market hold. What you feel is a DIP could turn out to be the highest price you’d see for the next few months and for one who is impatient, you could end up selling at a loss. So the same way you feel anyone (regardless of their financial status) can BUY the DIP, that’s exactly how it is for the DCA strategy, the only difference is that, the DCA strategy is way more safer that attempting to Time the market by waiting for a DIP before you make your move.",
