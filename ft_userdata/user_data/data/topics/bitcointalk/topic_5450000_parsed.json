  "content": "The great advent of Bitcoin provided decentralized finance to the world and sparked a movement of amazing decentralized innovation thereafter. However, countless regulatory hurdles exist, across all nations, due to the difficulty in linking both the ancient and new worlds, hindering the launch, adoption and, in some cases, operation of decentralized systems and the services built around said systems. It has become painfully clear that the world has been missing a proper regulatory environment providing safe-harbor for these projects. Joseon is the first legally recognized cyber nation-state. With conditional recognition from the Great Nation of Antigua in February 2022, later upgraded to full recognition in 2023, Joseon has been granted the opportunity to develop its own non-burdensome regulatory environment. This empowers us to provide safe harbor for creativity, nurture disruptive ideas, and foster a borderless environment for the cyber realm, without the limitations of traditional regulation.As a recognized nation-state, Joseon is also able to issue its own national fiat currency – which is also a blockchain cryptocurrency. This means that the Joseon Mun may operate as a foreign currency in certain other jurisdictions while still benefiting from the advantages and transparency of blockchain technology.Our MissionJoseon aspires to be a safe haven for cutting-edge technologies and breakthrough ideas by eliminating the regulatory barriers faced by innovators in the digital space to create a more fair, and free, world.DenizenshipJoseon provides \"Denizenship\" to anyone in the world. A \"Denizen\" is a special type of corporation that is limited to a single shareholder, cannot be transferred and is, also, limited to a single instantiation per person. This allows the physical person to separate the actions from that of the Denizen. The physical person acts as an agent of the Denizen -- and the Denizen is both incorporated under and subject to Joseon law, not the restrictive laws of the physical person. Also, Denizenship is free!Joseon Ministershttps://www.joseon.com/l/en-US/government/ministries-of-chosenJoseon Mun CoinOur national currency can be used to pay for business registration to domicile a company in Joseon.
