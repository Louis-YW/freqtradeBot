  "content": "Hey guys! I hope you're all doing well  With my latest release \"The Times Traveler\" I have created a crypto puzzle contest, disguised as a conceptual art piece. A hoard of loaded canvases with a design based on a sci-fi concept that alters the iconic January 3rd, 2009 THE TIMES front page layout.The secrets are hidden in plain sight! I will reveal one CLUE. Whoever is skilled enough tofind the secrets and successfully unlocks the key, claims all of the BTCits locked away inthe canvases! The winner gets the BTCits and bragging rights, and everyone still own'sa 100+ year fade resistant canvas of a conceptual art design with some history attached.(and of course, some BTCits attached as well, which I believe is a first.)Now that you understand the concept...On to the point!  The #002 Canvas Crypto Puzzle Contest!This is a feeler for the next crypto puzzle contest having an entry fee of 0.02BTC.01BTC per competitor would include registration fee, plus 16x20 canvas (shipping not included)The remaining .01BTC per contestant would go in escrow until ready for loading.With 21 contestants the grand prize for solving the puzzle would be 0.21BTC Obviously this is another concept designed around an iconic piece of bitcoin history,I do not own one  but the 2013 Gilt Silver is still one of my favorite crypto numismatics.Here is a sneak peek of the Casascius KEEP CALM and HODL#002 16x20 Canvas Crypto Puzzle Contest concept!Would some be signing up just to own a loaded and/or once loaded canvas?I mean, technically, I can't make competitors try to solve the puzzle...All thoughts and insights welcomed. Thanks for your time guys!",

Nice work!Thank you for the very kind words, Sir!¬† This is what I had wondered, would we have contestants that are more interested in owning one of the canvases than they are in solving the puzzle. I think that's pretty cool and certainly adds another layer of unpredictability regarding how long they will remain loaded / unsolved.Well, I will have an actual #001 prototype of this concept in hand tomorrow guys, I'm very excited to see how it turns out!
