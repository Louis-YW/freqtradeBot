  "content": "QuoteThe plans to scuttle the 2023 general election by removing the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, from office, failed on Wednesday, as the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) sitting in Garki, quashed the allegations of false asset declaration against him. The Court went ahead to bar security agencies from investigating Prof. Yakubu over his valid assets declaration. In the Originating Summons marked FCT/HC/GAR/CV/47/2022 by Somadina Uzoabaka against the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the Claimant sought, among other things, an order of mandatory injunction directing and compelling the INEC Chairman to recuse, excuse and exclude himself and or step down as the Chairman of INEC pending the investigation and consideration of the various allegations against him by the various law enforcement agencies. The plaintiff also sought an order of court stopping the INEC Chairman from holding or assuming any public office for a period of 10 years.Prof. Yakubu, who in his response to the allegations, furnished the court with several exhibits to show the sources of money for the purchase of the properties which the plaintiff alleged were illegally acquired and insisted that his asset declarations were validly done. In the judgment, Justice M. A. Hassan found that the declaration of assets by Prof. Yakubu was lawful, valid and in compliance with the law and that he cannot be investigated by any of the security agencies listed by the Claimant that should all investigate him. The judge declined to grant any of the 14 prayers of the claimant, declaring that the INEC Chairman cannot be removed over fabricated allegations of false asset declaration. The judge, therefore, dismissed the claims of the Claimant and allowed the Counter-claim of the INEC Chairman.Source: https://leadership.ng/court-stops-dss-police-ccb-from-investigating-inec-chairman-over-asset-declaration/Omo this election e no go easy ooo. The cabals are bent on doing everything it takes to swing power in their favour but God no go shame us, e go shock them. How una see this matter? Una think say the INEC chairman go frustrate their efforts with the introduction of BVAS in the forth coming election, or maybe dem don try to bribe am and him no gree or dem wan just instill fear in him so that him go dance to their tune? Another one wey dey pain me na DSS and misplaced priorities, wetin concern DSS with investigation and arrest?Some persons been don kick against the use of the BVAS and dem been don call for the resignation or removal of the INEC chairman from office as dem claim say Nigeria never dey ripe to use the technology. The BVAS machine get the potential to enhance electoral integrity and increase public confidence in electoral process as e go help checkmate many issues like falsification of votes, coalition of false results, snatching of result sheets, computational errors and many more.",

E fit be say na politics dem dey try to play with us thinking that they are against each other and before you know their plan don work out. The best solution to all these sagas na to turn out enmass during election day and cast votes and follow it up till announcement is made. With that, I think the rigging will be difficult for them.",
