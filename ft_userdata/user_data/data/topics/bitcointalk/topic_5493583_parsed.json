Wait until it has completelyshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run theinstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL ispossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Oldwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.CompatibilityBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systemsusing the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  BitcoinCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not asfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core onunsupported systems.Notable changesWallet#28994 wallet: skip BnB when SFFO is enabled#28920 wallet: birth time update during tx scanning#29176 wallet: Fix use-after-free in WalletBatch::EraseRecords#29510 wallet: getrawchangeaddress and getnewaddress failures should not affect keypools for descriptor walletsRPC#29003 rpc: fix getrawtransaction segfault#28784 rpc: keep .cookie file if it was not generatedLogs#29227 log mempool loading progressP2P and network changes#29200 net: create I2P sessions using both ECIES-X25519 and ElGamal encryption#29412 p2p: Don't process mutated blocks#29524 p2p: Don't consider blocks mutated if they don't connect to known prev blockBuild#29127 Use hardened runtime on macOS release builds.#29195 build: Fix -Xclang -internal-isystem optionCI#28992 ci: Use Ubuntu 24.04 Noble for asan,tsan,tidy,fuzz#29080 ci: Set HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK to avoid unrelated failures#29610 ci: Fix \"macOS native\" jobMiscellaneous#28391 refactor: Simplify CTxMempool/BlockAssembler fields, remove some external mapTx access#29179 test: wallet rescan with reorged parent + IsFromMe child in mempool#28791 snapshots: don't core dump when running -checkblockindex after loadtxoutset#29357 test: Drop x modifier in fsbridge::fopen call for MinGW builds#29529 fuzz: restrict fopencookie usage to Linux &amp; FreeBSDCreditsThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:dergoeggefanquakefurszyglozowGreg SandersHennadii StepanovJon AtackMarcoFalkeMark FriedenbachMartin ZumsandeMurchRoman Zeydestickies-vUdjinM6As well as to everyone that helped with translations onTransifex.",
