  "content": "Hello everyone. I am sorry for bringing up this topic here! Yesterday at 12pm my grandma had a brain stroke. She was suffering from diabetes for a long time. She was taking medicine and it was in control. But yesterday she fell ill all of a sudden. We immediately took her to the hospital. The doctor said that she had a stroke and brain hemorrhage was the cause of it. After that she lost all her senses. She can't even speak now.. not even opening her eyes... I'm full of tears right now. I don't know what to do... They asked for $2000+ for her treatment. I have already sold all my holdings and everything and yet I am unable to collect all the money. I have something around $1500+ right now in hand. But I will still need more. I have asked all my family friends and many have come forward to help me in this situation. But it's getting hard to collect the rest of the money. I have come here seeking for you guy's help as a last resort. I am shameful to bring this here. But I am left with no other choice. I'm asking everyone for a small favor. If I ever get the chances I will try to repay you all. But right now I need all the help I can get. So please guys.... Help me. I will always be in debt to you guys. Whatever amount you can help with will be appreciated... Even if you can't help, at least pray for her please. She's in a very critical condition. Edit: I have removed the address as suggested! Thank you for the advice.I will update this thread every now and then when I get free time..",

So I am not expecting much. Whatever help I get, it will be appreciated. Even if someone wants to give it as a loan, I will take it. I will repay them back for sure.",

I used to stay with my grandmother more than my mother. But suddenly one day my grandmother died, I still can't forget that day. I regret that day because I couldn't do anything for him and didn't get a chance to do anything.In fact, grandmothers understand what is missing in life.I am helping you with little money maybe it is not much but I helped you with what I had bro. Actually my income is very less I gave you all that I earned brother.Finally, it is a wish to God that your grandmother recovers soon and comes back to you and that your family can live happily together again",

I'm really busy and I won't be able to update much about the situation more frequently but I will update for sure. I haven't used the lending before and I have no collateral at this moment as I have sold everything. And he is from my local section and I have also made a post there too. I know I have been in this forum for a long and yet don't know how the lending process work. If you could give me a little bit of hint how to apply and what is required to get a loan it will be very helpful. I know this is begging and I am very shameful for that but as I said I'm trying to get help from everywhere I can. Please don't get this wrong. Also if I learned the process how to apply for a loan I will lock this topic. So please help me.",

Quote from: yahoo62278 on February 10, 2023, 10:48:57 PM@ALL, they are right in their decision to ask me to take down the addresses. Let's not all get butthurt by them trying to protect the forum. The responses in this thread are less than desirable but That's not on any of you, just the people who made them. It shows that certain people have a low opinion of me and that is their right. Everyone does not have to like me. Locking the thread is a bit much IMO as it is all factual info.There is also no need for theymos to comment. He hired the staff and stands by their opinion. That's how it should be. Rules are rules, LET IT BE. @tjtonmoy I'm sorry for everything you're going through, I know exactly what it's about, I went through it with my father, but unfortunately, this is not the way and it's probably better to lock this thread by yourself than to wait for something more drastic from the moderator.",

It's unlikely you'll be \"busy with the MRI\".  Generally only medical staff are allowed in the MRI room with patients during scans.  At most, you might hang out in the waiting area, fiddling with your phone.  So, either you're exaggerating or you're simply unaware of the protocols.

Thank you everyone! But, you did apply for a loan with @shasan just two days ago. (The day before your grandma supposedly had a stroke.) However, you later deleted that post and created this thread where you claim you do not know how to apply for a loan.  Is this just a coincidence?",
