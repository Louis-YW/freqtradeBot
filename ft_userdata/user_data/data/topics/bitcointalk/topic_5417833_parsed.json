  "content": "Last week, on the 14th of October, 2022, A Nigerian Man used 800 naira (which is equivalent to $1.072 in today's NGN/DOLLAR exchange rate) to bet on sports...He later won a whopping 38,317,137 Nigerian naira (which is equivalent to $51,363.454 in today's NGN/DOLLAR exchange rate).¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†....How luckier can one get?üòÅüòÅüòÅBelow is a quote of the entire articleQuoteAn unidentified man has become a multi-millionaire after placing a bet on sports betting site with only N800.The man, who instantly became a celebrity in a viral video, was seen with neigbhours trooping to the betting centre to confirm his N38million win after words spread out.The system screen showed the man placed the multiple bet on Friday, October 14, 2022 with N800 only and won N38,317,130.00After confirming his win, the man headed straight to the mosque to perform ‚ÄòSalat‚Äô (daily obligatory prayer for Muslims). The crowd that had gathered to confirm his win followed him to the mosque, kept hailing him even as he ignored them and carried on with ablution for his prayers.Here is the Reference link..., But please beware of too many ads on the website --this is why I decide to quote the whole article above.NOW, HERE IS MY REASON FOR MAKING THIS THREAD.. The book of proverbs(from the Bible) says \"A prudent(wise) man knows when to keep his mouth shut and when to speak\"Don't you all think that in the course of we trying to show off this kind of winnings to friends, families, colleagues etc, we end up drawing known and unknown enemies to ourselves?The heart of man is desperately wicked, Man destroy and kill his fellow man out of envy and jealousy, they celebrate your success with you in your front, but when you are not there, they device means to bring you down, or even kill you.I think people should learn to keep their success stories away from physical people, because as they joy and praise you physically, secretly, they might not be as much happy as they appear physically.If I am eager to share my success story, I prefer to do it online where no body knows me In person, like this forum, doing this offline with family, friends, colleagues, etc.. I think is too risky.What is or are your opinion(s) on this matter?",

Making huge wins like this is something that you cant really be that able to avoid when your name is known specially when you do play on a local betting place or something in related.In gambling, this is where people do always target on on which they are really making up some parlays but winning chance is really something that you cant really able to pull it off easily unless if you are really that extremely lucky.I was amazed that the winner or the guy had still mind off on praying up and never forgets his obligation and remain humble even if he do win up.YOu cant really avoid those people around not to get along with the crowd and you would definitely be famous in an instant.",

People that you don't know will become your friends because of one thing, they want to received some money from you because of your huge win.So I do agree that it's better to not open our mouth when we win big, no need to brag it out in the open because you don't know what's coming for you. Just live your regular lifestyle as if you didn't win any.",

If he has no investment plan, in a few years he might lose all the money on a lavish lifestyle or there is every tendency that he might gamble off all the money. What he needs right now is good financial advice from a professional. Buying bitcoin or investing in real estate would not be a bad investment.",
