It shows that miners deem the value of Bitcoin to still be the same, despite the fact that they are getting only half of the reward that was available, which could be an indication of an increase in the value from before the halving or an expected bull run.This does not mean that there is a direct correlation and that there would be an immediate impact on the market if that happens, but it would influence trader sentiments",

Rather, I am referring to how hard bitcoin would be as a money/asset, purely from an economics perspective. Thank you very much. While the miners will get half of the block rewards (plus probably same transaction fees, let's not forget) for the same amount of work (and spent electricity) since you said that the difficulty won't increase, this doesn't necessarily mean that the price on the exchanges will double. It's not only the miners who are selling bitcoin.It should have an effect, but it's not easy to predict how big that effect will be. As said, there's no direct correlation. On the other hand, if we go by the s2f model, the price should get to some 3.5x current value (so much \"stronger\" than what you say).Even more, that price is usually counted in gradually, it doesn't happen in the second (or day, or week) of the halving.",

At least this is how I've read/understood your question \"will bitcoin be 2x more expensive than now?\"My understanding of what happened on Reddit is that the misunderstanding was indeed due to the word \"hard\". Many in the Bitcoin community automatically associate this word with the difficulty of the SHA-256 problem one needs to solve in order to mine a block. Therefore, many of the answers were \"no, the puzzle will only become harder if the hash-rate increases\". Expensive may be a better word, but that has connotations with market value, which, as said before, is not solely decided by miners. Perhaps \"the cost of producing 1 bitcoin\", is the best phrase.

No one can answer you that it is Yes or it is No because you are talking about future. Who knows what will happen in future?QuoteAm I correct in saying that if the hashrate were to remain the same, bitcoin will be 2x as hard after the 2024 halving as it is now?You can check past halvings and Bitcoin makes its new all time highs after each of past three halvings. Future halvings, will Bitcoin repeat it? If it does as the past halvings, it will make new all time highs after future halvings. However, we can not say it will certainly happen. In addition, making a new all time high is probably but making new all time highs that are 2x of past all time high is harder. It is possibly too but harder to achieve.QuoteRather, I am referring to how hard bitcoin would be as a money/asset, purely from an economics perspective. It can be both.

Actually, that's impossible to happen that you can see hashrate today will be the same until 2024. I'm sure if blockhalving is coming there are more people who will mine because they know the bull market is coming. And the result is not instant since 2024 is the year of blockhalving it will take months or a year to see the price increase due to demand and supply. I think the question you actually want is that \"if the demand today is the same after 2024 blockhalving, Bitcoin will be 2x more expensive than the last year ATH\"?If you talking about the hashrate and difficulty then the difficulty will stay the same but if hashrate increases the difficulty is also increasing. Like they said the higher the difficulty, the more secure.And mining difficulty is maintained 10 minutes duration for finding new blocks if the network hashrate increases miner will mine blocks lower than 10 minutes duration if it happens then the difficulty will automatically adjust so it will increase just to maintain the 10 minutes duration in finding blocks.",

Well, to start from the base.We all know that every halving reduces the amount of Bitcoins miner are able to mine per block, this makes Bitcoin scarcer for the miners in particular, this can actually influence the price of Bitcoin in the open market in several ways, and one of those ways is sentiment, that is investors or traders sentiments, they think that since Bitcoin has become scarcer for the miners, they probably would not want to sell their mined Bitcoins cheaply in price, then they begin to buy in anticipation for a bull run, I believe this explains why Bitcoin price always goes through the roof mostly when halving is approaching and sometimes, immediately after the halving too.",

There could be many different possibilities for this question and future of bitcoin in correlation with the halving. Block halving is big event for miner, the reward is halved from the current reward structure and this is happening since bitcoin was first mined. This means it’s continually halving each time, and by so far it’s reduced to minimal. Thus to keep up the race of mining profitable usually miners will increase the power of hashing (by adding more miners) and thus ROI shifts further. However they will always sell bitcoins prior to halving causing massive dump (so that miners can profit before it’s bearish). In the process world wide buying surge starts and bitcoin slowly pushes itself towards new arena of high price asset. This is what can be seen from the historical charts. So price mostly will go up if that’s what you wanna know.",
