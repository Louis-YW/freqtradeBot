What is more important is how reputable this can be, if you have a pilot phase for users to review or to check on reviews done on your website. We have had some scam project here and people are careful to sign up to new startups. But of course it will be nice to check your analysis and perhaps predictions to support our analysis.",

By the way, welcome to the forum.Hey, Rose may have forgotten to mention that he is one of the reputable campaigns and another promotional marketing manager here in the forum,  and if SportScore needs to expose their platform through any of the offer-mentioned means of promotion. @SportScore you can contact Rose if you want to have a review campaign which is the best for of promotion for you when you eventually launch your sportbooking feature,  because having a review campaign will allow you have real time testers of your platforms there after give their reviews and suggestions on the features and operation of the site.",

I normally use livescore.in to check stats of a match and and also to check live scores but I don’t mind scraping off that one to use your own, I’m not really in now for sport betting so I don’t really need the odd feature for now but I could utilise for scores and analytics.",

I noticed too  you do not have African league live scores feature too. If you can do that then it would be nice.For your promotion and advertisement, you can contact Royse777 as he is well known and amongst the reputable managers we have here on this platform.

Blockchain Sport booking!Welcome to the forum mate. To be honest the features that site is currently providing can be found in all crypto casinos where sportsbetting is offered. Even they providing better facilities like Live stream and live scoreboard and real time updation of the odds. So why does people will need a site like this? Yes maybe if you offer something unique then definitely people will come to the site and use the features. But currently I feel there is no need of such a site.",

I'm guessing they are going to ask for a fee when it's all done when the site provides helpful data to its users. It's just for football for now. It needs to pull out more data from its sources. It'd be interesting if they had tutorials on how fans are going to make use of the data. Anyway welcome to bitcointalk.",

      "body": "First of all your welcome to the forum. Your site is good because it looks like LiveScore website for sports. When I click the link through the image and navigate the site, it is very nice and there are no too much things like LiveScore. And in the present as I checked the site almost all the games in the site are going on. Some of them are halftime, some just 2minutes ago, and some 44 minutes. And all the stats in the game are showing so if you don't want to watch it through hall, you can just use this site to monitor the match. Op but I have few questions about the site. As others said I also didn't see any button to click and register so how do you make money from this website because the way I look at it it is a free service you're rendering here for people to view the match score that is going on in the La Liga sport and others. So what is the reason for the ANNOUNCEMENT thread? Or do you want to launch a Campaign Thread?",

Do you have any specific timeline when are you going to add other sports and probably E-sports as I think many of us here are also interested with other sports, this could be really handy to analyze some upcoming games or just to get information on a certain match.I can see that there's still a lot of things to be added (matches) but regarding the information that you needed such as matchup history, h2h and other information  are already present so I think that was really a good startP.S. I have a question regarding your airdrop, are you dropping your own token? (do you have own token?)",
