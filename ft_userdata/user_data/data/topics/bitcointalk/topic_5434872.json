There's no improvement from Vitalik Butterin to solve the scalability issue, they're not creating a second layer and other thing. He seems to be agree if ETH is using the other centralized network e.g. BSC, polygon etc that can't be controlled by them.Any crypto is flexible because it can be transferred to any address regardless which city or country of the holder is.Talking about energy efficient doesn't really that important since any business will use energy, the bigger the business/project = the bigger the energy consumption.",

Majority of the financial scams and hacking incidents involve bitcoin. Does it matter? It's a very wrong statement and unrelated to the subject of the thread. POS is definitely more centralized in nature than POW coins. Also POW coins have a production cost unlike POS coins. But that doesn't make ETH look bad. It is a steller performer since the day it was launched. If you don't trust ETH, that's fine! But ETH is equally a great investment like bitcoin.",

There are probably many other reasons why I believe proof of stake is terrible but these are a few I can think of right now. 1. I don't think that's entirely accurate. Just like Bitcoin's PoW, Ethereum has a fixed reward per block and a target block time. On average over a long period of time, it should hit these averages. 2. Bad actors using/building on a non-restricted blockchain doesn't necessarily mean that the mainnet blockchain itself is a scam.3. No argument on unregistered securities. Though just because it takes no effort to generate coins, doesn't mean that it's not economically sound in the long term. Time will tell! 4. Well, you don't know that for sure. Miners have a lot of power and to say that they are a large and distributed group of people at this point would be quite naive. Maybe there are more groups and it doesn't come under one group or founder, but I definitely would not say that \"elitisim\" doesn't exist in Bitcoin.Proof of Stake is another consensus method. It's not terrible in the way Ethereum has implemented it, time will tell if it can keep up with Bitcoin though.",

      "body": "Another thing I believe is very bad about Proof of Stake...is the staking. You are giving up your private keys to stake your coins to a staking pool that you have to trust to give your keys back when you want to unstake. So much for self custody. Why anyone would want to stake ethereum is beyond me, especially after the collapse of companies like Blockfi and Celsius where customers lost millions worth of their staked funds. I would not be able to sleep at night with my funds staked in such a way. Not your keys not your coins. This just totally goes against the concept of decentralization IMO.It may be possible to stake ethereum without using a staking pool and keep your private keys but from what I understand this is very difficult, and beyond the technical ability of the average person.

After the collapse of  FTX and others it appears much stronger regulations are on the way soon in the US that would officially classify ethereum and most every other altcoin as a security. Which could then likely cause the price of eth to drop like a stone. Proof of stake is still a new and unproven concept and I do not want to be the guinea pig to see how it plays out in the future.",

It seems you cannot counter my statements so you resort to personal attacks. Which just proves my point. If you feel otherwise then you have to provide some credible reasons to support your position instead of personal attacks which to me is a sign of your desperation.",

It's pretty hard to talk about PoS without mentioning ethereum since it is the biggest crypto that uses PoS. I think most people are thinking PoS must be better just because it seems to be the latest technology that improves upon the older protocol but without really understanding the drawbacks. Proof of stake does have some advantages such as energy use. Yes it uses a lot less energy than proof of work, but so do bicycles.

Better still, you can't take part in proper Governance and/or Consensus if you don't have alot of money, and this kind of make power reside in the hands of few like your number 4 point suggest. That is the typical corruption you see in third world countries... The kind of 3rd world corruption that force the subjects to rise up against ruling elites who allowed or invented such corrupt way of governance. In regards to your number 3 point, solving problems or generating money/value requires energy, but PoS people don't seem to like that too much. They seem to want a system that make them alot of money without working hard or consuming the amount of energy that is needed to make the money. They can't escape this unless they build devices that use energy efficiently without compromising on hardwork",
