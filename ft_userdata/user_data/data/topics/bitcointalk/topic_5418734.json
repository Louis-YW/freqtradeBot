Also do not expect its price to go down to $10000, I think bitcoin getting to $10000 is now the story of the past, guess it would only be in history. Presently people are buying more and the price increased recently, maybe it's a bull trap or not, but holding at $20000 would be good, or better to just DCA.",

In the future, and especially closer to and after the next halving, why not!? I also don't believe a new 50% drop to $10k is to be expected unless something drastically changes and the world governments start turning against Bitcoin. With that I mean, whole countries prohibiting its use, trading, or the mining aspect of it. A big drop could also happen if we witness another case like with Celsius, where the platform starts liquidating big chunks of BTC in an attempt to stay afloat. Bad news attracts more bad news, which results in sell-offs.",

But when crypto market Is involved it's absolutely unpredictable, Market violation is absolutely unpredictable, so there's possibility of everything, of both sequence happening. But to my own honest opinion, I don't see Bitcoin going to 10k any time soon nor 60k anytime soon",

I don't think this year would end with Bitcoin falling half of its price today. But I also don't think it would rise back to $60,000. That's wishful thinking.",

Regardless if I have an technical analysis for bitcoin market, I believe it will not get as high as $60k in this year unless some significant event happen. Above all, I think it's still one of the best time for acquiring bitcoin before it reaches it's new ATH.",

Bad news can lead to bad news, so unless there's a bad news event globally(which triggers panic selling), that can only drop Bitcoin to $10k. In my opinion, expecting Bitcoin to drop to $10,000 is a thing of the past (as stated by @charles-Tim as well). If you are hoping to buy Bitcoin at $10k, I think that might not be possible. $20k is a good position to hold. In the crypto market, good news can also bring about a spike in price, but if you ask me, I don't think Bitcoin will get to $60k or fall below $10k this year.I am not a crypto expert, so this is just my opinion and should not be considered financial advice.Thank you, Dr.B_S ðŸ’Œ",

Let discussIf you are looking for a perfect dip entry, then you will miss it, my friend. No one knows the future so for the question of whether 10k is possible or not I will say yes it is possible. But another question will you buy BTC if it goes to that price? It's a 50% drop and to drag BTC to that level requires nasty lousy news to release. And trust me if something like that happens most people who were waiting for 10k won't buy at that price by thinking it will go much lower because of the weight of that bad news. It will be better not to gamble and be on the safe side. If you really haven't taken entry then you could start doing it right now small by small. If BTC goes that far you will simply DCA.",

Let discussDowns and ups are still very possible for Bitcoin this year. Because basically these two things are things that have happened very often in Bitcoin and even some people have considered it a natural and normal thing. And actually those two things (Down and Up) are things that are both needed by investors and traders in the market, because they will not benefit if they don't buy at a lower price, so a decline is clearly needed in order to make purchases and benefit when upgrades occur.",

Let discussIt might or might not, we really don't know. If it goes down to $10k, what will be your strategy? are you going to buy or not? that is the big question here.As for $60k this year, it's already out of the question. If by chance we will go there, we need x3 of the current price and I don't think it's achievable at this point as we are in a bearish sentiments.The catalyst for a eventual bull run is the halving, which is going to happen in 2024. So still very far if you are looking for a massive run. On the other hand, while waiting for it, all you can do is invest and buy and accumulate and then HODL.",

Let discussYour levels (both up and down) are just unrealistic this year anymore, you should not even dream about them. You should know that this year is about to round up with barely 2 months remaining, nothing so significant could happen on the bullish and bearish side. As for the selling, inflation was a major factor that influenced that this year, but this is changing now as inflation has price-in for the year already, it would not cause a further fall below the low of June at $19,625.00.I prefer a bullish trend for the rest of the year, yet, the Bulls cannot succeed above $35,000 according to my economic and technical studies of the coin.",
