      "body": "Only a few people know about web3 and it is not fully developed yet unlike web2 maybe if more people found web3 I'm sure they will come to use web3 due to ownership and decentralization.I believe if more blockchain games produce gamers would choose to use web3 because they own items they bought unlike games on web2 if you bought an item/weapons/anything and then your account is banned you can't use or transfer the item anymore. That's the big thing that I want in web3 decentralized and ownership.",

The current \"valid\" use-cases that actually works are only mostly trading and speculation(DEXs, perps, etc). As for the 99% of others? Nah, most of those don't even need to be using a blockchain.",

Also, you can't expect companies just transition from web2 to web3, they have process and it takes a lot of money resources to do that which is need of considerations.For common users, well, not everyone even knows what is decentralized and blockchain. Going there without understand things is suicide.",

The likes of League of Legends and Valorant having skins totally untradable seems to be racking them a good amount of money. The incentives are simply better.",

But if the online game is still centralized (e.g. server to handle interaction between player and host game asset), can't they just blacklist account/wallet address which use digital item from banned player?They shouldn't have the right to blacklist accounts/wallets of their players unless it was from fraud and violates the terms of service of that centralized game if it happens it was only blacklisted on their platform but the digital item is still on their wallet and can be still transferred to another wallet. No one would buy this item, I'm sure because it's blocklisted/banned on that game however, you still own the item and anytime you can transfer it to another wallet.",

Most web3-related content I've seen either requires someone to pay for it through tokens, or just plain concepts on how it will shape the 'internet of the future' or something like that. Right now though the rest of the world is still in web2 and is doing fine. Web3 is just a term used by coin develoeprs to hype what they are going to release and nothing else.",

Since decentralization demands transparency and is not regulated, it is a difficult problem for developers to earn \"money\" without burdening users or not even realizing that they have to pay. So in their implementation, they have to use a little centralized way.",
