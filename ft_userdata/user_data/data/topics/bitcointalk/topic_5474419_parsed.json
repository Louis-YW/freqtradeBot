I have a good reason for asking this question, because there is something I saw not too long and I am doubting if anyone have seen the same thing, I am from a place where crack heads ( drugs addicts ) and also gambling addicts are all around, here is what I've seen. I have seen crack heads more than responsible with there cash, than gambling addicts, this is what make me to ask you guys this question, drug junks are more responsible than gamblers, I have seen a gambling addict who spend 200 grand in under one and half hour on gambling, I've never seen a crack head done such before, not even on drugs.I have seen a crack head who changed and when we had some chats he thank God in front of me, saying he is thankful that is addiction was on drugs and not gambling, he sounds so scary of getting addicted to gambling as he confirmed that gambling seems so much harder to quit. He went on and say something about his friend who use 15 years on gambling and the friend isn't really sure how he will stop and the friend said that if he didn't stop it will kill him sooner or later, like he knew the danger lurking but he doesn't know how to stop, he isn't sure he will get better. The friend started telling him how the world will be better off without him, that's when they started locking him up, and the battle to change him when on for four years straight before he died from strange illness.I was so scared with this story and It affected me for a while, I stopped gambling for a week because of what I heard from this man, his appearance is that of someone you won't want to listen to but what he went through is so eye opening that if other addicted gamblers hear from him it could change them, gambling addiction is really scary.",

That is not true at all and it is a super distant mistake as some people say.I know drug addicts who have given their wife,mother,sister for sex just to buy drugs and while gamblers also the most addicted of all have given their wives in extreme cases I don't know any case where they have given the sister or mother to do just that,this as the best analogy to make it clear that there are no worse people on the planet than drug addicts and comparing gamblers to them I took it as a heavy personal offense as I am also a gambler although not addicted.Crack heads are never ever more responsible than gamblers,they sell their house,threat people for money and also the above things which are the worse.",

Both mean you just can't stop, no matter how bad you wanna.  With drugs, getting hooked is part physical - your body needs that fix.  Gambling's different cuz it's all in your head. The main thing is, addicts are always chasing after that high or rush they get from their habit, whether its drugs gambling, or something else.Quote from: Z390 on November 17, 2023, 07:39:11 AM<...>I was so scared with this story and It affected me for a while, I stopped gambling for a week because of what I heard from this man, his appearance is that of someone you won't want to listen to but what he went through is so eye opening that if other addicted gamblers hear from him it could change them, gambling addiction is really scary.

Of course, both of them are bad, being an addict is bad in any way so I don't think that you can really choose between the two. Even if gamblers can spend $200k in one night, the end result will be the same, that is you ruin your life and it's going to be very difficult to recover from any of them, and worst, it can lead to death.So in any case, if we have friends or someone who are close to us like family members, if we really care for them, we should tell them to stay away from both addiction and there a lot of time to make a U-turn for the better.",

In the end all addicts commit crime go to the extreme to satisfy thier addiction. An addict is an addict regardless of the kind of addiction they have. That's true, Any kind of addiction has a negative impact to a person, and for me, anything that related to drugs is the worst addiction because we all know what a person can do under the influence of it, unlike in gambling that it affects someones finances and health as well but with a minimal danger to the point that it will not cause any harm and danger to other people but it depends and case to case basis, sometimes having a gambling addiction can lead a  behavior to a person just like the behavior of a person who's under the influence of drugs and alcohol.",

Even if I am saying this though, I do think that we can learn a lot from this people because their experience is somewhat unique to us normal people that did not experience those stuff so definitely a lot of things can still be learned from that. In my experience, gambling is worse for the people around the gambling addict but drugs is bad for those even outside the immediate family of the addicts because they resort to crime to sustain their addiction and they are most likely to kill themselves depending on the drugs that they are addicted with heroin having the most kills I think.",

It is what you do that you don't have control over and so it leads your life for you.Therefore, both have their own different effect to the person who is addicted but on a different degree but I don't agree that drug addiction is a lesser addiction to gambling addiction. Even to the society, the government mostly go after those crackheads and the major reason for drug addiction being bad is that it has direct negative effect on the person's health as a primary effect. Then a drug addict can take his or life directly and the life of others too. We have seen and heard of many popular personalities and public figures, musicians dying from drug addiction but at least for a longtime I have not heard of an addict gambler taking his life or that of others, I have seen them cry for losing their money , showing regrets for playing. So what we have to consider most in both is the primary effect. One is to the health and resulting to the death of the addict or causing death for another person. And for the gambler, he cries, regrets and keep trying to chase his loses, so he loses money majorly but not his life in most cases unlike the crackheads.",

Gambling can be very dangerous too but your chances of reversing the damages are way greater if you decide to be rehabilitated. Depending on the type of the drug and for how long it was used, one might recover from drug addiction completely too. The longer you get drugged the harder the recovery process becomes and your body will have to endure some irreversible health problems till the day you finally die. To be on the safer side, just don’t get addicted to both and never ever do drugs because some of them bichez can ruin you even if you try it once.",

Addiction is synonymous with badness, in my opinion these two things have a big bad impact and are dangerous. Addiction to these two things is just as bad, it can bring bad effects and dangerous impacts to those who are addicted. First, gambling addiction, those who are addicted to gambling will continue to feel dissatisfied with the pa they get in gambling, win or lose they will feel dissatisfied with the end result, it is difficult to get rid of gambling addiction. and if they are already addicted, when they run out of capital they will do everything to be able to play again, one of which is by borrowing funds from their friends or making online loans. of course this will harm them on the basis that most likely they will not be able to pay off their debts because of gambling that does not guarantee victory.Second. Drug addiction is the same as gambling addiction, it has a bad impact on the health of the younger generation which can damage organs such as the lungs, liver. and worse it can damage their brains so that their thinking will be damaged by drugs. and it could also be that they commit crimes that harm other people who don't know anything.",

What you heard was someone's personal opinion or experience, so you cannot conclude or generalise that it is correct. I don't like any form of addiction because all of them are harmful but from research and observation drug addiction is not a behaviour disorder to play with. If you know how much it costs drug addicts to satisfy their daily urges, you might reconsider your stance. Have you considered the health implications of drug addictions and in some cases, they end up in prisons? I have seen many people who have been destroyed by both gambling and substance addiction so I don't think anyone is better. Regarding which one is easier to quit I think it also depends on individual differences. It might be easier for you to stop drug addiction, but it will be difficult to stop another form of addiction.

Well, of course, it's drugs. Drugs are a banned substance that causes people to change their personality, seriously damaging their health. But its excitement makes it difficult for players to give up. As for gambling addiction, we will have many ways to overcome it, and we just need to be determined to quit. But the important thing here is that Drugs have been banned for a long time, so the possibility of players getting addicted is less. As gambling is being legalized and gradually approved by the government, there will be more addicts than drugs. I want to ask you the opposite: if drugs are legalized, then drugs and gambling, which game will the higher proportion of people play?",

The more he continues gambling, the deeper he gets into this addiction. Aside from that, it's considered a cognitively based attitude that characterizes gamblers causing them to have a negativity with their belief about their own ability to win at gambling. The more reason why they will keep on playing to reverse this kind of thinking.
