One, because most of the time, it is a polyfill and not implemented as some C++ library - and all web apps fall into this category - so since there's a lot of math that goes into this it's quite slow. Two, you can't multi-thread it or take advantage of hardware acceleration that might be available.",

I mean, this is literally assembly language after all, it just runs on the browser's engine instead of on an OS.",
