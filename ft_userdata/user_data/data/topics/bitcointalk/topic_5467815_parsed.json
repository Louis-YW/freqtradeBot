The forum consist of different people from different diversity, so expecting a polite approach from everyone would be a waste of time. If you find a members word abusive or offensive, as long as you aren't wrong just ignore them. In no time, you will notice that other members will defend you on that same issue so there's nothing to be angry about. Nija board is home for us all, and as long as we maintain peace, we will live as one here on Bitcointalk. Ignore those offensive words and move on it's very simple.",
