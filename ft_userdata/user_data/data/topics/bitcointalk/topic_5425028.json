I think this is very easy, and if the campaign manager does not respond to you, he can be accused at that time .",

Please help me @allI lost my faith in Bounties back in 2017. Every single bounty I have managed has a minimum of 200 cheaters it seems. Messages daily about this guy stole this, this guy copied that, blah blah blah. It's probably the saddest thing in the world when dealing with videos and blogs in a bounty. The way to prove you own an account IMO is talk to the manager, tell him to give you a word to write and write it on your video in the description section. Don't discuss it openly, just talk privately. Same thing for an article or blog. When the manager sees the keyword, he will know you control the account and can mark anyone else using your link as cheaters. Best thing is stop doing bounties honestly. You're gonna be disappointed more often than happy.",

I'm not sure if every article I have checked was original or not but spending few hours would get the most common copy/paste author out of the pool. The problem is project owner hire campaign manager with small weekly/monthly payment which bring the worst quality in the campaign. Such campaign manager barely check the copy paste article. They simply give stake to them without checking the article throughly.",
