I hope you have something that you do plan to achieve in 2022 as your resolution for the new year entering into the year 2021 to 2022. The reality is that you are checking if you get those plan of yours or not but what I have to let you know is if you achieve the things, you should thank God for it because it is not into your power that you have them it is the grace of God , so be thankful. If you didn't have that achievement you plan my advise to you is don't give up your hope for what plan you have because 2023 is another opportunity year for you to try on again. You review yourself to know the reason for not having that your achievement.Don't lose your hope to be greatDon't lose your hope to be great because hard times make for you to be tough.How many times that you have fall will not determine your future so keep trying.This is my new year message to everyone.",

      "body": "It's good to look back from time to time to see how many of your goals you have been able to achieve. For me the one thing that bothers me is that I wanted to learn a new 3D and simulation software but I've only managed to get over the basics since I've been so busy this year.The good news for me is that there is still 79 days left until new year  Yeah we Persians celebrate new year on first day of spring (when it makes sense)  so I can still finish my learning journey and start next year to master this software.Happy New Year.",

This is close like a quarter of a year and a whole plenty of time to accomplish it. I wish you not be lazy about it and finish up your plan for yourself because you will get happy if you achieve it.",

Well, I can say that I agree with the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, when he said \"What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger\" I am sure ending this year tired, stronger, wiser and better. We go again in 2023.",

I am not sure there was any loss of life this year despite how heart breaking crypto assets went including exchanges that crumbled peoples hard earned sweat. 2022 is a year full of so much lesson preparing us for something bigger in 2023 it will take only preparation to utilise all the opportunities 2023 will offer.",

Its not been easy though through out last year,  atleast i can just encourage myself on the things i achieved but my greatest loss and dissapointment last year was loosing someone very close to me and this affected me but I thank God like you said OP because it was just by his grace that I was able to still be strong until this wonderful moments of the new year. Most of my plans were affected very badly by flood and it also took a soul from me.  The flood in my region had a big change in me.  i had to relocate to whole new ecosystem for a fresh start but notwithstanding we are still kicking and am hoping to achieve all my goals this year.",
