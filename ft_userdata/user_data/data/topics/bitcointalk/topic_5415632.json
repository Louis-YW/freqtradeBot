  "content": "ðŸŽƒ Fall is upon us here in the US, and with fall comes Halloween and pumpkin EVERYTHING (pie, lattes, candles, candies, even canned ham pumpkin spam lol).Â  Â I proposed a bitcoin pumpkin carving contest a few years ago and got some participation/feedback but kind of posted it too late and nothing materialized of it ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5192115.msg52727116#msg52727116 ). So with that said, I wanted to get an interest check and see how many people would be interested in participating. I would put up some pretty cool prizes for the winner. Im not 100% sure yet what I would put up prize wise, but I can promise it would be worth your time, plus , itâ€™s fun! I know pumpkins donâ€™t grow all over the world so any other type of gourds would be acceptable as well (or doing a mix of both even, be creative!). If thereâ€™s enough interest I will follow up with an official thread..so what say you .. ðŸŽƒ Other types of gourd examples",

The only rule is that there has to be a pumpkin or gourd of some type included. What you want to do in conjunction with that is up to you. 3D printed stuff, NFTs, etc etc.I will set up the announcement thread tomorrow. Again I will have some cool prizes! Hopefully more people will be interested in jump in!",
