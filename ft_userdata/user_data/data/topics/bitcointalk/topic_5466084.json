Buying now or starting to DCA now are all good because bitcoin price for now is not high at all and you are only buying the dip.Quote from: Makus on September 08, 2023, 07:25:21 AMReason for all these questioning, I have a dream of becoming a long term bitcoin holder but, dreams aren't achieved with words alone, an action is needed for the start up, so I have decided to sell one of my less used phone for the purpose of buying bitcoin.I'm really eager to purchase my first bitcoin in satoshi.If your old phone is not useful for you anymore, you can sell it to buy bitcoin because your phone will continue to become old and the price will become less as it becomes more old.",

But the time duration I always see in recommendation is from two years to five years. This is my first time of seeing a whooping 10-years advised of Bitcoin. Mate, I think 10 years is so long that you cannot tell if many of us will be alive and how about if bitcoin will not last upto the 10 years?Â  Everything is possible. 10 years will give you two times halving and two times bull run. Only one time bull run should be able to give you an expected profit and you will start again for another bull run.",

But you can also buy it now if you want.And if you can accept the risk of falling and increasing the price of Bitcoin, that's great and that means you're ready to start investing in Bitcoin. And it's true. It takes real action to start investing in Bitcoin.Once you have your first Bitcoin, you need to be able to manage your emotions because you will start to see Bitcoin price changes. It can give you all the feels so you have to be able to keep it unaffected by anything to become a longtime Bitcoin holder.",

No one can tell you with certainty to wait or to act now, because the price of BTC is almost completely unpredictable and can go in any direction. If you wait, you have a chance to buy cheaper, but also that the dip you are thinking about never happens.In addition, as far as I understand, you plan to buy a small amount of BTC to start with, and then it doesn't matter too much whether the price is $20k or $25k - try to calculate it and you will see if there is a reason to wait or buy today.What is perhaps more important in the whole story is whether you have taken care of the safe storage of what you are going to buy.",

Looks like you have a pretty good idea about Bitcoin. You probably have a good idea when to buy Bitcoin. No one can accurately predict when the price of Bitcoin will go down. I think, now is a good time to buy Bitcoin. At the moment bitcoin price is 26k, it can be a good opportunity for you. If you wait for the price to drop further, that's up to you. You buy bitcoins and hold them for a long time. Bitcoin halving day in 2024, expect bitcoin price to double in 2025.",

The market is unpredictable and as you can see it has taken a dive to $25k, it can also retrace anytime to $30k or more. So there's no better time to buy and hold than now. Whenever you have money you can still be doing DCA and be stacking your bitcoin. When the bull season finally comes and you sell your bitcoin, you will certainly get more than the money you invested and get to buy a better phone or whatever you want.",

What matters is watching how the market price is moving. Whatever happens when you invest, if it occur to be losses, nothing can be done about it. That's why, it's advisable to invest what you are able to lose. It's not a get rich quick scheme. One thing for sure, the price will increase or decrease, if you want to profit do not fidget when the price goes down. Keep on holding on to it. Many investors still hold their bitcoin regardless of the market price. I'd say it's a good decision and a lot to learn from the investment. The best time to invest, can't be predicted. The chance of correctly predicting such, is low.",

The next halving would happen next year and the price will surge up and might go beyond the 69K mark. You would get good return if you are able to hold it for that long. If you continue to hold for long term then there is no limit. Another good thing that you are doing is that you are selling an old phone which you do not use. That means you are investing with the money that you can forget for a long time. It is a great investment policy and I would say you did a proper research with the help of forum members.

Currently, the market is down and from the looks, this is the right time to buy more as a matter of fact, halving is around the corner so it would be of huge benefit for you now because if you are buying to hold for a long term, at least with few months from now when halving is over, you could make some reasonable amount of profit from your little investment.I will advise you to know this \"not your keys not your coin\" do well to keep your investment under your custody for your own safety. Third parties are good but can not be trusted with your funds and assets. Of what difference is it you holding your assets and keeping it with Â a third party when they add no interest Â for you other than you trading with it or activating a savings function which they could use to make more profit for themselves and give you peanut at the end.

Mind you that it is wrong to sell properties just to buy Bitcoin, you might be selling something of less value to you right now, but who knows what you'll sell next, it could prolly be something valuable.

Since if the selling price is low then you might just waste your time buying bitcoin now and hold it for long term since this action is best to do by investors who have big capital to spend. Since they can decently earn a lot even if the percentage of the movement is low.

You should make the same decision when you think about other alternate investments also.Instead or selling goods, idea I personally like as a first step towards a minimalistic life, you can also think about investing your time. But, again, your time has a value, so you have to decide which is the best opportunity among the existing ones (spend time, spend money, liquidate your goods, invest in traditional assets or altcoins instead, or simply save).",
