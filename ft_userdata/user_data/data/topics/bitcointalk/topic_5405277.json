Obviously the government would have no power over people accepting BTC for their goods and services (other than intimidating people with punishments, if caught). The idea here is good, but fiat plays a vital role in the business chain. The vendor accepts bitcoin, maybe a wholesaler, but the producer may not be a bitcoin trader. It brings forth a barrier to the business chain of such a vendor. The government will have no such power. However, they are always a means to cut side into other people's businesses, and the government is a part of such practice. Consider other valuable assets like gold, silver, and other country currencies being changed to fiat in different countries to ease the circulation of money. The peer2peer bitcoin traders that change bitcoin to fiat for-profits can't be erased from the market. I don't think such an idea will happen soon, as many people are involved in the market, including the same government you dodge.",

      "body": "Most people more convenient to coupling Bitcoin price to fiat since fiat price is stable, even though it always inflate. At least fiat price doesn't change 10% in a day, the price is slowly decreased without anyone noticing it after a year or few years. If fiat price isn't stable, many people will panic and think the price is controlled by the government, they can do anything to control the price. Coupling Bitcoin to fiat isn't a mistake, but we're not ready to see any price in Bitcoin due to high volatility.",

This can change, but before this Bitcoin needs to be an estabilished store of value and medium of exchange. Its just the natural evolution of money. Its only a practical unit of account when the world adopted it. We gotta be patient here.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on July 05, 2022, 02:11:43 PMBitcoin is bought and sold with fiat since the beginning. Was that a tragic misstep in the evolution of Bitcoin?Nope, its the process every good that wanna become money has to go trough. Most people wouldnt even have the chance to acquire Bitcoin otherwise, leading to no significant adoption. Theres also no practical benefit to account in Bitcoin right from the beginning, when only a tiny minority does it, so patience, this will change with adoption.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on July 05, 2022, 02:11:43 PMWould we have it better if all governments outright banned the purchase/sale of BTC with fiat? They cant really ban it, they can prevent services to build around Bitcoin, but thats it. It would have probably slowed things down. All the bad these exchanges are doing is also a reason for more people to improve their security practices and a real world example of what centralization leads to. Its like an immune system that adapts, it becomes stronger if you challenge it regularly, so nah i dont think it wouldve been better.

Obviously the government would have no power over people accepting BTC for their goods and services (other than intimidating people with punishments, if caught).We have this fiat-decoupled version already, because it never existed in the first place. The common money is still fiat so it doesnt have any advantage to not be able to get Bitcoin with it. Its about what people are accepting in exchange for Bitcoin voluntarily, this is always a individual choice, not a set rule. There would always be people accepting fiat in exchange for Bitcoin,so there will always be a market to exchange fiat and Bitcoin, this happened naturally and couldnt have been differently. In the future people can just use satoshis instead of fiat to price things, there wouldnt be much difference to how it works now.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on July 05, 2022, 02:11:43 PMIn such a reality, I think the purchasing power of Bitcoin would see the same rise in value from its inevitable adoption but without the dumps caused by the broken fiat economy and stock market crashes. We still live in that broken system, Bitcoin is designed in a way to use the weaknesses this system has, to its own advantages. Let the dumps happen, we will beat them at their own game, thats the only way. If we wanna beat them, theres really no way around the pain we have to go trough now.",

EG an american coffee amount bit no no for bitcoin. but that american coffee is a weeks groceries amount for billion of people..yet some think bitcoin is fine for americans to use for their weekly grocery shop amount.. seem fair? nah.. but oh well(i personally am wealthy and in a developed country(UK) where prices are similar to US.. but i can atleast understand how the unbanked/poor, unprivileged get treated/feel due to the disparages of the forex market and the elitism of american mindsets)",

A merchant who's supporting bitcoin by pricing their goods to it, has to somehow come to an agreement with the client. If both the client and the merchant get paid, buy goods, pay taxes, other dues etc, using fiat, they're reasonably going to use it as a measure. Note that some online stores do price goods in bitcoin, regardless of the exchange rate. (e.g., lightning.store)",
