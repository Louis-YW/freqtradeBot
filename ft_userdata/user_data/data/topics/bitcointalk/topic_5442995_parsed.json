Especially the guys for ikeja? AnywayI will not encourage you to order it from anyone in Nigeria directly because no known official reseller in the country, but if you want to know the authenticity of a new hardware wallet, follow this:Quote from: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389367057-Is-my-Ledger-device-genuine-?docs=trueSet up your Ledger device with Ledger Live to verify its authenticity.Genuine Ledger devices hold a secret key that is set during manufacture.Only a genuine Ledger device can use its key to provide the cryptographic proof required to pass the genuineness check issued by Ledger Live.The secret key is not seed phrase, do not be confused with that. Quote from: KiaKia on March 05, 2023, 06:00:36 AMThe nano x wey I dey see na 190k or close to.I have noticed that hardware wallet sellers in Nigeria are not many and they do not have the latest ones. Like Ledger Nano, I have not seen a seller of ledger Nano S Plus and no where to preorder Ledger Nano Stax. Another thing is that their price is too high, I do not think tax and clearance fee can be up to that. Better to buy it directly from the company, but you may have to pay tax and clearance duty fee.I have not ordered hardware wallet before, but because there are people selling it in Nigeria, shipping it should not be a problem.",
