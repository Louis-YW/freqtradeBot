      "body": "I was dealing with accounts that requires only a credit or debit card with an address as long as your region is allowed, i sold many accounts but mamy users once they get the account many of them they complain that the account isn't working after changing the password especially when you use an escrow or paypal as payment. The point what i want to say is buying or selling the account is so risky You better do it alone. You can use your card and confirme the account. If you are not allowed on your country use a vpn and ask for another credit card. If you need Microsoft services pay real money and get secured and better service from them monthly",
