If they did know, he would have been dragged out of the casino so that they will not have any responsibility for his death.

Do you think the casino is to be blamed?Since you already said you are going to argue about it, I will not object anymore.    But would they still blame the casino if they responded fast and for like a minute he was delivered to a hospital with advanced devices yet he was still declared Dead on arrival?",

I had to read the link to see if the dealer made any attempt at all,  but I did not see any significant information on the case and what becomes the final judgement,  but in all senses, it is not appropriate for the dealer to have neglected the customers immediately he slumps over the blackjack board.",

Do you think the casino is to be blamed?I read the article and it seems the actual problem here is that dealer ignored the man and continued card dealing. Also, Wynn security saw what was happening and didn't act. Is that a crime? Sure, casinos should train their employees for first aid help. Not only train but they shouldn't be like a robot, I know casino dealers are prohibited to stop gambling session even if their colleague passes out, that's a pure evil thing but at some point as someone explained me, that's because sometimes people cheat when they lose a lot and one would do such a thing to stop the gambling session to avoid financial loss. But I don't think that's a good explanation.To be honest, it was impossible to escape that man who had cardiac arrest. It's a fatal accident, I've seen myself in real life how a man dead from cardiac arrest, it happened in seconds. If you really aren't in hospital, it's impossible to escape because no ambulance can come in some minutes.",

Anyone can die of cardiac arrest at certain middle or old age.Only what I know that can happen is to rush the man to a hospital nearby, but which can be done by some of the casino workers that are in charge of something like it in the casino. But it can be too late, cardiac arrest can occur fast and lead to death.",

So having a stand-by van to move emergency in public utilities such as a casino is most appropriate for this kind of incident.",

In this case, the casino ignored the media situation and they can be sued by the affected parties for millions in case if they acted right there won't be a situation at all. So creating awareness of what to do can be a good suggestion instead of adding unnecessary expenses.",

I think when you enter into reputable casinos, it’s already given that they are also prepared to extend their emergency help in times of unforeseen incidents. However, you are right, having a cardiac arrest is not a common case as it’s very serious that needs immediate medication from health professionals. So if you think you have heart problems, be sure to take your maintenance medicine first before you gamble in casinos. That way, cases like this will be avoided and should not put the blame into the casino management.",

I agree that casinos should have well-equipped first aid but having an employed paramedic will depend on the size of the casino. If the casino usually has frequent customers and can afford the cost of employing one, it will be okay. But their staff you be well trained in customer relations and emergency. They should have a swift link with a hospital with an effective ambulance. Quote On the other hand, I would argue that the family of the deceased is trying to obtain money from the casino. Do you think the casino is to be blamed?The most disheartening part of the story is that the client suffered a heart attack for 15munites and the staff didn't show any concern but was dealing with other players. The family might just be angry and want justice. Maybe they might be targeting profit from the judgment. I don't know what the attendant was thinking maybe he thought David Jagolinzer was drunk or on drugs. I am sure they would have offered help if they knew that he was dying. The casino is responsible if they are more concerned about profit making than the health of their customers. But if it was because of the negligence of the staff, then the law should be lenient.",

Though at the least, the dealer should have called for someone to ask the man to 'leave' in order to check on what's happening with the guy. Needless to say, the dealer should have send someone out to check on the guy immediately after he stumped. I'm pretty sure that the way the man slumped isn't normal, so from that point the dealer should have been alarmed.Anyway, I guess casinos have these people around, the health professionals and stuff.

I often see ambulances where they are available in entertainment venues or first aid kits so that when something happens that needs to be rushed to the hospital they are always on standby.But this cannot blame the casino and its users either, therefore users should play at casinos that have first aid kits and services like that, when cases like this occur they can be handled directly, but this case will become a concern and a lesson for other casinos. also gamblers who still play in offline casinos. because this is very important especially related to one's life.",

If they are allowed to go without any consequences I’m sure other casino that are also guilty of such behavior will still continue doing it but if they are faced with a severe punishment others might be force to change for the better.",
