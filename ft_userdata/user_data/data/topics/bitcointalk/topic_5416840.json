  "content": "Let me make few quotes from this BBC news that makes me emotional because of the way poor people in camp in Syria were exploited by TikTok. QuoteChildren are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value. The BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (Â£900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that.QuoteThe company said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount.QuoteThe gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.QuoteFamilies in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.QuoteWith TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.QuoteThe $33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.This is why I like bitcoin, no central authority is involved, rather than virtual assets that can only be converted to fiat on TikTok.I see this as a way TikTok is exploiting poor people with the centralized tradable virtual assets on the platform. What about you, is this not an exploit while TikTok is saying it is the people in the camp that are exploiting the minors (or let us use donators)? https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63213567",

The fact that people are starving has not been a secret for a long time, but I consider it the height of madness to create such online broadcasts. Someone prosperous, having morning coffee and watching the news, suddenly stumbles upon the pleading cry of a poor girl, asking for some coins. It looks like wildness. But if it exists, then it's popular, right? Otherwise, why would everything be so organized? Instead, you can contribute to a humanitarian fund, from which assistance will be guaranteed. But the actions of the poor people themselves also fall under great doubt. A man sold livestock to buy himself a mobile phone. It would be better if he ran his own farm and fed his family with it.",

      "body": "This kind of scheme encourages minors to do the job, all the live streamers or agency/middlemen will try to maximize their profit, and by seeking profit they are willing to use any things that attract the sympathy of anyone.Actually, I have seen a similar approach even in my own country, Indonesia. So I rather think that it is an unintended consequence of the TikTok campaign that tries to maximize screen time, but gets profited by the streamers who are begging for their own lives and trying everything to achieve that. Nevertheless, if we zoom out and take an overall look. It is absolutely that TikTok, even if unintended, they do get the full benefit of increasing the screen time of users and more money that they took from the streamers' money-making scheme.",

      "body": "I'd imagine tiktok has gifts worth different amounts depending on where you live. If you're as likely to deposit and withdraw gifts (for example in Europe, Australia or the US) you could probably expect the tiktok to be taking less of a cut and giving you about the 70% that's normally quoted. If you were living somewhere like Syria I could then see the gifts might be worth less because of the area you're in and the greater chance o someone withdrawing gifts than one of them depositing gifts (perhaps they're \"smart\" with this too like being able to locate poorer areas everywhere and keeping their gifts lower than where they'd be expected to pay higher.This is a similar (but worse) strategy of how goods in rural areas/villiages are much more expensive than cities because of the size of population and ease of transportation (even though people living in cities were often wealthier when this was a thing).Quote from: Gyfts on October 12, 2022, 10:32:52 AMI'm more concerned at how many people are throwing money at these sob stories without the realization that their money never even gets seen by the subjects in the video suffering from poverty. The fees that impact the donations are part of the problem, but the bigger problem is social media grifters exploiting suffering children for their gain. Tiktok is a malignant tumor on society.Are there good places to donate money to these days though too? A lot of charities have issues with being inefficient, volunteers being hard to audit or their attempts to receive more donations than they need to to fund campaigns (such as claiming work they haven't done as their own). It'd probably be hard to go out to places and actually work out what help to prioritise to people too. It's easy to help local organisations that are normally very open and make themselves easy to examine but aside from that I'm not sure.",

He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living.

Besides the usual worthless dancing brainless content to lobotomize the masses (using kids too quite often) they also feature children in precarious situations, facing the consequences of war, hunger and poverty to go viral and feed the audience which somehow enjoys this kind of content. After all they ask for money, although it's not clear how it is being distributed exactly. Very shady practice, but common on third world realms and in the depths of internet.Tik Tok is full of businessmen/managers who use and exploit others' images, especially uneducated ones, for their own benefit, like the character Stromboli in Pinocchio's story.",

What about you, is this not an exploit while TikTok is saying it is the people in the camp that are exploiting the minors (or let us use donators)? It is quite disheartening to see how children, people living with disabilities, and refugees are used as modern-day slaves. This is a clear example of the failure of centralized authority and how it promotes exploitation. These people are exploited because of a lack of information. They are falling for these exploitative middlemen because it is the only option they know. In fact, most of them don't know that they are being used or exploited and they are very happy with the peanuts they are given. If they had gotten the information about Bitcoin or other donator platforms, they wouldn't have used TikTok.Quote from: Hydrogen on October 12, 2022, 11:28:40 PMMass adoption for crypto appear to have stalled in the middle east. Possibly due to lack of cellphone and payment support. But considering crypto has done ok for itself in africa. Perhaps it is only a matter of time.Lack of cellphone and payment support is not the only challenge that has led to the stalling of Bitcoin development in the Middle East. This is because they have access to these facilities more than Africa yet they are far behind the latter in Bitcoin adoption and use. Middle East societies are very conservative and difficult to accept change. Accepting innovation seems to take a longer period in the Middle East. Most of these nations are governed not based on democratic principles, hence the government limits the citizen's freedom. There is a need for the spread of Bitcoin education in every nook and cranny of the world so that people would know that there is a better alternative.",

Tiktok is clearly benefiting greatly from excessive fees and people being exploited in this manner, however they do bring a small amount of benefit to the equation in fairness. They have huge reach as, for whatever reason, many people choose to use this platform and it allows any content creators to get exposure to the highest degree. If you were to set this up on an independent website and tried to get the same amount of viewers who are driving the donations, then you would have an extremely tough time to raise anywhere near the same amount of money. However the fees should definitely be a fraction of what they are now and the actual people making the content deserve the biggest proportion - middlemen should be monitored heavily too.",
