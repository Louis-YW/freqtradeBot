For the past few decades, gold and property have always been used as measures for rich people. In the next few years, Bitcoin owners will also definitely be included in the middle class category.",

Of course, it can crash, but it's one of the investments I know that will always be relevant in this world. Real estate like every other investment has the possibility of crashing, stocks crash, just a few years ago, Bitcoin was at $16k from an ATH of $68k+. It's not different from real estate. People would always need a place to live, an office space, a place for their businesses and events, hotels and restaurants would always be a thing. As long as these things are still in demand, real estate will always be a relevant investment. There's no single investment without a risk, the risks may differ but there still risks.",

The banking system may have flaws, but we are also provided with a lot of facilities and as far as the safety of our money is concerned, I think our capital is safe in the banks.Some banks may not work online ,but many banks are working well online, and they are treating their customers well.Bitcoin is also considered to be the most secure, but I think wherever you store your bitcoins there are still risks of hacking. So you should worry about protecting your money in Bitcoin more than the bank, because one mistake on your part can cost you your assets.​",

The only challenge is the storage and security If you are holding physical gold. We have Sovereign Gold  and this is better option as you get little annual returns as well. Gold may not be in par with inflation but it is certainly most safest investment.2. I strongly disagree with your views on real estate. It gives you a place to stay, you can rent it out, collaborate with builders or business. It gives you multiple stream of income.",

Is it simply material things, things like knowledge, spirit, health... are also part of the wealth of each of us? Instead of just wanting to improve material things, the crowd often ignores what remains and lacks the balance of life. Like the way I come into contact with people who have millions of dollars in accounts, but they still cannot be satisfied because they do not understand the balance of life, blindly chasing after material things such as money, gold, real estate... even bitcoin... I think it's just an opinion that people don't see yet because then they can have/don't have to continue using the material to search for the rest.",

IF you look at the building structures from let’s say 30 years ago, you can tell the difference. And who is making all that money? The real estate investors of course.

But, I'm not really sure if Bitcoin will be on that same level because what if there will be a banning that will happen again on Bitcoin? There are reports that a bank can go bankrupt and this scares the people but not all banks are like that. There are people who don't trust their selves on handling their own money, because they lose it easily. There is also a worry about being robbed inside their homes. So, they can trust others to handle it. The banks serves different purpose than Bitcoin and Gold, so expect that there will always be people who will use them.",

All three assets that you mentioned are very good asset and anyone that has an investment in all has overcome poverty. Bitcoin is the new one amongst the other and and due to its volatile nature, it has become one of the best but I don't think that it has been approved as a safe haven yet. I don't think that they will stop to use real estate as collateral as long as we are using fiat, it will be impossible because banks and government are in charge of fiat, if bank wants to give you a loan, they will always prefer house property, because they can easily use the property of sell it off and get their profit.

Staying away from debt religiously is not a wise move. If you take advantage of the low interest rates, debt is a very good way to get rich. I probably owe 30% of my total net worth to the debts I took in the past before the central banks started raising them. When I did that, the rates were low and the prices were skyrocketing. Now the inflation is a bit slowed down because of the high rates but do you know what didn't happen? The prices haven't come down and they won't come down. (low inflation != price drop) They will still go up and more slowly now. That means every loan I took made me profits. Thanks central banks. I owe you one.",

Isn't that the same as giving up your rights? Gold and real estate have risks even Bitcoin has the same risks, here we cannot  play safe if we are not ready to face the risks. Because if there is a safe choice then  everyone in the world will experience wealth equally. Therefore there is always a risk for those who dare to bet.Likewise with mortgages if you look at the profit cycle during the covid 19 pandemic it is clear that there is a big bubble that provides multiple profits. When placing any investment if you are able to understand the market situation and conditions then you can play in it. Now that the era of digitalization is almost familiar Bitcoin is the top of the chain where everything will lead to the same point.  Mass adoption has shifted towards increasingly expanding people access in the world,  they just need to make a  decision and be ready for all the risks.",

All three assets that you mentioned are very good asset and anyone that has an investment in all has overcome poverty. OP's view of investing in real estate is based on his country or experience. Some countries pay very high property taxes which can make the business unprofitable. But in some countries, property taxes are considerably low which can make the business lucrative. An example of a troubled or unprofitable real estate sector is the Chinese market. Many real estate business owners in China are currently going through a hard time that is crumbling the sector.

Banks are not trustworthy because they are under the control of the people and the government. Bitcoin gives you total control over your funds if you keep them in a non-custodial wallet because you have full control over your private key. Bitcoin has also proved to be a good hedge against inflation in most countries that are going through high inflation. It will be unwise to keep your money in banks where it will gradually lose value over time. Bitcoin is safer, more convenient and more profitable.",

You need time to sell a house and get all get all the papers signed. If you buy a car it's going to most likely lose value, so it won't have appreciation at all, but the market will be pretty stable and liquid. If you choose to buy a rare painting, most likely it's not going to be a liquid item and won't generate incredible profit, but will offer decent price stability. Bonds, just like bank deposits offer a bit of appreciation, decent stability and decent liquidity. The problem is that if you account for inflation you come to a conclusion that you're not making any money, just enduring. What you own depends on your character. I'm a bit of a prepper so for me liquidity is the most important, appreciation is second and I care the least about stability, therefore bitcoin is an ideal asset for me. I have some liquid and some illiquid assets and out of my liquid ones almost everything is in bitcoin. I have some money in the bank and some cash, but all my fiat money is not even 10% of the value of my bitcoin. My father, who was raised in a socialist state, used to have 80% in a bank, 15% in cash and 5% in gold. This shows how different we are as people and as whole generations.",
