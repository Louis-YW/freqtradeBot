  "content": "The power of #TanithTanith (Tanit) was the mother goddess of fertility and the moon. She was the patron goddess of Carthage and is related to Ishtar and Astarte.Today, the goddess Tanith remains revered in Ibiza and its ancient temple, a cave with an altar in the center, located on the road to Portinatx and designated \"Cova de's Cuieram\".Why Am I talking about a Goddess ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùìIn Ibiza the female energy is very important, as Tanith is part of our Island. I think it is important in #web3 and #blockchain to keep the same balance.Crypto, like most tech sectors, has received the ‚Äúboys club‚Äù reputation. At its core, crypto was billed as a risky investment.Women, who are normally more risk averse, shielded away from the initial wave.I am happy to see we are breaking this trend in the #blockchain space.Web3 becomes more welcoming when speculation takes a backseat to participation. When people feel like #owners instead of speculators or flippers, they will have a deeper connection to a project. We need more Web3 initiatives that will appeal to humanity‚Äôs infinitely-wide range of interests.How stronger the utility of web3 becomes for humanity, how more we see the deeper connection and the female energy joining the space.For example, the recent promenade at #Davos was taken over by #crypto #companies as #ICP, exceeding the traditional finance and tech presence, but it was the presence of so #many #women in senior positions representing every segment of the crypto industry that confirmed my firm belief that the future of #web3 is bright.An April 2022 report saw women‚Äôs participation increase over 170% in the last fiscal year. Moreover, women on average made larger initial deposits, and although they traded less frequently, their portfolios showed more structured strategies and focused positions.Also at the InternetComputer the group of strong female personalities keeps growing. Shruti Sutwala Martina Zlatkova Angela Marie Harp Giulia Guizzardi ...to just name a few of the many.I can only applause this evolution. Keeping the balance is very important for innovation and development, and the blockchain world is definitely on the right track!Many thanks to all of you! We need your energy more than ever.Nathalie Noulhiane Aga Marecka Ioana Surpateanu Daphne Ng Justine Duchamp Melanie Mohr Anita Erker Iva Filipoviƒá Ayesha Mubarak Ali üíéSanja Kon Jillian Godsil, MA, BA (hons) Sarah RenardWhat is your opinion about the topic?(full article : https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6955165606471966720/)",
