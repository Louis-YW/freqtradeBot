I want to know everything in detail about Bitcoin Ordinal so I can write an article in Bengali, for the Bengali cryptocurrency news site I'm writing. Where should I start? Especially I'm looking for some forum discussion/guidelines on Bitcoin Ordinal. There are articles on a lot of platforms but no one can make it as easy and friendly as bitcointalk. Please share me the informative threads on Bitcoin Ordinal. I found a few threads but all of them were some specific questions.",

However, I came across a post here that suggests ordinals may not be as unique as we think, just can't remember what that thread is...Edit: it is from pooyah: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5437787.msg61756223#msg61756223",
