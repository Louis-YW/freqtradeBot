They need to cooperate with one another tbh, they just want to stir the market with FUD. I wonder why the SEC labeled them as security when there's really \"no expectations to profit\" for BUSD.1. https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr19090512. https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/02/10/new-york-regulator-investigates-stablecoin-issuer-paxos/",

Reserves should only consist of US Treasury bills, reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by Treasury bills or notes, government money-market funds or deposit accounts at US state or federally chartered institutions.According to Paxos’ latest reserve report, BUSD is backed by $636 million (4%) in cash, $12 billion in Treasury-collateralized reverse repurchase agreements (75%) and $3.3 billion in US Treasury bills (21%).[1] https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports",

That is tolerable since it is expected that when more and more people playing out within cryptocurrency spaces, the regulator or authority will keep an eye on it. Do also note, the recent FTX fiasco event is a kind of wake-up call for the regulator.So, it is well understood that in this case regulator are trying to catch up with how stablecoins utilization progresses among its people or reflecting on other countries since it being used widely.",

It also feels like SEC is flexing and trying to force their way by breaking their own rules. This move must be related to their other recent activities which is going after crypto staking. BUSD on a staking pool would generate profit and that's probably where SEC is attacking.",

He knows very well that USDT was also questioned if it's fully backed by reserves. To which Paxos can back the claim. Also, SEC can only consider a token a security if investors expect to profit from it but this is a stablecoin.  This is something they can't argue but this is to question Paxos not binance.",

Even if BUSD gets serious trouble, there will be way to handle it. Pay money for SEC like some cryptocurrency projects did in the past like Tezos XTZ. It won't kill BUSD entirely and the stablecoin will continue its existence in cryptocurrency market.",
