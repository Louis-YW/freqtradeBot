  "content": "Hi. I have a story from today. Need experienced people to advise me.Long story short. I was sending money from binance to Ledger. - ledger brand new from official website.For test I tried to send only BTT as that was asset I had worth like 15$. So easy, copy paste address, selected BTT coin to transfer, click Max amount. Verification and done.5 mins later still didn't receive transfer on ledger so back to binance to check status - completed. Hmmm Let's Try with a bit of XRP - wait where is my XRP? All gone along with all other coins. Contacted ledger they are saying it is not shown as the coin is not supported and to use metamask to recover it. Anyway the question is different. Well 2 of them. 1st one - is that possible that somehow when I selected transfer MAX BTT on binance it converted all my assets to BTT and sent it? Because this happened. Another question is. In transaction history the address is different than the one I copied and pasted from the ledger wallet address (just asking if the address which is shown in history on binance is always the same as ledger wallet because 100% I copied and paste correct one but it shows different, could that be related with the network used for transfer?) just trying to figure out if I just made a mistake or got robbed. Pretty sure got scammed somehow but then the question is - all assets were converted and transfered but 500USDT remained untouched and still on my account. If that would be someone who robbed the account would probably take USDT also ðŸ¤” anyone has any ideas? All answers will be appreciated.",

      "body": "I don't see why would they suggest MetaMask. That only works with EVM compatible chains. XRP has its own Network, and BTT uses the Tron network as far as I know. Or did you use a wrapped coin? Now to understand things better, I'm not familiar with ledger so I'm not sure if they generate new address when you receive funds but where did you send the money if they claim the coins are not supported? Did you send your BTT to a TRX address? After the following this guide?https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013062159?docs=true",

      "body": "I am not used to BTT but XRP was supported by Ledger wallet and if the sent XRP is not reflecting in your wallet that could be an outdated version of ledger live because the most frequent reason for a transaction not appearing in your Ledger wallet even though it is marked as completed by the sender is an out-of-date version of ledger live.For the copy and paste showing different public addresses, I don't want to scare you but it could be clipboard hijack. I will advise you first try the tips once provide.",

All answers will be appreciated. Binance would never replace your address on its own. Assuming you select the right network, it is likely that the malware just replaces anything on your clipboard as long as it is a crypto address. I second the suggestion to use another device and scan/reinstall your current system to make sure there is no malware lurking around your computer. You can also assume that your seed or private keys are already exposed if your copied address keeps changing. CMIIW.",

      "body": "More information is needed from you OP to figure out what happened here or what most probably happened.First of all, I have never heard of Binance converting any assets on their own. There is an option to convert your coins to BNB, but you have to do that manually. Binance doesn't do it themselves. Regarding the address being different than the one you copy/pasted, it could be proof of a clipboard virus. It's easy to check it you are infected with one. Copy any bitcoin address from your wallet and paste it somewhere. Now, compare the pasted address with the one you copied. If it changed to a different one, you have a clipboard malware on your system. If it's identical, you don't. Most of the withdrawals on Binance are surely automated, so I doubt someone replaced your destination address to steal $15 worth of an altcoin.Now to the issue with the BTT not appearing in Ledger Live. We first have to figure out how you got a receiving address in Ledger Live if the coin isn't supported?! It doesn't make sense. I assume BTT is BitTorrent, right? If it is, Ledger supports two variants of this token. The first one is a TRC10 token found on the Tron network. Ledger supports this token and the Tron network natively in Ledger Live. To receive BTT as a TRC10 token, you have to install the Tron app in Ledger Live and send the tokens to your Tron address. Is that what you did? The second BTT token isn't natively supported by Ledger Live. Which means, you have to use a 3rd-party wallet and connect your Ledger with it. Based on the suggested wallets on https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets (MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet), it looks like this BTT variant is an Ethereum token, although it doesn't say that on the page. I don't know if BitTorrent has a mainnet, and if they do, why would Ledger work with MEW and MyCrypto for this wallet. Did you maybe send your transaction to this BTT version (let's call it that)?What does the blockchain data show? Are the coins you sent from Binance still on the address that received them or were they moved elsewhere? Which blockchain is it? While we are at it, can you paste here the website address from your browser history where you logged in to Binance and initiated the withdrawal? OP's silence and the fact that he never returned might mean he understood he made a mistake somehow and gave up. Or it somehow worked out for the better in the end. The latter doesn't happen very often in crypto.",
