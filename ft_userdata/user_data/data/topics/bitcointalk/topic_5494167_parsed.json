It indicates this is because Bitcoin ETF is approved and so they are also seeing the adoption. The countries in the Middle East are the richest in the world, Trump demonstrates this by pointing out that military weapons are peanuts for MBS. If BTC will be used to buy gas and oil in the Middle East, I guess this is going to make every country able to trade with them even the US-sanctioned countries.",

I am sure that, the presence of free economic zones like Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has fostered an environment which helped in this case. I am sure the rest of the world is catching up as well! With the access of faster internet and information, people around the world are showing interest in crypto adoption. But the regulatory framework remain a bottleneck. Majority of the countries are still thinking to have a legal framework. So unless these countries come out something on paper, the situation will remain uncertain.",

The Op quoted it wrongly, the article says that 72% of those who use crypto, use Bitcoin, not 72% of the total population. UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are the too countries in the region with the intention of dominating the future market in several industries, not just reliant on oil. Bitcoin has lots of prospects for the future and they want to be ahead of that curve too.",

It seems that even the 72% info checks out (or, at least, is substantiated by some sources).Dubai is kind of associated with wealth and innovation, so it makes sense to me that it's becoming a major crypto hub. Also, since it's outside Western jurisdictions, it can be attractive for legal reasons. But why is it happening now, in 2024? Is it a follow-up of US ETF approvals, is it inspired by halving-related FOMO?",
