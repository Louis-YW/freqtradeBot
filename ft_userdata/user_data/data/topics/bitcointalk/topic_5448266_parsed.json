What I know is that people complain about the slow developments and upgrades in Cardano. I don't know the whole history but the team probably made a lot of promises in the early days that they were unable to meet. There are so-called investors that are impatient and wants immediate results or updates and they are present in almost every project.",

      "body": "ADA is no different from other successful coins, such as ETH, SOL, etc., they also often talk only bad and remember only negative sides of these coins, but they have positive sides that allowed them to achieve what their competitors could not. In this sense, ADA is no exception, and a portion of the hate is also prepared for it. Personally, I like ADA as an investment asset, it certainly does not look like a scam and you can get some profit here if we are talking about conservative investing. I never pay attention to the haters and those who speak well of the coin, only DYOR. Negative reviews as well as positive ones can be bought or pursue a certain interest, they are not to be particularly trusted.",

I also think that it did a lot better than the other projects in terms of price, during the past years.The only big negative that I remember was during the 2021 bull, that they figured out there's a very fundamental bug in the project which prevents it from running smart contracts and sending transactions in each block. That was a bad one. I dunno if they did (or will do) anything about it or not, but it was a huge disappointment to me personally. I believe it was one of the reasons why ADA didn't go higher than $3 during the bull, otherwise it could have been exploded even bigger than it did.",

I'm not sure what you mean by hate because I haven't seen any bad post about ADA. It's one of the solid coins, it will not be in the top 5 or top 10 in crypto market for so long without it become a good crypto to invest. And you can see it's previous historical logs, the gains and the profits that we have seen, it's huge for it's holders. So it will be just rinse and repeat, it's been down in this bear market, but for sure it will have another great uptick in price in the next bull run.",

I don't pay much attention to this altcoin and I don't interested in why people criticized this project. It might be another number of shitcoin that it's good to be avoided.",

They have been coding every single day for over 5 years now, and they failed to build a smart contract in time. Think about it, if in 2021 they had a proper working smart contract before the bull run started, not only did it went up, but it would have stayed up in the ranks as well. But because it didn't had a proper one, they failed and even though people supported it and took it high, after failing to deliver, they let it be and it crashed. Thats a very valid reason not to support it or at least have a dislike towards it.",

They have nice projects also and fundementally it's in good situation. But only problem is the value of ADA. Most yyoutubers promote ada by saying ada will hit 5$ in next 5 month blah blah. But it never happens. So right now people is don't care about ada. Because there are lot of new projects that are still under 1$ that can give 10-50× in next bull run. So I think it's not about hate people are now not care/invest anymore on ADA.",

Everyone has their own bet coin and tokens and thats normal that they tend to say something bad aside from their own holding to see the other side right? Anyway data and figure speaks for itself about it. Ada is on top list, so ignore potential fud cause it wont change a position for their token that simply.",

Aside from slow development and the failure to follow roadmaps and schedules, perhaps one of the reasons why altcoins like ADA get so much hate is that there is a competition.

Charles struggles to convince people that he wouldn't dump his tokens.

Maybe another reason is that, they are saying that they are the \"Ethereum Killer\", but developing very slow, and like others said here, they are overhyping the project too much, but the progress is very slow.Still, Cardano is one of the top tokens right now in terms of market cap, and it has been there for a very long time. It just shows that there's a huge community behind it. I'm currently holding, and staking Cardano for almost a year already, and it's always good to earn coins just by doing nothing though I'm thinking of selling it already, and purchase Ethereum.",

Based on what is happening in the crypto market few days ago, showed that ADA will be in second position among other cryptocurrencies next year because their team are very ready to make it more active in a way it will attract more investors. I believe, something special will definitely happen this season that will make Cardano pump higher like never before to make their investors have hope of winning something big soon.",

So there's nothing extraordinary from ADA to get the hate, (although I'm not sure what kind of hate the OP is telling us).To each its own, I still believed that ADA is a solid project since it's inception. And I also think that it will be one of the altcoins that will still enjoy success in the future. Could hit a new all time high next bull run, just saying. The developer is still very much active and that's what makes this project one of the better investment.",
