  "content": "QuoteSome big-company CEOs are seeing big cuts to their compensation packages.The reductions come amid economic hardship across different industries, including Big Tech. Employees at some of the companies have seen their own pay cut — or jobs eliminated.JPMorgan CEO Jamie DimonThough JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon received the same $34.5 million salary in 2022 as he did in 2021, last year marked a noticeable difference in that he was no longer given a \"special award\" worth millions. In an SEC filing in January, the JPMorgan board wrote it was \"committed to not grant any special awards to him in the future.\" The effort followed outcry over his $84.4 million salary in 2021, $52.6 million of which came from options awards, according to Marketwatch. Apple CEO Tim CookApple CEO Tim Cook is taking a 40% pay cut in 2023, bringing his annual target salary to $49 million for the year, per documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in January. The executive requested the pay reduction himself, coming on the heels of recent controversy surrounding his hefty salary. In 2022, Apple investors were urged to vote against Cook's nearly $100 million pay package by a shareholder advisory firm. The SEC filing references \"concern\" over Cook's total annual compensation in 2021 and 2022, noting the 2023 reduction comes amid \"balancing shareholder feedback, a desire to continue to create meaningful performance and retention incentives, and Mr. Cook's support for changes.\" Intel CEO Pat GelsingerIntel said on February 1 that CEO Pat Gelsinger would take a 25% pay reduction this year. It's part of an effort to cut costs at the company. Gelsinger will be joined by other top executives at the company, who also are seeing salary cuts ranging from 5% to 15%. \"These changes are designed to impact our executive population more significantly and will help support the investments and overall workforce needed to accelerate our transformation and achieve our long-term strategy,\" an Intel spokesperson told Insider's Aidan Pollard. Goldman Sachs CEO David SolomonGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon saw a 30% pay cut in 2022, bringing his salary to $25 million.Per a filing with the SEC, his base salary remained unchanged at $2 million, and he made $23 million in annual variable compensation, down from $33 million the year prior.  The reduction came as the bank struggled against economic headwinds, and laid off 6.5% of its global workforce. Morgan Stanley CEO James GormanMorgan Stanley CEO James Gorman also saw a 10% pay cut in 2022, taking home a total of $31.5 million. The reduction is in response to \"a challenging economic and market environment\" which was \"not as strong as the prior year in which the firm achieved record financial performance,\" the finance giant said, according to Bloomberg.The company laid off 2% of its global workforce in 2022, or an estimated 81,000 employees. Google CEO Sundar PichaiSundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent company Alphabet, told employees in January that top executives will take a \"very significant reduction in their annual bonus,\" but didn't specify by how much or for how long. Pichai told employees during an all-hands meeting the cuts are \"tied directly to company performance,\" Insider's Rosalie Chan and Hugh Langley reported. His remarks came shortly after the company announced it is laying off 6% of its staffers, or an estimated 12,000 employees. In a memo obtained by Insider, Pichai wrote the reductions will \"cut across Alphabet, product areas, functions, levels and regions.\" https://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-taking-pay-cuts-prevent-layoffs-economic-hardship-list-2023-2....Is it safe to say we're in for a rough year when Jamie Dimon receives a pay cut?The last few years have been so bad for finance, we may not see even a single \"Jamie Dimon should have invested in bitcoin, instead\" comment. Quite remarkable given the internets love for memes and spicy one line commentary.CEOs of google, apple, morgan stanley, goldman sachs and intel also appear to be subject to salary or bonus cuts.It appears the board of directors of many large banks, investment firms and corporate entities are not pleased with the current state of affairs.Have CEO pay cuts been long overdue? Is this a legitimate step towards wealth and wage equality, which many have called for? While current economic and financial conditions may not be ideal? Perhaps there is a good potential here for real and lasting reforms, which could help to balance the global economy?",

These CEO are earning skyrocketed wages and salaries while workers are receiving peanuts yet they are the first hit. Some top executive prefer to sack workers or cut thier earnings because they want to still maintain thier luxuries lifestyle. But the above news is a welcomed development because they are beginning to understand that these workers are humans with families and responsibilities. Although wealth and wages equity can never be achieved but this is a step on the right direction.",
