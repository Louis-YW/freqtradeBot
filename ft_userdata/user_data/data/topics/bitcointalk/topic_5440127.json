It's your responsibility to keep your private key safely and privately (secretly).If you don't want to lose it to courts, your family members, keep it privately (secretly). If you want more, use a multi-signature wallet like 2/3 cosigners. If one private key is lost to court, family members, with 2 other co-signers, you still own your coins.",

But this law will protect the husband from divulging his private keys to the court.Unless he is required to do so in which the restriction is no longer applied.If you try to hide your coins away and your wife has proof that you had access to an address that at the moment of the divorce holds any amount and you refuse to share than the court can ask you to provide the lawyers with access to those assets, refusing to obey this is usually followed by having you held in contempt of court and a fine, in extreme situations jail time.What this paragraph grants you is the fact that you're no longer forced to provide the key if there are other methods of determining, in the case you mentioned the said value of those assets with a public key.",

All the time we can hear, abc session happens and court concluded ban on this crypto stuff, ban on that person using crypto, FED ceasing the assets and what not?Having this bill does nothing except avoiding exploitation of our privacy publicly which used to be done all the time. Once your keys are gone it follows catastrophic leaks of your coin as well. So definitely this is just what we had blessed from Mr Satoshi in the first place only the difference is we have protection from the justice system as well.",

That's exactly what it is! Why a government would be so concerned about the privacy of its citizens? These kinds of laws are just eyewash, not to be believed or to be taken seriously! Usually, a person will be forced to declare his/her private key only if they are being prosecuted by any government department, especially IRS. So they can't be protected under this bill. So it doesn't really make sense!",

Wyoming has about 600,000 people living in about 98000 square miles with a GDP of $37 billion.Nassau County NY has about 1.4 million people living in 455 square miles with a GDP of $85 billion.These mostly empty STATES can pass laws like this since it looks good on the books (although as written does very little) because the odds of it mattering one way or another are fairly small. Having it places with a lot of people and a lot of money would matter since the issue might actually come up. Or, to put it another way. It's all political showmanship.Something like this would probably never pass in a location with a lot of people and money moving since there could be real consequences to it.There was a town around here that passed a law about no buildings higher then 25 stories. Which was kind of funny since due to the softness of the ground and a few other things any large buildings like that would have slid into the Long Island Sound. But it showed that the town was protecting the 'tranquility' of the area.-Dave",

Or what fits their greed (think most people go on exchanges these days for their interest bearing stuff from \"saving/staking\".I would actually say if you run a business and also requires being regulated, then the private keys must at least be retrievable by the same regulating authorities. Personal privacy shouldn't apply here to CEOs of regulated businesses that act as custodians for customer money. The law should be able to seize funds of rogue CEOs -- doesn't matter bank, company, or exchange.Quote from: Saint-loup on February 17, 2023, 02:27:51 PMThe court will still see how much funds he holds through his adresses and public keys, and if he doesn't want to give on his own the amount of money ruled by the court they could seize all his other assets and put him in jail until he agrees to give the rest.That's probably what they already do, but it doesn't solve the problem for the claimants...Knowing how cray people get in that position, he might just try to blackmail instead and say he's willing to go to jail for a lifetime and take his keys to his grave.
