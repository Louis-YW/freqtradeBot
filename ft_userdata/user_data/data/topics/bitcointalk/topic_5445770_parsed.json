Since 2019, there has been a whole series of scandals that can really affect the mental health of some audiences.- 2019 - Covid- 2022 - a new wave of Russian terrorist attacks on Ukraine.- 2022 - world economic crisis, crisis in the oil and gas market.- 2023 - Biden signed a law requiring US intelligence to declassify data on the origin of COVID-19.It seems that many more \"interesting events\" await us, and it is worth stocking up on antidepressants and sedatives....And among the consequences of covid-19, among those of my acquaintances who got sick, or after the availability of vaccines did not get vaccinated and got sick, there are definitely variants:- memory problems. Distracted attention, inability to concentrate- the ability to learn and memorize new information dropped sharply- General \"mental weakness\", such as melancholy, attention deficit disorder, apathy",

      "body": "Absolutely true, seeing how people around me are being affected by the epidemic is really sad.First of all, I will start with this, I admit that I have not had a vaccine since the outbreak of the disease, and have never been infected with covid19. I feel very comfortable and fearless, but I am not subjective when taking effective preventive measures, such as limiting contact with people when the epidemic is severe.However, I later found that the accompanying problem was the vague confusion from the beginning of the epidemic, and the fear of seeing so many people die. And the economy is tight, life is getting more and more difficult. Just from such a small aspect and practically anyone has had such feelings when the epidemic was raised.I don't know if you guys have had a reaction to the vaccine in terms of health status or not, but I see a lot of people having problems with the heart, nerves, or excretory system, ... actually many people still haven't. Only when they really have it will they seek the relevant information.",

      "body": "QuoteDrBeer,Hispo,someone703Hello all dear sir I thank you all for taking out time to share your thoughts with me. If you liked this post, I request you to kindly spot me.QuoteDrBeerThe world has experienced a series of significant events since 2019, including the COVID-19 pandemic, Russian terrorist attacks on Ukraine, economic crises, and the declassification of COVID-19 data. These events can have a significant impact on mental health, and it's essential to take care of oneself. Additionally, some individuals who contracted COVID-19 experienced memory problems, difficulty learning new information, and general mental weakness. It's important to seek professional help if you're experiencing any mental health concerns.Quotesomeone703Thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines. It's completely understandable to feel confused and scared during such uncertain times, especially when we see so many people losing their lives.Regarding vaccines, it's important to note that they have undergone extensive testing and have been approved by regulatory bodies worldwide. While it's true that some people may experience side effects after getting vaccinated, these are usually mild and temporary, such as fatigue or soreness at the injection site. Serious side effects are rare and often occur in people with pre-existing medical conditions.Getting vaccinated not only protects you from getting seriously ill with COVID-19 but also helps to prevent the spread of the virus to others, especially those who are more vulnerable. It's a crucial step towards ending the pandemic and returning to a sense of normalcy.That being said, it's still important to take preventive measures, such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, especially in areas where the virus is spreading rapidly.If you have any concerns or questions about the vaccine, it's best to speak with your healthcare provider or a trusted medical professional who can provide you with accurate and up-to-date informationQuoteHispoThe pandemic and lockdown have had a significant impact on people's mental health, and even mentally healthy individuals are struggling. Loss of jobs and family members has pushed many to the edge, and there has been an increase in demand for mental health services. Mental health is often neglected in many countries.",

The pandemic has caused widespread fear and uncertainty, disrupted daily routines, and isolated many individuals from their support networks. These factors have contributed to an increase in stress, anxiety, and depression among many people.Furthermore, the pandemic has also led to economic hardship for many individuals, which can further exacerbate mental health problems. The loss of employment, financial strain, and increased debt can cause immense stress and anxiety, which can lead to mental health problems such as depression.Moreover, the pandemic has also caused a significant increase in domestic violence, child abuse, and substance abuse, all of which can have severe long-term effects on mental health. The isolation and stress caused by the pandemic have created a breeding ground for these issues to flourish.In addition to these challenges, the pandemic has also led to a reduction in mental health services, as resources are redirected towards fighting the virus. This has made it more difficult for people to access the help they need, which can further exacerbate mental health problems.Overall, the pandemic has had a profound impact on mental health, and the effects are likely to continue for some time. It is crucial that individuals, governments, and healthcare systems prioritize mental health and take steps to support those in need. This can include providing access to mental health services, promoting healthy coping mechanisms, and addressing the root causes of mental health problems such as economic hardship and domestic violence.",

China had tried to keep zero cases policy and we saw what outcome of it they got. Lockdowns didn't helped much to stop spread of Covid, but it ''helped'' a lot to kill economy and hurt mental health of people.Pandemic didn't had much impact for my mental health. Probably because that I tried to live normal life, despite lockdown. I was going to my work every day - I didn't had to work at home. And I didn't felt loneliness - I didn't tried to avoid contact with other people.What I noticed that people now tend to look for conspiracy theories everywhere and believe into it. I think it's result of bad commuincation of governments during lockdowns and vaccination campaigns. Also, all these strange decisions that doesn't makes sense also didn't helped much.Also, people becomy angry, often enemies for each other, sometimes even family members. We had people divided into vaxxers and anti-vaxxers and often it looked that they would like to kill each other.",

The fact that it happened and kept people indoors confined for as long as they could not predict leaves the thought and feeling that it can happen as well as any other thing we thought was impossible before. That puts pressure on our mental health because if that happened it is also possible for a zombie attack to happen, many things unbelievable can happen, what we think we know, we are not really sure anymore about it.",
