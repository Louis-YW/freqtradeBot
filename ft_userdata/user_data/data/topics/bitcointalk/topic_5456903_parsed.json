  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk Community,We are a group of software engineers who have successfully launched an AI Utility https://www.aiplore.com/#  independent of cryptocurrencies. Seeking financial freedom beyond our 9-5 jobs, we plan to launch an ERC20 token to raise funds for further development and explore AI utilities in the Crypto Domain.Currently, we have a fully functional utility and 2nd impressive demoable utility as prototype, with a ready website and engaging Twitter account. However, recent SEC actions have created uncertainty   regarding the legality of our ERC20 token creation. We seek your advice on deploying contracts and establishing mechanisms for sharing returns or dividends, as we approach the imminent launch after investing significant time.Your valuable insights, experiences, and suggestions are greatly appreciated.Thank you for your support,Kiran",

It's better you go get grant or a loan than want to use a trickish way to launch a token to raise money from the people over here.

We were and still working on Our Project AI chrome extension, already released and under usage of public.My initial thought process was using Token fund raising and thats the reason i was afraid and reached out for feedback.AIPlore is my project and it is generic now. After spent some time with different domains such as IIOT(Iot 4.0), Supply Chain, Logistics, BlockChain... we picked that we want to extend AIPlore domain expertise, prompt setting & LLM tuning into BlockChain.Hence, it made me to think the way to take an opportunity too!",

My intention is not trick ppl in Bitcointalk. It just happened that i landed up here through CMC form one of the options.I am here since May and saw so many tokens PnD. I hesitated to launch any token even though i tested my contract creation learning over mainned and testnets.As i mentioned, i coincidentally picked Crypto domain for my project to train further i am also thinking to relate it with token somehow.At present we parallely working on our project and also sketched out how can Crypto Token complement each other.We dont want to treat this as securities and funding any more rather treat it as a token through which AIPlore services van be bought and get some discounts.The value of token depends on the project purchase and circulation.We are still carfully going through Tokenomics, sustainable model,  Values of token holders etc.",

I must thank for your devil advocate words!We are not going to treat Crypto Token as securities and no mentioning of returns, investment etc.We are planning to treat a token as branding to the project, discounts rate of service for the users holding tokens or buy service cheaply paying with tokens. Thats all the transaction going to be.How the staking, roi, value of token we are not going to mention neither promise. We will write disclaimer such way!I am certainly going to take your advice and talk to Corporate Legal Service!Thanks!",
