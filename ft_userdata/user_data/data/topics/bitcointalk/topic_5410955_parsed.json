The owner of this bar ''Jenny Nguyen'' say she felt the need to open this special bar after several visits to bars with her friends and noticing that they not show women sports on any of their screens. She also made mention of a general feeling among women who love to visit bars to watch sports.Quote it goes anywhere between ''uncomfortable to unsafe.\"This is a really unique idea as I think it can increase woman participation in sports if this idea is adopted by other business people who wish to start a sports bar in their different locations. More women will feel safer and more comfortable going to these bars themselves knowing that they will find more women than men there. What do you think about this?https://www.euronews.com/2022/08/22/sports-bra-a-unique-bar-dedicated-to-celebrating-womens-sports",

As of 2022, there are less than 20 lesbian bars in the country.Is the bar only for lesbians? If not for only lesbians but general, it is really a good idea, it is true that only men sports are shown in bars, like in my country, only men football of the big leagues, most especially the EPL are shown, but which we always found interesting.But there are a lot of women in sport, but not as many as men though.",

      "body": "I like the wordplay between Bar and Bra. Of course, it's going to be a lady bar that probably has ladies' drinks all over, but it's a great idea to have that to show women empowerment and where they could feel safe with so many women around there. I hope more of these ideas will be applied to men-dominated things, businesses, and more. Quote from: Oshosondy on August 23, 2022, 04:50:57 PMIs the bar only for lesbians? I don't think it should be, though. But it will be awkward to visit there if you are just a single guy trying to meet someone there.",

Would it be more decent if the name was The Sports bar  It sounds not decent to me, but I do not know how it would be in their country, if it will sound decent to them or not, but not also bad, the name could just indicate that the bar are not for men but only women. It is still odd to me yet, because in bar generally, you can see men taking their woman there, no gender discrimination but just that bar is more of men place to go if compared to women, but women still always follow their men to bar very often. And nobody will arrest any women that go alone but women like avoiding going along due to one reason or the other which I find to be good.

But I just think that men nature and different from women nature, men like to bet, it is in our blood, women have light heart that do not like to undergo depression, women avoid that a lot than men. Although, if anyone gamble responsibly, no depression will occur.",
