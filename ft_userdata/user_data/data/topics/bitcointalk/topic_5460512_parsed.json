This is your Bitcoin address, it serves just like the bank account number where you would be able to receive your coin and send it to other addresses.

From the looks, seems OP has no idea how things works with bitcoin and Crypto in general. For OP to have dropped  wallet address here asking where to use it then it means OP might likely have no one to guide him or her.I would advise you OP that scammers might likely be sending you messages as you have made this post  as a newbie here but do not give in to them. Never you send your key phrase to anybody for any reason because once sent, it would be used to steal your funds and assets.Do well to also store your key phrase or better still use hardware wallet to save your funds and assets.",

That's what you call your bitcoin address, and as it starts with a  “bc1”, it is called “Bech32” or “Native Segwit”.We don't want to spoon feed newbies, however, there are a lot of members who already posted good links so help you understand it.

Op, make it a habit to copy and paste when writing or when giving your Bitcoin address to people who want to send you some Bitcoin. Keep in mind, a small mistake can make you lose the bitcoins you have, save the address private key carefully because it is the access to open your wallet.

Before knowing where to use a bitcoin address or what it does, you must confirm where you copied the address from. If you have copied this address from your wallet, you can use this address for BTC transactions. That is, if you buy BTC from someone or receive BTC payment, you must use the BTC address. If you don't have minimum idea about BTC transaction then don't be so busy about using this address first, first understand well about BTC transaction then you can do transaction using this address.",

But let me assume op made typo error. Op to not make a typo mistake when next you want to make use of your bitcoin address do well to copy and paste it, this address is like your normal bank account number which you use in depositing funds into your account and when making transaction if you miss a letter in the address or figure you either have your bitcoin lost or send to someone else's.QuoteYou can use bitcoin or bitcoin segwit, both are bitcoin addresses. The bitcoin is a legacy address, starting from 1, while bitcoin segwit is a native segwit version 0 address that start from bc1.Know that any other address on Binance are not bitcoin addresses, they are altcoins.Bonus:Use native segwit (bc1 addresses), for low transaction fee",

It’s like your bank account number to receive Bitcoin and you can access it through your private key. You can call it too as public key since that’s the information you can share in public while private key gives you access on that wallet.How do you know Bitcoin btw?

Make it a habit to review the addresses you use for the safety of your assets.The highlited part in your post is most important thing we should do and that's to double check the address even after copy pasting because single mistake can lead to loss of funds.Sometimes you miss a word from the start or end by mistake by clicking on cross button while pasting so the address won't be valid one which would result in payment going to wrong address that doesn't exist so recovery is not possible.",

You can't do anything with that if you have not the private key of this address, or a way to access funds into it if it's an address of an exchange or a custodial wallet. So be very careful, it could even be the address of someone trying to scam you. When you use Bitcoin it's always important to have the private key of the address or being able to fully deal with the way of acceding your funds.",
