  "content": "Unfortunately the fun is over for me. I was using the safepal app to use the binance supposed alleged decentralized exchange (bs) to use XMR to swap over but they ended that a few days ago by locking accounts unless KYC is provided... and I actually have some funds stuck on the exchange because of that. I can withdraw but some of the alt coins are frozen for some reason. Luckily I was able to withdraw my bitcoin. Anyways... so yeah. That's a no go. There is also the Incognito wallets exchange that has XMR but the fees from slippage are insane for larger amounts. What others are there that are tor friendly? Like I use a tor router that my computer connects to the internet to but some exchanges have not allowed me to make an account because I guess they think I'm in the USA trying to use tor to look I'm in another nation. I swear if I get rich I'm revoking my citizenship. This is ridiculous the amount of turmoil you have to go through to remain anonymous or not deal with KYC.",
