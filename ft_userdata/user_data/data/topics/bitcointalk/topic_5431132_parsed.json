The planned expenses are usually higher than normal because marketers take advantage of the season and increase the prices of their commodities and you spend more that usually budget. The unplanned in this season is that you may have some visitors either family or friends and will have to spend some more money entertaining them.

For people who have a strict budget for gambling, I would like to know if your budget for gambling has reduced, or if it remains the same?Its the festive season no doubt about that and yeah its comes with alot of unnecessary spendings, in my locality here the period is celebrated with so much festive activities and its celebrated mainly by christains and you wondering if the period has affected anyones gambling plans  totally depends how he or she feels about this period. For me i don't think its affects me in my gambling since gambling is not an act i put under my budget. While for others i think your topic is going to be the other way round especially if he or she does not gamble responsibly.",

I didn't spend anything on gambling 2 weeks ago as I bought a gift for someone I dearly wanna visit tomorrow, I would assume many of us are actually spending for gifts.There could be people not really putting much spending on Christmas gatherings.

However, that doesn't mean that there are times when I would like to celebrate a little bit more so I would spend a slightly higher amount. This isn't some grand deal though, I am not a whale, I can gamble with like 20-100 dollar range, which means I could maybe crack it over to 150 when the time comes and I feel like having some more fun but that's it. Which lesser than bets some people make here for each bet, hence its not really a life changing amount, I just do it to have fun, not to get rich.",

This festive season, I am trying to lay off the gambling platform and try to just go around town and discover some hidden spots that I can get some good food from. It's way cheaper and kind of relaxing, but gambling is just a lot entertaining and I really can't get off it that easily. Perhaps I might do a one time, big time before the end of the year, and spend maybe a thousand dollars in one sitting. Hopefully I don't get dumb enough to actually do that and waste my money for nothing.",

Now the Christmas festival has started. So Christians keep everything in their calculations. When a gambler gambles they know what amount of money they can spend. They make proper arrangements for it in advance. Normally gamblers are not affected much. But unexpected something run into some problems. If you are forced to spend a little more then gambling may have little effect. Many gamblers think that gambling can be done all year long but this day will never come again. But responsible gamblers prioritize their gambling above all else.",

Some persons might want to increase their stake because they want to increase their chances on winning big so that they can have money to spend this festive period. Others might spend less on gambling because they have used part of their budgeted funds for gambling to cater for some expenses during this celebration period. For me this festive period didn't affect my expenses on gambling because I already have a budget for it. And I have also learned to spend within my means or budget this festive period.
