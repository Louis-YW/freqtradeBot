Perhaps the people behind doesn't know about Bitcoin to be honest, and just used that domain name.And as others have said, it's business so they have to take that name to create a token on Ethereum.

It's an utility token for Bitcoin.com users and obvious money grab. I would have understood this if they had token model to begin with but this is so unnecessary and transparent. I am hoping they get sued for illegal sale of securities. And with their history of messing up, i would say there's a very good change for that.",

If I am able to recall correctly, bitcoin dot com was owned by BCH team (please correct me if I am wrong) but not sure on which token that you are referring to? They managed to add one more coin/token? I remember bitcoin got the development of having its own smart contract to issue token which will use bitcoin as gas for transacting but not sure about its implementation.Do you mean if that bitcoin dot com needs any new token then they should issue within bitcoin ecosystem?But, you need to remember that only bitcoin dot org is the official website of bitcoin and anyone may register bitcoin related domains like bitcoin.net or bitcoin.co.uk or anything similar to that which does not mean that they are all officially linked to bitcoin ecosystem but for some reasons (it can be for scamming purposes also) they have chosen bitcoin related domain hence we need to remain cautious when visiting a new domain, that's it.",

Honestly bitcoin.com is a BCH company more than it is a BTC company to be fair, and they are just doing silly stuff. I can say that bitcoin and crypto world in general is filled with morons, that is normal, there are a lot of naïve people as well, and that is normal, and it's filled with scammers too which is normal.Why are these all normal? Because, we have the same people in the fiat world as well and not a shocker, if we are all doing something in the fiat world, then that's normal. Scammers in crypto?
