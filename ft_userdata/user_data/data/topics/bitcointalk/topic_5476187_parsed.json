      "body": "We already have this thread here:  Paris 2024 Olympic üèä Discussion & Predictions ü§∫ Summer Games.But to answer your questions regarding the fastest man and woman, I haven't follow the men's division after Usain Bolt has retired. In the women's though, it's very interesting, it seems that Sha'Carri Richardson is dominating the women's field, and in the recent 2023 World Athletics Championships, Richardson beat her Jamaican rival, Shericka Jackson and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.And I think the rivalry will continue to the Olympics but Richardson has a good chance to be crown the fastest female athlete.",
