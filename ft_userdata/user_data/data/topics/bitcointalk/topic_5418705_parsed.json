My question here is what are the next AltCoins Gems for the people  in Q1 2023.  also, I stand to be corrected The best answer is go to coingecko or coinmarketcap. Observe low potential marketcap within the top 100. Why? These coins arent listed for a reason. Theres a chance to find a potential one on these projects. Check out their historical price and marketcap and the community interaction and if the team is still active and building on the development side.For sure youll see which one is a gem from a dead one.",

We're still in a bear market and that would be hard to figure out if you're trying to look for some assured answer because no one has an idea. The NFTs are done, the DeFis are done, and what's next? We don't know, web3 or what's with the next crazy that developers will make into the hype? Just be updated on what are the new projects are all about and that might help you give the idea.",

My question here is what are the next AltCoins Gems for the people  in Q1 2023.  also, I stand to be corrected LOL, I thought I will get some new topic here, in any case it was just the same questions we hear over and over again.And the same answer will be: No one really knows, we don't have the crystal ball to predict which coins or project will be the next hype one. So it's better to really do your own research and investigation. Look for websites that list potential next projects, dig deeper if it fall on your criteria, then invest and see how it goes.If not, then go on the next project, dissect everything. It might take sometime though, but the good thing is that we are in a bear market so some new projects might take sometime before they can grow.",

My question here is what are the next AltCoins Gems for the people  in Q1 2023.  also, I stand to be corrected Pay attention to coins in crowdfunding phase on well known platforms that are incharge of this service. Platforms like Binance launchpad or launch pool, CoinList etc  these platform aren't known for listing scam project instead they're known for the quality and we'll funded project they launch. If you're able to get your hands on this early investment and they turn out to be popular in the future, you'll profit big time. Not all project listed on this platform turn out to be great investment but chances are you could profit huge if they received massive hype from the cryptocurrency community when they're launched. Every altcoins no matter how good they're needs hype to bring profit as this hype is what attracts new investors that'll drive up the price as they try to get their hands on the new token therefore the best way to profit in times like this is to get in while the project aren't hyped yet.",

Invest on a blockchain project that suffers huge loss and disregard whether centralized or decentralized because it doesn't matter when the price is being considered because investors didn't care on those aspect besides the price alone.XRP and Solana for centralized blockchain and the rest will be all decentralized blockchain such as ETH, Polkadot, Avalance and Near.",
