I also believe there are a lot of traders here especially using the Elliot Wave method. Just make sure there will be some moderator to the channel to avoid spam or scams. I think it's better to drop the channel and it is open for everyone who wants to join.",

Most people want to learn from other people's ideas.",

Most people want to learn from other people's ideas.The possible problem would be this, as we know about the background of Telegram social media, there's a bunch of scammers or let's say, a house of scammers.  Though the concept is good I'm afraid it will end up in a pump and dump group which is the member will rely on other's opinion only and becomes the lazy one.

But a process whereby is a strategies to scam, it will be some else. Before someone will join their channel we have to scrutinized them and find out if this is real what is obtainable, because respected user of this noble institution is in lines with them, is very obvious that many users and especially newbies will like to pertake with this ideas. So therefore we need to be conscious about it.",

I think that the already existing telegram groups are enough for everyone to find for themselves what they want. You just need to make the right choice among the existing channels. The creation of a new channel and community will take a lot of time and it is not a fact that it will be successful.",
