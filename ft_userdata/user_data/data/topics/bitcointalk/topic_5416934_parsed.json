      "body": "I wouldn't be surprised if in many cases these sites can be accessed from countries where gambling is prohibited without vpn or anything else. Obviously, if you are in a country where gambling is forbidden, you'd better use vpn. But I say this because in Europe you can access many cryptocurrency casinos that theoretically could not operate. Only in some cases the site is blocked and you get a message saying that the site does not have a license to operate in the country, or something like that. Although I hope that this will change over the years and just as all, or practically all, fiat sites that cannot operate legally in the country because they do not have a specific licence are blocked, I am afraid that this will become generalised with crypto gambling sites.",

      "body": "First, I like to advise people that they should not engage in illegalities, what the authorities in your country do not permit is what you should avoid. The worst is to relocate if they are disturbing your happiness and freedom. This is important, especially for the future, who knows if any circumstances would cause the government to dig deep into the person's financial transactions, which might invite further trouble if laws are broken?That said, some countries would partially ban gambling, so you could still have some access, while the government will look away in most cases. Government officials could however be bribed or not bribed in the case of a partial banning, it does not matter, yet some gambling associations incentivised government officials to keep it that way. Nonetheless, in case it is totally banned, then all gambling sites known by the government would be blocked. You will need to rely on a VPN to access them. Just be careful not to be caught in that kind of illegality, the penalty might be severe in some countries.",

I know some countries that blocking gambling sites but mostly of users were using VPN to bypass it. There's no need a special attention from the developers about this case. The government will not trace your daily activities everyday lol. I think that is not a serious problem since even an easy solution like VPN has been solving everything related to this problem. You must aware about that too. The gambling developers were also creating alternatives domain to by pass the block too.",

      "body": "Different countries have their own regulations. Few of the gambling sites with cryptocurrency acceptance have provided mirror links through which users from specific countries can have access. Those sites take necessary measures if something is found wrong making use of VPN and other services to bypass the block.These days everything is well advanced and this lets people find an alternate way when there is access termination. I don't think these gambling platforms have made connection with the officials and police to continue their services.",

I think it actually depends, as different countries has different gambling rules for its citizens, whereas, some casinos has its own blacklisted regions for reasons best known to them alone, while some casinos allow the use of VPN, whereas others don't. So if you live in a country where gambling is not allow, then i think the best solution is to search for general casinos which allows the use of vpn, as this may be kind of risky sometimes if you happens to open an account with the wrong casino which could lead to frozen of fund or termination of accont. So it's advisable to kindly DYOR.",

Problem faced by OP almost the same with member using Binance exchange market, I use another way by access casino and Binance trough modify DNS setting. You can check your chrome browser and changed with DNS browser with cloudflare and you can find on google which one IP can adopted. I don't think this way the same like using VPN or not, but using VPN is violate from all casino gambling term of service, I don't recommended when your country banned access to casino gambling to use VPN because sometime your account will banned.",

We know that states that do not allow gambling are very strict when it comes to gambling and will never allow their citizens to gamble unless there are corrupt officials.Maybe because of the corrupt officers, the gambling site could survive because they had deposited \"security money\" with the officers to continue running their business safely. But if the corrupt officers are arrested, their businesses can be shut down by clean and honest officers.",

VPN is a double edged sword. A casino can easily turn a blind eye to VPNs, but in case of the smallest suspicion that something is wrong, KYC is asked and, since the user is not from an allowed country, he may get banned and the funds frozen/taken away. And the casinos have to do this because law enforcement can also try out their vigilance.So my take for the situation in \"that country\" is to consider electing better politicians next time.PS. The image is not accessible to me.",

I don't think they do. I think it'd be a lot better to expand their influence in places they already have a stable player base instead of spreading their influence in countries being tightly guarded, especially since it might cause some issues. I also don't think VPN is an option, afaik some casinos don't allow it and even if they do, you'd still be hit by KYC so if you state a fake country at registration then well, you've basically ruined your account. And if there ever was a trick to be used, it's probably called money.

I think that would work for physical casinos but rarely online? Most stuff online leaves a track after all that can't exactly be erased permanently and can easily lead to them being caught if investigated. Not that I really know much about it though, just giving what I think.",

For reliable and trusted online casinos, reputation can be more expensive than profit, so of course you can use a VPN, but exactly until the moment when you are asked for KYC and there may be an unsolvable problem that can lead to blocking your account and it's good if you manage to withdraw funds.",
