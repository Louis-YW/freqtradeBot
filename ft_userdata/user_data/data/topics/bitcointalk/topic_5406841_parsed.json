It's not the AML and KYC only, they will check your betting behaviors, the market your placed bets, time of placing bets and many more factors before giving you a final decision. In this case I think it is a statistically anomalous winning streak, and that is why they have started to investigate it. I don't know Betfury but if it is a legit site, after checking that the OP has done nothing wrong (if so), they will refund the money.

Quoting for visibility.You can update the OP and add the images. Maybe this is a case or maybe not. I am still waiting to see the development and the response from Betfury, if they have any forum account.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 19, 2022, 12:46:18 PMWhy checking betting behavior? I do not think that will be the reason. Just that betting sites do more check about the deposit after the depositor win and want to withdraw.It's a nice question and many fails to understand the reason. There are good reasons for casinos not to check when there are no win or an account is not making huge profit. A casino has thousands of bets from clients everyday. It's not possible for them to go and check every bet unless something alerts them.",

Nobody calls you a hacker or scammer but when you post something here in the scam section you need to post all your proofs and pieces of evidence so we can have a valid conversation, we can rely on your hearsay and admit it as true, now that you posted all your screenshots this makes your claim valid it stated that you'll have to wait 72 hours or more.I know the eagerness but it's the casino rules that they are implementing and since you are playing here you have to abide by it.",

The good thing is that support has assured you the check will take up to 7 days at most. I don't think it's just AML checks. They are probably looking into your betting patterns to be sure you are not cheating.With what you have experience with them, once you get your money, you could choose to play with another casino to avoid such inconveniences of having to wait for 7 days for checks to be complete.",

So you just need to follow the procedures. As for me you would have provided the website link although you are a newbie which you can not provide image or screenshot pictures but I still believe you can copy the conversation between you and the support team and quote it here for clear clarification. And also BetFury representative in the forum should say something about this allegation. If the BetFury manager in the forum has knowledge about the too, he or she can come and clear the air what really happened and also find solution for EthDoo. EthDoo, I will like you to wait for the 7days they promised if it has not elapsed but if it has elapsed then there is need for the gambling company to take a proactive measure to avoid bad reputation.",
