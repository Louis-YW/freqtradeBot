  "content": "It is very sad how goods and commodity prices increase on daily basis as these rise in price of things in the country have made life so hectic for the ordinary man.This has also devalued our currency as money is no longer enough for everyone. Sometimes before one receives salary they might have incured so many debts just to meet up life obligation then when they're paid they use their salary to pay the existing debt thereby may not have money to manage again the following month. This skyrocket of goods and services have really brought setback for most salary earners.The most annoying part is the fact that there are some food we produce locally like, garri, cucumber, potatoes, yam, and corn. Instead of selling this locally produced food at a considerable price they will begin to make comparison with foreign goods and then increase the prices of the locally produced foods.I suggest the government should moderate the price of goods and commodity and punish people that default the agreed price. Then locally made food should also be sold at a cheaper rate since it is being produced by local our farmers. Unlike people that buy goods and resell it, like for example if goods are bought at a rate of #100 and resell it for #120 it is understandable. But a farmer who produces this foods ought to sell it cheaper than the person that buys as resell.What's your own view?",

Sure, since our government have been failing us over the years, it is our duty to embrace digital skills and acquisition that will help us not only to make ends meet but also to broaden our knowledge on digital assets that will aid us in solving problems in the future",

You no dey get the full side to the story. Locally produced goods or not no mean say, the price gats drop when majority of the things you dey consume as per other commodities as well as, clothes, electronics and all na from outside you dey import am. Na the money you generate from these internally or locally made goods you go use buy the other foreign produced items way you need.Woman way plant pepper for en backyard, harvest the pepper and carry go sell for market, e go still need money to buy cream way e go use rub e Pikin? If e sell the pepper cheap, where e go get the balance to add up and buy the cream.The solution na simply to be more productive on the things we consume. If our import drop and export increase, we go do well and our currency go add value to itself small because, people go dey buy we naira.",
