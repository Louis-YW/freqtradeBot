Stuff like this is impossible in my area since crypto is banned as a form of payment. But even if it was not, it is also difficult since crypto is yet to be a mainstream alternative for payment. Assuming everything is ideal, I guess you can offer them some loyalty points too? The rewards depend on how your business is doing. It is kinda hard to encourage people to use Bitcoin or crypto for works like that imo. I believe it is easier if you just set up a payment gateway that accepts fiat and buys crypto for you periodically. Even if they use apps that support crypto, the majority of the customers probably only use them for services like online marketplace, VPN, etc.",

Don't expect to find people who will give you work and pay you in Bitcoins, very rare for that to happen.Only places that pay for work in bitcoin are crypto companies like exchanges.

The easiest means of earning Bitcoin is to offer services that are related to blockchain or Bitcoin. This is because people who need these services might somehow own some Bitcoin to pay for the services. I don't know how many persons that need the services you are proposing own bitcoin. For them to enjoy the discount you are offering they have to change from fiat money to bitcoin before payment, this will be ambiguous. For me, your focus should be on offering competitive prices for your service which will attract more customers to you. As they pay for the service with fiat you can easily buy Bitcoin with what you have earned. Nevertheless giving customers diverse payment options is not a bad option.In my area, the Bitcoin payment option will not be a good idea because the government has enacted unfriendly policies that negatively affect Bitcoin. Although we have a high population of crypto owners, using Bitcoin for payments is unpopular. The coin is mainly used as an investment or hedge against inflation.",

Discounts in this season? even black Friday deals from many outlets did not offer so much discounts, and discounts have to be very attractive to get customers. I suggest that you increase or raise the price for your services right now above the normal, and then offer to still accept the old pay-rate for your service if your customer is to pay with cryptocurrency. Everyone knows that the economy is poor and the cost of many services have been forced to increase due to the cost of things and materials, thy will be happy to still be able to pay the old rate for services.",

Do not sell on a loss. As long as you do not do that, you will have the same amount of Bitcoin as you did before. Many traders burn through their money just with trading fees because they feel the need to trade 20x a day to make a 1% profit but end up losing much much more in trading fees. They basically grind away their coins because they are trading without a strategy and without extensive knowledge of trading.Although thats basically how I learned trading.

It may not be worth your time and effort to provide value, as giving a discount/promo means receiving less pay for the same work, which could negatively impact your business. Some people may be interested in availing of the discount, but it depends on whether they have access to many options to buy Bitcoin in their area and if it's worth their time. On the other hand, some may ignore your discount due to their hesitancy towards using or buying Bitcoin, especially if it's a new concept. Fear of the unknown can discourage people from trying out new things.If you're considering offering a discount, a discount of 30% or higher may encourage more people to use Bitcoin as payment, especially if many are willing to sell their labor at a discounted price.",
