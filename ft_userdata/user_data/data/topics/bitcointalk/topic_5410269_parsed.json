  "content": "Trezor and Ledger are the two most popular brands in the hardware wallet niche. Both manufacturers have their positives and negatives, but what do their Terms of Service agreements and Privacy Policies say?Yes, those boring lists of rules you are asked to accept and must follow to keep using a service. Since most people don’t like reading those, I have decided to take a look at the ones provided by both Trezor and Ledger and highlight some of the most interesting findings, be it good or bad. I will copy/paste parts of the TOSs and Privacy Policies and offer my views on the content.Additionally, I find Foundation Devices very appealing, so I will also take a look at them.   Let’s get straight to it and look at the Terms and Conditions.TrezorTrezor’s official website links to 3 different TOS documents:Website Terms of UseTrezor Shop Terms and ConditionsTrezor Suite Terms and ConditionsWebsite Terms of UseQuoteWe are not responsible for the content of any sites that may be linked to from the Website or any bulletin board or forum associated with us or the Website.QuoteIn addition, a link to any other website does not imply that we endorse or accept any responsibility for the content or use of such other website. In no event shall any reference to any third party or third-party product or service be construed as our approval or endorsement of that third party or of any product or service provided by a third party.In other words, all content you find on Trezor’s website is there for informational purposes only. Trezor provides no guarantees about the quality, security, or accuracy of the information or the services. QuoteUnder no circumstances shall any information on the Website or provided to you by us constitute financial, investment or professional advice, unless explicitly stated so.Just because a particular site, coin, or service is mentioned doesn’t mean Trezor is advertising or suggesting people should invest in it. QuoteWe are not obliged to fulfill any of our obligation under these Terms of Use, if temporarily or permanently prevented by vis maior - event or circumstance that is extraordinary, unforeseeable and unpreventable by usual means and with proper care, and that occurred independently of our will; such vis maior event is, among other things, a serious hacking attack or power shortage.Vis major is described as “natural occurrences that cause damage and are neither caused nor preventable by humans.” Trezor considers a “serious hacking attack” (something caused by humans that can be prevented by proper security measures) as vis major. Trezor is not responsible for any issues caused by hacking incidents on the website.   Trezor Shop Terms and ConditionsQuoteyou are entitled to withdraw from the Contract within fifteen (15) days from the date on which you or a third party named by you who does not deliver the products has taken the possession of the products.If you are unsatisfied with your Trezor HW, you can return it within 15 days of receiving it.QuoteIn order to qualify for a full refund, the products must be returned unused and sealed in the original packaging, with all the original materials provided in their complete condition.You will only receive a full refund if the package wasn’t opened and the device wasn’t used. QuoteWe shall not be responsible for any incidental or consequential damages which are incurred and/or have occurred in connection with the product or its purchase. We assume no responsibility for any loss or costs due to a third party's or the customer's loss of profit, or any other indirect cost or losses, however incurred.  Trezor is not responsible for any losses you incur when using their devices. If you lose money for any reason, you can’t hold Trezor accountable. The next part concerns returning defective products and who bears the cost for those.QuoteThe costs incurred in connection with returning the product to us and back to you shall be always borne by you. If we find out that the product was defective or damaged and the damage or defect is covered by the Liability for Defects and/or Commercial Warranty, you are entitled to a refund of the necessary shipping costs.Whenever you return a device under warranty that is not working as it should, you have to pay for the shipping fees. After Trezor inspects the device, they will refund the shipping charges only if the damage is covered by the warranty agreement. QuoteIf we conclude within the product inspection that the returned product was not damaged or defective or that the damage or defect is not covered by the Liability for Defects and/or Commercial Warranty, the costs for returning the product to you shall be due in advance, before we send the product back. In such an event and at our sole discretion, we might offer you a discount on a new product purchase as compensation for not returning the item to you.  If Trezor concludes that the device is not broken or the damage is not covered by the warranty, the shipping costs will not be returned, and you have to pay additional shipping fees to ship the product back to you.Trezor Suite Terms and ConditionsQuote…we strongly recommend creating a recovery seed and setting up a PIN as described below to keep your cryptocurrency coins safe. If you continue using the Device with Suite without further protection and back up, we shall assume no liability for any damage incurred as a consequence thereof. This is a warning to create a recovery seed and a PIN to keep your crypto safe. Personal opinion: knowing that Trezor has an unsolvable vulnerability that can be mitigated by extending the seed with a passphrase, it would be desirable that Trezor mention the importance of using a passphrase. QuoteYou may at any time after your Device initialization create a recovery seed – a chain of randomly selected words. Recovery seed enables you to recover the information stored on your Device. Without a recovery seed, you may not recover information stored in your Device and your wallet and your cryptocurrency coins stored in the wallet may be lost forever. Is it possible to use a Trezor for receiving and sending coins without having previously created a seed? This part of their TOS makes it sound like it is. If so, it’s something I really don’t like. It reminds me of a case of a user who made a thread a few years ago in which he lost access to his coins because his Coinbase wallet allowed him to start using it before creating a recovery phrase.QuoteWe shall not under any circumstances be held liable to you for any direct, indirect, special, consequential, punitive or any other damages and costs including but not limited to loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunity arising out of or in connection with your access and use or inability to access and use of Suite services.Trezor is not responsible for any losses that might result from using Trezor Suite.QuoteUnder no circumstances shall any information within Suite and/or Website or provided to you by us constitute financial, investment or professional advice, unless explicitly stated so.Nothing you see written, mentioned, or promoted in the Trezor Suite shall be considered a good investment. QuoteYou must not endeavor to abuse any respective cryptocurrency network including but not limited to sending the cryptocurrency coins to multiple addresses at once (double spending). You are not allowed to double-spend transactions with the Trezor Suite. Probably not to others or yourself.LedgerSimilarly to Trezor, Ledger also has 3 different Terms of Use on its official website:Sales Terms and ConditionsWebsite Terms of UseLedger Live Terms of UseDepending on the payment method used for the purchase, a service provider called Flow can be utilized. If that is the case, the following TOS will be in effect:International Order Terms and Conditions When Flow is the Seller of the Goods Sales Terms and ConditionsThese terms are in effect when the purchase is made via Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Bitpay, and PayPal. If the customer uses any other payment method, Flow’s TOS applies. QuoteIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 221-18 of the French Consumer Code, you have the right to withdraw from the contract within a period of fourteen (14) days without reason and without bearing any costs, except for the costs of returning the Product, if necessary. The aforementioned period runs from the day of receipt of the Product by you or by a third party, other than the carrier, designated by you.If you are unsatisfied with your Ledger wallet, you have the right to return it within 14 days of it being delivered to you for any reason. You will get your money back, but you might be required to pay the return shipping costs. QuoteThe costs of return of the Product are at your own expense. You must return the Product in perfect condition in its original packaging.You can even return a used device (since they don’t mention that the box can’t be opened) as long as it’s in perfect condition and in the original box.QuoteWe will reimburse you for all amounts received, including delivery charges, within fourteen (14) days from the date we were notified of your withdrawal decision, but we may defer the refund until we have received the Product.This statement is a bit contradictory compared with the previous one above, which says “you have the right to withdraw from the contract within a period of fourteen (14) days without reason and without bearing any costs, except for the costs of returning the Product, if necessary\". Here it’s said they will reimburse you for all costs, but apparently, that’s not always the case.QuoteTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LEDGER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, VALUE OR DATA, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. Ledger is not responsible for any losses you incur using their products. That includes the loss of customer data. I wonder if they added this “data” part to the TOS following their data leak fiasco!?QuoteTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LEDGER’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING FROM THESE TC’s, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO PURCHASE THE PRODUCT.If I understood correctly, if you lose all your coins with a Ledger HW, the company is only liable to (maybe) compensate you for the amount you spent to purchase your hardware wallet.QuoteYOU EXPRESSLY RELIEVE LEDGER, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY AND GUARANTEE THEM AGAINST ANY CLAIM, PROCEEDINGS OR LEGAL ACTION ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE USE OF THE PRODUCTS OR FOLLOWING A BREACH OF THESE TC’s, INCLUDING ANY LIABILITY AND FINANCIAL CHARGE RESULTING FROM CLAIMS, LOSSES OR DAMAGES, PROCEEDINGS AND JUDGMENTS, AND LEGAL AND ATTORNEY’S FEES.This again confirms that Ledger is not to be held responsible for any losses the customer incurs by using Ledger HWs.Website Terms of UseQuoteThe information included on the Site does not constitute legal, financial or investment advice and is not intended as a recommendation for buying, trading or selling crypto assets. It is recommended to seek advice from legal and financial experts before starting buying, trading or selling crypto assets. Ledger SAS, Ledger Technologies Inc., and all other companies mentioned on the Site will not be responsible for the consequences of reliance upon any opinion or statement contained herein or for any omission.Additionally:QuoteAny loss of data, crypto assets or profit is your sole responsibility.No information on the site shall be considered as a recommendation to invest in a particular asset, and Ledger is not responsible for the results of any such actions by the customers. Ledger Live Terms of UseQuoteNo liability... For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding the generality of the Limitation of Liability under these Terms, you hereby agree that Ledger shall have no liability for any loss that incurs as a consequence of the risks highlighted in this section and/or your failure to follow the recommendations herein.Ledger is not responsible for any losses you incur while using Ledger Live.QuoteLedger may perform code reviews and conduct security audits of Device Applications available on Ledger Live Manager, which does not constitute any kind of endorsement nor any guarantee that those applications are risk-free. Ledger does not warranty that Device Applications will be maintained over time and reserves the right to restrict or suspend access to them from Ledger Live for any reason for as long as deemed necessary.This refers more to 3rd-party applications. Ledger does not guarantee they are safe to use, and they have the right to suspend and remove them from the Ledger Live Manager if they see fit. QuoteLedger is not responsible for the content, accuracy, security, availability, any performance, or failure to perform of the Third Party Services or any issue in relation with the use of Third Party Services. Ledger does not provide any guarantees that access to Third Party Services will not be interrupted or that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions, corruption or loss of transmitted information, data or funds, and Ledger shall not be liable for any such Third Party Services. You agree to use the Third Party Services at your own risk. It is your responsibility to review the third party’s terms and policies before using a Third Party Service.And:QuoteTo the extent you choose to use such Third Party Services, you acknowledge that Ledger is not responsible for any issue in relation with the use of such Third Party Services, including any loss of funds.Ledger is neither responsible nor liable nor guarantees for the 3rd-party services they have partnered with in Ledger Live (swaps, NFTs, buying, selling, exchanging coins, staking, etc.). They should be used at your own risk.  Regarding staking, Ledger Says:QuoteNo guarantee of Rewards. LEDGER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE STAKING REWARDS OR ANY STAKING REWARD RATES. SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE REWARDS IS SUBJECT TO THE PROOF-OF-STAKE NETWORKS AND IS NOT UNDER LEDGER’S CONTROL.And:QuoteNo custody. Ledger will never take custody over any of your rewards or assets and Ledger has no responsibility or control over any Proof-of-Stake network on which Ledger may exercise validation rights delegated by you.Ledger doesn't guarantee nor are they responsible for paying out staking rewards. Ledger also doesn't have custody of staked coins, nor can they take control of them. QuoteYOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT LEDGER AND ITS DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES…Ledger states one more time they are not responsible for any losses or damages that could result from the use of Ledger Live. However, there is also this:QuoteTHE ABOVE LIMITATIONS DO NOT APPLY IN RESPECT OF LOSS RESULTING FROM (A) LEDGER’S FRAUD, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD; OR (B) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY.I wonder if having their servers hacked or data stolen by their employees and or partner companies can be considered gross negligence? Or if a person gets physically attacked and robbed due to data released about them following Ledger's data leak?  Foundation DevicesFoundation Devices’ TOS can be found below:Terms of UseQuoteFoundation Devices further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item.Foundation doesn’t provide additional information for this part. But according to their TOS, if you order 10 devices, they have the right to ship to you only 7, for example, for any reason, and they aren’t required to inform you about this.  QuoteIN NO EVENT WILL WE (AND OUR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SITE ARE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.And:QuoteYou hereby release and forever discharge us (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or relates directly or indirectly to, any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Service users or Third Party Sites & Advertisements.Foundation can’t be held responsible for any and all damages caused to you for using their website and services.QuoteNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION), WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS ($100) OR (B) AMOUNTS YOU’VE PAID FOUNDATION DEVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12 MONTHS PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DAY THE CLAIM AROSE (IF ANY).

YOU AGREE THAT OUR SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.If Foundation is found guilty of any damages caused to the user, said user will be compensated with no more than $100 or the amount they paid for their hardware wallet(s).Privacy PoliciesWith the TOS agreements out of the way, we can now check out what is stated in the Privacy Policies of the 3 companies.TrezorTrezor’s Privacy PolicyQuoteThe collection of your personal data in connection to the use of the Website and access to and use of the Services is as limited as possible.

This is the first time I hear about that site. I took a quick look at it and it really seems like a good idea that a service like that exists. It makes things easier to understand what it is that you agree with when you use a particular service. Although you really can't and shouldn't expect that you give consent to something good and positive that will benefit you.Quote from: dkbit98 on August 19, 2022, 08:18:06 PMNice work collecting this, and maybe you can add few more hardware wallets like Coldcard and Keystone.

      "body": "I would like to ask Trezor users for their feedback regarding the below part of Trezor's TOS. Here is the same part of the TOS that was mentioned in the OP.QuoteYou may at any time after your Device initialization create a recovery seed – a chain of randomly selected words. Recovery seed enables you to recover the information stored on your Device. Without a recovery seed, you may not recover information stored in your Device and your wallet and your cryptocurrency coins stored in the wallet may be lost forever. I know that Coinbase allows its users to go ahead and use their wallet without creating and verifying their seed, and it's a bad feature to have in a wallet. Is it possible that Trezor does it as well? Can you start using your HW without generating a seed beforehand? If we check what was said above, it says that you \"may\" create a recovery seed. \"May\" means there is a possibility or a permission to do something. The TOS doesn't say you \"must\" or you \"are required\" to create a seed. Does the software really offer you an option to skip the seed generation or is it just an unlucky combination of words they used in their TOS?",

Trezor Suite informs the user that the wallet is almost ready and then you have two choices: create a backup (recovery phrase) or skip backup. Even if you click on the \"Create backup\" button and the software tells you about what a seed is, there is a \"Skip Backup\" button at the bottom. You can see it at 5:33 in the video. So it does indeed seem possible to set up and maybe begin using a Trezor without generating a recovery phrase just like I initially thought after reading that part of their TOS.",

This can easily be checked by contacting the customer service departments of some of the most popular hardware wallet manufacturers and simply ask them if they can ship to PO boxes or not. Judging by some other information I found in the past, I think Trezor might still ship to PO boxes while Ledger is less likely to do so because the shipping carriers they work with don't deliver to such destinations in many countries. So, it doesn't depend so much on the business you are buying from as it does on the shipping carrier I would assume.I am still waiting on a Trezor user to confirm the above assumption whether or not it's possible to skip the seed creation process and start using the HW without generating and backing up a seed first...",

And yes you can. They even mention how bad it is to do it in one of their blogs.https://blog.trezor.io/broken-hardware-wallet-dont-panic-602d23090341QuoteMaking secure backupsHaving a backup of your keys is the only way to ensure that future you will be able to access them, no matter what happens. When you set up your Trezor for the first time, you will be prompted to create a backup. This step is not optional: if you skip it, it will not be safe to transfer coins to an address created by your device.I look at it 2 ways. 1st is it's your device and your BTC trezor is not your mom so they cannot and should not make you do things.The 2nd is something I have mentioned before. People are used to loosing / forgetting passwords and usernames and all you need to do is click a few buttons and whatever online service will be more then happy enough to reset it for you. How many times have we seen it here with people asking for support because they forgot something and now can't get to their wallet. Allowing people, who may not understand, to do something that can have severe financial consequences when making sure they do something does not take any time or effort on the part of the wallet manufactures is just a crap idea.-Dave",

Very few people do that. It would make sense if you are ordering a lot of goods to make it worth it. If you are in fact renting and paying for the property. Alternatively, if there is an old and abandoned house somewhere, you could have the package shipped to its location. In both cases, the courier probably needs a signature from you, so someone would have to be there at the time of delivery. In some countries, the courier delivers the package to a neighbor or nearby business owner and informs you where you can pick it up.Some other things you could do is have the package ordered and delivered to a cafe or a restaurant, for example. That's easy if you know the people who work there and you arrange it with them to pick up your stuff if you don't mind them seeing what you have ordered. I think someone recommended ordering to the reception desk of a big hotel or local company as well.",
