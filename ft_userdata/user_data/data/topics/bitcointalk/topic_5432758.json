  "content": "I saw recently that the long wish of The Pharmacist -- to have a new name -- was finally approved. He became The Sceptical Chymist.Then, by pure chance, while browsing bpip.org I saw the following: at first glance, a wall of users, including me, which no longer trusted fbeyvgnobo (obviously, this implied that they previously trusted that user):However, I was 100% sure that I never trusted fbeyvgnobo before, thus it was impossible to distrust this user now. So I kept scrolling down on bpip, searching mainly for my name. Among other entries, I found the following:However, I knew that I made to change to my Trust list. I also noticed the very short time interval between those changes. Anyway, I remembered, by seeing the name The Sceptical Chymist, that The Pharmacist requested a long time ago a name change with this one. So I understood why bpip was showing that I trust The Sceptical Chymist. However, the rest of information (why I previously distrused The Sceptical Chymist plus the trust / distrust of fbeyvgnobo) were still unknown to me. For a while I believed that bpip was showing incorrect information.But soon after I found this topic: The long waited Nickname has been given (The Sceptical Chymist), which confirmed to me that Pharmacist's wish was approved. But one post confused me even more (highlight is mine):Quote from: PX-Z on December 09, 2022, 07:47:06 AMFor those who asked about the former The Sceptical Chymist, he is now @fbeyvgnobo, what a username made by theymos lol. Here's his post on the request thread[2], with the quotes confirming his former username.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5426440.msg61414870#msg61414870[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5312089.msg61247685#msg61247685So I thought that, for some reason, theymos trolled The Pharmacist, by allowing him a name change, but that was to fbeyvgnobo -- which was definitely not the one he wanted -- then finally allowed him the wanted name. At least, that was logic for me and it could also explain why bpip was showing me trusting fbeyvgnobo then distrusting him (as I previously had The Pharmacist on my Trust list, the trust was spread to fbeyvgnobo, then to The Sceptical Chymist, which also implied to distrust fbeyvgnobo).But this logic could not explain to me why user fbeyvgnobo still exists! And, furthermore, he also has 1 post! I said okay, if theymos changed Pharmacist's name to fbeyvgnobo then to The Sceptical Chemyst, then fbeyvgnobo should not exist anymore. As The Pharmacist also does not exist anymore after this change. Yet, fbeyvgnobo still exists.So I also considered that my judgement and logic are wrong. I tried to search for more references to fbeyvgnobo in the two links mentioned in the quote from PX-Z but I found nothing.After days of trying to solve this puzzle, I give up So, as a sum-up:- The Pharmacist became The Sceptical Chemyst, while previously being named, for a short while, as fbeyvgnobo- The Pharmacist does not exist anymore- fbeyvgnobo still exists.Does anyone know how this is possible? (Or, in case I understood everything wrong, can someone explain the entire situation to me?)",

Yet, as far as I know, this never happened for any of earlier name changes which occurred. And I remember some of them -- Cryptovator (which had two name changes! ), The Bearded Baby, El duderino_, BitcoinGirls.Club... and maybe some more. And in none of these cases was created a fake account... At least, I am not aware of that nor about any similar topic started for any of those name changes...Quote from: Lafu on January 02, 2023, 05:53:42 PMIn the same time i have added you , as i would doing that already a long time ago.I noticed that and I want to thank you for trusting my judgement enough, in order to add me to your Trust list.Quote from: Lafu on January 02, 2023, 05:53:42 PMI guess only theymos maybe can explain whats happend with the Account of fbeyvgnobo.He certainly knows, but I don't know if he will get involved in this discussion... let's wait for a few more replies, maybe someone clears the mystery...",

Obviously Theymos had to change the username of that newbie before giving it to TP. Something might happen in this transition period.",

Theymos changed the Newbie's name to <smash his keyboard>, after which he could change The Pharmacist to the desired name.The \"no longer trusting fbeyvgnobo\"-thing never happened. You only saw this on BPIP.org, not on Bitcointalk. As far as I know, BPIP's DefaultTrust Change Log gets it's data from Default trust breakdown and Trust settings in Hierarchical view. I'm not sure about the former, but the latter isn't updated instantly.

Most likely, the UID is the primary key in the forum database in the members table. However, BPIP appears to log changes based on the account name. There isn't any rule against changing a p key, but it is best if they are immutable. I am not sure if it is possible to track changes to trust lists based on the UID. In any case, BPIP appears to have failed to detect the name change and included entries on its log that did not actually happen.",

So we can say that The Pharmacist's luck was, in fact, that Newbie!  As, without having the Newbie registering the name wanted by The Pharmacist, who knows for how long theymos would have kept him to continue the waiting. So it was a troll, yes; it was (partially) amusing, yes; but without this \"incident\" we could still see now The Pharmacist instead of The Sceptical Chymist Quote from: LoyceV on January 04, 2023, 07:49:15 AMThe \"no longer trusting fbeyvgnobo\"-thing never happened.
