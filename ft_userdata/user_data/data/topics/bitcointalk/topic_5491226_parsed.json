  "content": "During my job hunting era, I had this friend who we were into the job hunting together later on we departed variously aftermath I found a petty paying job which was better of comparing to my idleness (jobless). Time goes by when I learnt about Bitcoin and then I invested with the little I could afford.It was amazing to see my asset growing which attracted me to keep holding, buying more and accumulating.Thereafter the portfolio of my holding has smiles more than my job could be.Within a year I met that of my old time job hunter friend but was already married then. So we discussed about life but yet things are not still alright with her because she is just a house wife whose husband does not want her to work for anyone. The husband was either a jealous one or being overprotective to his wife at such course.She was so curious and inquisitive to learn about Bitcoin because she found it flexible to run considering her husbands decision and also stress economical unlike the conventional traders who has to labour and strategies on how to attract customers to them as business strategies is demanded just after I also shared about my Bitcoin journey with her.I told her about the primary ethics and the elementary terms of Bitcoin and its potentials including the risks.She decided to accept digging into it believing that if the Bitcoin markets can favour all of its Investors without being sentimental of favouring others while other investors are left behind and most especially as there is no business strategies in the Bitcoin investment then she would not mind investing in it. As I told her to begin investing with what is affordable to loose, she began to cut cost of expenses from the groceries funds from her husband.She was able to buy $10 of Bitcoin per week unfailingly and in less than 3 months, she was able to hit an income of 80% from her capital Invested without the knowledge of her husband.There she found trust in the Bitcoin industry and then she told her husband that she has Bitcoin knowledge and knows about the industry so her husband can fund her to Invest on it so that she can also be financially independent .Her husband was able to raise her $1K which she had it to accumulate more of Bitcoins using the DCA accumulating method and has also diversified her digital assets.In less than a year, she called and told me that she felt being in the dark all those years when she has not been to the industry and now she is, she feels being in the light.She basically buttressed more at how amazing someone can just Invest with a minimum amount and just matter of patient boom... You get to smile with the profitable potentials in the industry.She felt regreted not to had embraced the industry before that time. I also let her know that such has been most of the Bitcoin investors expressions. We all doubted, ignored or were not in opportune to the industry earlier back then.As at this time, she own a conventional trading firm where people works for her and she calls her self the BOSS LADY. Lol!Interestingly... Her husband said she can not sideline him in that lucrative Bitcoin investment so him too has partake to also investing in the Bitcoin industry.",

I assume she was able to make such a profit within three months because she was fortunate to buy the coin during this period when the price of Bitcoin was rising. I hope she is aware there is a time called bear run when she would have to wait for several months or even years before she could make a profit. However, congratulations to your friends.",

Well, Bitcoin truly has changed so many peoples life and is still changing, so long you are willing to embrace its power and invest in it for a longer term. Bitcoin over the years has created so many opportunities for a lot of individuals who understands how it works and understands the market. Though just as @Fiatless had said hope she and her husband are aware of the bear market where everything isn't fine because it seems they had invested during the time Bitcoin experienced its current bull and thus, thy have to also be ready for a bear market.They should know that the best way to enjoy your Bitcoin investment is by buying and holding for the long term and continue accumulating using any methods that best suits them. DCA is the best so they don't have to worry too much but set a particular amount of money and amount of funds to invest.",

I mean I have seen women happily wasting their time, doing nothing, not participating in the economy, housewives,s or housework (only) making them tired. I know many will judge me for saying it, but cooperating with each other, and helping each other, supporting each other, makes one house economically better. Then a domino effect started and every other house in the colony will start to live better. As a whole, the economy will be better. By helping each other, and supporting each other, regardless of relations, gender, and ego, people grow. For example, if you had not have talked to her about BTC then she might not have been a firm trader by now. I am glad she opened a firm just by DCAing $10 a week. That's so unbelievable, that I am starting to think its just another April fool story. haha.",

Glad to see that her investment did not just stop with profits but she also found a new career path. It’s quite rare to see women into investment sector especially in crypto even if there were, we don’t often hear about them so it is nice to hear there are very strong and smart women out there making their place into the crypto space.And it must feel really nice op to have helped a friend and see her succeed beyond imagination.",

Does it mean that bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme, that you invest little and in few months you make millions.This story is too long to be cooked, investing in bitcoin is not as easy as your story says. This is because for you to have a good profit from bitcoin, you must be a long term hodler, and not a short-term. From the way you sound your friend is a short-term investor, or did she trade to make such profit, I guess not.",

Starting with just a small amount of investment, she was able to gradually build her portfolio and achieve significant returns, all while managing her household responsibilities. I want to put more emphasis on the transformation here because we all invest for profit but not all of us are able to make Bitcoin a source of positive transformation in life. This journey serves as an inspiring example of the potential for individuals to achieve financial independence and success through cryptocurrency investment. Consistency is the key!

I can agree with you that not every forum memebers that likes or enjoys reading long texts such as this, the truth is I was also one of a kind that doesn't like reading long texts too but coming to be a member of this forum has nortured my reading and writing habit to adapting to long readings and writings. The forum actually has lot of effects to its users and in here I was also thought to exercise patient with my holding which has also inspired me on holding my assets longer as much as I can now else I was not one of the kind.Maybe I should say I am being possesed with the forum at  all courses. Lol.Well... My apologies if my long texts has been so unaccommodating to reading by those memebers who finds it stressful.
