Endorphina is a known slot provider to me and, I think, to many people on this forum, so it's nice to have an Official Representative of Endorphina here on bitcointalk.Here's my question, to start up a conversation, I guess. As I see, most, if not all, Endorphina slots have RTP of 96%, and my question is, is it changing over time? I mean, are there some periods of time for some slots when their RTP is much higher for promotional reasons, and if yes, are there announcements in advance about that?",

Because it really attracts the attention of potential new users, like me for example.Endorphina is just a slot provider and deposit bonus is responsibility of the casino since casino is just using there software in there website and the bonuses such as deposit bonuses that you are asking is the casino responsibility. You can ask them question about there slots such as bug, functionality or your experience and not things that related on the casino feature.I’m surprised that endorphina starts there ANN thread which makes forum member life easier in case they have problem on there slot games. Dealing provider issue is very before since players can’t communicate directly to provider which always result to a very long process of waiting.",

Hopefully, your business can be more advanced and better in the future and can be one of the recommended casinos. By the way, when is Endorphina birthday?Maybe just a suggestion. If Endorphina really celebrates a birthday, it means a special moment for the site and maybe you can gift new users who join your site as a welcome greeting. This will be an offer that attracts them But it's up to you and the team. Oh yeah, I didn't see your TOS. Can you add it to your site if you haven't created one yet? This is also information to us about the rules in your casino because I think the rules will be a little different from other casinos.",

I believe they are in package deal once you purchase a casino program to a developer. The purpose of this thread is clearly stated on the OP. They are looking for a client casino but rather they want to connect to all the players to answer question, receive feedback and to attract more user to use there slot by doing some announcements here. The competition of game provider is very tough because they are already saturated on the casino. Endorphina is one of the old slot provider that I know that still exist but new providers is now dominates the market with there new flashy slot games.",
