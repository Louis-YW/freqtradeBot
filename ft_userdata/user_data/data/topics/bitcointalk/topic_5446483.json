  "content": "It has been more than a month that @pakhitheboss talked about vanished Merit source on our local board with this topic. The concern!Already due to Indian government cracking the crypto community a lot of high ranking members have now become inactive. There are a few instances when suddenly they rise from their hibernation and reply on important topics. Most of them are not active and don't care what is happening on Bitcointalk or the local board.   The problem!These high ranking forum members are Merit source for our local board. You can check @Heisenberg_Hunter or other merit source activity. They are either aloof or not active.  The solutions according to me. @theymos should assign a new merit source on the local board, who is active and has been trying to make the board active. There should also be a dedicated moderator as this board is subjected to spam. I hope he checks this big issue if he wants members like us to make this board more engaging.",

But that's not a good reason, theymos may likely want to add merit source in local board if there's a lot activity and high quality posts.However, you guys are using English language to posts, if you think there's an unmerited quality post, you can report it on this thread [self-moderated] Report unmerited good posts to Merit SourceQuote from: Rikafip on March 15, 2023, 08:16:46 AMPost activity per local board during February 2023",

Instead of waiting for theymos to find you someone who would be a good merit source you should choose someone among yourselves who is active and shares merit regularly and tell him to make a merit source application. The same thing should be done for getting your own moderator, but chances of that actually hapening are slim to none as our local board (Croatian) is way more active than yours and despite that we are waiting for years to get our own local mod again after Lauda got removed.",

Most of them are not active and don't care what is happening on Bitcointalk or the local board.  Are they inactive, or not participating in the local forum? They are two different things.An inactive user means that you don't log in to the forum. Another thing is the user, not participating in the local tab of his country/language.There are many users who prefer global tabs over local tabs.Then, the sources of merits, are not intended for a local tab but for the entire forum.Although I understand the fact that our local tab is not very active. Try to make quality posts in your local tab, and maybe that will help attract more users there.",

I have seen that there is also problems with his application regarding to the lost charity donations that he needs to explain.Based on this thread , it was made few years ago and up until now he is still pending for application maybe due to the issue or maybe @theymos no longer wanted to add more merit source. IDK which one but it seems that it was the case.",

Instead of requesting this to theymos, why don't you apply for being a merit source or ask any of your local board user to apply for merit source. That would help getting a merit source for your local. Requesting here wouldn't work I think. theymos would look at merit source application. With this thread, I doubt you will get the attention from theymos.Follow the merit source application and apply. If theymos thinks Indian local board needs a merit source and the applicant is a best fit, he will assign.",

When merit system was a few months old, there were opportunities for Full Member of Senior Member successfully applied to be merit sources. Now such chance gone.Your suggestion is valid that OP should ask his legendary local members to apply for Indian merit source.One member I can think of:Heisenberg_Hunter",

Since I'm a lazy merit backstabber and hoarder I can merit quite a ton of those if you can make a list of 10-20.",
