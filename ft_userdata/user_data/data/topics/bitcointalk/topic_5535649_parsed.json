Jameson outlines scenarios where quantum computers could potentially exploit Bitcoin's current cryptographic vulnerabilities to access funds, especially those in addresses with exposed public keys. Lopp argues that permitting such quantum-based recovery would lead to wealth redistribution favouring entities with early access to quantum technology, undermining Bitcoin's principles of decentralisation and property rights. He proposes some measures, such as implementing quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes, something that is relatively trivial, but above all, potentially rendering vulnerable funds (such as Patoshi funds), unspendable, to preserve the network's integrity and trust:QuoteIn SummaryWhile the moral quandary of violating any of Bitcoin's inviolable properties can make this a very complex issue to discuss, the game theory and incentives between burning vulnerable coins versus allowing them to be claimed by entities with quantum supremacy are a much simpler issue.I, for one, am not interested in rewarding quantum capable entities by inflating the circulating money supply just because some people lost their keys long ago and some laggards are not upgrading their bitcoin wallet's security.We can hope that this scenario never comes to pass, but hope is not a strategy.The game is afoot!The position is not new: I first heard of it in his talk at the \"Future of Bitcoin Conference 2024,\" a video that is, by the way, linked in the above blogpost. I highly recommend viewing this video before reading the blog post. This proposal leaves me with mixed feelings. What is your position on this proposal?",

Well I read the blog (only 80%) it was good, if some rich dude or whale gets their hand on a quantum computer, they will surely need some great resources for that, I mean owners are not just going to release QCs as they releases AI models which I doubt they were already using for a long time. Same way, QCs owners will only publicize it after lots of documentations, government might involve too because not only BTC is vulnerable to it. World has been digitalized and most of the technologia are vulnerable to QCs. Proper supply should be tracked, like who bought it, proper usage should be taught, so combined rich people definitely need many resources to pull this off. I think it would be better if someone from Usa or any other country, with functional QCs comes forward and says we will, break the old or most vulnerable wallets, and not seize, or release the supply back to the market, but will give it back to the right full owner by taking some commission.

I highly recommend viewing this video before reading the blog post. This proposal leaves me with mixed feelings. What is your position on this proposal? I think the video already gives the insight to the blog post.This issue has also been raised several times, but this particular one raises more question with possibilities.So many questions running through my mind while watching the video.First, we are still a bit far from witnessing all these proposed vulnerabilities, but the need to start putting preparation at heart is not a bad idea at all. There is a high probability that powerful high quantum computers will be in existence soon( I think we already have few, but not sure of how powerful they are).The proposal to allow quantum computers bring back lost coins into circulation isn't a healthy one imo. Who exactly are they proposing to handle the coins over to?, because the last time I checked, they are already mined but lost. Bitcoin enthusiasts needs to be careful with what they propose, as making some drastic decisions to the protocol might complicate things.And I believe the community can find a solution not just because of the valuable addresses at risk, but because of the need to protect the Bitcoin protocol, since almost everyone might likely be affected if things eventually goes south.",

Bitcoin blockchain is like layers of blocks and Satoshi's stash belongs to oldest layers that are deepest in the Bitcoin blockchain.If anything can dig deeply enough to Satoshi's stash, that means no satoshi of anyone is safe while oldest, deepest and assumedly safest satoshis were no longer safe.Bitcoin blockchain.QuoteThe blockchain is often visualized as a vertical stack, with blocks layered on top of each other and the first block serving as the foundation of the stack. The visualization of blocks stacked on top of each other results in the use of terms such as \"height\" to refer to the distance from the first block, and \"top\" or \"tip\" to refer to the most recently added block.One way to think about the blockchain is like layers in a geological formation, or glacier core sample. The surface layers might change with the seasons, or even be blown away before they have time to settle. But once you go a few inches deep, geological layers become more and more stable. By the time you look a few hundred feet down, you are looking at a snapshot of the past that has remained undisturbed for millions of years. In the blockchain, the most recent few blocks might be revised if there is a chain reorganization due to a fork. The top six blocks are like a few inches of topsoil. But once you go more deeply into the blockchain, beyond six blocks, blocks are less and less likely to change. After 100 blocks back there is so much stability that the coinbase transaction—​the transaction containing the reward in bitcoin for creating a new block—​can be spent. While the protocol always allows a chain to be undone by a longer chain and while the possibility of any block being reversed always exists, the probability of such an event decreases as time passes until it becomes infinitesimal.",

First, private corporations like IBM and Google need to demonstrate that they can crack ECDS or something equally difficult. By that point, hopefully core devs will have something in place to roll out in a new version to either protect or destroy vulnerable coins.The first real-world applications of such advanced quantum computing power will assuredly be military-related, but we might not know about their existence.

      "body": "I'm quite skeptical regarding the \"burning\" option. But I think the Bitcoin devs should think already in the next years about possibilities to offer alternative cryptographic schemes. I would even argue, \"the faster the better\", because the more time the user base has to upgrade, more upgrading will probably be done. The best option in my opinion is to offer several algorithms, as currently there seems to be no consensus about the \"best\" quantum proof scheme. Or directly offer a flexible set of operations allowing several schemes (Simplicity, perhaps? Something based on BitVM?). So the desperate can already try the option out.Regarding the advantage/disadvantage of the \"burn option\":I think the faster the threat emerges, the higher is the potential damage that could be done by the attackers. Thus, perhaps it would be an option to already prepare the code for an eventual \"emergency\", i.e. a burn option like Lopp proposes. It could be only a last resort fork, a kind of \"nuclear option\".In the best case it never would be needed to be rolled out because most of the owners of the affected coins have already migrated when the attack is being detected. It could even make the attacker's cost/benefit equation more disadvantageous for them: At least at the start of the \"quantum computing wave\", they would have to invest a lot of time and money to crack a single address. If there is a possibility that their funds are being burnt, they would perhaps not even try it, and thus the resources invested in the attacks would stay small, giving those who have still not migrated the needed time to do it.",

Vulnerable coins are all those where the public key has been published: P2PK and re-used addresses. I would however limit the \"burning\" strictly to P2PK scripts.

I can only hope the 4th scenario of Lopp is what's going to happen. Should the solution involves either freezing vulnerable funds or the same should be left available for whoever has the capability, I prefer the former. Both have heavy cons, but considering the huge amount of vulnerable funds, I'm imagining the market to fall hard. But that's not even the main concern. The main concern is that it's probably a chaotic scenario when people and institutions are racing against each other, investing heavily in their capabilities, to legally steal other people's money.
