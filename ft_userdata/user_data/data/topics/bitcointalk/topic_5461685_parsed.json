I don't expect any stratospheric rise, but I would say a sustained rise with some ups and downs typical of the pre-halving year. What we are experiencing these last few months is basically monotony, which at some point has to break to the upside.",

We can say that whether the price will be less than $30,000 or will it be less than $26,000, will it pass the $32,000 point, as all of them represent support and resistance points in the medium and long term.In this month, there are many factors that will pressure the price, including:It's summer when everyone's outside and there's not much trading going on.The results of the third quarter will begin to take shape, so there is no active movement.The interest rate hike (which may occur at the next meeting) will be calculated this month, which will put pressure on the price.So I think we will be at some point less than $32,000.",

It wasn't that odd in the first place for it to start going down, it took a little over 3 days for it to go up from $25k to $30k after all, which is rather fast imo, compared to the expected steady but gradual increase in movement expectations I had before. Well in general it isn't a big change, nothing we hadn't experienced in the past month or so really.",

Some long time investors will also accumulate, but I don't expect bullishness to happen in August.The month of August - September last year became a monthly decline in bitcoin, if this cycle continues to work then the beginning of August will be the beginning of the decline until September. We can see now that Bitcoin is still holding in the $29k price area and it is difficult to break $30k. If this continues and the support is not strong enough, we will see one more drop.We need to be prepared for anything that happens, and prepare a reserve of money to buy back in.

This July I'm surprised that it didn't break the $30k I predicted strong support going in the $30k level and staying there, but if there's another drop I welcome it and go for it this could be the last drop for this year then it will take off, provided there's no more bad news that could harm the market, there's a lot of surprises this year heading to the halving year, but I'm very positive that another all-time high is coming and we should prepare for it.Of course, this is not a piece of financial advice but my views and I could be wrong, I always tell this to all my friends who I urge to invest.",

I am not really so bullish about the market this month, but never say never; volatility never ceases to surprise us.Yeah, It seems that market sentiment has not gone up much this month as you stated above. The reason is, if we look at the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, it has returned to “greed” status with a score of 51 today Wednesday (2/8). The score briefly dropped to as low as 41 in mid-June, when the SEC launched several lawsuits against high-profile crypto companies. At least, the Fear and Greed Index also helps gauge crypto market movements and market sentiment, which is useful for crypto investors who may just be sitting idly by and wondering- ask what to do. will happen next.",

But whatever happens, we have to be prepared and if it is a downturn, we can use the moment to buy more Bitcoins. I don't think about where the Bitcoin price is going because I'm still thinking about how to collect more Bitcoin in times like now.Bitcoin wants to go back up or even down, it's not a problem for me. The important thing is I can still buy more Bitcoin. And now, the price has returned to the $29k level and hopefully, this month, the price can reach the $30k level or even increase to $35k-$37k immediately. That is the hope of many and people are eager to see the price increase again.Congratulations to those who managed to enter at $28k yesterday because now they can take advantage of it. Or they can wait until the price goes higher to take their profits.",

As I see it, the cycle-wise years that would correspond to this 2023 are negative return in August. So it happened in 2019, 2015 and 2011. Although history need not repeat itself, this makes me more pessimistic than I would have been at first, before seeing the table. And September has not historically been very good in this respect either. Hopefully the statistic will be broken this year.",

That means it breaks the $30000 resistance but it was unable to increase much above $30000 as the resistant price was $31800. You need to know that bad news that can decrease the price of bitcoin can come at anytime unexpectedly. Also good news that can increase the price of bitcoin can come at anytime. People may not be expecting it at all. Saying there is no bad news that can further reduce the price of bitcoin is not accurate at all.",

If on the way there is a correction, then my estimate will not be too deep. This means that I do not dismiss the analysis that there will be no further decline, but if there is a decline, it will not reach a price level below $22k, even though there is an analysis that August to September will be months of falling prices.",
