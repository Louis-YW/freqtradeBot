These companies are looking for profits so if they see that more people are interested in bitcoin, then they will prioritize bitcoin over anything else.",

So, it's no surprise that bitcoin is becoming more and more popular and people are turning to investing in bitcoin instead of gold. I also saw this news yesterday but I don't think this is due to the impact of bitcoin. Gold has now become so popular and has been recognized by the world for thousands of years, so it will not even need ETFs and will always be the choice for those who like safety and asset diversification. Blackrock close the gold ETFs probably because it was no longer as profitable as they expected, not because it became useless.",

So I believe blackrock is willing to come out of this competition all together. When it comes to digital gold and ETF, the main goal is to make profit from the prize movements. So when people can have multiple options for the same type of product, the competition become very steep. I believe that is the case why blackrock wants to close their gold ETF. I don't honestly see any other reason. Closing out common products will help them to focus on new types of assets and provide better service to their customers.",

Well, blackrock decision to close its gold ETF makes sense with the increasing competition in the gold investment market, maybe this will show their adaptability to market changes and focus on innovation to meet the needs of their customers someday, Looking at the flow, it's probably a smart move to ensure long-term growth and success. And that's their job to attract potential customers.",

It is story about different ETFs managed by BlackRock but months ago, before and after Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals by SEC people already discussed about how many Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the USA will exist and continue after some time like one or two years.I read some discussions and news that some predictions lead to conclusion that there will be less than 6 Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the USA after one year or two years. Weak Bitcoin Spot ETFs will have to self close their ETFs and customers will move funds to bigger Bitcoin Spot ETFs.",

Blackrock is just one investment fund among thousands, and they are not the fund with the most gold in the world or the one who can make people abandon gold and switch to bitcoin. Even if gold ETFs cease to exist, I can guarantee that the value and status of gold will never be shaken because it was used and recognized thousands of years before gold ETFs were approved in 2004. We are bitcoin investors and we all hope that one day bitcoin will surpass gold in popularity or market capitalization...but we shouldn't deny that gold is still a valuable asset and demand for it remains very high. Let's be realistic.",

I believe this move by Blackrock could have positive impact on price of Bitcoin.I believe Blackrock can earn more profits from Bitcoin ETF because we all know that Bitcoin's volatility is way higher than that of gold. Gold ETFs won't help to make that much profits even in years which Bitcoin ETF could make in a year or two.Their main aim behind this decision is of course related to profits and I'm very sure with Bitcoin ETF they can earn those profits. As a part of Bitcoin community I consider this move of BlackRock as a very useful move because it will catch the eye of more investors who may also shift from Gold ETFs to Bitcoin ETFs",

I don't think it necessarily has anything to do with BTC, but that ETF is more than evident something that attracts their clients due to the fact that BTC volatility is something that far surpasses gold, and thus the possible earnings are much higher.Quote from: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-shutters-8-etfs-including-215611913.html\"As we evolve our platform and launch new strategies, we also constantly assess the regulatory and operating environment as well as how our funds are meeting investors' investment objectives,\" BlackRock said in a statement.The closures represent a tiny piece of the iShares franchise, which manages $2.82 trillion in 414 ETFs.Investor appetite for ETFs has been strong this year, although it has created fierce competition for assets.The eight funds have failed to ignite investor interest, noted etf.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy.\"What these ETFs have in common is that they all failed to catch on with investors,\" Roy said.\"Each of these funds has AUM of less than $50 million, with some less than $5 million. That's peanuts for BlackRock.\"",
