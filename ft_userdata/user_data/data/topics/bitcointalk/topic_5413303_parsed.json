  "content": "SourceIn this Post you will find about BTC accumulation and tips to keep in mind before shopping Bitcoin. Many of you have known BTC’s history if not then pay a visit here.What is BTC Accumulation?We all know the meaning of accumulation but in terms of market cycles, it’s a phase. This phase starts when market comes to its worse stage or bottom line at this point, Public and Private Corporations starts to buy huge amount of BTC for long term. There are three more phases other than accumulation phase but i will share their articles later. How much BTC has been accumulated by Corporations?In 2021, According to NASDAQ, total accumulation of BTC was the 8% of the total BTC supply which is equal 1,660,473 BTC. But in 2022, According to Coindesk, total accumulation of BTC is 60% of the total BTC supply which is equal to 12.92 million bitcoin.When we should accumulate Bitcoin?The price of BTC is $21,647 while writing this article and we all aware of the ATH (All the High). Many of us are fully sure that BTC will cross its ATH and there is no doubt in it, that’s what BTC was doing from the start.We should started to accumulate BTC when BTC is in bear market after touching the ATH. Now is the Bear market and according to the amount of accumulation wrote above, Corporations had already filled their bags when BTC goes below $18,000.We should use tools like Glass node to keep track of demand and supply, because when seller pressure increases, the bear market comes with great buying opportunities.SourceTips to keep in mind before accumulation:1: Use Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Technique:In this technique, we do not accumulate BTC in one trade. We divide the trades in to many parts. For example, if you are buying 10 BTC, Then divide them in 10 transaction. Like set buy order for 1 BTC at required price and place another buy order of 1 BTC at lower price than required price for better profit. Because we don’t know the nature of market. Sometimes market goes in unexpected ways. So from preventing huge losses, we should work smart. 2: Use indicator to analyze market to take better entry:The most famous and common tools to take entry is RSI (Relative Strength Index) which has two main components:Overbought: When the indicator line moves above the channel then it is considered as overbought which means the asset has been overvalued and there is more chances of its price to decrease.Oversold: When the opposite happens of above action than the assets is considered as oversold which means there are more chances of asset’s price to increase. There is no doubt that indicator’s result will help you in making great entries either. But it increases the chances only instead of taking entry blindly. You can use a RSI tools for BTC only which will send notification on your twitter handle. Get this Tool from here.3: Do not freak out: One of the biggest benefit of long term investment is you don’t have to check market again and again. Thus you will face no tension. But to do that you have to build patience in yourself. Which you can do by not becoming a prey of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).4: Prevent from News Cycle:As mentioned before, we don’t have to observe market again and again to book profits here. Because we are playing the long term game here like for 3 to 6 years some people holds more than that. The news platforms will try to share every crypto related news which will make you sick. No doubt that, short term investors are greatly affected by news cycles and get into FOMO and lost their money. But here you know the big picture of BTC potential as how it touches around $68,789.63.Tools for analysis when Whales enters market:Whales are the market manipulator who trades more than 10 BTC at a time and these are the 1000 people who have the 40% of the total market. We will shed light on some tools to keep track of Whales activity to prevent from losses and to take profits. 1: Whales AlertWhales Alert is a tool which collects data from all of the blockchains and provides alert notification on Whales transactions.

Which wallet is best to accumulate Bitcoin?I had discussed some of the wallets types before, you can go for hardware base crypto wallets for better security, and I only mentioned 3 hardware wallets there and some other hot wallets. But in here, you will find the best options to store your BTC for long term using hot wallets. 1: Exodus:Exodus is best for beginner as they have 24 hour lives support and you can use it on phone and pc.

As it is reproducible.•   Works only on smartphones.Precautions to take before withdrawing huge amount of BTC:There are numerous precautions, a holder could take, but depends upon from which danger. Danger of losing BTC, danger of getting taxed by IRS, danger of too much exposure and publicity that you do not want. I will try to cover two of the above danger to avoid.1: Danger of Losing BTC:Talking about withdrawing BTC, to do that first we have to transfer it to an exchange, if your BTC is already in a wallet which comes with built-in exchanges than its more secure. Because in first scenario, you have to transfer from hot wallet to exchange wallet. Which will expose you twice. While sending BTC from one wallet to exchange wallet, double check the address and do not send all the BTC in one go.If you are using hot wallets on smartphone or pc, try to strictly avoid from download any third party and unverified app or unlocked APK MOD, because these APKs contains malicious viruses which could get all the info of your wallets.  2: Danger of getting heavily taxed by IRS:In my country there is no huge taxes on withdrawing money, I prefer try to withdraw money in parts not in one go because in Pakistan there are many limitation of withdrawing money and in many other developing countries too. But this danger is for the people of developed countries. Like USA, China, Japan, Russia etc. maybe I left some countries but let’s move on.I am not a tax expert so I will just share some useful article’s and thread’s links to avoid heavy taxation.Cryptocurrency taxes: A guide to tax rules for Bitcoin, Ethereum and more3 Mistakes to Avoid When Making a Large Portfolio WithdrawalCRYPTO-ASSETS: ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTANTSConclusion:I hope this thread will help you, just to clarify, I collected data from many blogs and BTT threads. I also provided the sources and tried my best to come up with every possible helping material. If you guys find that something needs correction please let me know and do share your love.

Which you can do by not becoming a prey of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).I'm sure this will be difficult for most new investors especially for those who are new to investing. Panic is normal when the price drops 10%-15% in less than 24 hours, but when a trader or investor ignores these fluctuations and chooses to hold on and believe in another potential in the future then they have become a strong hand.Don't panic, it's much easier said than realized in day-to-day or short-term trading practice. I agree that if one can avoid panicking when the price drops [in particular bitcoin] then they will have no regrets in the long run if the bounce occurs in a relatively quick timeframe.OP, by the way you could also consider moving this thread to a trading discussion board instead of a bitcoin discussion board.",

We tend to know what really they do and plan next in order for us to be prepared but unfortunately, we did not. In this situation of the market, DCAing is certainly the most applicable way of accumulating Bitcoin. Buy low, hold and sell if there is already a profit. In fact, this idea has already been practiced by many so I believe this is really working despite how these whales are doing and manipulating the market.",

However, we know that the crypto business in this bear market is highly more volatile and riskier. but on the other hand, this is the right time to accumulate Bitcoin. Why should be Bitcoin? Because Bitcoin is the most trusted and valuable cryptocurrency asset to have, much better compared to all altcoins.

We can really implement this technique due to considering the market changes every time. By doing DCA, we can utilize very chance to take Bitcoin at any rate. With this, we may not miss every chance. Although we may have fro the highe rprice to lower, at least we also know n what rate to target to take profits.",

It's a complete process of accumulating Bitcoin.Most of Us, evenThat's very true about 80%+ Bitcoiners do DCA. DCA can be more worthy instead of the savings account as BTC market follow all these phases, Accumulation in bear, Sideways in Consolidation zone and Mark Up/ Profit booking in Bull Run. DCA minimize the risk on the investment which attracts the users and a time to time investment helps to create better Avrage price setup for your assets more positive results can be obtained through this system.Quote from: Doan9269 on September 12, 2022, 06:26:56 PMQuote from: Hamza2424 on September 12, 2022, 05:12:05 PMI had discussed some of the wallets types before, you can go for hardware base crypto wallets for better security, and I only mentioned 3 hardware wallets thereI appreciate the effort put together in bringing this up, nevertheless you could have lay more emphasis on hardware wallet here as well aside the embedded link provided to your previous topic on that, also there is more need as well to add the type of coins each wallet support, but in conclusion, its all a beautiful display of efforts you've put out altogether to present this as part of your contribution to the forum.

I myself to monitor movements and large transactions in and out of the exchange to my personal wallet and vice versa, I use whalebot_alert (https://t.me/whalebotalerts). so that we can monitor the movements of the whales' major transactions via telegram notifications.like when the price of BTC will experience a correction. then usually starting with the day before there is always a large amount of BTC transactions entering the exchange from personal wallets. me when I found this. then it will wait first and not enter the market first. and I put the price at the nearest support that might be subject to correction. of course with DCA. and most of them always prove to be true. after a large transaction of btc to the exchange enters, after that most of the BTC will be corrected. so it is very important to monitor the movement of this Whales transaction.Besides that, we must always keep up to date with the latest news.I myself put a special notification on telegram from special channels that are considered the fastest in publishing news. because news sometimes matters too. and it is very useful to always collect information as the basis of our analysis before making accumulation.if you also want to always be notified of the latest news all the time then I suggest some of these channels.- https://t.me/crypto_panic_news- https://t.me/CryptoPotato- https://t.me/cointelegraph- https://t.me/CTMarkets- https://t.me/CryptopolitanOfficial- https://t.me/WatcherGuruThese are the channels that I think are the fastest in providing up-to-date news",

You don't even have to learn analysis and how to track whether the price is already hitting bottom or not. You just buy. You already know that the target is long term.

It would make sense for them to buy when the market is about to form a bullish momentum.

Pros:•   You can add Exodus with Trezor hardware wallet. •   Combining with hardware wallet increases security.•   It supports 240+ assets. •   You can use its web 3, desktop and mobile version as per requirement.•   Built in exchange.Cons: •   It is not an open source wallet To see the difference between open source and close source wallet. Pay visit here.2: Electrum:Electrum is a free cold wallet which provide next level security with its unique features. It’s in the market since 2011. Pros: •   We can use it on all the operating system, such as Android, Window, MacOS, Linux and Python.•   We can use their Cold Storage option to keep seed phrase to perform actions, and hot storage can be used to watch the balance. •   It supports hardware wallets like Trezor, Ledger and Keepkey.Cons:•   Only useable for storing Bitcoin. •   24 hours support is not available here.This made me a little confuse as maybe i am missing something as why the Exodus wallet is better than the Electrum wallet. I am more curious to know this because i haven't used Exodus wallet but frequently used the Electrum wallet. Also as per my knowledge , Electrum is the best and safest software wallet after the hardware wallets.",

No doubt Electrum is on top of Hot wallets but i made point there for beginners so consider it.",

No doubt Electrum is on top of Hot wallets but i made point there for beginners so consider it. Electrum is primarily for Bitcoin, but there's many altcoins currently support, you can read below. There's few alts currently can be accessed, it seems they're stop supporting those alts e.g. DASH and DOGE due to internal problem of the one who created. There's a discussion where it might be re-run by someone, but it will increase the risk since it's possible he add malicious code.Hot wallet aka custodial wallet aka exchanges are completely different with non custodial wallet since you not get the private key. Electrum is non custodial wallet since you're get the private key.Code: (https://1209k.com/bitcoin-eye/ele.php)Various chainschains count(chain)bcd 1bch 39btc 159btg 4cesc 2cgr 2cpc 4crp 8crw 1dash 6dgb 6doge 6firo 8grs 115iq 1kmd 6lbc 2liquid 3ltc 15lynx 5mona 15nmc 4ppc 2rtm 7rvn 10sbtc 1sgrs 1tbch 6tbtc 17tgrs 6tltc 4tmona 4vrsc 6",
