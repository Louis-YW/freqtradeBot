ASIC units are power-hungry compared to GPU mining. So it depends on your current location if you have a cheap electricity rate.If you already decided to buy ASIC there are some cheap offers from Canaan here https://shop.canaan.io",

If I'm not wrong there is a discussion in the past that generally says the solar panel is expensive and is not worth the cost to power your mining rig, since it will need a lot of panels to power one rig while also depending on the weather for the energy.

There are approximately 7 days left before the end of Ethereum mining.What does huge electricity outage mean? How many times a day do you have power outages and how long does it last? This is not very good for mining.I recommend the same and I find it strange that you have problem with electricity in a place where the cost of it is cheap.If you have a 0.04 dollars energy price then whichever one you choose is going to be profitable,both ASIC-s and GPU mining rigs.For the GPU-s you will have more choices and flexibility,flexibility in the sense that you can easily move to another algorithm to mine and also to expand or shrink your rig (by adding or removing GPU-s) as you see fit for different situations you may be in.",
