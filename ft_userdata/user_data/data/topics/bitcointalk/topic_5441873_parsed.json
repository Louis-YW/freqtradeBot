Bitcoin is not gonna pump at one time because it has already pump more than once and it still gonna pump more again. Also Bitcoin is not just for investment there are other use of Bitcoin and also bitcoin can be used for payment for games using Binance exchange, bitpay and others",

And besides even if he invest in Bitcoin he'd still have to be patient with the market. So, during that waiting and learning time he could also engage in games that do pay its those participating in it. He can be earning from gaming and at the same time be learning about Bitcoin because he won't be spending the whole day here on Bitcointalk he still have to take some time off and gave his real life.",

But I'm sure he heard of this stuff already. If he wasn't playing those games still then your friend is not interested in making money in crypto.",

I want to know if it is appropriate to give this advice to my friend?Well, first of all I think it's important to be sure Bitcoin is his/her kind of thing. One of the best ways to know this is to let him/her know why Bitcoin was invented. If he buys into it then you could encourage him to contribute to the continuous development of Bitcoin either through financial contributions/investment or by participating directly in the development of the system. He can also be taught to use it for transactions. Ofcourse, you can let him know about the financial benefits and the profitability of Bitcoin investments... and how to minimize investment risk and maximize profit. There is always the right time to invest and the right time to take profit when he needs to.Don't serve money, instead let money serve you. To be served by money is to do your job/work really well that people come looking for you very willing to pay whatever is right for your products. You are in control when this start happening.",

Is a long term investment, and not some thing they can hop on today and expect to make alot of money tomorrow.",

And he should gain knowledge before he invest in the sector.It was actually a great idea introducing his friend to bitcoin but gaming doesn’t seem to be a useless activity in this current generation. There many people that got addicted to playing it and became developers of it. Recently they have been competitions set aside for games to earn money just like sport. The most notable one is the game organized by FIFA over the world where young gamer’s are payed huge amounts after winning. This idea by FIFA has made some football clubs to recruit young lads to represent them in the competition.One shouldn’t force people fully into bitcoin but it can be thought as basics of storing ones funds. And not heavily having to invest in it.",

You can rather suggest to them to consider creating time to learn another thing where you then suggest bitcoins and this forum perhaps with the opportunity of the moment. That way they may see the need to create time for something new while they still enjoy their games.",

I also have several friends who play mobile games every day, but what makes me confused is why they don't feel bored even though they play almost 2 hours to 8 hours every day. I also suggested that they learn about bitcoin and get profit through bitcoin, but that didn't last long and most of them returned to their previous activities playing games for hours every day.",

It's just a question whether your friend are going to listen to your advise or your friend has money to invest in the first place.So it's really up to him, you have given him the right advise. So that is the best that you can do right now.I'm just thinking that he might not listen initially, but if you can show proved that you have made a lot of money in the bull run, maybe he will be convinced.",

I know you are coming from a place that's well-meaning, and you're only concerned for your friend's future otherwise you wouldn't really say something like that to him, but I feel like the way you approached him wouldn't really sit well with him and may even stray him from your point, coz now all he's gonna think about is you not minding your business and telling him what to do. I had a friend do that to me once back then and it's a good thing we're still friends because I really got offended from the way he approached me. I also wouldn't really just haphazardly tell people about bitcoin and make it out to be an end-all-be-all investment when it's as risky as all investments go. Maybe next time talk to him in a more calm and reasonable manner, sound like you're giving advice and not reprimanding him, that's going to be a better way to approach him rather than attacking him. We don't really know his reasons for playing videogames do we? Let's be a little considerate in that case.",

But, did you also tell him about the risk? because this is also important to be understood to decrease every high expectation for him and let him learn byself to understand what Bitcoin is, how the investment is, what the profit probability is, and also the risk possibility. For, investment in Bitcoin is always involving profits and risks. Once you only told about the profits, if someday the asset is decreased because of the dropped price of Bitcoin, he will ask you much and blame you. Hopefully, this will not happen. But wisely, you also need to tell him about the volatility of the market and the ways to be more patient and not panic every time the price is decreasing, because what he needs to do is waiting for more times to wait until the price is going up, moreover during the bullish era for long term holding.",

So, you won't take responsibility if your friend fails in his Bitcoin investment in the future. You must explain to him that Bitcoin investment offers big profits but it also can make you lose your money since it is very volatile and unpredictable.",
