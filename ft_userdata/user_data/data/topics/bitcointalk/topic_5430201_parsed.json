But as they were brought under the control of big money (Big Pharma) this info disappeared. And they are still lying about the benefits of the vaxx, right in the face of all the evidence that shows that the vaxxed people are dying from covid way more than the un-vaxxed.After meeting with anti-Second Amendment extremists, CDC quietly removed defensive firearm use statistics to support bad faith gun control agendaQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-12-18-cdc-quietly-removed-defensive-firearm-use-statistics-gun-control.htmlA few years back, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commissioned a study and associated fact sheet about defensive gun uses (DGU) that showed anywhere from 60,000 to 2.5 million tragedies are prevented with firearms every single year in the United States.

Dick Durbin’s (D-Ill.) office spearheaded the effort, which resulted in critical DGU statistics being scrubbed from the CDC’s data archives.“[T]hat 2.5 Million number needs to be killed, buried, dug up, killed again and buried again,” wrote Mark Bryant, one of the attendees, in an email to CDC officials following the meeting. “It is highly misleading, is used out of context and I honestly believe it has zero value – even as an outlier point in honest DGU discussions.”Bryant is in charge of the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), an anti-Second Amendment extremist group that is constantly pushing for more gun restrictions in the United States in response to mass shootings. Bryant argued that the work of criminologist Gary Kleck, who helped put together the DGU data from the CDC, needed to be scrubbed completely from the agency’s website....The CDC is controlled by anti-gun zealots who want truthful data hidden from the public...",
