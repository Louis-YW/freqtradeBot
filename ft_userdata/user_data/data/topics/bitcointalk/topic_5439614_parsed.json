Thanks.do you have this psu?https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FG81F7H/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ARSL1YBVZEIA9&psc=1if you do this cable workshttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012EI6KE/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1but you will need to run the s9 at lower clocks as that psu does not run well on 120 volts.I have found that particular psu will work to about 1000 watts on 120 volt powerso you will need to clock the s9 to about 10th",

      "body": "Why not try that 220v first and run the miner for a few minutes and check the cable if it's heating too much? If it's very hot then replace it with 110v I think you should down clock or remove a few hash boards from this unit because like the above said running it at 110v can melt a few wires and cables of your unit or the miner won't mine properly.",

      "body": "What is the size of the cable you used in Germany, if it's below 2mm2 that might not be a good idea to run it on 120V and draw 1000w or so, also the socket type is different, Germany uses type C, and type F sockets, so you will likely have to buy a new cable that fits U.S sockets and can deliver 1000-1200w on 110v, but keep in mind that the PSU can only run the miner at full speed when plugged into 220v.You can either use the multi-option firmware to underclock the miner, or simply unplug one of the there hashboards to fall below 1000w and you should be good to go.",

      "body": "The German cable works fine with 240V or the equivalent used in computer servers, photocopiers, etc.Dropping to 120V will use twice the amps. By default the S9 cannot be run safely like this since 1350W is +11 amps unlike +6 when using 230V. So you would need to either disconnect 1 hashboard or switch to a firmware that lets you exactly control the amounts of watts used, about 900W is safe at 120V (8A).",
