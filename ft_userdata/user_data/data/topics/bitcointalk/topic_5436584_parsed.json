You are correct, OP; as we all know, there are numerous reasons, aside from the one you mentioned, why bitcoin cannot be accepted by the government. It is not the case that they can print as much fiat and steal as they want. Today, government funds are stolen or diverted to different accounts which are not in physical currency form but in digital form. Being decentralized means they can't print it. So your point about them not being able to print it as they please is one of the reasons it is decentralized.",

If it's something good that has to with better development for humanity as far as it won't benefit them they will surely go against it.In developed countries where humanity is respected and citizens have rights to fight for their freedom, governments are not free to do everything they want. They have to step back and accept some requests from citizens.Oppositely in developed countries or ones from third world or from countries with dictatorship like Russia, North Korea, Cuba etc. people have zero freedom or little freedom. They don't have basic human rights and governments have more power.QuoteThe reason government won't accept bitcoin is not because it is a decentralized currency,  it is because they won't be able to print it like they print fiat  to steal as much as they canIf Bitcoin won't die, governments can not banned it or killed it entirely. If they can not banned the Internet and can not restrict ASIC manufacturers and Bitcoin mining farms, they can not kill Bitcoin.QuoteIf bitcoin is something the government can manipulate to steal public fund they would accept it even before now without any delay. They can not steal your bitcoin if you store your bitcoins in non custodial wallets.In contrast, they can steal your bitcoin if you store it on centralized exchanges that can be fully controlled by governments.",

Bitcoin is decentralized and it's cannot be controlled by government. Central Bank are the main opposition of Bitcoin in any country. If people start to make invest in Bitcoin then They will withdraw money from the bank and no government want this.QuoteThe reason government won't accept bitcoin is not because it is a decentralized currency,  it is because they won't be able to print it like they print fiat  to steal as much as they can .Yes this is also one reason and only those citizens can use it for payment system whom can use mobile also. Rural area citizens will not be able to do this. The supply of BTC is also limited and price of btc is also variable and did not backed by any thing.",

Too bad for them that the scales have fallen from people's eyes.",

Government will not likely rely 100% something that isn't thier creation and something they cannot control. The government knows how to control her citizens. They know how to filter the information and give us mutilated information. The government is used to crooks and manipulation, it they will not accept bitcoin which they cannot easily manipulate. Another question is why accept alternative currency when you have a working and well trusted fiat?",

They intervene in the market with taxes, and, if they're tied with a central bank, with the creation of money. Such ability is without doubt strengthening the government, because it gives the power to experiment with the economy without paying the potential loss; that will be paid by people who don't have a direct affiliation with this practice. So, any mistake a governmental secretary does, isn't paid by themselves, but by another fellow. So, there is less incentive for the secretary to not think recklessly. Bitcoin isn't administrated only by the people in power, but by the people in general. That obviously isn't liked by the people in power.",

It seems that China has succeeded with government coercion, although I heard that there are still crypto activities being carried out. CBDCs I think are ultimately the same as coins or paper money because their system is centralized, so control is in the creators or the government. This is quite contrary to crypto technology. Even my country has issued a Whitepaper for the CBDC project although I am now very happy that Crypto has been recognized as a commodity asset in my country.

Perhaps Plato put it in a more balanced way in The Republic (mother of said western democracy), to the effect that the best suited to rule are least likely to want to, and perhaps those less suited to rule will be more inclined to desire power due to their own shortcomings.Quote from: Y3shot on January 24, 2023, 10:44:40 AMThe reason government won't accept bitcoin is not because it is a decentralized currency,  it is because they won't be able to print it like they print fiat to steal as much as they can. If bitcoin is something the government can manipulate to steal public fund they would accept it even before now without any delay. That's not quite correct, in my opinion, in the sense that the finance industry successfully lobbies to create incentives against decentralised financial tools, which otherwise they want to continue to provide and control, at a premium. I've been on the lobbying side, and in my experience it is laughably easy to convince officials to see the light, usually because of very human insecurity and reverence issues, rather than outright bribes.The other and major part of governmental non-acceptance is, I believe, precisely the decentralised qualities; every government's first and foremost issue is the successful taxation of its constituents, and in a fully decentralised financial system neither verification nor enforcability are feasible.",

The main reason why the government won't accept bitcoin is because they can't regulate, trace, or track it. They want to at any time investigate and monitor your financial activity and, if necessary, freeze your assets, raise interest rates, and collect taxes. But bitcoin is so decentralized that it is ubiquitous due to how it is distributed. As a result neither the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) nor the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can easily impose their will across borders. Furthermore, there's no one the government can hold responsible for anything that goes on with bitcoin.1. https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2021/04/the-distributed-ledger2. https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44918.html3. www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg31384/html...HRG-115hhrg31384.htm",
