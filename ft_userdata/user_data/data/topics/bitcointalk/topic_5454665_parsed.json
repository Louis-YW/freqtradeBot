      "body": "I do use both my PC and my mobile phone to login to this forum, and sometimes the captcha shows up when my account gets logged out and I want to log back in. It happens both on my PC and also on my mobile phone. What happens most of the time is that on my PC, which I usually operate using a wifi network that seems to have a stronger network than that of my mobile phone, when I click on verify if you are human or not, it immediately marks that I have passed the test. This happens sometimes too on my mobile. I guess this all depends on how strong your network is and sometimes the IP address from which you are signing in. Apart from this, I have never experienced a captcha before while trying to login to the forum.",

But be careful do not share this with anyone because it can use to brute-force your account.Why not enable always stay login so that you don't need to keep entering your username and password when you want to visit the forum?",

I just notice it now when I browse using my company desktop for the first time. To be very honest, i never encounter such a thing, as every time when i login to my account i have to click on the button saying that \"i am not a bot\" and sometimes it automatically \"approves\" without filling or giving any imaging test and few times it asks me to give image test. Well, i do have to click on it whether i am at the phone or a laptop.

Do you encounter this too on the mobile version? It's just annoying sometimes to captcha over and over on mobile because of the small screen. Well, i also never faced such issue as I often log out of my accounts as i kept them logged in all the time. I think your device must have been tagged with some robotic script or something like that which has made google captcha think that you are a bot. Well, whenever I use VPN for anything on Google (not for BTT) they ask me to fill the captcha and start a captcha loop on me, even after many tries they never let me go forward so what i do is, turn off the VPN and then connect to another server and try again and after giving a first try to captcha, i get approval as human and i can do whatever i want. IDK, what type of work you do on your smartphone which might have tagged you as suspicious one in Google's eye. but still i am no expert in these scenarios I recommend you to read this out too.Quote from: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/how-captchas-work.This reCAPTCHA test takes into account the movement of the user's cursor as it approaches the checkbox. Even the most direct motion by a human has some amount of randomness on the microscopic level: tiny unconscious movements that bots can't easily mimic. If the cursor's movement contains some of this unpredictability, then the test decides that the user is probably legitimate. The reCAPTCHA also may assess the cookies stored by the browser on a user device and the device's history in order to tell if the user is likely to be a bot.source",

I just notice it now when I browse using my company desktop for the first time.  I am not sure if you are using Captcha bypass unique link for your account when you login from your desktop. Other than this, You should have always see a captcha when you try to log in. No matter from what device are you trying to log in. You have to verify the captcha each time you log in. I never had an exception other than the captcha bypass link I use. QuoteSometimes the captcha on mobile keeps giving me a result to try again even though I'm sure that I'm choosing the right tile. Do you encounter this too on the mobile version? It's just annoying sometimes to captcha over and over on mobile because of the small screen. I confirm I face this issue as well. It's freaking annoying. Sometimes Captcha sucks. It asks me to try again over and over even though I choose the correct tile. Not only on the mobile version, but I also face this issue on my desktop as well. I thought it was because of my internet connection. Maybe Google failed to get my data or something like that. As someone already suggested, Do not share your Captcha bypass unique link with anyone. I also suggest not using the Always Stay logged-in feature. In case someone has access to your computer can access your account too if you use always stay logged in.",

I never had an exception other than the captcha bypass link I use. I’m using a regular link too on my desktop. As Bitmaxz previous comment. The captcha just instantly solved once I ticked the check box without completing the captcha manually on my desktop. I appreciate all the reply everyone. Thank you.",
