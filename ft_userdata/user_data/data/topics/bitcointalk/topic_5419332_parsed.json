At least, that is my position when I browse the forum.Anyways, I wish you good luck with your thesis.",

      "body": "The research I conducted for a gambling website showed that there are three primary reasons why people like to watch gambling livestreams. That is, there is a casual fan, who likes the idea of gambling but doesn't gamble himself. There are gamblers themselves, who enjoy watching other people gamble and they want to learn strategies and tactics. Finally, there is the group of hardcore fans, which watches every stream in order to support streamers and be part of the community. Even though some people might think that livestreams are overhyped in the gaming world and that it is a dead trend, watching other people gamble just for entertainment still has a lot of potential. Most importantly, it is unlikely that this kind of content will go out of style, as people like to watch others and learn from them. Most of these fans are learning the gambling techniques by watching streamers and then practicing it themselves on gambling sites.",

I myself do watch some streamers who are gambling on their streams but I did not search for it. Since I am one of their followers, it pops up on my newsfeed or wall as recommendation by the platform. But to those who are that hooked up with gambling, they are looking for streamers to get idea or strategies they could use whenever they are playing. Out of curiousity I also asked the same question as OP have asked, to my friends who are also moderate gamblers. Majority of them answered no, because they only gamble to kill time, nothing more. But two of them (they're 7 btw), has the same answer with mine ;streams do just pop up out of nowhere which catches their attention.",

The information tells reader that he is a university student who takes subject of General Psychology and yes it is a part of his final thesis.

Unfortunately, it seems like the link is not working on my end as I can't access on both my phone and pc.Anyways, I enjoy watching slot games mainly on YouTube and Facebook streams, as I also feel excited since they bet huge amounts compared to what I bet on the same game. It also thrills me when they are winning huge wins and multiple combos.  To be honest, I didn't really search for those until they got into my videos while watching games and didn't expect to enjoy almost the same when I gamble myself.",

For me that is a waste of time and I don't sympathize with streamers very much because they don't look natural on their behaviors and seems to be always over-reacting to everything in order to create hype.
