If they have picked interest,that is when you should start teaching  them about wallets and which wallets is the best to keep funds, and that is easy to understand in terms of transferring funds from one wallet to another.Then you can create three wallets for them and start saving their bitcoin for them. They should also have their own personal wallets apart from the ones you that you created. My suggestion is that after this,you can also teach them how to import keys from one wallet to another so that when it is time for you to hand over their bitcoin to them,you can give each of them the seed phrase to their wallets and tell them to keep it safe,so that when you pass on they can import the seed phrase to their own personal wallet.",

And they may have an idea that you have a investment on bitcoin, if there's something bad happen they would know where to locate your keys and they could use your hodl balances without any problem.
