For example, if you go from 300 to 500, you make a withdraw for 300, that is, you have withdrawn 200 from profit and 100 from Capital. This is then considered a return on investment. Most of my friends, will make periodic withdrawals, ranging from 40% - 60% in withdrawals to achieve ROI. After achieving ROI, now the money traded is purely from the rest of the money saved.I also will not invite you to do the same method, because everyone has the freedom to choose/make a decision.",

In-case some shit happens and you miss prediction, then you're only losing estimation profit not your money. Most mistake people is not taking the initial investment, and keep holding while they don't know anything about the market it self.Ended with loses ~XD Especially while you're trading with shittoken/meme. The volatility is really high, you need to secure initial investment first.",

Profits should be withdrawn on all possible bull trade, because one never knows the next position of the market. The market fluctuate and very difficult to predict which coin while dump and the one that will be pump. Profits should be monitored on all trade and fully withdrawn so the aim is to know whether you're progressing or retrogressing.",

It's all up to you how you're going to expand that money of yours and both options are good if you want to invest in another crypto.There's really no magic on it although you are getting additional risk as for getting new crypto to invest that's the ideal one because that is what the majority does.

Take out your initial investment when the market is at the peak, hold the rest if you want you can reinvest all or just 50% of the initial investment when the market is down.",

Well, after a long time I learned that you can't trade if you don't have some holdings on a side... cause trading with everything you have it's like you are gambling with your whole bankroll and you hope for the best!Simply said you have $300, put $200 in the coin you believe in, and use $100 to trade and try to swing a bit if you think it's a good opportunity for that! Either way, you will always have your holdings, it's like another chance for us to try something again if things go the wrong way! And one last thing... how to take profits depends on your desires! For example, when I wish for profit I would like that to be in more coins, not in dollars or euros... and some people aim for more dollars! You need to know what you wish to have more.",

You are asking a question like there would be an unified solution for this. There are TA experts disagreeing with each other, hundreds of different indicators that some people swear to, and some dislike most of them. Reality is that most of people can't sell the top, because it's just mathematically impossible. It's a zero sum game that might bring money if you enter and leave right time. But NO ONE knows when to enter and exit. It's just a game of probability and these probabilities aren't that high.",

Depends on you but in general sense you could really take advantage on getting profits on realizing it or making it real because if you havent sell then those are just imaginary ones.People are different when it comes to approach whether they are patient enough to look for profits in a short time or would really be holding no matter what.Dont listen up into others suggestions and advises and rather stick to yours whether if you do see that reinvesting those profits would be ideal and effective for you thengo ahead.If you are really holding for long term then stick to it and wont mind about these movements.",

It depends on what your goal is.  If you want to shed risk then yeah I'd pocket my initial investment in that case you presented.  Then trade the 200 which is essentially house money at this point.  Then aggressively trade that if you are looking for big hitters.  Never bad to pocket profits though if your goal is capital retention.",

The only way we can generate profit is to sell them high. As you can see in your portfolio, it was quite growing a little bit, and selling them earning $200 euro could be somewhat great. You can sell them all and reinvest them again or just get the 200 euros. Honestly, nothing happens with our money and we don't need to keep them asleep because, in the end, we become a loser missing out on the chance to earn profit. As you can see, active traders earn more profit compared to holders because they can possibly earn some every day, unlike holders who will just have some if they will sell which is not happen every day but for months or years.",

I am a notorious hodler too, which also has to do with the tax laws regarding crypto investments here in my country, because you have to pay taxes on profits that you have made while trading cryptos except if you were hodling the tokens or coins for more than 1 year then you don't have to pay taxes. That is why i hold the coins at least 1 year.It is definitely true that you can make way higher profits if you are an active trader in comparison to someone that is just hodling but of course every trade that you are making also means that you can make a mistake. This means not only the potential profit is way higher when you are a day trader but also the chances that you lose all your money are way higher.",

It's quite simple selling when it was going up and then waiting until it will be going down again to bought again. What you have said above was actually correct and there was no problem about that. The risk is if you have sold your token but the price might go even bigger but since you are aiming for profit and you can find alternative token in the market again to be used as investment. The fact that if that's very simple as that. It's better rather than hodl your token for long term but you will get nothing from there.",

And reinvest that profit ?How do you guys do this ?I just feel like i'm missing potential profits by not selling and seeing my potential profits go up and down. from what I learned, it is one of the strategies in investing. at this time, your method is also not wrong, in fact you are right that when you use that strategy, then you will lose the maximum potential of the assets you hold. however, people suggest it, because it is a pretty good strategy and also low risk. it is a technique that always puts profit first, no matter the maximum potential of the asset you hold. as long as it's still profitable, then that would be great. Imagine, when your $300 investment becomes $500, and you take your main capital from $500 and it becomes $200. In this condition, you do not have the slightest risk, because you have taken the main capital you have. In this case, you can get a sizeable profit when the price goes up again, and you can buy back to the amount before you took your capital when the price drops. well, this is one strategy that is widely used to date.",
