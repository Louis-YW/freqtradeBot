  "content": "I do experience a lot of upsets due to my gambling losses and it's very stressful to bear it all alone since no one in my family knows that I'm gambling. Gambling is also against our family values so I will just get scolded if I share my feelings since they will not understand my side. I create this thread to help users like me express their stress when they are feeling down so that we can help and hear each other. This support group thread aims to provide an opportunity for Bitcointalk users to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies or information about the root of the problem. Local thread rules:No shamingDon't post negative comments on a testimony(emphasizing the mistake)Only post encouraging posts and shit posts will not be toleratedAvoid pyramid quoting, Snip parts of the parts that you are not replying toAll off-topic post that violates the rules will be deleted without noticeUse this format when reporting a therapy post:Code:Days without playing gambling:What is your experience for the day(Related to gambling;Leave blank if none):*Being honest about sharing your progress like \"I almost do gambling but I control myself to save my gambling therapy progress\" will help you to open up more to control your addiction rather than keep it with you. Even though we don't know each other, Sometimes it's still good that someone cares to read or reply to your problem.Suggestion on improving the thread is always welcome.Here's the International Problem Gambling Help Contacts for those who needed immediate support to fight gambling addiction.Resources:https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/support-groups/art-20044655#:~:text=A%20support%20group%20provides%20an,information%20about%20diseases%20or%20treatments.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5195317https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingAddiction/",

Many are going through lots emotionally as a result of their engagement and possibly addiction in one way or the other looking for how and who to share their experience with but for the fact that it is related to gambling, they keep it to themselves which makes it even worst than it was. Atleast, this topic would help to sort out most of the problems bothering gamblers and the way forward.OP it is nice you brought this topic here but locking the previous does not seems ok but anyways you have a good idea.",

My current feelings keep thinking how can I stop gambling, even if not directly or suddenly, at least I can reduce gambling activities gradually.......what to do......! I am happy if there is a way to stop gambling, especially for me personally, of course I like to stop if there is a natural way without therapy, psychology, rehabilitation and so on or a third party.I used to gamble quite often and win, but lately my bets in vain gambling rarely yield good win values, that's why I'm a little stressed and want to stop gambling, unfortunately it's one real obstacle for me. My mouth said I wanted to stop, but my brain whispered to place another bet. like durian fruit, traders are pricked by thorns, if you smell it, the aroma will be even more fragrant.If this thread can get a little idea, to reduce my gambling activity, maybe something is the best thing for me.....what can be done....!",

My time spent on accumulating my wins all gone just within a space of time as I sensed it from the staff what they were upto but my thoughts never went there to stop and start processing for withdrawal and it was very bad what happened but I had no choice than allowing it to go just like that. I learnt my lesson and ever since then I had to do away with the casino.",
