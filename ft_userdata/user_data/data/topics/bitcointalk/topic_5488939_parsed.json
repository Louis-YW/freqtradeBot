  "content": "I have been pondering on the motion of making bitcoin a legal tender, if bitcoin becomes legal tender, it can be used in place of fait currency to purchase goods, used  for transactions,etc.      For me, making  bitcoin will take years because that motion will never be assigned by our financial institutions and central banks. The main reason is what we call;         Decentralisation of Financial Power    Removing the power to control money and financial asset from    centralized body like; Central banks, and other financial institutions.   Thus our fait currency begin to operate in a decentralized system as     bitcoin.   And we know that our governments,elites that take the will of the    people at stake will be at the verge of losing everything if that occurs,    meaning the system will be open and run by anyone at all that means f      freedom.   We all know bitcoin runs in a decentralized system, so making it a legal tender simply means the government will also have control over it and it system which wasn't the original motive of it   So two colliding forces, which can't be met at all. I know El Salvador has bitcoin as a legal tender, but can only be used as a means of payment and transaction which also works in other countries.     IMF,World Bank, Central Banks of countries these are the major controllers and Most powerful institutional bodies,so imagine making this system decentralized.  What do you think will be the fate of our Economy..? Let share our ideas on this guys.",

That makes bitcoin to be a legal tender in the country to be easy as they do not have their own fiat. But another country that makes bitcoin a legal tender is CAR and also an island in Honduras. Other countries can do the same if they want but they will prefer not to do so but prefer just on their fiat.

It will be better than fiat but other things has to be put in place so to make a good effect on the economy. Only bitcoin can not make the economy good.",

You're right, Bitcoin is a Decentralised monetary asset and was designed in a way that it can't be influenced by the government and other centralised sectors, making it difficult for the government to have control over it's volatility, the least they could do is regulate and track down citizens or officials that use it for criminal activities. Most people think because it decentralised then it's not traceable but Yes, Bitcoin can be traced due to recorded blockchain transactions which are set down on a public ledger, making it easy for authorities to make analysis concerning the address used for criminal activities. Well that's one of the reasons I think Satoshi created Bitcoin, for everyday users to adopt it as a means of transaction and other financial activities for now Bitcoin is not here to replace the fiat currency cause it's not vastly adopted around the globe, but was set aside as an alternative monetary asset which cannot be manipulated by the government and can be used to carry out quicker and faster transactions without any third party.",

      "body": "The only problem with Bitcoin is its volatility and a legal tender is not considered good if it is volatile. I think most struggling economies would try to hold on to Bitcoin as their reserve rather than having it as a legal tender. It is not easy for struggling economies to have USD as reserve but they can use their fiat to buy Bitcoin and hold on to it like they did earlier with gold. The price of Bitcoin has been always going in a positive direction and they can use this opportunity to increase their reserve currency which in the future they can exchange with global currencies or gold. I think Bitcoin as a commodity to storage value would be a great opportunity for these countries to restore their economy which depends on how the political structure of that country is and how good is the leader leading that country.",

We don't need the US government to be initiator, or if they don't accept it can't come through.We are simply discussing the fate of the economy of it becomes.    You trying to put out that because it requires 30 minutes before transactions go through costing $30 is not a solid background for the denial of acceptance. You are a bitcoiner, people of all races are doing transactions everyday, we know about the high cost of transactions but still we believe and work with the system everyday. What the masses want is profiting and learning more about bitcoin, it is also stupid for you to think that people trying to bring up an idea about the system is stupid.You can read the thread  again to understand more.

It's not. The US government (and most other governments) are not meaningfully hindering the adoption of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was faster and cheaper than normal credit card transactions, and could scale to handle the world's everyday transactions, then it most likely would have long ago.Blockchain was never meant to scale to mainstream levels, and it solves a problem that only a few people actually have.

What Is Legal Tender?QuoteLegal tender is anything recognized by law as a means to settle a public or private debt or meet a financial obligation, including tax payments, contracts, and legal fines or damages. The national currency is legal tender in practically every country. A creditor is legally obligated to accept legal tender toward repayment of a debt.This pretty looked like a national currency. Me, I don't like that, I want bitcoin to still be recognized to what it is now, more like a payment method, an alternative to fiat.. That way, less regulation necessary to it, and I think it will not pass as legal tender since it's very volatile, and it's decentralization might be the opposite definition of a government which promotes centralization. Also, legal tender or fiat (most popular) are not limited, I mean the government could print money if they desire, bitcoin is limited because it's supply is fixed.",
