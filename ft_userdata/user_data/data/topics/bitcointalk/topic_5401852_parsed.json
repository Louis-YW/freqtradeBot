It's one of the projects that I've known but I have never held it.Another one is the filecoin.It's one of the top 50 coin in the market so that will give you another option if you're on this type of protocol or algorithm.",

If i remember correctly Filecoin had the biggest ICO ever within the crypto space because they collected 257 Million USD back in september of 2017. That being said back then ICO's did not have a hard cap so everyone could basically invest, which also means that there are a lot of holders now that bought for the ICO price.I held some Siacoin myself and also mined a little Siacoin from time to time a few years ago before ASICs for Siacoin were introduced and you could still mine with GPU's. If i remember correctly Siacoin needs a very high adoption and usage in order to not be inflationary anymore.",
