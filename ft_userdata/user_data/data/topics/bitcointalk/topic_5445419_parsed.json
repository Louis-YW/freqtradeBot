I have been contacted of telegram for empty wallet before and I failed to reply the person because I don't trust anyone that PM me first, he wanted to pay 20$ per wallet but in your own case it is too much.",

This airdrops has been famous again since there are so many people who participate earning some good cash so maybe this is caught his interest to bait people about paying false $350 each wallet.If he stated about using an escrow on this transaction maybe we people cannot call him a possible a scammer.",
