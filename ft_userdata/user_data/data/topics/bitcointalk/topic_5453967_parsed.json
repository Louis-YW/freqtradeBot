  "content": "As Bitcoin became more widely known to the general public, many began to see it as some kind of alternative to the fiat payment system. Not only an alternative but a superior alternative. This superiority supposedly stems from Bitcoin’s “decentralization”, “security”, and “scarcity”. Here we will show that Bitcoin and fiat are different as night and day. And that the first don`t even belong to the same category as the second.Narratives about Bitcoin are mostly focused on the field of informatics. However, payment systems belong to the field of economics. Here we will therefore focus on the second. Economically speaking, people need goods and services. They need food, clothing, energy, a roof over their heads, clean streets, medical services, etc. This is what satisfies human needs. In that sense, the technical implementation of payment systems, through which goods and services are exchanged, is irrelevant. Payment systems themselves can neither satisfy human needs nor magically create goods and services. They are only auxiliary means for exchanging them and, most importantly, securing their return.Why is securing the return of goods and services the most important thing in payment systems? Well, suppose you gave up your house and in return, you got units of the fiat system, i.e. you got banknotes or a deposit account that show the number of received units. These units cannot satisfy your needs. They are not goods or services. So, you gave up a house that can satisfy a lot of needs, and in return, you got units that cannot satisfy any need. That is why, if a payment system is legit, it must have a protective mechanism so that in the future you can return goods or services. The fiat payment system has such a mechanism. Let’s see how it functions.The units of fiat payment systems are created when banks grant loans to individuals and organizations or purchase government bonds. By exchanging goods and services for banknotes or deposits people become holders of those units. The fiat system ensures that holders get goods and services back. It does that through the liabilities of debtors and their collaterals, i.e., by forcing them to pay off their debt.Namely, to be able to pay off their debt, debtors need banknotes or deposits. And the only way to get them is if they work for their holders, sell them goods and services, or, in the case of governments, accept banknotes or deposits as a tax payment. So, by being forced to pay off debt represented with units of the fiat system, debtors are returning goods and services to holders of those units. Such returns are realized daily by hundreds of thousands of debtors in the fiat payment systems worldwide.Let’s now turn to Bitcoin. Bitcoin boils down to a network of computing devices linked together to manage a database according to some protocols. That database stores information on the number of units held by users registered on the network. The units are popularly called electronic coins or bitcoins(₿). How do people become holders in the first place? Well initially, they give up electricity in the process of the so-called Bitcoin mining. This gets them the units. So they give up a good that can satisfy a lot of needs and in return, they get units that cannot satisfy any need. That means that users of the Bitcoin network are in the same situation as users of the fiat system – they need to return goods or services.And now comes the crucial question: does the Bitcoin network have a protective mechanism that enables users to return goods and services? Well, it does not.And this is the key difference between the fiat payment system and the Bitcoin network. The first has banks, debtors, loan contracts, government bonds, and pledged collaterals to ensure that users return goods and services. The second has nothing. Users just hold the units, and that is it. The network is not there to protect them by ensuring the said return. Instead, the network is there to protect its units. It takes electricity for its own sake.“Decentralization”, “security” and “scarcity” are just pointless features of the network as none of that protects users. No matter how decentralized, well-protected, or limited the units are, this cannot help anyone to return goods and services. Network maintainers, miners, protocols, the database, and everything else related to the network are entirely focused on the units. It is like these units represent some kind of transcendental value worthy of worship and high protection. The users, on the other hand, are unimportant. They exist only to sacrifice need-satisfying items or protective units of the fiat system to be able to hold that transcendental value.There is currently an entire army of Bitcoin users. They gave up an enormous amount of valuable items to get units of the Bitcoin network. And this network has nothing to protect them. Consequently, if people outside the network decide they no longer want to give up valuable items in favor of network units, that whole army is doomed. The network cannot help them to return even a bit of what they gave for the units.To conclude. The units of the fiat system are valuable because they protect holders by ensuring the return of goods and services. The value per specific number of units can be determined by checking the value of collaterals that banks take when issuing that number of units.On the other hand, the units of the Bitcoin network are worthless because they do not protect holders. The fact that the Bitcoin network is designed to protect its units instead of its users is pretty bizarre. What is even more bizarre is that some people are currently giving up 30,000 protective units ($) to get one non-protective unit(₿). This indeed looks like sacrifice in favor of some transcendental value. And shows that the whole thing is some kind of digital religious practice instead of something related to economics.",

Well, first banks granted loans to individuals and organizations or purchased government bonds. That is how banknotes or deposits ended up in the market. By exchanging resources for those banknotes and deposits, people became members of the fiat system. So basically, they gave up resources for numbers.People no longer have desire much as before on the use of bank notes simce the new payment system was introduced with bitcoin, because they have always been into debt over years with this same financial system of operations, people no longer excha their other forms of physical resources or asset with fiat notes because they have hope in bitcoin for more better opportunities to realize more from it investment ober time.Quote from: JamesNZ on May 25, 2023, 09:30:39 AM“Decentralization”, “security” and “scarcity” cannot help members to get resources back.These are just pointless features of the system and its units. While reading through your post and story analysis, i thought it could be something tangible as expected not until i come across this part, which gives me a second thought about what exactly you're trying to portray here, to counter a decentralized network or what? If being in debt and scarcity over the years is worth staying with for life then you can continue but don't discouraged how others have been getting back their financial and economy freedom back, bitcoin is far ahead in security than traditional system, the main reason why people want bitcoin is because of it decentralization which i think should be your major point of discussion.",

For this topic it is irrelevant what Bitcoin is. What is relevant is the difference between Bitcoin and fiat. Bitcoin lacks a protective mechanism to return resources. Members of the Bitcoin system cannot eat coins, drink them, live in them, drive them, use them as energy, etc. So once they are in, by holding coins, their coins mean nothing. They need people from outside of the system to get resources. To get something they can live off of. Calling coins resources won't make them eatable or drivable. Fiat system, on the other hand, has protective mechanism, as described in the OP. That's why units in that system are valuable while units in the Bitcoin system are not. It's pretty simple argument.",

      "body": "I think technical implementation of payment systems does matter. If money is only something physical, it means you can't use it if you want to pay for something abroad or just order online (if we're talking about the times of Internet). If it's something that has significant weight, you'll think twice before deciding to go far with it for a specific product. If it's only available digitally, it means you can't use it if you don't have relevant knowledge and devices, and if your merchant doesn't have them.To get Bitcoin, you don't have to give up electricity in most cases because most people just buy BTC rather than mine new coins to use. Also, the fiat system doesn't work as nicely as described. There's inflation, so with the passage of time you keep losing a part of what you got. Also, instead of selling goods and services, debtors can and often do just get new loans (more numbers) to cover the old ones, so it's not a completely safe mechanism. And I don't think most people see fiat through this debt and paying off debt thing.Instead, one could reconstruct the narrative differently: money is just useful because you can't always directly exchange what you have for what you need. Because of that initial limitation of barter, people come up with something that they'll accept as payment and give as payment when they sell or buy goods. Money is a medium of exchange, and Bitcoin can be that, even though it doesn't work in the same way as fiat.",

      "body": "Op actually exposed what is wrong with the fiat system which I typically call evil system partly due to it's opaque or non-transparent nature which is synonymous with darkness/night he or she erroneously tried to equate with transparent Bitcoin system.In regards to debt based fiat system you say is the reason fiat put into circulation, Bitcoin doesn't need to function in that manner. It's model after gold which is mined with energy/electricity and put into circulation. The miners don't need to give up their house to own bitcoins. They use electricity to mine bitcoins which become theirs rather than borrowed. So they don't need to return any resource that's worth roughly the amount of electricity expended to mine the bitcoins. Just like gold people use energy to mine bitcoins which become theirs and can be used for the exchange of goods and services. Miners don't need to owe a bank somewhere or become debtors to own Bitcoins. Fiat debt based system is actually part of what is fundamentally wrong with it. Bitcoin system is not debt based. Whatever you decide to borrow is between you and your lender. It's not tied to the system like fiat The Bitcoin system is quite advanced with inbuilt features to protect members . It already has the so called built in mechanism you are referring to. It's a basic smart-contract which can be used to enforce a contract or agreement between lender and debtor. You don't need banks for that. The smart-contract works inplace of banks.You do not seem to understands Bitcoin really well. And your writeup generally doesn't really make much sense. I got some headache trying to understand it. Sorry for the harsh words but it's true.",

I am a bit confused about how @OP delivers his topic.  Fiat system then he talks about the banking system, Aren't the two entities different?  So if these two are different then it only means that the fiat system also relies upon outside resources the same thing as @OP stated how Bitcoin relies on outside resources.  The only difference between the two is that the fiat system is guaranteed by the government and can be printed infinitely while Bitcoin is not issued by the government is decentralized, and has a finite amount of coins.We can agree to disagree about the value of Bitcoin but I won't argue with that, just look at the market and it tells us all.  QuoteOn the other hand, membership units in the Bitcoin system are worthless because they do not protect members. These units are some kind of system decoration that looks attractive from the outside and gives the appearance of money. But is not money as it provides no benefit to members. The system is designed to benefit that decoration instead of its members. This is at the same time bizarre and hilarious. Regarding protection, the fiat system as I stated is guaranteed by the government.  It is guaranteed to be inflated whenever the government wanted to create more money.  Yeah right, Bitcoin is worthless, just look at the market and see how it fares.  Bitcoin protects the integrity of the transaction, it protects its users from fraud and exploiters like the government.  It enables the economic inclusion of the unbanked.  It protects its users from inflation, and it provides boundless transfers and do not need intermediaries.QuoteWhat is even more bizarre and hilarious is that people are currently giving up 30,000 protective units ($) to get one non-protective unit(₿).Bizarre things happen... why still surprised when the fiat system itself has lots of it.",

Members just have membership status, and that is it. The system is not there to protect them, to ensure they get resources back. Instead, the system is there to protect those membership units called bitcoins. In short, the system exists to protect its units, instead of protecting its members. It spends electricity for its own sake.“Decentralization”, “security” and “scarcity” cannot help members to get resources back. These are just pointless features of the system and its units. That is why existing members can get resources back only if people from outside of the system become members by voluntarily giving up resources in favor of existing members. Without that, they cannot get literally anything. The system cannot help them. Outsiders to the system are their only hope.There is currently an entire army of members of the Bitcoin system. They gave up an enormous amount of resources. And the system has nothing to protect them. They have membership status represented with well “secured” units. These units are stored in a “decentralized” fashion. Also, the units are “scarce”. Yet, none of that can help them to get back things they can live off of. And if outsiders no longer want to become members, that whole army is doomed.To conclude. Membership units in the fiat system are valuable because they protect members by ensuring the return of resources. The value per specific number of units can be determined by checking the value of collaterals that banks take when issuing that number of units.On the other hand, membership units in the Bitcoin system are worthless because they do not protect members.

This happens because fiat has become digital: now billions of fiat transactions are performed in digital universe. It requires enough support systems, enough computing resources, and really strong security algorithms. The same is true about cryptocurrencies. Crypto devs continuously improve support services (wallets), computing facilities (mining), and security algorithms (blockchain and decentralisation).",

These units are some kind of system decoration that looks attractive from the outside and gives the appearance of money. But is not money as it provides no benefit to members. The system is designed to benefit that decoration instead of its members. Bitcoin has potential value and is inflation resistance. Fiat is depreciating because inflation has hit it so hard that fiat will soon get ruined. This is the reason that government keeps on printing money to enable them balance the high level of inflation but instead it has worsen the system more. Nobody wants bitcoin to take over from fiat but the fact is that bitcoin investment is far better than any fiat investment.Quote from: JamesNZ on May 25, 2023, 09:30:39 AMThis is at the same time bizarre and hilarious. What is even more bizarre and hilarious is that people are currently giving up 30,000 protective units ($) to get one non-protective unit(₿).I disagree with you, where were you when some banks crashed earlier on because of pilled up loans and some economical challenges, and investors were not comfortable with their assets in banks and they diverted most of their assets to bitcoin. China has uplifted the ban from bitcoin and more people is adopting it. Bitcoin has potential values to its investors and it is more profitable than keeping your fiat in the bank for bankers to use them for their own business. Only the privacy that bitcoin gives and make its user ananymous is enough,the use of P2P payment method across boarders without a third party is a big benefit to bitcoin users.",

You can just simplify it like, Bitcoin and Fiat are two different types of payment system. Bitcoin is decentralized system that uses cryptography to secure transactions, while fiat is a centralized system that is backed by the government. Bitcoin is not reliable to store of value. It is more a speculative investment, and we people should only invest in it if they are willing to take on the risk of losing our money.or better yet, the OP can make a table showing the different features of BTC vs fiat, so you can already see their main differences at a glance. because too much words, most of the time forum users won't read. and besides, such topic has been discussed many times over already.and besides, whatever their differences are, let's admit that we still need fiat in most of our financial transactions. so whatever advantage BTC has, we can't totally ignore yet the existence of fiat in most of our daily transactions.",

The banks needs to work hard in order for them to convince or manipulate their customers to take loans from them so that they can extort you through their interest rate.Bitcoin is not like that,you don't need to work hard by luring someone into a trap to his financial bondage,instead bitcoin helps you out of that financial bondage which the government and banks has make is think is a norm. If you purchase bitcoin,all you need to do is to learn how to secure your wallet safe and understand the market analysis,if possible just keep on accumulating more just like you do put some part of your income into savings with your bank,and your portfolio will increase as long as you hold for long. Easy  life, unlike fiat that if you $5k that can buy you a car today in the bank for 10yrs after the 10yrs is over your $6000 with interest of $1k might only buy you a motor cycle.",

      "body": "Bang on, you've painted an austere picture of the Bitcoin world, so dark. Yet, let's not forget one pivotal characteristic of Bitcoin—it's like a self-depleting treasure, capped and limited.Fiat money? It's like a leaky bucket, losing value over time. Imagine trading your hard-earned bucks for goods or services, and each time you can afford less. Not so good, right? But Bitcoin, with its staunch limit of 21 million coins, plays a different game. Demand surges, supply stands firm—value, possibly, escalates. It's like preserving the gold you've sunk into it.Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin isn't the perfect treasure. It has its storms and perils, like any other asset dictated by the market. But it's got this unique blueprint that could theoretically give you a payback over time. Sounds fantastic, right?",
