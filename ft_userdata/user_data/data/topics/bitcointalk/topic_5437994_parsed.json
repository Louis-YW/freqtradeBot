The idiom can be interpreted in several versions but it's mainly about taking control over life/things is way better and important than just being a follower. This can not only be used in general discussions but only apply to finances/economics. Recently I learned a lesson from my foolish behaviour and I think it'll set a good example. Please let me explain. Weeks ago, I met with one of my old friends and we had a nice time having dinner and talking about life. The diner was in a shopping plaza so we went to shop after dinner. Everthing was good and we spent bunch of money buying some useless things. On the way back home, I soon realized that I did not need those things at all. I was not feeling sorry for the money, it was just over 100 dallors and that's the money I can surely afford to lose. However, I felt bad for the irrational rush to buy things that I don't really need. It's like the money is manipulating me to spend it to prove that I have money. But hell no, I am not a show-off person and I am living just fine with my life. I am the master of my money and my life and I refuse to be labeled by what I have owned, although I own a lot of things.",

So what the point is? you seems to contradicts one to another, but you're already realized about it lol.As long as you're already afford $100 to lose, I don't think you need to think you're using that's money without a point and regret after that. The fact you still have a lot money and you've own a lot things, which mean it's not hurt you and there's no problem to spend small money for self reward.Money management is a must, but don't forget to enjoy your life.",

      "body": "If you are a girl, then I can understand your behavior about shopping (joke).The comparison of a hammer and a nail is not entirely clear; perhaps this is due to the fact that they are used differently in different countries. But what I understand is that you are easy to manipulate. This is exactly what happens in large shopping malls. I worked as a sales manager. Persuading customers to buy a particular product while adding another accessory and other small details is a great example of skilled salesman work. That's what marketing is all about. But you can plan your budget and strictly adhere to the plans for purchasing the necessary goods. In other words, the more you shop wisely, the more you save, or earn, by saving. There is nothing wrong with this. You can’t call a person a miser if he controls his brain because it’s really difficult not to fall for the bait of advertising and buy things you don’t really need.",

Op seem to be fray a little that he was convinced and confused at the same time to buy what he may not be needing at the moment or at far will not be important for a longtime. It is better to have self control in anything we do and including our finance and that is how we can become financially prudent and save money in this hard times. Saving money that would have be used to purchase unwanted items can be channeled into other diversed business interest and soon it will cumulate into other financial source. On another note I think if we don't visit the malls regularly, it can make us subsceptible to falling for any little conviction at the point of sale especially when we have \"loose\" This is what I notice because some people don't plan or have a tight budget of their expenses when or if they are buoyant to the expenditure.",

So you make really necessary purchases, even if you pamper yourself a little. The more completely your house is filled with the necessary products, the less often you visit stores, and accordingly, you do not buy too much. Because we go for some little thing, we spend more, as we buy more \"for the company.\"But yes, I agree, there are times when we need to enjoy shopping, chat with friends, and thereby get a feeling of happiness if this is not associated with psychological problems. Shopping, in fact, can be compared to an addiction.Therefore, those who feel guilty should limit themselves to going to the big malls for the sake of their health.",

It's excellent that you've realized this and are making efforts to curb your expenditures.I believe it's vital to examine the motivations behind our financial decisions and determine if they are in line with our beliefs and objectives. Money is a versatile resource that may help us achieve our goals or bring us down if we aren't attentive. Creating and adhering to a budget will help you avoid making unnecessary purchases like the ones you highlighted. By doing so, you may monitor your expenditure and direct your resources toward your highest priorities.A further tactic is to wait at least a day before making any major purchases. You may use this time to decide whether or not the item is something you need or desire before making the purchase. By adopting these routines, you'll have more authority over your financial situation and be better able to direct your resources toward achieving your objectives. Putting in the time and effort required is well worth it. Do not forget that you are in charge of your own life and finances.",

It's great you have enough to spend but remember lavish spending can turn a rich man to a poor one. For example, let's assume you have $30,000 and you keep spending $200 every week lavishly without working to earn more, such person will end up with nothing within few months. Making a serious plan for ones money is highly useful and help in controlling lavish spending no matter what happens.",

Then what's the point of you buying the item if you really don't need it at all, while in another paragraph you say it's not good and then buy the item, isn't this also an analogy of the process of proving that you have money.Most people only rely on prestige to look capable and often neglect how to use money sufficiently. If you can't use money properly, then no matter how much money you have, it will run out, while there are many people out there who have difficulty making ends meet in the midst of an increasingly difficult economy, recession and inflation that continuesUsually that's how young women behave, they just want to look perfect in front of their friends.

Maybe get rid of the stuff you don't need, it could help make you feel from free as that stuff wouldn't define you. You could get probably money out of it if you are not a giving type.But that said, sometimes we need irrational behavior to relax. And often that requires money to let out some steam or relax. So don't feel bad about the money you spend. It was only $100 and sometimes we need to treat ourselves, no matter how silly that would be.Although i have no idea what the hammer and nail are representing in your story.
