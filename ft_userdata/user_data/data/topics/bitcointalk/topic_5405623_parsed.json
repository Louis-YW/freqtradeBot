  "content": "We are opening up the possibility of accepting payments in cryptocurrencies for websites, bots, applications and messengers. Integrate Cryptomus using the API, SDK for PHP and ready-made CMS plugins without KYC and other verifications, and if difficulties arise, our technical support is always in touch to resolve any issue.IntegrationsCurrently there are 2 types of integration available:1. Host-to-Host integration allows merchants to assign a static address for each user to replenish the balance. This is necessary for merchants whose services require a balance feature in the service user's personal account. Payments can be made using a static link — take a look at the EXAMPLE, or using a static wallet address in the form of a text or QR code. In this case, users will not have to switch to the payment form.2. Connect integration allows you to automatically generate links to payments for goods or services. Using the API, you can track the payment status, so this integration method is no different from fiat acquiring, only much more reliable, cheaper and faster.White Label integration is now in development. This type of integration will allow merchants to personalize the payment page under the brand of their project.💡 If you need to create a one-time payment link or dedicate a single static address to top up your balance, then use the \"Payment by Link\" Business Wallet function. This feature is used when one needs to receive a transfer, but does not want to reveal a personal address.CommissionsFixed commission of 2% only when accepting payments. All other products of the platform are completely free and designed to work effectively with cryptocurrencies. If you pass moderation within the platform, commissions can be reduced up to 0.4%.💡 The fee for accepting payments can be assigned to the buyer, thereby acquiring crypto will be free for you. WithdrawalsInstant withdrawals without holds, rolling reserves and any restrictions. Use the API to assign automatic withdrawals to any external wallets with an auto-convert option. For example, there are ETH, USDT, TRX and TON on your wallets, but you can choose withdrawal in BTC — we will convert everything at the current rate.💡 If you need to make a refund to the buyer, it will take only 2 clicks.Mass paymentsMass payments are available in any currency to every user. Convenient reporting and uploads will help you track transaction statuses.AnonymityWe do not require passing KYC or KYB to verify users or merchants. Authorization is available via Telegram or Tonkeeper, this guarantees you absolute anonymity.💡 Anonymity does not exempt transactions from the AML procedure. Do not use the platform for illegal purposes.Security and notification systemTwo-factor authentication, SMS confirmations, Anti-fraud system, Auto-withdrawals and many other useful tools ensure the security of your funds.Affiliate programThe affiliate program allows you to earn money with us. You will receive 30% of our payment commission from each merchant you have invited.ALL in One​Cryptomus is a platform that offers a comprehensive set of tools for effective work with cryptocurrencies. The wallet has built-in functions:• A cryptocurrency converter that allows you to exchange cryptocurrencies for others at the current exchange rate without commissions;​• Staking from 5% per annum for holders who prefer to store cryptocurrency in anticipation of the best price.​In the near future, we will release our own P2P exchange – this product will help merchants work more efficiently with cryptocurrencies, thanks to the possibility of exchanging them for fiat funds and vice versa. You can find out more about future developments and innovations in our roadmap.Contact our client support team in Telegram: t.me/cryptomus_supportOr use the feedback form on the website: cryptomus.comEmail for cooperation: advertisement@cryptomus.com",

      "body": "What is cryptoprocessing?Cryptoprocessing is a modern payment tool, thanks to which customers pay for goods or services online not with ordinary money via bank data or payment systems, but with cryptocurrency. Agree that today's development of the cryptoindustry in one way or another requires merchants or merchants to integrate new payment solutions for doing business online.This possibility of using cryptoprocessing is not only convenient for buyers, but also beneficial for merchants integrating this payment method to their sites. That is, by accepting customers' money transfers in cryptocurrency, merchants save on commissions, the amount of which is significantly higher for ordinary bank transfers, and also increase the number of buyers, many of whom are eager to pay with cryptocurrency. Due to new payment approaches the client base and, correspondingly, the company's profit grows.Cryptomus gives everything necessary for comfortable and safe acceptance of cryptocurrency payments with the lowest commissions.
