  "content": "The BOE might strike first then Fed and ECBCentral Banks knows they cant save Fiat currency value anymore the stronger currency Will eat the weaker one.And bitcoin Will eat all of them.They might pivot very soon the inflation will go high but the central Banks not care about becouse they know they cant save Fiat currency.When europe the euro currency replaced weaker currencies like finnish baltic and other local currencies Same might be happening with most of the fiat currencies euro and gbp are in danger and might not survive If there would be other pivot and qe.So people in UK and EU Will better do it with crypto by holding funds in btc and crypto when crypto falls then dca then this Will keep their balance Stable more coins and better purache power.Central Banks talking now about pivot and QE ...so If they do then most people in UK and EU specially cant afford any food or Pay for energy.Â And we support or not we want or not but in this situation btc Will have biggest purache power.Fed likely might pivot to LET burn dollar fully and make huge bull run next 1-2 years huge gains and then the old fiat currency Will be done this is likely scenario here.1 btc is more then 23k now the price so it's most highest value currency you can use for payments the currency with best purache power in the world Anyone whos not interested about crypto and btc in some countries they Will be in the deep trouble soon.The other option Will be the central Banks Will hike rates until full economic downturn but this Will affecting the very wealthy ones Also so they better kill few fiat currencies with big inflation.",

      "body": "The general purpose of rate hikes is to make a particular currency attractive to investors seeking higher yield, leading to potentially increased demand and strengthening its value relative to other currencies. However, higher interest rates also have negative impact on economy as it can result in reduced spending and investment which is not good for economy in the long term. In such scenario, Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are viewed as alternative investments that can provide diversification and hedge against traditional economic risks.",

      "body": "I simply don't know what initiated this post by the OP, such is so ill-informed, and I don't know why people are always pitching Bitcoin against fiat as if Bitcoin can survive without fiat.Well, if you must know, nothing is eating nothing, there are times when fiat will thrive and nothing will stop the thriving of Bitcoin when its time comes. The USD for example has proven itself to be so dependable and dominating in the world, so it should be disregarded entirely because of Bitcoin? Common!!! Wake up.However, the rate hike in the world is not to threaten anything but a measure to limit the effect of inflation on the economy. It's a regular world standard practice, so what?",
