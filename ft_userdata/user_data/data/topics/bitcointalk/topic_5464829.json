  "content": "Hi all,Would appreciate advise on what to do, I purchased 2014 funtokens on the 4th January 2023 and they showed in my account, I locked them and Freebitcoin did an update! They disappeared, havenâ€™t been returned to me since, I have sent lots of messages through support@freebitcoin.in to no avail. I have screen shot of purchase & locked for 360 days but they are not there?Could someone please help me.Thanks,Mary",

      "body": "Sorry to hear that, apart from contacting them directly I'm not sure what else can be done. I assume you've tried the message form in the FAQ? Also just a slight thing, you say you've emailed support@freebitcoin.in , the website is freebitco.in, so did your emails get bounced back or just not answered?Freebitco.in is primarily a gambling site, and the site hasn't changed much, if at all, in many years; I highly doubt they have a large support team so any replies will probably take a bit of time.For me, I see Freebitco.in as a free lottery. I've never bought fun tokens; just collected the free satoshis, exchanged RP for extra satoshis, and then withdrew those satoshis when I hit the minimum payout. You need an old style withdrawal address starting with 1 ... The site works and keeps gamblers gambling, they use lots of little tricks to make you feel really good about gambling; but the odds are always in the sites favour (on the multiply game, it shows you the odds you are getting; a 50/50 chance, wager 1 sat win 1 sat, you only have a 47.5% chance; the house always wins) - so why would they ever change the code if they didn't have to, or keep a support team around to dive into code that's been running for years?Not your keys, not your coins, applies here. You and I have no control, and any resolution is going to come from getting in touch with them. I'd say be patient and wait for a reply, keep the screenshots safe, wait a week get in touch with them, be patient and wait...I wish you the best of luck in getting this resolved.",

      "body": "Hi Kamikazeqvist,I have been patient, happened on the 4th January, 2023, yes, I sent emails through FAQ and also email. They were sent to support@freebitco.in, I made a typo error in the above message, I have also contacted person above that was recommended and hopefully will get this sorted.Thanks so much for your help,Mary",
