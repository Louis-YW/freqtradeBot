      "body": "Personally, I don't think the way you consider post quality is right, let me buttress a quality post can be a two line statement or less as far as it sends a message I'm quite sure it has a quality than writing a million plus words that beats around the bush without a clear point. So spending time to create a post depends on what you are about to write, most people mistake quality for quantity there is a big difference in it, like someone writing alot of post everyday with a good messages such as helping out people to solve problems and someone writing same quality without a message it's considered quantity not quality  hence this thing is just intertwined.I will use people from the forum as example. JayJuanGee writes a lot of words in his post and is considered a quality poster.Oshosondy writes a two or three lines sentence and his considered a quality poster. Then let's take me for example now I can write like JayJuanGee and yet it's still not a quality post and you can write like Oshosondy and it still not be considered a quality post hence it all depends on the message your post carries.",

      "body": "Quality posting first demands understanding the topic and contents being discussed. I believe passing a message across in a brief and concise manner with enough detailed information as expected is considerably what is required than too many compounded words that lacks value and essence to the reader without clear information being passed. Also knowing, not all brief response are quality enough and some times those with the higher quantity of words has better impact as they make their post well constructive, with well detail information on what is being discussed. It is required of us to have a well knowledge on the topic before we make any response and the one's we know nothing about we spend time to read and understand from those who are making their own contributions on the matter being discussed, gradually knowledge is being added and where we find difficult to comprehend questions can be asked, instead of spamming.",

Nomatter how best of you is proven you are likely to do an error or one aside would want to make a falseful error of your professionality. I don't think the grammatical terms and the t spellings are were errors are lied because it is believed that the unifying language here which is English could be a borrowed language to the others. So , they are likely to make such error mistakes which I am not biased about.My point of view here is about the posters (forum users) time factors on how it is utilized or considered at when having the keyboard at hand supposing to make quality and constructive posts. Because some of the forum users mostly the beginners are not endured enough to read and understand the posts before contributing to it and at the period of creating posts, they are likely not bothered in stressing and brainstorming to make quality and constructive posts.",

Each subscription campaign manager has their own criteria for the number of characters a post must contain to be counted as legitimate. As a rule, this number varies from 150 to 200 characters. In some cases, this number may be higher or lower. If you can write a decent post (not just a flood) within these criteria, then naturally the manager will count it.",

This is correct but most of the one-liner/single post here in forum are typically spammer and just stating the obvious answer that’s why some people have a misconception that a short answer means shit post.The other reason why others are encouraged to post long is because the character requirements for signature campaign that’s why most of the post of campaigner is long to guarantee well thought post.",

You have started a good topic even if this topic has been discussed few times before. But this topic never gets old especially when new members are keep coming and old members are going on the wrong side of preferring quantity over quality. This will work as a reminder for these members and they can realize that they are doing wrong. Making more posts is not wrong, what is actually wrong is making useless and meaningless posts. I also make a lot of posts and I will not say all of my posts are 100% meaningful because one post can be meaningful for one member but may not be meaningful for another member. Most of the members are just trying to fill their posts quota and making abrupt posts, I read a post yesterday where, the OP was talking about spamming, like why this forum has spam posts and the main reason he mentioned is, that most of the people with more than 1 accounts are working in campaign and to fill there posts quota they are making posts which are almost useless to anyone.",

If you resort doing like that, you will end up with burst posting that are done just to finish the required post but are not made actually from being constructive and quality posts. I see a lot of beginners are doing like this and end up having the forum admin keeping an eye to them because they don't follow one of the rules in the forum.These newbies are also found to be spamming as well. But I guess the longer they stay in the forum, the higher chances that they will learn what's right from wrong and correct their wrong posting habits.",

And then you quickly answers =4  but yeah, a beginner (newcomer) could be asked same question but would need some bit times to put it in logics to count the figures by numbers and sums up before being able to give the rightful answer.This is not that you are forcing in to give response to the discussion on board or not being knowledgeable of it as you said @un_rank it literarily demands some factors of time for logical inspiration due to your unawareness of the forum or considering the nature of the discussion depending if technical or not.",

Nobody wants to read that, and you will not get merit for it. Moreover, the length of your post and the quality of your English are only minor factors.
