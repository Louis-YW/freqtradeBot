The receiver can withdraw the money from their bank account but as long as there's a recall, they will be in debt.you should copy all this This recall of a SEPA Credit Transfer may be requested up to 13 months after the book date of the original transaction and must include a comprehensible reason, that will be submitted to the beneficiary for its consideration (e.g. incorrect beneficiary or amount). Note that ING cannot guarantee that the requester will effectively receive back the funds of the initial SEPA Credit Transfer since consent of the beneficiary and the beneficiary bank is needed.In addition to the fee payable to ING to process the recall request, the beneficiary bank may charge a return fee in cases of a successful recall, which can be deducted by the beneficiary bank from the amount of the initial SEPA Credit Transfer before returning the recalled funds to the requester.Once the process has been completed, nothing can be done to reverse or cancel the process. The recipient's bank will have already given the money to the recipient and the deal completedIt may request for a reversal of transaction. If the beneficiary agrees, the transaction will be reversed back within 7 working days. In case of beneficiary from another branch, you have to personally visit the branch to meet the bank manager for the solution.https://photos.app.goo.gl/5aH5aS6hC8byXY8F8 iever had issue with sepa payments",

      "body": "If I may respond to this, and I'm not defending anyone here, it's about my experiences with SEPA transfers. These are not reversible. I can only talk about my own experience and note that the amounts were much smaller and I live in the EU but I don´t think bothmake any difference.I myself have run into trouble a number of times. Two small amounts and one larger amount of €1,100. Once the transaction was processed (it was to a foreign account), there was no way to reverse the transaction.What the bank could do for me was to contact the bank of the person I should not have sent money to (but found out a bit too late). Indeed, I found out that the €1,100 was temporarily blocked for him after my complaint, but the recipient was called by the bank about the complaint and all they had to do was to say that they did not accept the return of the money.The only option left for me was to try to get my money back through legal means. This was in 2021.Another experience was someone from the same country I am rightout scammed me and let me pay an amount of $100+ in his bankaccount. I had it back in a few days. You can put so much pressure on that person that took advantage of you. Another experience I had involved someone from the same country as me outright scamming me, leading me to deposit an amount of over $100 into their bank account. I managed to get it back within a few days. You can exert a significant amount of pressure on the person who took advantage of you. Just step into an office of his bank. With evidence ofcourse.",
