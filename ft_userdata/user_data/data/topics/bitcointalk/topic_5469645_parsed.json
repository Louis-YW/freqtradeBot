We have numerous altcoins out there in the market and it is not advisable to invest in them, because their devs use them to extort money from the people after a hype. Here are some altcoins Etherum, Litecoin, Dodgecoin and many more. There is no special way of knowing altcoins, as long as it is not bitcoin, then you should know that it is altcoin.",

But if you look at the past, you'll see most of them became trash or lost to the ground. That is the reason behind called shitcoins. They can only give you temporary profits.
