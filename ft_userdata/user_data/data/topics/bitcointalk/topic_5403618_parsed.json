  "content": "So while the \"When Lambo\" crew have disappeared there is a lot of talk about Bitcoin'smarket value falling further, $13k, $10k and beyond.Think back to 2017 The ATH at the end of the year was ~$19700Think back 1 year after to 2018 Bitcoin fell to under $4000We all know Bitcoin in the long term is only going one way, and thats up but most of usdidnt take the opportunities presented to us like in 2018, $4000 for a Bitcoin  is nowa \"sell everything\" to buy Bitcoinprice.Everyone has a mark at such time they panic to BUY Bitcoin, at what price is your \"sell everything to BUY Bitcoin\" mark?We know $69000 is easily achievable and we may not see these prices again after nextyear so we have to take these bear market opportunities.",

I feel like it is the easiest way to make money, and it just feels like it is the opposite of hard, you literally do nothing while holding, holding is not a thing that you do, it is just the name we call to doing nothing.There are some people who fail to do it, don't know why and how, but it just feels like they are not good at it at all. I have been doing DCA for a while as well, and I wish I started earlier, I would love to have a lot more right now, if I had money, I would buy bitcoin right now without a worry at all, it is as close to bottom as it gets anyway.",

Some people doesn't really know how to find the positive side of what they thought would be negative, of course there's always a positive side you just have to change your perception on how you see things.Bitcoin is not any other coins that would just continue to pump then suddenly dump almost everything until it gets delisted from the exchange. There are few people who can find opportunities in this situation and that is the people who's in this market for a long time.",

I also find the \"sell everything to buy Bitcoin price\" to be relatively useless. For me in 2018 it was in the $1K-$2K region, but this never happened as price only reached $3.2K. Instead I was a buyer when a breakout was confirmed at $5K.I think most investors these days prefer to play it safe, and we'll either see heavy buying pressure if price capitulates further to $10K, or otherwise buyers will step in back aove $25K. After all, it's a lot safer buying into a confirmed recovery and trend change, as opposed to trying to buy a falling knife. Not to mention DCA during a bear market to be reliable in order to get an average price. Personally I preferred having an average price of $6K to $8K during the bear market of 2018/2019, rather than buying $4K and holding for the duration, with price reaching $14K as well as returning to $4K...",
