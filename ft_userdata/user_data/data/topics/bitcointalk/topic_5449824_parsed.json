We should continuously learn our lesson on our losses before we go to the next one to avoid trading just to chase loss.Quote from: mvdheuvel1983 on April 22, 2023, 09:56:12 PMFurthermore someone said that the losses incurred in trading especially when you were disciplined enough to stick to your plans and the proper risks management strategies should not be considered losses. He said they are akin to operational costs for running a business. What do you think?Loss is still loss no matter how you view it on different perspective. We should consider it loss to make our future trade more cautious because of our previous experience. I think this is just a self justification to accept losses easily but loss is a loss.",

Even a professional trader can still lose money in some trades, but they don't overthink their losses, not to making more trades to archive profit. Only an amateur trader can overthink their losses, which can make them even worse traders because people who act in such manner can end up allowing their emotions to take some trading decisions that will even cause them more losses. So anyone who is not ready to experience loss should not even trade at all.",

He said they are akin to operational costs for running a business. What do you think?I highly agree. Losses are a normal part of the game. It is necessary to let the probability of your strategy play over a series of trades.Losses are just taxes in your business. It is simply a losing transaction so why bother? The most important thing is you act accordingly to your plan. As long as you are following your plan, with little to no deviation as much as possible. Every losing position is a win in the long run. Since losing must be expected, one strategy should also have sound risk and money management. Overleveraging is the easiest way to lose your account. A loss or a series of drawdowns is like having a flat tire. It sucks. but guess what? soon enough when you stick to your trading system you'll get out of that rut. It's not consistently winning, it is all about consistently following your trading plan.",

What do you think?I believe this because sometimes the market doesn't allow your plans to work and in such cases where you have done the right thing and discipline then you should see it as one of those days that you are running a cost without profit. In reference to trading bitcoin, the price has been dropping since a week and nothing indicating the reason for the drop, so a trading buying while price is dropping should get acquainted that sometimes the market just have to take away certain percentage from you as cost that you may not explain but to move on with the mindset that every day isn't for profit.",

As simple as that!Considering that the price of Bitcoin has grown by over 30,000 times in the last 14 years, it is reasonable to assume that there is a significant demand for this cryptocurrency. However, in order to further support the bullish trend in the coming year, some believe that we need more institutional investors, larger funds in the crypto space, increased demand and liquidity, as well as more crowdfunding initiatives. While we currently lack concrete evidence to support these predictions, the fact that Bitcoin reached a price of $30,000 in a short period of time this year, which is half of its previous all-time high, suggests that anything is possible by the end of the year.",

Operational costs I think only cover tolerable fees such as trading, withdrawals or asset holding fees if any(some exchanges charge this fee).

If you see that you are on a little bit of loss and your next analysis indicates the opposite of your open trades. Do you still keep that trade open in hopes that it will go as planned and ignore your analysis? No, if you do it, you'll be in loss and could also get liquidated. So instead, you make your risk management on how much you can lose and won't affect your trading, then you close at that point and open a new one. By doing this, you turn the tide in your favor. Many newbies forget to learn this and only focus on emotions. This is the worst mistake a trader can do. But you need to do your own research and come up with a plan that will suite you.",
