  "content": "So you may be heard this couple of weeks ago. Still it's so hype in the twitter. So wordcoin is offering 70-80$ airdrop for those who own s wordcoin id. To get Id you need to verify you via iris scanner. So right now there are long queue to get a id. Most of people doing this because of that free airdrop. But no one is thinking about the consequences of this. I mean we don't know what will they do the data that they collect from us. They never mention why they implemented iris scanner, what will they do with those data collect from scanning peoples eyes.  So why people don't afraid for this situation. For 70$ they sold their data. What happens if worldcoin use this iris data for illegal activity?",

I would like to leave a decent quote about worldcoin here:\"If the product is free then YOU are the product.So what does it mean if the product, is not only free, but pays you?It seems then your cherished biometric data is the product.This is how the new Worldcoin retinal scanning “orbs” work.\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeGammon/status/1683556303044501506But the question is also, with the current development of technology and attacks on our privacy from every side, is it not that we are doomed to lose? if not now, in a decade or two, when technology will advance so much that cameras enabling such a scan will be installed at every pedestrian crossing for \"our safety\". I've always respected my privacy and try to fight every attempt to invade it, but a few days ago I started to wonder if my fight isn't doomed to failure.",

In this case, the question of privacy infringement and misuse of data looms large.While Worldcoin, via their World App, promises a seamless, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly experience, the method of identity verification leaves much to be desired. Iris scans are a potent tool, yes, but they're equally potent when misused.The key issue here is transparency, or lack thereof. Worldcoin needs to be clear about how they intend to use and protect this sensitive data. Until such clarifications are made, I advise caution.",

The most distinguished part of it and the most controversial one, the iris scanner is what making it both popular and controversial both at a time.Personally, I don't think we are ready to give one of our most sensitive identification to a company we are not sure about has the necessary measures to secure the data and we can't be sure if they are used for the right cause. Worldcoin should have worked and shown their potent on the field of security and gained the trust before asking for something sensitive like an iris scan.

I'm sure they trying to explain what their product does on the blog but of course, it is for their own benefit and interest.Here is the page where they claim they have open-sourced the project ecosystem: https://worldcoin.org/open-source. I don't know what is the differences between the green and yellow dots.

While there will be desperate people that will do it, there are some that are even complying and sending their KYCs to unknown projects and undetermined ones if there's a future or success of it. Technology today can do anything and that's why they're asking for the iris because they have a scanner on it and they'll for sure keep a copy of it and will use it for something else. Yes, maybe AI or there could be even more but you're right OP that it's possible that they can also use it for illegal things, and what if the authorities have found out that your iris was used for one of it and you can do anything with it because you've just sold it to them through an airdrop and a few bucks. That's why it is not going to happen to me, call me paranoid or what but everyone is sharing the same sentiment regarding this thing from worldcoin. They're still in hype and popularity and that's why I think it is timely that they've announced that for more attention.",
