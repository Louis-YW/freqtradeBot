Please help.They are friendly with Bitcoin and El Salvador is a first nation makes Bitcoin legal tender. They airdropped bitcoins to their citizens too but if you want to have business there, it is risky.El Salvador has very high criminal rates and it is not a safe place to run business. I am not sure your idea to incorporate business but if you will directly open business office there, it is risky. If you do it indirectly through your business partner, it is still risky as your business partner will have risk of criminal activities too.I don't think it is impossible for business as many companies have their business in El Salvador with Bitcoin and Lightning Network. Just aware of risk.",
