  "content": "Recently, Binance has changed some deposit addresses for its users, which they said is due to security, and some of the forum users here were on the support list as it is good for such acts for security reasons.Hotbit Exchange has now announced that all CEX operations will cease as of May 22, 2023, though users will still be able to withdraw all of their funds prior to June 21.  They believe the former management employee, who quit working there in April, was involved in a project that violated Hotbit rules. My questions here are:1. Can centralized exchanges be fully relied on again?2. Can we trust them with our money even as all those recent ones are given room for the users to withdraw their funds?3. And can we depend on this opportunity to allow users to withdraw their funds and keep trusting them?I feel that if the CEX management does not trust themselves, then why are we trusting them and giving them our coins to keep for us?Hotbit has given three reasons for this action, which are as follows:Quote1. deterioration of the operating conditions.2. change in the crypto industry trend.3. Hotbit has also suffered numerous problems, such as repeated cyber attacks and the exploitation of project defects by malicious users, resulting in significant losses.Source: https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14750194236823-It-s-time-to-take-a-bow",

It is not your keys and it is not your coins on blockchain. Which means you have no full control over your own coins.2. With noncustodial wallet, you will have no one to trust. Leave only the money you are using to trade on exchanges and have the remaining on noncustodial wallet. Some people will trade and still always transfer all their trading money to a noncustodial wallet. Offline wallets which are safer.3. Do not trust. Trust only yourself.",

Being your own bank means you keep your coins yourself, thus if you have been trusting third party entities to keep your coins for you, time has come for you to move it into your non-custodial wallet.Having said that, use exchanges for the purpose of trading; don't fall for the misconception that they are \"banks\" where you can keep your crypto, your crypto bank is your non-custodial wallet that you control and have the keys.",

      "body": "I don't understand what connection did you find between Binance updating deposit addresses and this case of Hotbit that pushed you to question whether should we trust centralized exchanges after these accidents or not?Summarized answer is that you should not hold your coins on exchanges and the basic rule is: Not your keys, not your coins.But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't use exchanges at all. There are certain financial features that only centralized exchanges can offer, for example margin trading, futures trading, options and so on. If you use these features, you have to use centralized exchanges but if you only want to trade bitcoin to another peer and you don't do it daily, then decentralized exchanges are the best option among available ones.",

And can we depend on this opportunity to allow users to withdraw their funds and keep trusting them?Of course not. Let's take your example - hotbit for instance. Yes, they are giving people time to withdraw but it's only for a month. This time frame is simply too short for most if not everyone to be able to withdraw everything. Since people's money are already on their pocket, we are almost always at their mercy. Not to mention, sometimes situation could get worse with CEx's e.g. hacking/exit scam where it's possible you won't have any chance of getting everything back.Dabbling into CEx is just picking the lesser evil and setting up preventive measures. Don't even think about giving them your full trust.",

The point here is, never store your coin on CEX for a long period of time, after your trading session, withdraw them all. If you're in a trading session, we should regularly assess the reliability and security of an exchange, including staying updated about its policies, regulatory compliance, and any changes in its operating procedures just like Binance did.",

These exchange make use of multi signature wallets because of extra security and humans can't be trust especially when large sums of money are involved that crimes can be committed without been caught so they can't fully trust each other. No centralized service should even be trusted to the point of leaving our coins on their platforms. Centralized exchange hasn't had a reason to fully rely on them and they can never have any reason for that.Don't even store your coins on exchanges as that's not the purpose why we have those platforms existing, they're there as a medium to be used for trading and so shall it remain. Infact if you don't have any legitimate reason to us them then don't use them. Make use of the decentralized exchange for your trading. When exchanges allow their users to withdraw then noted that the reason behind that particular exchange shutting down could be as a result of the SEC pressing down on their necks or low trading volumes and since they can't keep up running a business at a lost so they have to shutdown still that doesn't mean they can be trusted. They might only be doing that to keep a clean reputation.",
