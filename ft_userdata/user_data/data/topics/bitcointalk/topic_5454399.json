The answer to this is dependent on your country of origin, because for me in Nigeria, holding 1 Bitcoin for the next bull rub can make you a millionaire in my local currency, because the value of my local currency is low compared to the DCA Bitcoin price and if there is any increase in the price of bitcoin somewhere around $1k+ it enough to earn you a million naira in profits. But for those who leave in the United States, it may not be able to make them a millionaire in the currency, since Bitcoin have to do multiple price increase in innumerable e.e.g. million dollars x price to make you a million dollar profits from holding 1 Bitcoin.",

Let's take for instance you invested on bitcoin and two other altcoins while bitcoin was at $27,000 you hodl and secure your assets till when the bullrun occur after some years and the bitcoin price jumped up to a new all time high of about $150,000 from it all time high of $68,000, this will be a massive increase on all your investments including those other two coins you have invested because they will definitely gives you a reasonable profit realization, this makes it a good idea to always buy the dip and hodl till major event happens that makes the market go bullish, this same experience will happen to all other cryptos you have invested on as long as they are still in market running and they project never failed.",

How can you seriously expect someone to give you a meaningful answer to such a question? Yes, investing in BTC and ETH has made some people millionaires in the past, but you can't really expect someone to predict with certainty whether investing in BTC would be enough to make someone a millionaire in the next bull run. Also, you can't really expect someone to tell you which coins have the highest chance of making you rich. Let's look at meme coins like DOGE or SHIB as an example. If someone, just a random person on a forum, had told you two years ago that these coins would skyrocket by 100x or even 1000x, would you have believed it? Even if you did accept such a prediction and invested in these coins, chances are you wouldn't have become a millionaire, and you likely wouldn't have sold at the all-time high (ATH), because accurately timing the market is practically impossible.The problem is that no one can predict the future. There is no way to know what will happen in the next bull run or bear market. The best thing you can do is to learn as much as possible about cryptocurrency investing so that you can make an informed decision about whether it's right for you. And don't rely on other people's predictions, because in most cases, these people are not doing it in your interest, but in theirs.",

Yes, I'm sure you will get big profits if you start investing from now on. It's not too late because the bitcoin price has already dropped a lot, and maybe in the next bullrun, the price will pass $60k. And a little advice, you can also invest in the top 10 accredited tokens instead of investing in new coins, because the it's very highrisk.",

How much money can be considered as a millionaire? I think this is very relative so there is no comparison because everyone is different in saying this, so if you want to become a millionaire from bitcoin or other crypto then you have to be prepared for all the risks and it's not easy to say even if you imagined being bullish before not necessarily you will never feel if you don't know how to invest here and when to take advantage of it all it takes the right time to do it.Altcoins are full of risks, but in some other coins there are up to thousands of percent, but you have to know which coin to choose, all of that requires research, even if you fail to choose the altcoin to invest, it will be a big loss in your life.Basically Bitcoin is the best investment choice but if you have 1 BTC then it is enough with bull run conditions for example, but I can't say you are a millionaire because other people will have more value than you.",

If you have $10,000, for example, neither ETH nor BTC will make you a millionaire. The growth of these coins has slowed down a lot and is unlikely to keep the same pace as before. Altcoins can make you a millionaire even with a modest deposit of several thousand dollars, and in just a few years, but you have to try hard and keep abreast of all new and promising altcoins.",

For you to become a millionaire on the next bull run, Bitcoin should reach $1m. I don't think that it will happen anytime sooner but you get the safest crypto investment. While many will say that it's more likely for you to earn that much with altcoins. But the risk is higher and you'll never know if these projects are here to stay.So, you get to choose the slow process but surer or the quicker process but you're like playing random cards.",

Investing in bitcoin would rarely make you a millionaire, simply because the value of Bitcoin is already very high and you are only investing one bitcoin. If you consider putting same amount in other less valuable coin, it may be possible to surpass the millionaire goal as there would be multiplier effect when the value of such token goes higher.",

If you buy 1 btc now selling around $28,007 and when the price of btc by next year bull go to $200,000, this means you have make more return in your investment. That will be about x6 profit apart from your investment money which is current price ( $200,000 ) - minus your investment that is buying price ($28,007), $200,000 - $28,007 = $191,993.

Basically between bitcoin and ethereum start from the price of $ 0 and then they reach different ATH levels with different journey times. The question is, who really survived from the starting point? (Identification of millionaires starts from here).Speaking of innovation, bitcoin has brought everyone financial freedom to a certain level, Ethereum has brought solutions to almost all of the fintech industry.

First, it wasn't \"safe\" for you to become a millionaire back then. It seems safe compared to now because we KNOW what's going to happen already, so don't be dumb enough to assume that that's always the case. Second, it seemed like \"modest\" investments now, but with the same logic as the first, it only seemed like it. I mean, would it seem modest to invest thousands of dollars on an unknown currency that popped up all of a sudden without any company backing it? Any altcoin could potentially give you big profit, the margin of growth in new coins is a lot bigger in comparison to old coins after all, but at the same time, just like when Bitcoin was new, the risk is comparatively higher compared to well-known ones. As for Bitcoin making you a millionaire, who knows? It may be a modest growth, or maybe even none at all. I'd suggest just doing DCA though instead if possible.",

So whether you accept losses in the short term or a relative period of time, I see that the hype in investing makes many people who have not experienced it to have a subjective view of this field as well as the market. Do your own research, don't depend on anyone's judgment, then come back and answer the questions you've asked yourself, and repeat this now or in the future that you really believe. bitcoin?",

I don't think 1BTC is enough to get millionaire on the next bull run. Last ATH was 69,000$, so even on the most optmistic scenario it's unlikely Bitcoin is going to cross the 1$ million dollars barrier... Be happy and consider mission accomplished if BTC is able to reach 100,000$. Moreover, indeed, the percentage of gains with BTC must be lower than it was on previous cycles. You can't make the same profit right now early investors made on their times. Market loses traction as it becomes more solid and less volatile.On the other hand, there isn't anything like \"elite altcoins\" on this industry, neither they are safe investments. The safest investment in crypto is still Bitcoin and if that is the characteristic you are looking for, you should invest your funds in BTC.
