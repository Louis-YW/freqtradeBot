Exchanges are not secure, they are often hacked and your coins can be freezed, your account can be blocked, you have no full control, it is not your coin on blockchain as you do not have the private key.Web wallets are most vulnerable, followed by mobile and followed by desktop. They are all online wallets, they are more vulnerable, the reason to have just small amount of coins on such wallets. I do not recommend web wallets.Quote from: Yawa2020 on July 05, 2022, 10:34:52 AMhttps://www.quidax.com/Not recommendable, I have used it before like 2 years ago, it deduct far more than the amount it displays to deduct while converting from one coin to another.",

After 6 months of continuous operation, their website crashed, thus wiping all of my BTCs in the process (USI-TECH ponzi).

But still they like to keep them but keeping them on non custodial wallets is far better that don't have access to your funds directly.",
