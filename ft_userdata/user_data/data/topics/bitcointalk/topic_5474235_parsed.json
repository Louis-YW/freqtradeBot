  "content": "My twitter: @enrikebambo*There is pinned post about some informations included below, but they are actually obsolete, given that the community is acting very quickly and rapidly.1/ Let me introduce you to a certain project --> Pulse Inu, community driven project on the PulseChain network. I'm community member and I'm gonna break it down a little.Website: https://pulseinu.orgStake: http://pulseinu.org/stakeBurn: http://pulseinu.org/burnX: @PulseInuOfficial: https://t.me/pulseinuofficialOther Telegram channels:Poland: https://t.me/PulseInuPolandChina: https://t.me/pulseinuchinaFrance: https://t.me/pulseinufranceNigeria: https://t.me/pulseinunigeriaKorea: https://t.me/pulseinukorea2/ At first glance this is another memecoin based on dog, that many people love as well as hate, however this one is on the Pulsechain Network, which in my opinion will still have a lot to show in the forthcoming years, the competition is really weak and PulseInu vibe surprises!3/ We have an interesting formula which was initially introduced in HEX token created by Richard Heart (founder of Pulse Chain Network)The mint phase lasted 180 days and ended on 9/11/2023. During this period we managed to collect almost $2 billions PLS.4/ Tokenomics:https://www.geckoterminal.com/pulsechain/pools/0xd1b9544c5be500a002e6a5c8ce4f1f53d16aa108As of this moment:24h Volume$41.39KLiquidity$55.1KFully Diluted Valuation$1.17MMarket Cap$1.17M- Supply: 230,702,249,532,092.202 PINU ( still about 5-10% has been unclaimed from the refferal program, so it may grow a bit).5/ Burn $PINU to get NFTs! There are only 10000 pieces to be minted. Some NFTs are rarer than the others. 386 EPIC, 3 LEGENDARY (2 minted already), 1 GODLIKE, the rest EXTRA RARE/RARE. It doesn't matter actually because each of them is unique, it depends on a few aspects, as you probably know. Â All 1 of 1, no copies! Right now (15/11/2023) their value based on burning price is about 12-70$. More new people coming from other countries, but mainly Polish, who have seen some 'pumpamental' potential in this meme token. I think, they were charmed by my NFT collection, but I'll remain humble. Unfortunately some people decided to leave the group before the mint phase was launched. They probably concluded that it's a scam and not worth engagement, that's a pity. Nonetheless, nothing is lost!6/ Staking - by blocking your tokens you get in return \"Shares\", which I would call the number of shares in the distribution = more shares, bigger slice of the cake. Yield Boost Bonus generated from NFTs is cumulative, so with a few pieces you can get a pretty good booster. So, you can mint NFTs for burning 10 Billion (for 30% bonus) or 2 Billion PINU tokens (for 5% bonus). You get rewards in PLS tokens and it depends on the amount of held NFTs. Staking also has a referral system, where you can get 20 000 PLS for each person, who will stake his $PINU through your individual link. The cost of stake is 100 000 PLS, which is distributed to the staking participants, there's no possibility to terminate the stake earlier.7/ Both the $PINU token and the staking mechanism have a Coinfabrik audit.https://www.coinfabrik.com/blog/pulse-inu-audit/I will add staking mechanism audit as soon as it is uploaded into coinfabrik site. But can actually send this audit on Telegram.8/ With the current strong condition of Cryptos, recurring situations, where memecoins are changing people's lives, and the possibilities of adoption in the PulseChain Network I'm willing to bet a few $, not to mention building various dapps by the community itself.9/ A lot of opportunities for development, community acquisition and first and foremost --> burning of supply is not limited.$PINU Contract:https://scan.pulsechain.com/token/0xa12e2661ec6603cbbb891072b2ad5b3d5edb48bdNFTs Contract:https://scan.pulsechain.com/address/0x2B307dB5C0b745B0D77d424479f1F4D37980383FNFTs on marketplaces:https://pulsemarket.app/collection/0x2b307db5c0b745b0d77d424479f1f4d37980383fhttps://nftonpulse.io/collectionDetail/90d33342-749d-40e3-a649-c80c22d34f61I hope that at least NFTs give some profit in the near future. They are some sorta of my trademark and I'm proud, that community appreciates my work, though it's only pixel art, nothing more .If something comes to mind I will add it soon.Write what you think about it.",

      "body": "hello @enrikebambo maybe some update reffering to first post?? how its look now?I also join pulseinu community. I really like the fact that it is a true community project with a closed smartcontract. There were no pools for the team or CEO. Besides, the project does not have a team, only a community.No one has any expectations towards anyone.I also see that a community wallet has been created. It is under the care of a YouTuber who recorded the first videos about the project. On that wallet community collects funds. I see that the goal at the moment is listing on XeggeX. There is not much left to collect enough funds for the listing.It's nice to know that the project community is working hard. I also saw an NFT of the community wallet, probably intended for all kinds of competitions in the future.I see that the main liquidity is accumulated on phux.https://www.coingecko.com/pl/waluty/pulse-inu-2Coingeko still needs to upload the proper project icon and you have to be careful with the second project on erc20 which has the same name but uses hipe around true pulseinu.orgCorrect pulseinu.org is only avaible on one network - Pulsechain Network (that guy from HEX Richard)I see that pulse inu is also available on kanga.exchange :-) I use them as fiat gateway for crypto, nice!Enrikebambo, from what I read on project telegram group, you also made an NFT without any paymnet for the Pulseinu community.I can honestly say that I am very impressed with the style in which the NFT was made and the work you put into it.I'm waiting for an update, because the only materials I found on YouTube are not in English. I would be interested in something in ENG. Let's continuing these discussions because I am very curious what everything will look like in a year, I have never been involved in any project so early.",
