If you don't have a discretionary income, it's better that you look for a second means of income and cut down your expenses. Bitcoin is the best asset money can buy.",

Just as you have stated, in waiting for the dip, you'll miss lots of opportunity since we don know the support level where the dip will break out from. Its best to just DCA and when opportunity comes your DCA could even fall into the dip making in two in one strategy.  But the most important thing about bitcoin investment is that you dont use money supposed for other things to buy Bitcoin so you don't get to make quick withdrawals after which you have invested. Because the major goal should be on a long-term holding plan.",

      "body": "While it’s the best time to buy bitcoin when you are emotionally, financially and mentally ready, however there are also factors that you need to consider when buying:1.HODLING If you are seeing bitcoin as a long term approach, and is aware how to manage the risks that bitcoin investment is associated with, then it’s best time to start buying and accumulate good amount of bitcoin.2. Buying on DipsWise investors often buy bitcoin when price is in dips, that is to maximize the purchase while price is still affordable. However, it requires good knowledge so you can predict the market movement more accurately, but due to its volatility nature, it could be quite hard for us to tell whether the current price is already in dips or not.3. Technical AnalysisIf you have the ability to analyze the market charts and patterns, then this could be a great help to find market buying potentials so you can timing the market well. Technical analysis could be helpful but know that it isn’t completely reliable.4. Market Sentiment and NewsKeep updated with the market trends and monitor current sentiments and news. Being focused on how the market reacts with different types of news that will hit the market, that will be crucial for you to make informed decisions when buying bitcoin.",

I don't think there is any one who will have opposite opinion on buying the dip as the most strategic way to accumulate more Bitcoin with less money. Even if you have enough money to invest, taking advantage of the dip is more profitable. Quote But the fact is there is no Best time to buy in the market, but rather a right time for you to buy! Buying during the dip is actually the best time to buy. However, you mustn't have to wait for the dip before you can start your investment journey. In my opinion, at whatever time you buy is the right time for you. But when it comes to best time to buy, you can not really take it away from buying the dip because that's simply the best time to buy. It gives you double advantage when you buy the dip, you're buying at the best time and also at the right time. When you are buying at high price (during the bull) you are buying at the right time but not really the best time.",

So, if anyone wants to invest into Bitcoin but is considering the right time to buy, let them first consider the time frame at which they will be willing to hold that money without the urgency to spend it on something. If you can hold that money for more than 4 years without having needs to spend it, then you don't have problem buying Bitcoin at any time you want, because if you buy at a high price, you will still sell at the ATH of the next bull season and make some profits.",

And as it was said by knowngunman - dip is the best opportunity, though anybody can start their road even without it.",

I think it totally depends on you, It will be possible to purchase Bitcoin whenever you have enough capital to purchase it. You may never get back the opportunity you missed to buy Bitcoin today, time never waits for anyone. Many experienced investors and many members have already said that there is no need to wait to buy Bitcoin. One must be experienced in investing to buy bitcoins during market dips, so that you can analyze the market in the right way and understand the market movements correctly.However, it is not certain when the market dips will occur because the market is associated with volatility. Everyone can buy bitcoin according to their own ability, so don't delay to buy bitcoin buy immediately and hold for long time.",
