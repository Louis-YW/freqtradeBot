I have not scammed anyone, I don't have anything to sell or I don't want to make a trade with anyone, I also don't applie to a loan.I was reading before I posted this how I should do, and I think this was the best way to do it, maybe better to send PM but I don't like drama.You see here we spoke with each others: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458492.msg62524264#msg62524264But how does that make me a scammer?Please remove the feedback because its wrong.",

Meanwhile - negative tags posted by CryptoHFs on your profile will never appear because he is not part of DT. But it's sure to annoy you a lot though you could put it on your distrust list. [~CryptoHF].But by the way, I also found that some DT had tagged CryptoHF's profile as one of those users who abused the trust system - so I don't think he'll ever use DT until he changes his habits.",

I see a feedback with no reference. It's not unclear why CryptoHF left a feedback [Negative] and thinks you are an alt. When leaving a feedback especially a red one, a user must include a reference link. On the other hand, if someone is an alt then it does not mean they have to have a negative feedback unless the other account has been tagged for failing in a financial transaction. CryptoHF himself is a lower rank member and I doubt he have a good understanding of trust feedback system. I will request him to revise the feedback and not to act too harsh in situations.",

      "body": "I am actually more impressed at how you noticed the negative feedback, given that CryptoHFs is not on DT, thus his feedback doesn't show by default. But that thing aside, my post here is more to CryptoHFs than to you.CryptoHFs, I take a peek at your feedbacks. Now, I am not going to put a screenshot or a quote of it here as, if I do so, it'll permanently leave a history of your sent feedback, and I am not trying to be patronizing as well, but by this occasion presented to us, I'd like to extend a suggestion for you to really read what Loyce's suggested on the correct use of the Trust system as well as perhaps reading yahoo's recent question about candy.For Loyce's thread, as it is intended for beginners, the summary can be found on the first post, so I think reading it is quite enough. For Yahoo's though, I'd suggest you to give it a thorough read, chew them 32 times, digest them slowly, and give your own summary based on it as the outcome of the entire length of the discussion is quite mixed. Both of them are a nice read, and I am really really really [can't emphasize this enough] strongly suggesting you to get acquainted with them prior to your next sent feedback.Again, I am not trying to patronize you, and I am not sure your insight of the DTs or --if I may be blunt-- your agenda on being one of them... well, us, but the road you currently take is one of the fastest way to meet Tilde, one of the Trust Sisters. This is not a threat, this is a friendly warning nudging you to understand how things supposed to work. I really hope you heed my suggestion.",

You don't like oppression, I believe you are from the non-conformist school of thought, keep it up. Better days are coming. Yes as you said, CryptoHF as a new comer in the forum has not really understand how to use the trust system so he or she misused the feedback, so it is good to call his attention to know if it was a mistake or he knew it and did it knowingly.Sort of off-topic, but I regret giving you all the merits I did.  I'd like to say I was high out of my mind at the time, but that wasn't it.  Ugh.",

As you rightly stated, what was he doing checking feedback when newbies do not really know much about it. Also, simply by the way he is writing it seems it is designed to come across as a novice non-English speaker but Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on July 24, 2023, 08:51:35 PMQuote from: CryptoHFs on July 24, 2023, 08:22:52 PMTag it I don't really care, you guys worship the tags here like the forum is you life  Yeah well, the forum does mean a lot to many members here (myself included) and if there weren't people trying to mop up all the shit, it would stink worse than it already does.  Y'all take care, now.You probably do not not the situation but I think the puppeteer controlling the CryptoHFs account probably gave up on it because of two significant occurrences. First, his account was tagged as someone who would not ask for a loan in future and second he put a spotlight on himself by posting nonsense in the Reputation and Lending boards.That is true. But I gave up on it once I joined the whirlwind fight. I know since then that this account will be ruined but I choose to stand beside that guy.. since that thing I knew I started building enemies with cryptohfs.",
