  "content": "I'm looking to make \"quick\" bucks by offering my skills on creating landing pages.If you need a landing page I can make it for you.We can discuss about the price based on the features you would like. let's say from 100$ to 1000$ to keep it straight.I can make it:- responsive (mobile first as well)- static (a basic page)- animated (cool animations coming in and going out)- with webgl (basically with some 3d on it - for real - not just 3d images.. this will work mainly on desktop - not mobile friendly)- with forms (contact forms? other kind of forms?)-  with almost anything that comes into your mindI can also provide graphics / illustrations if you need specific things like logos, photos, whatever.Can be stock or original work, as you wish.pls no \"illegal\" or \"shady\" stuff.if you have some reference to get inspiration it's even better, otherwise we can discuss together and find a nice working solution.hope you can help me..  i'm literally underwater ehehehe...thanks!",
