If you are the type that like consolidating your inputs, like after DCAing for a long time, the best for low fee consolidation is pay-to-taproot.If you are the type that have many outputs in transactions, like paying many workers salary, segwit version o (bc1q) is better.If the transaction you are seeing is having the same inputs and outputs, segwit version 0 is better.Is better that I am referring too is the one that has low fee.",

Addresses that start with 3 are p2sh (pay to script hash) and they can be nested segwit, multi-signature, time locked and so on.

      "body": "The both sigwit addresses have an advantage of reducing the transaction fees. The nested segwit address is called a Pay-to-script-Hash (P2SH) and it’s  suitable for multi sig Wallet and can reduce transaction fees by 26%. It is compatible with both new and old softwares. The problem is not all software can get its message verified. The native segwit is the mostly widely use address version because just like P2SH addresses it reduces transaction fee but this time more than Nested. It reduces the fees by almost 52%. It’s only major disadvantage is that it is not compatible with old wallets. Just like it said above it is best when sending to multiple addresses from one address You can read about them here en.bitcoin.it",

Whether a P2SH address is segwit or not depends on the script and I said in my previous post, an address starting with 3 can be a multi-signature address, time locked address, etc. A nested segwit address is called P2WPKH-P2SH. Also note that the percentage of fee reduction isn't always 26% and that depends on number of inputs and outputs.

Some non custodial wallets like Electrum wallet stop default generation for Legacy or Nested Segwit address. Electrum wallet in latest versions by default setting, only generate Native Segwit addresses for users (Bech32, bc1q).You can use Bitcoin Transaction Size Calculators to see differences of different address types, with same inputs and outputs for one transaction.https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-transaction-size-calculator/https://bitcoindata.science/plot-your-transaction-in-mempool.htmlhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/",

You are right, the fee reduction will depend on the  number of inputs and outputs (the more inputs and outputs,  the higher is the reduction). However,  native segwit will always be cheaper than nested segwit. There is no reason to use nested segwit anymore if you are focused in fees reduction. Just go for taproot or native segwit.",

But now, you have to use the console to generate legacy seed phrase on Electum. But using command line in console is only available on desktop Electrum.To generate it, typing this on the console will generate 12 word legacy seed phrase.Code:make_seed(128,\"\",\"standard\")",
