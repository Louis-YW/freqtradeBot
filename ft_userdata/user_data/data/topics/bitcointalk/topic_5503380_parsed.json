  "content": "Arthur Hayes Family Office Fund Maelstrom is supporting Bitcoin developers with grants. Hope members in the Technical Discussion sub-forum benefit. It's a good time to be a BTC dev.QuoteBitcoin is the bedrock asset in the crypto space and unlike other crypto projects, Bitcoin never conducted an offering to raise funds for its technical development. Maelstrom, like other companies in the space, indirectly relies on the work of open-source Bitcoin developers. We are therefore keen to give back and donate to the Bitcoin technology, on which the crypto ecosystem depends.Maelstrom is proud to announce the launch of the Bitcoin Grant Program. The objective of the program is to help with the technical development of Bitcoin and enhance its resilience, scalability, censorship resistance and privacy characteristics. We have the capacity to support Bitcoin developers and are committed to an open and transparent grant process.Applications must be submitted prior to August 25, 2024. + Grants are issued for 12 months and payments are made monthly in BTC, USDC or USDT.+ Grants can range from $50,000 up to $150,000 per developer. + A Grantee will be expected to contribute to Bitcoin’s technical development, potentially in the form of pull requests or review work for the Bitcoin Core software project.+ Grant stacking is permitted with a cap at $250,000 / year.+ Grants are expected to be awarded in Q3 and/or Q4 2024.+ Candidates should expect at least one interview with a member of the review committee prior to the issuance of a grant.+ Your application must contain at least one reference.+ Review Committee includes: Arthur Hayes (CIO) and Jonathan Bier (Grant Program Administrator).https://maelstrom.fund/bitcoin-grant-program/",

When I saw the news, I remembered you, Mocaccinno and the guy you're wearing his signature, oeleo-something. And a few others I read their smart comments.",
