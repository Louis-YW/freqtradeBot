If they were aware of such things, it will be more beneficial for them. I think there's a lot of topic like this at Beginners & Help  where there's many questions that already have been answered. But from your statement OP. It's just a common thing for a beginners to have some mistakes that could help them develop their skills at trading or investing. That's why once you gained an experience plus your knowledge at crypto for a long of period of time it will be easy for you to make a good calls in crypto. Those things you've mentioned are just few common mistakes made mostly by beginners there's also fomo, fud , timing when buying and selling and etc. These what I've been experienced before improving at crypto world.",

Sadly for some people people in non crypto friendly countries or communities it has hard to find people to trade bitcoin with and many had to resort to exchanges. The major problem is not the use of exchanges to sell or buy bitcoin but the type of exchange or the mode to which it is used. Decentralized exchanges are simply the safest but most features like future trading aren’t on some also it doesn’t mean centralized exchanges can’t also be used to trade. The main problem is using these exchanges mostly the centralized ones as wallets were funds are stored rather than just treating it as a marketplace which it is meant for.",

Focusing on limiting yourself to prevent a single mistake will just just give a terrible result in the future because you are allowing other mistake to come at you.In general, Being cautious by not trusting everyone here in crypto space is the best thing to do. Use a service as if they will scam you so that you will not be comfortable leaving your asset unsecured with them. As a newbie, They are the one that needs extra caution on what they are dealing in crypto but sadly most of the newbie are careless and just learning from mistakes after losing their funds.",

Being a newbie in cryptocurrency, you need to start your investment with bitcoin, considering that we have many crypto out there that were just a fancy display of name only and got nothing to offer than high risk taking, if you choose bitcoin being a beginner, you are safe from loosing your entire asset like some would give to you when you invested in their shitcoins, after choosing bitcoin, it is very important also to choose a decentralized exchange for your coin, so that it does not end up in the hands of the hackers or centralized institutionizations.",

Most of them thinks that earning profit in this industry is an easy thing to achieve but in reality it is not. Be mindful or risks on choosing a coin, and if it is Bitcoin, beware of its high market price volatility. Prices are unpredictable and are having no definite pattern wherein one wrong move and you'd suffer from huge loss. Also, avoid FOMOs and other things in relation to this industry which might affect your actions from your investments. Indeed, peofit potential is high for this industry in general, but potential will only remain as potential if no right actions would be made.",

It's important to choose an exchange that has a good track record, transparent fees, and secure storage.Focusing only on pricing instead of ROIs: Beginners often get caught up in the hype of price increases and FOMO (fear of missing out), leading them to invest in cryptocurrencies without understanding the project, its technology, and its potential ROI. It's important to do thorough research and analysis before investing in any cryptocurrency.Lack of research and planning: As mentioned, research is crucial in the crypto space. Beginners may jump into buying a cryptocurrency without understanding its purpose, technology, or long-term potential. It's important to have a strategy and plan before investing in any cryptocurrency.Underestimating cyber security: Cybersecurity is a significant concern in the crypto space, and beginners may not fully understand the importance of securing their investments. It's crucial to store cryptocurrency in secure wallets, use two-factor authentication, and be cautious of phishing scams",

Risks may vary, security, price fluctuations and some things like that, it should be an extra consideration than only expecting returns.About the best trading platforms, some will prefer binance, some will also like other platforms, but it is also a good idea to use local platforms which may have been licensed by the government.",

Once this new person gains experience from here, he will not make such mistakes more often. We have also made such mistakes and learned from them. But beginners will take some time to gain experience and then if they choose a good exchange for crypto trading and continue trading then their path will be successful.It is not necessary to focus only on this issue, but the newcomers should pay attention to some other issues. Like firstly beginners need a secure wallet that is a software wallet but the seed phrase cannot be given to any second person and must be kept in a very safe place. Cannot invest in a hurry Investment must be experienced. Don't join any nonsense airdrop campaign since this is where wallet hacking is most likely.
