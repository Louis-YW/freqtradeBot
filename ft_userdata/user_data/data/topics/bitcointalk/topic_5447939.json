  "content": "Hi allSo I want to display several things on a webpage in php ie getbalance, getblockheight etc etcThis was fine and everything was displaying as I wanted it too, but I found I was typing a lot of the same stuff so thought I would create a config to pull the info in from, however I am having issues as it wont connect to the wallet now.My config:Code:<?php$rpc_user = 'xxxxxxxxx';$rpc_pass = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';$rpc_host = 'localhost';$rpc_port = 'xxxxx';?>My webpage:Code:<?phpinclude('config.php')require_once('easybitcoin.php');$bitcoin = new Bitcoin('$rpc_user','$rpc_pass','$rpc_host','$rpc_port');$getbalance = $bitcoin->getbalance();print_r($getbalance);?>The above is a snipet of the webpage but if I can solve this bit then I can solve the rest, the config file is in the correct directory (the same as the index page)I know the easybitcoin works because if i replace the $rpc_user etc with the actual details its is fine.Any help would be most welcome, I suspect it is something real easy, that I can no longer see as im stressed out over it ThanksTT",
