So, when you place a bet and earn a good amount, you should know when to take profits out and when to stop gambling. This has to do with the emotional part of a gambler. If you do not know how to control it, you will end up losing one way or another",

Luckily the team I chose scored and I won. This has happened to me not the first time but countless numbers if time.But that can be otherwise too.A for me, I do not use cashout, but it can be otherwise too in a way it will remain just few seconds and the bet that is favouring someone will become otherwise and be lost.Just zero your mind to one, nut if I should give my opinion, cashout has more disadvantages than advantages.",

You don't have to wait until the last game is over because you already have an experience where if you wait until it's over, you'll lose more often than not. So learn from that experience, don't be greedy by expecting more profit from gambling because the results can be very unpredictable.

Well it happens that way and this is the reason it is gambling that even in the midst of winning you have to gamble your luck. Don't regret. Always do what you think is appropriate for you at the right time.Certain factors can contribute to our decision in this light. It may be lack of fund, if we need money at that time we can decide not to wait for the full winning money. We may also not be sure of the last game and our past experience is also a factor",

It may not be the highest win you can get, but it's better than zero and losing the wagered money, which will already be a direct loss (your $70). Everyone wants to win here and now, and hit the jackpot, and as a result, greed leads to losses. But what if you change your strategy and aim for not big wins, but to get them for a long time? Little by little, increase your winnings, which will eventually turn into a large amount. It's the same in your story. In the pursuit of $725, you lost $389, but 2 wins of $389 each would give you exactly that $725, but with less risk.",

When a gambler doesn't know when to stop gambling he will eventually end up losing everything and even more. So, when you place a bet and earn a good amount, you should know when to take profits out and when to stop gambling. This has to do with the emotional part of a gambler. If you do not know how to control it, you will end up losing one way or anotherIn my opinion this is a little different from when players should know to stop betting and take profits that can be taken, if bettors choose multi bets then stick to their choices as consistencyActually, what you feel is felt by almost all bettors that not doing cashout when they are already profitable and it turns out that the last match spoiled everything and give disappointing result.But it should return to the goal of multibet, which is to get a bigger win at the risk of not getting anything, then stick with the original goal it would be better but if you choose to do it and it works then that's fine but if it turns out you don't cashout and become a loss let it go.Or if bettors is good in calculation can do cashout if the rest of the game doesn't really affect the amount that will be earned rather than risking bigger it would be better to take it and Don't be disappointed if it turns out that the last match also won",
