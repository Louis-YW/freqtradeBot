I do have a personal opinion for both your points tough, it might not be the same as the admin's and i reserve the right to change my opinion if i hear good arguments coming up from other people .1. Don't think this is a good idear. If you lock a topic, it becomes completely static. What if somebody wants to clean up his posts because he (for example) doxxed him/herself? I know, the internet it permanent, and your post details stay in several caches forever, but at least if the topic isn't locked you have the option to edit the details that are in plain view. AFAIK, there are people advocating to lock topics as soon as they received sufficient replies, but it's more of a personal responsibility, not something the mod's have to do manually or the admin does automatically.2. depends on the thread... Most of the time, the answer would be: yes, if you find a topic that hasn't received a reply for 2 years and you have something new to add, it might be a good idear to open a new thread... But it does depend on how long ago the thread has been created, how long ago since the last post, the content of the thread and the comment you want to add. For example, if it's a topic from 2014 that asks a very specific question and received a couple dozen replies over then next 7 years but no real answer, and it is now dormant for 2 years AND you have the exact answer for the exact question that has been discussed for 7 years and is dormant for only 2, it might be ok to add the answer to the question for reference purposes. If you just want to tell the world you haven't found the answer either you might want to consider not necroposting...",

I mean, it certainly takes a significant amount of time and mental effort to analyze each post on a forum with hundreds of topics for each section.Plus, as far as I'm aware, necroposting varies from case to case basis. There are instances that some people have found their subject of interest through a Google search, or perhaps it's just that this particular subject is thought to be of high quality and continues to serve its purpose for a longer period of time. But still, the topic can be easily reported and locked if it is revived from a low value opinionated reply and that the parent topic is irrelevant in the present day.Personally, bumping an old thread or creating a new one isn't really a huge problem as long as the post is substantial, extremely relevant and well-written -- because hey, that is what we should do  e v e r y   t i m e.",

It therefore suggest that you can use your discretion knowing when you're bumping or spamming on a particular thread that has already been discussion. And things that anyone should consider to knowing if you're spamming or should bump on an already existing thread is; the duration of such thread; when last was it edited or a comment was made in the thread was it 2 or 3 years ago; or are the answers to the question of the thread now obsolete and you have current updates to it which could be so elaborate.",

[...]Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 07:59:04 PMRegarding necro posting, if the necro post is substantial (doesn't break the rule especially rule 1 and 2 (2014/07/21 version)), then it's OKPlease be aware that, if the necro post is not substantial, then it's not OK anymore (at least, this is what I understand from mprep's statement).So, basically, there is no rule against necro posting. However, if OP wishes to bring back to life an old thread, this can be done, in my opinion, by editing it (if he was the author + combined with a post like \"March 2023 Update: I found new evidence / new information etc.\") or adding new valuable information to what has been discussed, if he believes that it would be useless to start another thread on same matter, since one was already created. Take for example the topic Merry Christmas to the Forum, which is brought back to life each year on Christmas. Practically, by typing there after 365 days, those posts can be considered as necro posts. Yet there is no reason for starting a new similar thread each year.Quote from: alastantiger on February 28, 2023, 06:25:10 AM2.

Each case should be analyzed on an individual basis. If what you want to add is precisely on the subject of the topic, then you could add your post to the old thread.Basically these guidelines can be considered as common sense. If you feel that you are not on same page with the main subject, then start a new thread. But if you'll discuss precisely same ideas, you can use the old topic.",

If the person wants to find an answer and the old thread doesn't provide answers that suits the level of understanding the user needs, bumping the thread won't help as many members won't contribute on the bumped thread. So, the user can create a fresh thread and as well refer to the old thread then tailor out what answer they're actually looking at. Hence if its a news or update it's not necessary because they must be changes in such threads. So, you made the right point by adding that it has to be a personal decision.",
