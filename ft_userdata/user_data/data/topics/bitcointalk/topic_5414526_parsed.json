Bitmain doesn't have units with a price of $1500  or below, the current cheapest available units right now from Bitmain is s19 pro with a price of $1900. So you don't have any other option than buying units from Canaan as suggested above the available cheapest unit they have is 1126 pro with a price of $882.What do you mean you want two units? Do you mean that if you want 2 units with a maximum price of $1500 then you have around $3000 budget?If yes then you can have 3 units with that amount with their cheapest unit(1126pro) from Canaan.",

      "body": "See in the past, I would tell you to buy Avalons instead of Whatsminer or Antminer, but this no longer holds true, with the current generation of miner and as far as robustness goes it's Whatsminer > Bitmain and lastly Avalon, I follow failure rates provided by miners on various places and Avalons seem to have a very crappy PSU quality, It can be as bad as 50% failure rate in the first 4 months.If it's Avalon vs any Bitmain 17 series, then, of course, I'd go for Avalon, but the 19 series is a lot more robust. Then you also have Whatsminer, Avalon is the cheapest per terahash for the same efficiency class, and honestly, that is for a reason.But why cap yourself at 1500$, why not get the S19 pro for 1.9k from Bitmain, brand new, 100th, it will probably be a lot cheaper than any Avalon or Whatsminer out there, and you get a 30% discount coupon so the average cost for 3 miners will be around $1500 per miner, and then don't forget to add duty and tarrif fees which can be as high as 25% if you are in the U.S.",

I know cloud mining isn't great but never thought there was so much scam here...Cloud mining is not worth investing why? Because you don't actually own mining units instead you are investing in a Cloud mining site that you didn't know if they actually have a physical miner. Are you promoting one of the Cloud mining sites? I'm one of the victims of those scheme I wait for almost a month to withdraw them but in the end, you can't able to withdraw your mine BTC. Almost all Cloud mining sites are using the same scheme. It would be much better if you buy or own an ASIC unit because it is safe than investing in any Cloud mining sites.",

Why would you focus on that level?  To learn about mining and experiment?  You can do that cheaper.  Plus, you need to watch your j/Th (joules per Terahash) ratio so that this doesn't end up costing you money given energy prices.Efficiency is the name of the game over time.  If you plan on running them a while, remember, low efficiency is like buying a cheap truck and paying for that every time you have to fill up the tank.  That initial savings catches up with you quick over time.",

Canaan 1126 pro is a new hardware and easy for him to bought, more over he does have a budget to buy it.But I agree he wouldn't get any profit if his country has high electricity cost, I think nowadays it's hard to make profit by solo mining if you don't have many good ASIC miners.",

Or are you just explaining?Because I never heard that he mention s7 and it's too dumb if you buy an s7 that consumed 1300w with 4th/s s9 would be much better it can get 13th/s with the same power.Anyway, the 1126 pro price is now dropped to $768 it's always the best time to buy ASIC units in the Bearish market.And take note about solo mining most of the miners only do solo mining for lottery not for profit unless you own a pool or if you have a huge mining farm.",
