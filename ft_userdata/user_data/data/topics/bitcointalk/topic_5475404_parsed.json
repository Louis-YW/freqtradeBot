All you just need is time to hold it and not sell.From the money you are receiving weekly if you are working, investing like 30% on bitcoin is not bad. Yes, you can diversify. Quote from: Prosofina_G on November 24, 2023, 10:25:31 PMit is so obvious that majority of the world is totally dependable on Bitcoin.The adoption still continues. If majority of the world invest in bitcoin, its price by now would have been over $1 million and its marketcap would worth trillions of dollars if I am not underestimating it, but I think I am still underestimating the price and marketcap.",

      "body": "There are few things that can cause the price of Bitcoin to dump prior to the halving. We just escaped one of them which is the issue of CZ, the CEO of Binance; I was thinking it will lead to a major dump in price since Binance is a leading exchange. Fortunately, the market did not care about that and continued to rise after a minor reaction. Another thing that can lead to massive dump in price is the ETF application that is expected to be approved or rejected early next year. If the approval happens, then Bitcoin will rise rapidly. On the contrary, if the application is rejected, I expect the market to dump significantly. If the price of Bitcoin dumps, the smart way to respond is to continue to buy more reason being that the Bitcoin halving that is happening next year will create enough awareness that will make price recover so fast from any dump. This means the market will not remain down for long before it rises again.",

Majority of the world aren't depending on Bitcoin, Bitcoin never get any better share of the economy of the world self so we still dey far from dominating or making people to depend on Bitcoin.

The cryptocurrencies that would have been affected to dump significantly had binance fallen would have been cryptocurrencies that are tied to the binance. Mind you, binance isn't the only existing CEX, another would have taken advantage and cover the leading position even much better.

But am not worried about the bitcoin spot ETF not being approved cause definitely all indications has shown that it will be approved. What I am worried about is what if the whole ETF stuff is just a hype, it get approved at the end of the waiting and bitcoin price didn't do well as people had expected that the ETF approval would make it do.
