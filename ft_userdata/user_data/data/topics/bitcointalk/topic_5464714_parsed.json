Consider this a speculation, Thanks.This is impossible!!!After all, we are all speculating and I was even happy to see some speculations here but only to read that you used Fibonacci retracement to get your predictions. How possible is that? This is certainly not possible, maybe you wanted to write another strategy. As the name implies, Fibonacci \"retracement\" is a retracement tool that helps traders to know retracement, trend continuation or reversal. But all these must be within a price limit that has happened before, it can never predict outside of its range that long.How come you get the values that those coins have never hit before by using Fibonacci retracement?The tool is not even good for such predictions because it only tells where support and resistance could possibly happen, not to say the fact that it must be within the prices that have initially been witnessed by the coins. Not even the Fibonacci sequence/extension/expansion is capable of this.This can never be possible!",

I do not know how you truly get your speculation, but it is interesting for me because I am also predicting that bitcoin will get to $170000 and doge to increase to or slightly increase above $1.I will advice people to go for bitcoin the most. The coming halving and the bitcoin spot ETF will help the crypto market which can make these possible.",

I also believe that Bitcoin will of course be a on top during the bull run because it will definitely trade over $100k and there is a possibility that Bitcoin may reach or cross $150k in the next bull run, but it will surely cross the $120k price mark in the next bull run. I don't know about the way other coins will react to the next bull run but definitely your prediction related to most of the coins seems genuine to me.Quote from: mk4 on August 27, 2023, 10:01:55 AMCoins on that list that I wouldn't suggest anyone to use long-term TA on simply because the coins are total crap: XRP, ADA, LTC.The other coins I didn't mention aren't necessarily good per se, but at least they have narratives that could push them back up in the next bull run.I won't say anything about ADA or XRP, but LTC is a hidden gem and it may get to very higher values in future. XRP is not going to cross $2 mark any soon and even in next bull run its chances are very low as compare to other coins in the list and same is the case for the ADA because that one is totally a crap and I don't think it will ever gain much value even in the next bull run. But, LTC will surely gain good value in next bull run and I even think that it could surpass $361 if it gets the attention of the investors.",

But why ada and litecoin?Litecoin is pretty much a Bitcoin testnet. Yes, fees are cheaper, but if we're going to make decisions of fees then there are dozens of other cryptocurrencies to use. Not saying I'd 100% count out LTC, but the narrative is weak and that there are far better bets out there.As for ADA, Cardano \"the chain\" has been up and running since forever and yet even chains that are only built last year have lots more protocols/platforms running on them compared to Cardano. They're either just super slow and will blossom very late(which is totally fine if you're super patient), or it's pretty much finished. One thing's for sure, I ain't betting on it.",

If you combine the factors of the world economy and the market cycle, you can see that the bullish season will most likely coincide with the time when the world economy enters a recovery and growth cycle. That will drive investment demand to the highest levels we've ever seen, so the market will be hyped up like crazy. I even believe bitcoin will hit over $200k and not just $173k as OP predicted.",

In my prediction, I was thinking the most BTC could touch is 110,000 dollars, but you are saying it has the potential to touch more than $170,000. Now, this is something really amazing if it happens, but honestly, I think to touch that target, BTC needs a lot of trading volume and buying potential. To touch that digit, the potential of buying must be twice or three times than the previous times when it was on the day when BTC touched $69k.I am not a trader of any alts but still think ETH is a good investment at the time as it is also approving many ETFs, and now PayPal is promoting things in ETH just like their own dollars based on the ETH blockchain. And many other platforms and political parties like ETH for centralization purposes, but still, one could make profit in BTC and make profit in ETH, so why risk the factor of decentralization over centralization by investing in ETH?

I know its a speculation well for these two I think we can give a loose hand but SOL how ? When ? I really don't think that SOL had enough potential to raise up to 1k..Moving on to ADA I was expecting that for Matic that can be sure and even more, LTC fascinating LTC vs SOL I think LTC has enough potential to cross over $700.
