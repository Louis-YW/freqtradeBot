  "content": "Just now, another BTC ETF ticker got listed on the DTCC website. This ticker belongs to \"INVESCO GALAXY BITCOIN ETF COM SHS B\" Well according to the news, it might have been listed a few days back and we (the crypto community) came to know about it in the previous 1 or 2 days. And if you visit the source then you will find that Invesco applied for the ETF (21 June) just after 6 days of applying for ETF by Blockrock (15 June). sourceOverall I think it is bullish news even though there is not that much hype about this listing of ETF as news outlets said it might be listed for a few days but it is confirmed by them that it was not listed on the website till 25 October.Well, let's see how this news turns up to be beneficial for the market but I don't think it will have any good impact because most people know the name of astronaut who stepped first on the moon and they don't know about the second or third astronaut.  https://www.binance.com/en-ZA/feed/post/1588263",

Get ready for some crazy movements and price changes. With more such ETFs coming in I am sure some people will get scammed by fake and shady ones but that is all part of the craze.It will be interesting to see how the things settle once the intro-hype ends.",

(many novice investors thought its just for computer nerds)adding more institutions to the list of possible lineup of an accepted application makes the chance of ANY ETF happening more promisingso there is more confidence of an(y) ETF happening no matter who manages it",

I believe that ETF approvals are already discounted in many cases by the market, and what will happen with the news of the effective approval is that many large investors will fleece retail investors who will buy for FOMO and sell in the fall.",

ETFs keep trying and sooner or later one is going to get approved and sell like mad, which in *theory* will drive up the price of BTC.Which ones will matter and which ones won't is probably a more interesting discussion. Everyone knows the BlackRock name, but does anyone care?Or will it be a smaller ETF from some smaller place that people feel more comfortable with?-Dave",

News and analysis on this matter, especially since most of us do not have much information about SEC decisions and how we can influence them.You have a valid point, but I don't think it would be wise to ignore such news because this is the time to analyze the market and make use of it. I don't know how true this is, but many investors are considering it an accumulation month. If that is true, then we might see some ups and downs, and all of those ups and downs will be to manipulate the market to fill up bags with some extra satoshies (buying low).Overall, you said what DTCC already stated: that listing a ticker on the list does not mean that it will be approved. And to be honest, I am also very frustrated by listening to the word \"ETF.\" I mean, we should start to call it something else, maybe a funny name.

So the question again arises, is this for real or sign that we will eventually get the ETF or just another manipulation and test from some entities behind to see the reaction of the investors again?For us though as we have seen the effects, are we going to be riding on the hype again?So let's wait for a couple of days an see where this things are going to be. If it is for real or not, it seems that it did have another significant effect and maybe this time we will see the price climbing as high as $36-$38k.",

We already see the good effect of it to the price of Bitcoin and it is making me more optimistic that there's more to this and all we have to do is wait maybe before the halving and let it go if it comes after it.",

The thing is, people have picked up this update and the price suddenly went bullish. We are yet to see one ETF being accepted in the open by the SEC, so at of this point there's nothing but empty promises for this to come into fruition.",

In long term, we don't have to mind about those tickers because Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the USA. is a matter of time. SEC will have to approve Bitcoin Spot ETF applications in the USA because it is not logic to approve Bitcoin Futures ETFs but don't do the same for Bitcoin Spot ETFs.We know a fact that Futures is more risky than Spot, we all know about that, SEC know about that. They only try to delay their approval for a first Bitcoin Spot ETF maybe because of Gensler or Gensler is only a person who is in charge of executing the task from a higher position person.",

It could still be a big deal for others who are just waiting for any news that will trigger the price going up again.Nevertheless we all know that this is not the final and just like the first one, anytime they can removed this ticket and then simply apologized to the investors for the supposedly \"Honest mistake\". I don't think that it's enough to trigger the market to reach $38k.",

That said, I agree on the general reading, if we don't have any real life events that negatively affect the price, it looks like the next few months are going to be bullish, although a repeat of the regularity of past cycles would push the price up to $50K or $50-something at best before halving.",
