Out of 591 posts, even 587 are in Bounties (Altcoins) and I wondered how he managed to get even 8 merits at all, and that brings us to this post for which he got even 5 merits - and more than obviously a classic merit abuse.Given that @Groomerboll is tagged as an account/merits seller, the OP undoubtedly bought those 5 merits. I think that the OP opened this thread to try to get some merits, because this post talks about the fact that he needs 2 more merits for the next rank.",

It just doesn't make any sense to me. This forum allows your to ignore the signature and avatar, but I don't think the companies you're promoting want that from you. So showing signature and avatar is what they expect from you and every other user even if you find it bothered. I won't do it, it's done out of respect for the company I'm promoting as I would still love to see their avatar and signature used in many sections of the forum. If I'm only bothered by the avatar and signature of certain users [spammers & scammers in particular], then I just think their deserves on my ignore list.",
