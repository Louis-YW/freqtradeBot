Also antivirus soft are mainly developed for desktop.FYI, either its IOS or android its not going to be affected by viruses but malwares and phishing attacks are the major cause for losing money while using smartphones and the reason is simple people use their smartphones more than their desktop so they are unaware of what they are clicking or installing which cause them loss.Using desktop version isn't safe either and virus can affect the desktop easily even with best anti virus installed so don't take it for granted and make sure you're installing the wallet from original source and increase your knowledge about how to avoid attacks of hackers.",

Even its mobile or desktop as long as there are no closed source or centralized aspect its safe. There are many wallets proclaiming to be decentralized but of course we must not be deceived by those. Regarding malicious files. Im not sure if desktop are more safer than mobile though a lot of viruses have been found on desktop versions.",

About mobile wallets, it can be safe if you are very careful using your mobile device but compared to desktop in terms of security then desktop is better than mobile phones. Anyway, all of it is true but it doesn't mean that you can't use mobile wallet or you shouldn't use mobile wallet jist because desktop is better. Honestly, I am very careful using my mobile phone which I have a crypto wallet which is Trustwallet and I am using it since 2018 until now (That makes it 5 years already). It's all up to you on what you decide to do. Just sharing my experience using mobile wallet.",

And when someone gets infected, it's because of their carelessness. Whether you use a mobile wallet which you think is safer than a desktop, you shouldn't be confident with that and vice versa.

I think that's what op wanted yo express here and at first I was confused about it because the thread title starts with why and I know that it is a WH question but when you read the OP, it is all about \"stop using crypto wallet apps in mobile phone and better use desktop wallet. Maybe OP didn't know someone who use a mobile app for storing crypto and I guess I am one of the people who use mobile apps for storing crypto such as Trustwallet for example and have been using for years withdraw getting hacked or losing any crypto at all (I also installed Electrum mobile version).",

Unless you use a airgapped PC as your desktop or sort of hardware wallet.

I think every computer do always came up with an anti-virus but even if we noticed that they aren't installed, we will download one immediately because computers are more vulnerable to attacks than in mobile.

Mobile wallets, on the other hand, may store your private keys on the device, which can make them vulnerable to hacking.Backup and Recovery: Desktop wallets usually have an option to backup your wallet, which allows you to recover your funds in case of a device failure or loss. Mobile wallets may not have this feature.Customizability: Desktop wallets offer more options for customizing the settings and configurations to suit your needs, whereas mobile wallets are often more limited in this regard.Performance: Desktop wallets can handle more transactions and have a better performance than mobile wallets which can be slow and limited.That being said, it is important to use a reputable and well-reviewed wallet, whether it is mobile or desktop, and to always keep your private keys safe and make sure you have a backup of your wallet.",

For saving and long-term holding is better to use desktop wallets, and even better to buy... I have Trezor T, just my choice. But if you are active in the crypto community, if you like to trade or gamble, and participate in all crypto things around you will need a wallet that will be used for all those daily stuff.
