      "body": "Actually, you can trade PI Coin with other people who are interested in buying it, but first your account must be verified (KYC) so you can send and receive the coin. I think you will get a notification e-mail from Picoin if your account is eligible for the KYC or if you must be a pioneer to access the KYC. If you're looking for a legit buyer, it's better to mine and wait for the official release of the mainnet.Â I would like to know for those people who mine Picoin when the official release of the mainnet?",

Since I think from that way you can earn some by mining those coin. But also try to do some research about this coin since this is long time mined by people but they never exchange it yet on any real crypto exchange. If you plan to buy some of it to hold then do your own diligence to find reliable information so that you will not caught by wrong expectation for acquiring this.",

I was curious and I tried to dig up information about coin pi. After I learned, it turns out that coin pi was raised by their community makes news in hopes of boosting the pi coin price during the mainnet later but the creator of the pi coin nikolas doesn't brag about the pi price they are more focused on the development of pi and nikolas doesn't announce the price of the pi coin.",

The pi is probably best to join with people who really like that kind of thing to be traded or really want to make it your money because it's not really something that will be profitable if it's not with people who are interested with that.To be honest, if you are an old person, of course I will speak a little more harshly, but looking at your account, even if you are a beginner, I don't know if you have been around for a long time or have not been involved in something like this, but I will assume you are new, so I will try to be more subtle.Until now, Pi has never been something to be proud of because while I was here and there was discussion about Pi before, the promise remained the same but there would be no changes in any way and for me personally Pi is unacceptable and maybe this will also be the choice of most who are in this forum but that doesn't mean it isn't valuable. it's valuable to you and the Pi community out there.",

There are better ones where you don't need to disclose your private details. We have no idea what they are doing with your KYC details. Much better to look for other worthwhile projects out there.Ask yourself, what are the known utilities of Pi today? About their promise of providing such utilities to its holders.",

If you have successfully done KYC for those who haven't done KYC, the tokens won't be distributed to wallets, so maybe PI is also doing this one miner can't do multiple accounts so to anticipate this project PI requires miners to KYC.",
