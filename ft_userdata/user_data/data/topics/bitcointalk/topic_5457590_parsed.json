  "content": "Millions of people are being forced deeper into poverty as the ultra-rich increase their wealth. People in the US and around the world struggle to pay the high costs of food, gas, and other necessities, yet over the past two years, the richest 1% have secured nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined. How is this possible?Most people believe billionaires are there to help the economy, this is a total NO in most cases. Their very billions are earned because of cheap labor, and cheap labor is available because of poverty. More poverty creates more billionaires. They are rich because they utilze the opportunities coming from developing and poor nations.In short, billionaires are bad for the economy. How bad? Check out these top four ways:1. Extreme wealth and poverty are rising simultaneously for the first time in decadesNow more than ever, workers are struggling to pay their bills, buy their groceries, and support their families because inflation is skyrocketing across the world. Corporations are raising the prices on goods, not because they have to, but because it increases the payouts for their shareholders. This lines the pockets of the ultra-wealthy while forcing more people into poverty.Last year, 95 food and energy corporations doubled their company profits. Instead of investing that money in their employees, they paid $257 billion to their already rich shareholders. In the backdrop of this outrageous corporate greed, 1.7 billion workers live in countries where inflation now outpaces wages.2. American billionaires are 33% richer than they were at the start of the pandemicIn 2020, the US experienced the worst economic growth since World War II. Much of the country felt this burden, especially marginalized groups, but the top 1% did not struggle. Instead, they became significantly richer.This is possible because, for decades, the system has been rigged in favor of the rich. Labor laws, CEO compensation, the privatization of public assets, and much more are skewed toward making the rich richer. This leaves little protection and support for the average person, putting them in a vulnerable position.3. Billionaires are contributing a million times more carbon to the atmosphere than the average personPeople across the globe are facing dangerous climate change events, such as severe hurricanes, flash floods, and wildfires because billionaires are making climate change rapidly worse. In fact, 125 of the worldâ€™s richest billionaires invest so much money in polluting industries that they are responsible for emitting an average of 3 million carbon tons a year. The more they invest in fossil fuels, the more they protect the use of them, no matter how much the rest of the world suffers in response.4. The super-rich are taxed at a dangerously low rateBillionaires paid a low tax rate of 3% while most people with less money, like nurses and teachers, paid far more. If multi-millionaires paid a 2-3% wealth tax rate and billionaires paid a 5% wealth tax rate globally, it would raise $1.7 trillion a year. This money could be used for underfunded social programs, environmental policies, and economic programs. This would reduce the stress of necessities like the cost of childcare and healthcare.With this tax rate, 2 billion people could be lifted out of poverty. We need to reduce inequality to end poverty and injustice. Increasing taxation up to 5% for the richest people in the world would be a strong step toward equalityReference: https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/top-5-ways-billionaires-are-bad-for-the-economy/ CONCLUSIONEveryone want to become a billionaire and it's a good thing to become one but what will be your impart to your community, nation or the world if you become a billionaire today. People like Warren Buffett, Chuck Feeney, Oprah Winfrey and many more can not be forgotten for their impart on the society. Only few billionaires are ready to help.

      "body": "I think someone has been sleeping here for the last 200 years, because most of the postulates come from another world, the world before the industrial revolution and the then prevailing idea of â€‹â€‹\"toxic wealth\", which can only grow as a result of lowering the standard of living of others (in times when the only force producing goods was the power of human hands). Currently, in the era of capitalism, after the industrial revolution and at the beginning of the AI â€‹â€‹revolution it is recognized that the cake is constantly growing, and therefore the fact that someone has a larger piece does not affect that someone has a smaller piece. If someone is a billionaire, it does not mean that they exploited people, nor does it mean that they will eat a billion loaves of bread a day so that others have nothing to eat.everyone is the blacksmith of his fate, everyone can set up his own business. If he doesn't and prefers to \"get exploited by billionaires\", that's his choice. Millions of people dream of being \"exploited\" by Google on Mountain View. The times of pharaohs, kings and goods derived solely from human hands are over.Forgive me for my harshness in my post, but it annoys me when someone rationalizes their poverty with the wealth of others, because it's easier that way. It's easier to cry because someone has a lot than to try to get something yourself. it's easier to cry for higher taxes for the rich than to start your own business and risk your life savings and your family's savings to start it up.",

How many services can be paid by that contribution and how many government salaries can be paid by that.Â  They also create a lot of jobs in the private sector and those people also pay taxes and that money is also being used to fund projects in the public sector.",

Yes. As a result, many investors came in, at least they opened a branch of their company there, on the other hand it was also able to create new jobs, increase economic growth and be seen as globally competitive.Quote from: odunybiz on June 26, 2023, 03:06:43 AMWith this tax rate, 2 billion people could be lifted out of poverty.

There are many things that can be pursued and indeed these (taxes) seem irrelevant and question marks arise and if there is a policy change that leads as you stated, it will have an impact towards a more equal future. meaning that with the additional funds, the government has additional budget slots that can be directed to social programs, environmental policies, and economic initiatives and so on.Quote from: odunybiz on June 26, 2023, 03:06:43 AM CONCLUSIONEveryone want to become a billionaire and it's a good thing to become one but what will be your impart to your community, nation or the world if you become a billionaire today.

To solve the issue posted on the economy by the billionaires, the followings can be doneIt's interesting to read the conclusions you convey, whether you, I or someone else may have aspirations to also become billionaires. and one thing that is also common is when you get to that point, don't forget the land. Indeed, getting great wealth also has the opportunity to make significant positive changes, meaning that billionaires don't only focus on increasing the coffers of their wealth because there are still many weak hands who need strong hands to care for society and the world around you. .",

Many entrepreneurs are taking risks, working hard, and investing in diverse ventures, while others are relaxing and avoiding risk. It will not be right to make policies that will discourage or exploit them. Some of these billionaires started small and grew their businesses to become multinational. People should be given the freedom to identify business opportunities, grow them and benefit from their input. QuoteðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Wide-ranging increases in taxation of the super-rich, and we call on world governments to tax multi-millionaires and billionairesIf you were a billionaire will you support a tax increase? The answer will be no. It is easy to point at these billionaires as the problem,meanwhile, some of them are the solution to our problem. They establish businesses that the government will never engage in. Taxation policies should be fair both for the rich and poor. The government will not tax them so much because they may decide to leave a country and move to another friendly nation. QuoteðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Creation of total education, full employment and health care facilities for the masses.Private companies engage in social corporate responsibility programs. They assist the government in providing basic amenities or services to the population. But the responsibility of providing education, employment, and health care lies on the government. It is the government that should be held responsible if they fail to provide these essential services. I am against these billionaires that engage in sharp practices to exploit the masses. Some of them partner with corrupt government officials to defraud the masses through shady deals and monopolies. This wickedness should be discouraged. But if these billionaires engage in legal businesses that help to create jobs and provide services, they should be allowed to operate in peace because they are the solution and not the problem.",

Having one life changing technology that everybody wants can make a person rich overnight. Companies being traded publicly will see their value change a lot and most wealth of the billionaires is not cash but rather companies they own. It's hard to really tax these individuals because of their global presence, most of the companies operate internationally and will just move their headquarters to another country with a more friendly tax system. Same goes for the billionaires themselves, they can just give back their passport and immigrate to another country. There is a lot of competition of small countries to offer tax haven for billionaires because they attract more business and other form of income for the small country.",

The super-rich are taxed at a dangerously low rateThis sentence is completely bullshit, income tax is progressive tax where people get taxed based on the income they earn. If they earn lower than minimum, they don't need to pay any tax. If they earn minimum salary, they only get small taxed. If they earn a lot money, they need to pay a lot tax too!But the problem is those billionaires can evade or avoid pay tax by manipulation.You sounds like rich people is an evil while poor people is good people, the reason why they're poor is they're not want to try hard like the rich people.",

They keep printing money while they didnâ€™t give much value on the services provided by the workers. This is the reason why Billionaires keeping up on earning while normal worker is struggling because their services value doesnâ€™t increase.",
