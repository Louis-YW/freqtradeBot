The biggest focus will be new crypto enthusiasts.Nice looking website but I think you are missing a bunch of hardware wallets there (Passport, OneKey, Satoship, Cypherock X1, etc) so you need to research more and add them all.Maybe you can also add dimension for all devices, and some kind of comparison for two or more different wallets.Good starting point can be my list of Open Source hardware wallets, but there are other closed source devices out there that I don't recommend:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0",

At first, I thought it was about mining hardware.OP, can you remove the newsletter subscription popup, it's irritating.Also, the H1 font is desperate, it is tiring to read, a site that prefers to be informative, must be comfortable to read.Apart from the transmitted information from each manufacturer, I have not seen a single wallet where any criticism or opinion has been expressed. Real user feedback is missing.",

Some responses:- New content and hardware wallets and accessories will be added- Comparison table is on my to do list- Newsletter pop-up, I will consider removing it. Have to way the pro’s and con’s- I changed the H1 font somewhat, so it should be easier to read- Didn’t know about thebitcoinhole.com, will have a closer look. First impression is it is very nice, but maybe a bit more for the advanced crypto user (?)- There already is a privacy policy page- Will be adding more search filters and features in the futureThanks guys!",

A lot of security / adblock things will stop them.My pi-hole stopped me from going to a couple of places on your site because of that.-Dave",

OP, I think you have bad hosting, because as others have noted, your website is very slow to load. You can also try to optimize some things to speed it up and consider using a caching plugin. Check the results with some benchmark test, like https://gtmetrix.com/ or https://pagespeed.web.dev/.Regarding the content of the site, the first thing I would personally remove is the newsletter pop-up. Newsletters are old school, and almost no one uses them anymore. Instead, use social media to inform your followers about new updates on your site. You can leave the newsletter sign-up somewhere in the footer of the website.All in all, nice job! Just keep improving and adding content.",

Maybe adding a pop-up explanation would be better when the user hovers over it, or just delete and improve the filter altogether. As of now, it seems like it refers to the same thing.",

Haha, I was going to tag my fellow that, Theme is clean but it's rough looking a very nonprofessional one, don't take it as I'm being offensive they can keep the UI clean still if they focus on the eye-catching color scheme and also this Font type ohh it sucks bro please make it normal or something else because it's affecting the overall readability. There are my review comments rest is ALL-OKK. A good initiative I would recommend is to choose a color scheme like 3 main color plates Orange, Black, and White. Even Blue, Black, and White will also be a decent choice but the Primary color should not be Black or White.Also, buddy not sure what night mode what as I haven't checked by switching the mode because currently, I'm not writing a detailed review haha just giving quick thoughts on the Price section of the product or in professional terms the cards of the product are not effective there you need to use card elevation make them more prominent and the text color is same as background it's not at all visible. Hmm putting a Screenshot.A few Changes are needed in the design and it will be great, Rest the idea is great also buddy I'm not sure if you've added most of the Hardware wallets or not or if you are still working on the Filters because there's nothing in the filters.",

Well i think it's not a big deal as they just launched this Website couple of days so i mean its just beginning so everything needs time to groom. Things changes time to time so they will add more feature or colour scheme according to their desire or their consumer demands maybe. well i would like to appreciate crypto-hardware.com they did good work even it was just beginning. i also agree with Faisal2202 as he said everyone has there own POVs.... so i prefer to say both of your opinion are respectable.
