Sometimes I think we need to migrate to a crypto friendly country.That's because every country has different jurisdictions towards crypto, if your country isn't yet embracing crypto yet, it might one day they will realize how useful it is. Â It could be one reason is political stability and the level of public trust in government institutions can possibly the reason for cryptocurrency regulation.You're lucky if your country accepts crypto as a legal tender the same in my country, so I think migration isn't a solution here. Â You can still own your Bitcoin since its decentralized nature. Â Though the process of trading might be difficult because you're using DEX's but it's fine if you know how to manage it.

What i am saying is this, relocating from your country because you want to move to one in which you can spend BTC nearly everywhere makes sense, but because of one or two physical stores or BTC ATM's is not enough reason to relocate, except if BTC is totally banned in your country.",

Bitcoin adoption is seen in most European countries so it is not unusual to see something like this in Turkey. In countries where Bitcoin is used as a legal currency, such a physical Bitcoin exchange may occur at any time. Bitcoin can be traded online very easily and since Bitcoin is a digital currency and Bitcoin can be used completely anonymously, such a physical Bitcoin exchange is not very important for us.Â  But this news would be very happy for us if new big companies accept Bitcoin as payment or legalize Bitcoin in countries where Bitcoin is still illegal.
