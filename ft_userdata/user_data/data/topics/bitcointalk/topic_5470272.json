  "content": "Will Robert F. Kennedy Jr get much voters from the bitcoin community? Are there enough voters from the bitcoin community that would make a difference and help him win? The cryptospace is only a small community. The skeptical me thinks that his support for bitcoin might be real and sincere because he cannot gain anything from being very outspoken in his support.Also, he has been telling everyone that he wants the issuance of treasury bills to be backed by gold, bitcoin and other assets. This would certainly make the dollar backed by bitcoin and the other assets indirectly.I reckon if he delivers his promises, this might be good for bitcoin and the whole cryptospace because the regulators under his administration might not act similar to uncle Gary.U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) discussed a variety of topics, including bitcoin, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, published Wednesday. RFK Jr. is a son of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy.The presidential candidate pledged that if elected as the President of the United States:I’m going to make sure that bitcoin is protected, that people can keep their own wallets, that the current White House war on bitcoin will be over, that transactions will be protected and encouraged.What I would like to do is to provide at least some issuance of Treasury bills that are backed by hard currency, and that could be a bucket that includes bitcoin, that includes platinum, gold, silver, and other hard assets.Read in full https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-promises-to-end-white-house-war-on-bitcoin-says-we-need-freedom-currency-that-government-cant-control/",

Meaning, he will be taking a big political risk thinking that pacifying the Bitcoin community could earn him the presidency. So, I would say his love for Bitcoin is genuine. Whether he will win or not, is way off my limits to know as I do not see him as a serious contender to Trumph and Biden.",

Refreshing because he is carrying the voice of the cryptocurrency industry so he is our candidate then. For me, Biden is definitely so old and is already senile judging on the way he is speaking and the many times he fell - in fact he is now known to be a vacationer rather than a very active global leader and it is because aging is really taking its toll on him. In between the two, Trump is way better in terms of health. Now, the question is: Will Kennedy really win against the two famous opponents? Only time can tell.",

Hahaha, I like this response, I am not living in America but yes Kennedy Jr will also have my vote if I can vote on anyone of them, I just don't know if he has the real power to get to that position because in my country the corruption is so much that if they don't want someone who is fit to become a leader to get to the sit they will make it happen, I hope this isn't the situation with the U.S elections? Or election rigging is also available over there? Lord have mercy.I am not ready to put my trust in any politicians because most of them are liars and manipulators, I have some relations with two who are family friends and even in family, they used and dump their own people who never asked them for anything, but they promised heaven and earth for them when they get to power only to be abandoned later. They now pretend as if they don't know the family again but one got out of power a year ago and he isn't looking too well, don't know how he turned out to be like that, I believe he can't make a come back anymore because he destroyed the trust of his own people, so I will say do not trust the words coming out from any politicians mouth.",

How are you going to support a national currency (any) with something as extremely volatile as Bitcoin? Although it is not the same, but let's remember how the experiment of that South Korean scammer ended - he backed his \"stablecoin\" with Bitcoin and everything went to hell.In addition, RFK Jr. continues his campaign as an independent candidate, and although all kinds of miracles happen in the US when it comes to politics - I think that his already small chances have decreased even more.",

This would certainly make the dollar backed by bitcoin and the other assets indirectly.Simply impossible to do. Because:1. He has to first tank the dollar price where the exchange rate would be something like 1 Venezuelan bolívar is equal to 1 US dollar thanks to the massive amounts of dollar they've printed over the past 20 years alone, not to include the circulating supply before that.2. The US economic structure has to change. They can no longer print money whenever they want to. Like the $10 trillion they printed for the War in Iraq and Afghanistan. The trillions they printed in COVIC pandemic and the $3 trillion they printed in the past couple of months alone to battle the US recession and fund the proxy war with Russia!This dude is speaking in a way that one would think that he has not spent a single day in US political scene!By the end of this month most probably another \"war\" will begin between the US government and the US parliament over the second raising of the US debt ceiling. Where does he plan on bringing all this money if my some magic he won the election? It's not like the US regime's foreign adventures are going to stop to reduce its ridiculously ginormous expenses. He would have to print money out of thin air like his predecessors.There's a reason US regime killed the Bretton Woods system. The system is broken and it is impossible to fix it without a literal revolution in North America and possibly a civil war.",

But the thing is that he's coming too late, and this bitcoin accepting and promoting strategy alone can't take him to the top; he has a very strong opponent, and beside that, even some bitcoin lovers might like him for that, but still might not be able to cast their vote for him.

So let's not hope too much on what happens to Bitcoin after the elections. Second, everybody knows that the president is not all powerful. He doesn't have the absolute say in everything.
