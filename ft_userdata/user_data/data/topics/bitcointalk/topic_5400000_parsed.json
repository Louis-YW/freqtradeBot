Is because China harmonize their selves together to make sure they have gone out from economical reception. Before china was one among the country that do not have a good economy, and since they calm down to study were their problem is coming from, and they have no excuse to put everything together to work as a team to rise the country. Some of the countries of that is battling into economical problem. I think is from the architect of the managerial of the country",

I clicked on the title, preparing to disagree with the OP, but then saw that the argument was not that China would fall back into poverty, cease to be a superpower, etc... merely that its phenomenal level of growth would not continue. Which we'd probably all agree with. Thread title probably needs a tweak, though, to avoid confusion.",

It's been apparent for some years now that the era of double-digit Chinese growth has ended. The huge spike in early 2021 emphasises your point regarding bitcoin - it's far easier to grow from a low base, the massive early 2021 growth occurs only because the growth is year-on-year, so it's relative to the downturn at the start of the pandemic.As there is some confusion in this thread, I should stress that the chart below is measuring the rate of change of GDP, not absolute GDP numbers. So with this in mind, any value above 0 is still growth, and China is still growing at a significant rate, just not as much as previously.https://www.statista.com/chart/17747/china-quarterly-gdp-growth/And as an aside, this also suggests that if we are trying to assess the long-term growth of something that has exploded exponentially, such as bitcoin, it makes more sense to do so on a logarithmic rather than a linear scale.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/",
