  "content": "According to the statistics of NBS 2020 unemployment rate in Nigeria was 33.33% which is also currently in World statistics record. But currently the unemployment rate in Nigeria is down to 4.1% which does not seem convincing. According to AJUJA, Nigeria (AP) 24 August report, Nigeria's unemployment rate is reported as 4.1%, although in this case they admit the new mythology and explain that the calculation of the unemployment rate is still undercount.Do you accept the current published unemployment rate report as true? Â Do you think it will be a miracle for Nigeria if this happens?News:DetailsI ain't Nigerian, but I wonder how Nigerian Unemployment rate 33.33% to 4.1% possible!!! ...may be it statistical analysis mistakes.I locked the topic forever.",

      "body": "Speaking from my personal perspective, I don't rely on statistics, records, or numbers to assess various factors in Nigeria. I gauge the conditions such as poverty rate and unemployment rate based on tangible indicators. I strongly believe that if there is any progress or growth in different sectors of the country, it will undoubtedly be felt by the majority of the population. Even without specific statistical data, I am confident in stating that Nigeria experiences a significantly high rate of unemployment.",
