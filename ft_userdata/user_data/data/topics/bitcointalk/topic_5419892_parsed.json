If you alter how the table balances (such as putting something small and unnoticeable under two of the legs) then you'll probably find there is a greater chance the ball ends up on one side of the wheel than the other (or clusters around certain specific numbers) - there could even be a way to do this with two opposite legs out of alignment (on the diagonal) so a host or someone off camera can change the lean of the table every so few spins without being noticed.There's also a possibility grooves could be added to parts of the wheel where the ball spins so its course changes as it roles (if you think of the bounce of a ball that hits a corner then it's a lot more predictable). There's probably a lot of people on both sides of a casino trying to look for these sorts of things though because it can hurt the house's edge if the wheel is a bit more predictable.These both don't guarantee a specific number is hit though so it'll still make the outcome seem random (if not done in a way that's noticeable - someone stretching across the table to do more than pick up the ball would likely be perceived as weird at best).",

But the fact is that casinos, be it online or physical casinos do not have to manipulate the roulette table before they make huge amount of money. I will say Fishy001 is only getting it not right and the day might not be a lucky day for him and he lost. Is there any good reason the table should be manipulated? To me, no good reason because any number can be taken by the gamblers.But we should know that casinos do have house edge advantage which makes more games to favour them than the gamblers.",

If this really happens on land based casino or even with online platforms, that would be unfair. I'm not into slots and roulettes, but because of these tendencies, I'm not into 'pure luck' gambling games. In sportsbetting, there is also a tendency for result manipulation depending on the fighters or teams. Money rules and money talks, right? Since we cannot easily determined if the house is manipulating the game, be observant. As other players suggest, if you often lose, try playing on other platform to somehow calibrate your losses.Quote from: piebeyb on November 08, 2022, 05:18:22 AMQuote from: Fishy001 on November 08, 2022, 04:18:14 AMQuote from: Don Pedro Dinero on November 08, 2022, 04:14:58 AMQuote from: Fishy001 on November 08, 2022, 03:57:57 AMThis why i lose 2 days in a row thiefs.

People will later likely know and this can damage the reputation of the gambling site. But why rigging anything when they set a hedge that makes them have better chance to win. Even in sport that bettors have more chance to win, gambling sites set odds in a way more gamblers will lose and they will gain, it is like that in casinos too, while even that the chance to lose more are in casinos compared to sport betting. So no good reason for casinos to manipulate anything because they will always grow and become more established.",

This happen always especially when you became greedy and want to earn more money since you are not contended on what you are receiving at that time.Maybe next time best solution to gain from roullete is to quit immediately and comeback tommorrow or the other day since if you came back in an hour or the same day you might lose all your money.",
