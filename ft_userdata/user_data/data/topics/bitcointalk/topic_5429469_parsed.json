If you've got $5 worth of bitcoin then that's already enough for you to swap there and have the TRX on your wallet.It's easy! as long as your transaction sent there gets 1 confirmation, they'll start to exchange it and have the trx sent to you asap.",

This is totally different from how Bitcoin works.",

This is totally different from how Bitcoin works.I might be wrong on this one as I'm speaking from a few years of when I've used a wallet and it didn't require me before or it's just because I have sent trx on it without knowing that requirement and then used to send it eventually because it already has got a balance. So upon doing a quick search a while ago, a wallet like Ledger requires 0.1 trx to activate the tron account and before receiving any trc20 tokens so it means, that it isn't that much but it seems I'm wrong telling that it won't require any balance, sorry about that. While for other wallets, it's said that you just have to send at least 1 or more trx for you to use a wallet.",
