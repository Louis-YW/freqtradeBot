      "body": "It's a pretty good protection actually but people should be aware of the false sense of security. Because you're more likely to lose it somewhere or to get robbed than to undergo an earthquake or a flood in most places of Earth. In addition if this kind of disaster happens to you or if you get a fire of your home, you have very little chance of finding the plate among the debris. So IMO it's better to keep several backups in different locations. And to use a BIP39 passphrase ofc or to encrypt your seed in a way or another to avoid a theft from anyone finding your backup.",

      "body": "There are already very good tutorials and videos about how to protect one's seed phrase using steel instead of paper. In my opinion, it is not one hundred percent necessary to go with titanium, not only because it is relatively expensive when compared to steel but there are also very good grades of stainless steel which are used in industrial processes and can withstand sea water and mild accids easily in the long term. Look up for \"A4-80\" steel, it is very good for engraving ones private keys and also it is the kind of steel one could find easily in one's country in the form of washers, regardless it is developed or developing. When comes to separating or hiding one's keys, I would be comfortable by getting at least two copies of the seed, one for personal use/recovery, which is supposed to be easily accessed to and another copy, which would be hidden in a secure place, geologically far away from home; the latter would be divided, so one would only need to remember the locations to recover the pieces of the plate.",

This is because no one knows the kind of natural disaster that will occur which will make give you no access to your seed phrase. It is more safer when there are duplicates either you writing it on paper or titanium/steel plate.",

This is not to say that anybody would know where it's going to be stored. Be that as it may, whatever method (paper, titanium, washers) that seem protective for any crypto user is fine, provided they're kept safe, but if you're thinking of saving those keys for generational wealth—writing it on paper is not advisable.",

Just to be sure I also make a backup of that partition which is a normal partition that does not contain any OS data, so if my machine crashes (only when SSD will crash as Linux never crashes) I can reinstall to a new SSD and then add the encrypted partition. I still consider this a plain text thing though yet I am proud in having 0 incidents since late 2013 when I first came into contact with crypto. I am also the only person to use my machine which is never shared with anyone else.While for the guy in here showing it in a plate showing text, the only way to save it like you should, is to take it in a safe that you are the only owner of it.",

As for the plain text I think it is best form of writing seed phrase down is in the plain text, using illustrations or any other way to write the words would be a thing too much and most at times people usually end up forgetting the pattern or how They illustrate the words or text and this is a much painful loss than theft. My advice is if you feel like the plain text is too easy one can simply just add a passphrase to the wallet and then stores the both phrased separately from each other. This way you have text in plain and also a second layer of protection on it",
