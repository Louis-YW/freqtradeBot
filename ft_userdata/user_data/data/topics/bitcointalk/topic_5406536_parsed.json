  "content": "I'm a new user on this forum, and I'm not happy because my first post is in the topic Scam Accusations.After six days of waiting, I saw no other option than to open a topic here. I think it is quite frivolous to keep the user on hold for six whole days, and not pay him his money.I created an account on Duelbits, played the first bet which was a winner and tried to withdraw my money. After that they asked me about KYC. July 10, 2022.Although I don't like to leave my documents on various sites, but I had no choice. I had it done within 15 minutes. Six days later, the money has still not been paid. It's $1275.Whenever I asked them if KYC was confirmed, I would get the same generic answers from Live Support. They don't know anything, I need to be patient, they don't know when it will be finished, there is no ETA.Given that Duelbits has a pretty good reputation on this forum, I think that their behavior like this is very frivolous and unacceptable. If there is no ETA for such things, they can drag this out for half a year.I would like your help and advice, what to do in this case. Is there anyone here who can help me?Screenshots: https://ibb.co/2ZqQxD1https://ibb.co/b2zDKF4https://ibb.co/G0p63G6",

I've seen a lot of gamblers complain here in the forum about the time it takes for the gambling site(not just Duelbits) to verify their documents. so I am not surprised about this but I hope gambling sites would communicate more to their gambler about the progress of their verification.",

I think it is quite frivolous to keep the user on hold for six whole days, and not pay him his money.I created an account on Duelbits, played the first bet which was a winner and tried to withdraw my money. After that they asked me about KYC. July 10, 2022.Thank you for posting about this issue.I am wearing a Duelbits signature therefore I have a moral obligation and ethical duty to take an interest in it, to understand what you claim has happened and to understand from their side what they claim has happened. There are several things that can be said...The Duelbits forum representative has not been online since 1sy July 2022 therefore under usual circumstances one would have to wait for the representatives to post about it to hear both sides of the story, however, in this case your screenshots are sufficient enough to come to understand their side.According to your screenshots, Duelbits are stating their compliance team is looking in to this. Granted, they might have some technical or administrative issues which they have not (or do not want to) elaborate on but is this an actual scam allegation at this stage?I think you should have waited a little longer before claiming their delay in dealing with your particular case was a scam. Calling it a scam allegation at this stage seems premature to me.Quote from: sale2000 on July 16, 2022, 04:31:22 PMAlthough I don't like to leave my documents on various sites, but I had no choice. I had it done within 15 minutes. Six days later, the money has still not been paid. It's $1275.I have a golden rule, I will never send KYC to any website regardless of their reputation therefore I can understand your reluctance.Quote from: sale2000 on July 16, 2022, 04:31:22 PMWhenever I asked them if KYC was confirmed, I would get the same generic answers from Live Support.

If there is no ETA for such things, they can drag this out for half a year.Highly unlikely they will not complete verification within 6 months. Stay positive, hopefully they will have this sorted out within a couple of days.Quote from: sale2000 on July 16, 2022, 04:31:22 PMI would like your help and advice, what to do in this case. Is there anyone here who can help me?To me these are facts thus far as I have interpreted them:You signed up to their website and won $1275 on your first bet then wanted to withdraw the winnings but were unable to. All this happened on 10th July 2022. For reasons not yet known they asked you to verify your account and you reluctantly sent KYC within 15 minutes of them asking. After that, you are on to nearly day 8 of you waiting for them to allow you to withdraw your $1275 winnings.In your chat with Duelbits, they advised you to not contact them (as it was not going to expedite the process of you being contacted by their compliance team) and they stated there was no time-frame on how long the process could take and mentioned their verifications process was in line with legal requirements.Did you ask Duelbits which legal requirements they were referring to?Did you ask Duelbits what was it that triggered their request for the KYC?We simply do know why they wanted extra verification for such a tiny amount as $1275 but since you have no previous history with them and you won on your first bet and maybe only bet, maybe they want to receive confirmation from their security team that:- a vulnerability did not exist which may have been exploited in the game you won- maybe your IP address what it triggered their security alert- maybe the address you sent your crypto from alerted their security teamIn my opinion, $1275 is such a tiny amount for a reputable gaming/gambling website they would never even dream of scamming anybody for such a miniscule amount therefore there is something else probably going on behind the scenes related to you and your win.Others can express their views, some already have and I would like to too. For me, they have covered themselves for a maximum of 28 days (from 10th July 2022 onwards) by simply stating their compliance team will contact you regarding to completing their addition verification checks. If within 28 days if they do not get in contact with you either to state the verification is complete allowing you to withdraw $1275 or on the contrary state you failed the verification and you will not be allowed to withdraw the funds due to such and such issues, then by all means chase this by contacting their support team again and post full details here so forum members can see what is going on.In my opinion if 8 days after sending KYC the verification process is not complete, it does not constitute a scam allegation regardless of the amount being discussed and regardless of the casino/gaming website brand being discussed. I hope this gets resolved within the next couple of days for you and in your favour.Quote from: Rikafip on July 17, 2022, 06:40:57 AMQuote from: sale2000 on July 16, 2022, 04:31:22 PMI would like your help and advice, what to do in this case.

As I see the representative account of duelbits is inactive from 1st July, perhaps there is a logical explanation like holidays, for example. it is certainly completely unprofessional.OP, I suggest you wait for a max of two weeks (14 days is quite enough for all eventual checks) then you need to create a flag on their account and ask for support from the forum community.",

If they will not solve this, it's unprofessionalism that can result in to ruin of their reputation. Since the forum representative account of Duelbits wasn't active since July 1st why not just try to approach the signature campaign manager (Hhampuz) of Duelbits casino.  He might have personal contact with the owner or it might be any higher staff that will help you to fix this problem.  Because 8 days, seems enough time to fix if there's a sort of investigation regarding the big winning or if you violate the term of use, then that's a problem that will never be fixed.",
