NFT and Bitcoin are completely different, Bitcoin can be used to store a value, currency or not hard to sell since every Bitcoin is same, except you're buy a fake Bitcoin e.g. BCH, BSV, etc. In NFT, you must find a buyer who want to buy your NFT, this is really hard since when you uploaded your NFT to Opensea or NFT marketplaces, there are a lot competitors which upload their own NFT too.2. Using NFT or shitcoins for investing are really a bad idea, honestly NFT is more dangerous than shitcoins.",

Employment takes mostly your time away and not your money (and even if there was, it'd only be spent on daily expenses like transportation and food), trading is completely different. It's a zero-sum game.Â  You have to have something you can lose before you gain something, in this case, money. Anw on the topic of NFT and Bitcoin, they're different. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, to simplify, it's a type of money you can use like how you use say USD (or whatever local currency you use). Emphasis on \"like\" since they still have differences. NFT's are like a \"token\" that certifies ownership. Just imagine it as a type of deed for that certain object, in most cases right now, it's for a piece of art.",

Though both are far different from each other. NFT's won't reach the level of bitcoin when it comes to community trust and other factors. With the rise of cryptocurrency, There are many jobs that created because of the recent users spike and numbers of project launching. Most of the jobs are digital like jobs in arts, coding and digital marketing. Just separate bitcoin from NFT's when you do research and don't compare.",

One can be self-employed by trading and investing in the crypto market and assets, including NFTs.Well the price of one bitcoin is at around 22.000 $ at the moment. I would guess that 99% of all NFT's out there are worth way less than that. A NFT does not automatically has the same value as one Bitcoin as they are completely different things. Bitcoin is a digital currency which is own blockchain and of course the first cryptocurrency to ever be created and therefore still the most popular and well known cryptocurrency out there.A NFT is a piece of Art that is stored on the blockchain. Some of those NFT's are really valuable and worth even more than BTC at the moment but most of them are not worth that much. They are also pretty easy to create and mint.Regarding making crypto trading to your job: I would be careful with that, because a lot of people are losing money doing that. Yes a few people got really rich that way, bust most people are not that lucky.",

And choose different properties for them, then you choose a blockchain and pay the fees for creating your nft.You asked that do they have same value as Bitcoin? You can think this as etsy shop. You can try to sell anything with any price. But the question you need to ask from yourself is: Why would anyone buy the nfts you did?An example: I made this banana as nft for a test:Now i could set up a sell order for it and name the price. But why would anyone buy it? Even it was a special banana? But my explanation was not about nft collections. Those are basically same thing except you mint (buy) them without seeing what you get and they have a reveal day when you get to know what sort of pic you got.That's more complex procedure and someone else can tell about it if they have time. However the whole web is full of tutorials.",

Bitcoi's value was coming from the demand and supply. People saw bitcoin as a digital gold that can be used as an investment while NFT was just the digitalization of art work.

They are stored on a blockchain, which is a decentralized public ledger that records transactions and ownership information.If you believe that a particular NFT drawing has significant value and potential for appreciation, you can purchase it with cryptocurrency or fiat currency and hold onto it in hopes of selling it at a profit in the future.
