But it will be online and act as node.solution is to buy raspberry pi 400. install raspberry os or ubuntu 22.04 (slower)install electrumstepshttps://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/install-electrum-on-linux/warning do not download old version. use electrum 4.2.1 and must verify the signthen disconnect the pi 400 FOREVERthen create new wallet. generate seed (you can extend to 24 words )and save it on paper and lock it. save the wallet.dat file on cd rom.then on your online pc create watch only wallet.and use this step to buy\\sellhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQumISxkJsQWArningbefore creating electrum WATCH only wallet which is connected to internet in windows. first download bwt plugin and put it in electrum plugins folder (destination is in c:\\users\\appdata\\roaming\\electrum)and then link it with bitcoin core. This will make sure your transcasction is not leaking to third party. This has to be done offline. once your electrum is connected with bitcoin core showin as connecting to only 1 node, you can then connect to the internet.Then create a watch only wallet",

I want to only use the 24 seeds words, and not any sort of product like a ledger or nano.I would say that using casino dices is probably one of the best offline methods you can use to generate bitcoin seed words, and you don't have to pay anything for that if you already own them.This way you will get truly random results for 23 words and last word needs to be calculated, for that you can even use hardware wallets like Seedsigner, Bitbox or ColdCard if you already have them.Alternative easy and fast way is to use Iancoleman.io website offline to do the same thing.Important thing is that you always verify if seed words are correct before using them for generating addresses and receiving payments.Here are few instructions that I know for process I mentioned above:https://github.com/veebch/Bip39-Dicehttps://shiftcrypto.ch/blog/roll-the-dice-generate-your-own-seed/",
