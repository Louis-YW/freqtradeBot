Just like what we have seen in the past, ICO-IEO-IDO and others, same breed and as soon as the hype goes down, then something new will come along way.So there is a risk, and if anyone is willing to take that risk then so be it. At least you know what you are getting into and so you can't just bitch around after you invested on them and lose your money in an instant. You just been warned.",

Market value of Memetokens are only good upon its release in the market and will suddenly fall once huge investors decided to take profit unlike with some NFTs wherein sometimes there is a utility (physical copy and some perks depending on the concept), which could sustain the market price of that particular NFT. Both has risks ofcourse, that is not something new in this industry. Not all NFTs are profitable to hold for years and not all memetokens would be able to sustain high market volume. So I guess it is safe to call it situational and dependent with what project you are engaging into.",

Not just with any chant that has been pushed by anyone and it seems there's pressure on you just because they're making you choose from the choices they've given. For most of the NFTs, they're collectibles and the value usually goes down after the bull run whilst for the meme coins, you don't expect them to go along with the trend of the market and they've got their own trend that's being set by its community.",

That depends on you whether you are willing to take those shitty things as your investment or not. It kinda so stupid to call NFT as investment.",

      "body": "NFT and meme coins are two different crypto currencies with distinct purposes. NFT coins are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a particular item, such as artwork or collectibles. They are valuable because they provide proof of ownership and authenticity of the item. NFT coins have gained popularity in the art world as a way for artists to monetize their work and for collectors to invest in unique pieces. Meme coins are type of crypto currency that are based on internet memes and have gained popularity due to their humorous nature and low cost. They are not intended to be taken seriously as investment but rather as a fun way to participate in the crypto currency market. The choice between NFT and meme coins depends on your investment goals and preferences. If you are interested in investing unique digital assets with potential long term value NFT coins may be a better choice. If you are looking for a fun and low cast way to participate in the crypto currency market, meme coins may be more suitable.",
