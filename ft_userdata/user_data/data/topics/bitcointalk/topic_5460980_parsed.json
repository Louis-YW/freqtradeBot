  "content": "This game I want to share some information who maybe most of you know but may be most other don't so I feel obligated to share what I know.The odds for Partizani were near 2 and now are 1.44 so it caught my eye as why such thing happened so I asked a few colleagues of mine who are fans of Partizani and they told me that Escaldes fired their coach and soon after 8 main players quit the team to follow the coach,so it should be free money on today game in Conference League,I didn't see any ongoing Conference League thread except self moderated which I don't post there as I don't like being subject of a person if he/she will delete or not my posts and that is why I made this post.I will lock this after the game ends.It ended well and it was just like these guys said,free money despite Partizani missing lots of opportunities and the goal was a bad move from Escaldes goalkeeper,hope you guys made some money locking this.",
