  "content": "Hello. Not sure if this is a bug or standard procedure. I have two regtest nodes, one connected to the other through the \"addnode\" RPC command. Both nodes are using Tor.When reading the debug logs for the connecting node, it will spam repeatedly this line, about twice a second:\"{date string} Selected {onion address} from new\" I have redacted the date and onion address.The debug logs for the node being connected to will show something similar, unless I add \"connect=0\" to the config. I didn't have this experience with Core version 22.0. Is this normal behavior for the node, or is this a bug?Thank you for reading!",

I am surprised that it is a misconfiguration, because the status of the peer is connected and I receive transactions / blocks between the nodes.Is it possible for it to be misconfigured yet the nodes still connect over tor?I will try adding the port designation. I did not add it previously because bitcoind is a little weird with regards to how it handles incoming tor connections (moving between 18445-18444 on regtest).Edit: When I add the port designation, the peer connection no longer works.",

You can use debug=net on the bitcoin.conf.",
