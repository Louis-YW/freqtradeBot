Best to first contact the gambling site customers care to know about the country that you are going to, to know if they will allow you to use VPN. If they said no, better not to gamble in the country until you go back to your country. I will expect the customer care to say no though.

The casino can freeze my account and take every win, but there are always some users who escape monitoring as long as they don't win anything big. If you win something big then they can instantly freeze your account and your winnings because you violated their ToS. If someone took this risk, then what's the point of complaining, it was a intentional violation.",

However, the risk is high and shouldn't be considerable if a person has lots of funds on that casino, because when discovered could lose out their funds. Nothing can be done about it, it's a rule. Hence, in a new country, a player can decide to fund another casino compatible with the new location and enjoy their games instead of risking it all. Whenever, you travel back, the other casino can be of use again without any red flag or issues.",

But probably the answer will be negative, since in the country you visit, betting is illegalAgain, using a VPN can raise a flag in your account and you may even be able to gamble normally, but you have chances to have your account investigated after some time.",

There are some popular casinos on the forum that actually require me to use TOR or VPN to access them, but that's a risky move for me. So in the end I wouldn't use a VPN or TOR to gamble even if the casino didn't notice that in the first place. There is no guarantee that it will be safe to withdraw large amounts of funds when you use a VPN to gamble.It's better to avoid anything risky than us trying to explore the weaknesses and ignorance of the casino to our suspicious activities, it's much better because we need pleasure not solely for money.",

If you somehow got an itch to do gamble on your travel, It would be better to just find a casino that are allows the country you are currently in on playing on their casino. It would be a waste to be block, banned or restricted by the casino you like playing when you go back to your country and of course your crypto that is confiscated by the casino. I also think that casino has the power to detect you and worst if the casino you are playing on has a certain team to find gamblers who are not abiding the casino rules.",

What will you do if they \"block\" your account and take your balance? There are too many risks using a VPN if ToS is not allowed to be used on the site, for example the account will be blocked which will result in our balance being lost. If you already know it can't be used then why try it and of course there is no relevance to the complaint if it is a ban from the gambling site. I also don't know why so many people get away from this problem, even I myself have done it several times on gambling sites using a VPN that is not permitted by ToS.From what I've seen, it's nothing more than winning a small bet and maybe still being lucky enough not to freeze the account. But I'm sure if you get a big win on that bet it's likely to get blocked, so before that happens you have to reconsider because who knows later we'll get a big win but the account is frozen.",

You can't argue \"cause I wanna get rid of the cookies and trackers on my data\" cause again, you willingly gave your data through KYC from way back then, and most of these sites don't issue that much cookies that it's worrisome. So I personally wouldn't risk getting banned and barred from my funds all for the language of safety. Cause if safety's the discussion then as an online gambler we have pretty much relinquished that a long time ago, right from picking which casino to play with, to allowing ourselves to be KYC'ed. And it's not like these casinos and sportsbooks are taking advantage of us for \"collecting our data\" if anything they are just doing this to protect us against hackers for all I know.",
