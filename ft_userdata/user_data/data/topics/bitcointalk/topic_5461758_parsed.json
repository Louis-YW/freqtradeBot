  "content": "I was browsing other local boards, and I've noticed that some of them are very active. This made me realize that maybe it's time to make our local board more active as well. In my opinion, the best way to achieve that is by having a new merit source. Merits can genuinely entice posters to participate more actively in discussions.If we analyze the reasons why other locals are more active than us, the main factor seems to be the presence of \"merits.\"I believe we had a merit source before, but they weren't as active in distributing merits compared to other merit sources (This is my personal observation). Additionally, when their reputation was ruined, they stopped being active in the forum. That was a long time ago, and we haven't had a merits source since, so I think it's about time to have one again. I know there are many active forum members here, so I'd like to suggest that if they don't want to voluntarily apply, we can encourage them by nominating them.So here's my idea: How about we nominate a forum member here whom we believe would be a good candidate to apply for becoming a merit source?I will start with by nominating @bisdak40",

Actually, if I'm not mistaken, our first merit source in the Philippines was cabalism13, who applied on April 26, 2019, and was approved on the same year, I guess. My point here is that I think it's better to have plenty of applications coming from our locals, so Theymos would have more choices.Quote from: JackieKing on August 02, 2023, 05:49:05 AMTwo people gave me two merits a few days ago, I am very happy to receive them.

Agree ako sayo kabayan, no disrespect at parehas lang natin gusto maging active ulit itong local natin. Sayang lang na maraming nawala na local members at contributors sa atin na hindi natin inaasahan. Ganun lang talaga siguro. At salamat sa initiative mo kabayan at sana mas madami ding source ang maapprove dito sa atin.",

We do and if people appreciates your post, you'll be merited but don't make it look like that you're begging for it. Get into meaningful discussions and not just get engaged into bounties. While this local is open to everybody from other locals as well, it will be easier for you to converse in your own local and have genuine discussions.",
