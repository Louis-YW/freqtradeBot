Quite often she used to watch more details on Instagram posts and doesn't have proper knowledge to get into it. Days passed and today it is her birthday. I remembered the conversation and wished her. Already she had Binance, so requested her to send the bitcoin address and send a small amount of 0.0011BTC as birthday gift.I know it is not good to send gifts to the centralized exchanges. During the conversation she said she is interested to learn about trading and for that purpose she had downloaded Binance. While meeting her in person I will brief her better about the security and need for non custodial wallet.I've added the conversation that happened through the WhatsApp.",

Such gifts are always cherished, and that day won't be forgotten so early by her.For now, since she is still new to crypto, a lot of the newbies are introduced to crypto through centralized exchanges as one of their safest means of storing their coins, which I see as normal for anyone who has just a little knowledge about how things work.Just try and make time, like you have said, to lecture her more about the security measures and steps she can take to safely guide her holdings and how to follow up on trades since she said she wants to get involved in trading. To me, for the main time, it could really be nice if she could just start by holding the bitcoin until she familiarizes herself with how trading works.",

But one things make me laugh a lot that your girlfriend is calling you \"Anna\" which is I think a south Indian word, maybe Tamil and the meaning is \"Elder Brother\". Actually she is calling you Elder Brother not her hubby. Maybe your relationship status has been broken. Anyway take it easily, I am replying because this one makes my mood funny.",

Because truly this is quite impressive, & the best way to getting her to love Bitcoin the more & pick interest into getting to learn how it works and her trade which she just opened a \"Binance\" account for. Because by having you as a mentor, I'm sure she is sure of going through her journey smoothly without falling victim of scam just as we did years back when we started our journey alone. However, if you could introduce her to the forum, it will be a very great idea, as she will have the privilege to meet like-minded people like her interested in Bitcoin and learning how to trade, most especially on the \"Trading Discussion\" side of the forum. So once again, I must confess that was a good job you just did.",

But your case is different because your girlfriend has some background knowledge about cryptocurrencies and she desires to own the currency. I have always believed that a gift will make meaning to the receiver if he cherishes it. It is a good birthday gift and I wish she cherishes and appreciates it. QuoteI know it is not good to send gifts to the centralized exchanges. During the conversation she said she is interested to learn about trading and for that purpose she had downloaded Binance.

She needs to use a non-custodian wallet and don't forget to introduce her to an open-sourced wallet. Ensure she understands crypto trading before starts putting in money. She should also know that trading is not a get-rich-quick business. She should know that sometimes you lose and in some cases, you gain.",

      "body": "It was a meaningful gift, and I'm sure she was delighted you did it with her. Recently I also saw a topic about giving bitcoins on the wedding day, but honestly, bitcoin will be a very meaningful gift if the recipient knows what it is and its value. But it doesn't make any sense if you give bitcoins to someone they don't know what it is. Many people will object when you and her use Binance, but in this situation, I don't think there will be any other choice as she is relatively new and maybe Binance account is the only wallet she owns. Of course, you should tell her about the pros and cons of holding bitcoins on a centralized exchange, but with that amount of bitcoins, it would be really unwise to tell her about withdrawing bitcoins to the non-custodial wallet.",

If she is doing research then this can be very beneficial for her in future as knowledge increases only when you are interested in something.I think anyone can be gifted in any form and a gift in the form of Bitcoin is a great gift. Your gifting method is great so it will get more attention in Bitcoin, and that's how we can promote Bitcoin even more.For trading she can choose any good exchange. Before trading she needs to have complete knowledge and experience about trading. You should also guide your girlfriend completely about trading, and fully inform him about the pros and cons of trading. Tell your girlfriend about different trading indicators, trading charts and analysis.",

Yes, in some 3rd world countries, 30 dollars is already quite a lot of money.  it can cover living expenses for a week for a household of 2 to 3 people.

The amount of bitcoins OP gave her is a small amount and even if bitcoin hits $100k it's not too much money for her to change and leave him. If she was just a girlfriend, I don't think any guy would be stupid enough to trust and give all his possessions or secrets. As long as two people are not married, they are still strangers with no ties to each other, there is no reason to completely trust each other.",
