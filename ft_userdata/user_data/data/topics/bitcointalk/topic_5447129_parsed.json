From consensus.h, it's set to 80,000. That is consensus rule.Quote from: Cricktor on April 01, 2023, 08:42:05 AMWhat's the reason, that one of my peers tries to relay a block with \"too many sigops\"?It's indeed weird. There is either some malicious node out there, or a miner who failed to to validate the block properly. Maybe some Bitcoin Core developer can enlighten us.",

In other words the nodes must not relay the header alone before fully verifying the block itself. If a node sent you an invalid block that node is either malicious or a broken/buggy implementation.Additionally compact block feature is about reducing your node's traffic consumption. Basically your node already has most of the transactions that are waiting to be confirmed in its mempool and a new block usually contains transactions that you already have in your mempool (verified). So your node can skip re-downloading and re-verifying them and instead download the parts it doesn't already have.P.S. I wish you shared the entire block not just its hash if you had it.",

      "body": "I don't have a full chainstate to perform a full block verification but by verifying the block with what I have it seems like the block that @garlonicon shared on mega contains a bunch of transactions like [1] and [2] that are using multiple outputs with P2MS scripts. These scripts using OP_CHECKMULTISIG have a very high cost per OP, 20*4 to be exact. For example by my calculations tx [1] has a sigOpCount of 644 and [2] 2084.The record belongs to [3] with 158 outputs and a sigOpCount of 12564[4]!Note that these transactions aren't invalid on their own (as you can see from links below they are already included in another valid block), my guess is that the miner who mined the invalid block (00000000000000000002ec935e245f8ae70fc68cc828f05bf4cfa002668599e4) was running a modified code that didn't check sigOpCounts of blocks they constructed and they ended up including more of these transactions in their candid block as they should have hence creating the invalid block with too many (more than 80k) sigOps.[1] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/0b71a358a1f82e66143fb2dfd54b7cc9227dc8c054397f3fae703f474950f2c1[2] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/4af11e9067eade98e4210a4f739e3c651734b53164dd82e3821363cb586536c6[3] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/87dae4c816c9611038ee35e4662d71089e73f3041863165e56e3dd70d309b274[4] If they had used something like P2WSH the sigOpCount of these 1of3 multi-sigs would have been something like 160 for this transaction instead of 12564.",

      "body": "This seems to be the same problem as above. A block containing transactions like this one [1] that are creating P2MS outputs (1 of 3 which is strange itself) hence inflating their sigopcount (884 in case of [1] which is the highest in that block) and the miner doesn't check the limit ergo produces an invalid block exceeding 80k sigopcount limit.The miner/mining-pool also seems to be the same since coinbase script contains F2Pool string again.[1] https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/0450a1fc590465796e9a1099328fdc4726b86558b7010704ae04cf2cca9643aeQuote from: CohibAA on April 06, 2023, 04:10:27 AMIt's curious that it's happened more than once over the previous days.  If indeed this is a configuration error, which seems likely, someone is losing a fair amount of mining rewards I think.That's true, specially when it is a pool where miners are trusting to not waste their hard work.Quote from: CohibAA on April 06, 2023, 04:10:27 AMI wonder, would it be possible for a competing miner to capture these blocks and insert their own (valid) transactions in place for broadcast?No because the block has to be changed and if you change even a single bit the final hash will be entirely different meaning it will no longer satisfy the target check so it has to be mined again.Quote from: CohibAA on April 06, 2023, 04:10:27 AMWhat would be the goal or take away from a malicious node broadcasting these intentionally?I don't think this is intentional. To give a better answer we have to know the client the said node is running which may be acquired if your logs stored the IP address of the node that sent the invalid block. In which case we may be able to connect to that node and see if it sends its useragent and that may give us more information like the client name which we could find on GitHub and report this bug.",
