      "body": "Fine, even though the project you want to promote has 100% potential to make a big multiple price increase when launched, it doesn't warrant you making such a big statement in your title because at first the thought that came into my mind when I first read the headline was that this is another Ponzi scheme that only promises x return on investment but on the long run it will fail to meet our promises.So due to the above-mentioned points, what makes your project different from that Ponzi scheme because they also promise such a return just as you did?",

Reasonable remark. I just noticed that this is the OP's first post, and also that it is written in standard phrases from regular advertising without any practical justification.  Now there are a lot of fraudulent projects and therefore you need to calculate and check everything several times before investing in new projects.For now, I prefer to invest in bitcoin, ethereum and a few other top coins.",

I know this is your trick to promote the project you did to trap many people.I will not believe the words above, only stupid people enter their projects and then invest and hope for high profits, it's not as easy as what is clearly imagined, it's like a ponzi scheme with multiple profits but the facts don't exist.Even with the title you have plunged it.",

The market may have a different opinion on this and what you want from the market, it is not going to do, this happens very often.What makes you think that all investors in oscar token will be paid that 50% APY? Such high returns are more like some kind of pyramid scheme, and your happy post is more like an attempt to schilling another shitcoin with loud promises and prospects.",

It's that usual too good to be true scenario.That's right, it's shilling another ponzi scheme with promises of high earnings. Such tokens are issued in unreal numbers and each one promises unreal profits. And shillers like OP very rarely write more than 1 post here. Once again, I urge everyone to never believe promises of large interest payouts, especially if it requires locking up your valuable tokens for a long period of time. This most often leads to the fact that at the time of unlocking your coins, the value of tokens is already completely absent and all this time you were earning 50% air.",

Oscar swap has been running its bounty campaign, told your bounty manager to at least run signature campaign.It will a bit better rather than keep spamming by creating the new account just to promting your suspicious project. I meant think smart. People are very smart these days. You made something wrong and your project will be flagged. I never seen people used this garbage swap. The only swap that was trying to raise funds first before making a product. It's non sense thing for sure.",
