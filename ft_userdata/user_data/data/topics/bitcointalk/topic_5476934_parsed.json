The thing wey this Sam bank Fried do pass to kill person o. The reason why they gave am that kind of sentence is because he deceived so many investors who invested in FTX and when FTX crashed, some investors lost their lives while some were trying to survive to clear the debt they incurred when they were investing in FTX.

What they see is that they just smartly took the money without being caught but they don't consider the implication it has in the victims lives. Some of this victims of cyber crime are passing through serious trauma that has disorganised and made them turn into unimaginable things.Some families and businesses have been scattered because of the amount of money that has been lost to this number criminals and it gets to me seriously to know that they are happily spraying someone's hard earned money for frivolous things. Some persons might even commit suicide if they fall victim of this yahoo guys but because it has not happened to us or our fathers and relative we seem less concerned about it.No amount of year's is bad to be given to a man that delight in frustrating someone's effort by stealing from him just to chase after clout and women. I understand that the major root of the problem is that their isn't enough job available for the average youth to engage himself with and that the few ones that are available have been reserved for the children and relative of this politician. But then, if we are being truthful to ourselves, if you put in the energy you're using to deceive others and rip then off their resource into doing a business or rendering a particular service to people, it won't take time before you become financial stable.Someone we de use this bad government and no job talk take de motivate ourselves to be do bad and e no make sense.",

This is where the law is working but I think this is not decided yet, he will be charge to court by next year March and the court will decide his faith and I think the max sentence is likely to be 115 years, it is possible that the court might be lenient with him and reduce the sentencing because as I said, these are places where the law is practice and not abuse by the people in power, if Sam happen to be from Nigeria, he will be paraded by EFCC and either the appeal court or Supreme court for years and later be forgotten. Look at the cases of Fani Kayode and the former Minister of petroleum that has been hiding in the UK for more than 8 years and yet, they are walking the way they like, Diezni is from UK and has carried such level of corruption, she will definitely be extradited back to her country but look how she has lied to be ill of cancer and enjoying public fund in the UK, this country has failed us all.  Quoteif dis kind law dey inplace, e go mean say you fit spend 100 year or more, behind bars dat one go depend on d amount of fraud or moni wey u thief. for me, e dey reasonable dat wan na becos due to many reason, both old and young people Dem don enter dis yahoo matter just to survive d hard economy, but dat one no suppose be yastic for Dem to dey thief other people money. d worst part be say, Dem go thief dis money Dem concience no go judge Dem, watin go happen to d person wey u dey thief from. e go die abi go get financial problems latter? instead Dem go carry d money go club, and other place Dem dey waste am. for me Dem dey heartless and Dem supposed deserve d punishment.again, no be only yahoo boys go still suffer dis thing but also our government people Dem wey go dey guilty of thief or fraud. those people Dem go still need to stay behind bars well because if u say thief, yahoo boys no thief reach politicians. so my question for una, besay e dey fair or inhumane to impose dis kind law for fraudster? make una chuck mouth put for dis matter.If a country want to completely eradicate corruption and cyber crime in this country, what they need to do is to make sure that they weed out the main problem completely and the only way they do this is to provide job opportunities because the reason what we have high level of crime in this country is because they don't have job. Even in the developed countries where things are working, when they notice that crime rate is high, they do analysis on job index but I doubt if this is even consider in this country.If the Nigeria Judiciary should like increase the jail period to 300 years for crime, they will do it because there is no alternative for job in the country, people are hungry and no means to leave an average life even after completing a bachelor in science and art. They need to create jobs in this country for people to live moderately, also fight inflation to the minimum and improve the minimum wage otherwise, this discussion will last in the next 50 years and the crime rate will be on rise.",

If dem dey very serious with this financial crime punishment, I go like make dem still carry am come Nigeria so that e go reduce the corruption rate for Nigerian politics. so that  after person don rule for sit and them find am guilty of fraudulent activity, e go just go prison straight up and that one fit make others wise not to partake in such wicked activity. Anyway I no sure say na the normal punishment year to serve for prison be that, the punishment year depend on intensity of the crime, like this Sam Fried own na, dem say na $64 billion em exchange down. Truly dis wicked monsters dem never near your side, dat na why you de reason say di sentence wey dem give di guy too much, for all i care make Im de di jail to reduce the population of fraudsters wey de outside. Yahoo Yahoo boys and adults no mean well for dem victims, people done get stroke, some don die because of this wicked people. In the twinkle of an eye, all the money wey you don save for dis life inside your bank account go just disappear, because one yahoo boy don get access to all your money comot enter im own custody.Weda dat kind long sentencing law go work for naija, depends on the leadership, because if na corrupt government officials de leadership position, then how kettle go call pot black? E go be business as usual. But if people wey get clean record de for government, den dem go get di zeal to truly fight corruption and sentence criminals accordingly.",
