If you mine ETHW, then you probably have very cheap electricity, because at my rate of 5 cents per kilowatt, there is no profit on many old video cards, and on new ones only a few cents per day. Ethereum clones may still appear, but most of them will close.",

Its a bit crowded already for altcoins that they already have same tickers, PINK is already taken making this unoriginal.",
