However, generally most users learn from their mistakes, and avoid deletion of posts by simply learning what's acceptable or not. To speed up that process, just take a look at the rules. It might seem boring, but it'll likely eliminate most of the issues you're having. Generally, thank you posts are deleted though. Unless, they offer something other more than just that.",

This suggestion doesn't make sense. Mods typically delete the shit post that was reported or they spot along with other message that is shit post too. Your post will not gonna be deleted even if your quoted word is shit if it contains a value that can contribute to the forum such us educating other members to not copy the shit post that you quote or provide a reference to improve it. In general mods won't delete if you tag a shit post if your own post quality is good.Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on January 13, 2023, 11:25:39 AM but in most cases, members abstain from even replying because they know such thread will end up off topic, being locked or deleted.
