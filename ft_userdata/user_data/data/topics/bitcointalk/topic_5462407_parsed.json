It is not an exchange we can recommend on this forum. I have used Binance, Bybit, Huobi, OKX and Kucoin with nothing like seizing of my money. But they are all centralized exchanges, they can seize your coins. But if you have nothing to hide that is a crime, threaten the exchange with lawsuit would be best.",

      "body": "I have been using Bitmart for a very long period of time; I can't remember how long, but I know it's been more than 2 years now, even before my huge exposure to crypto. I passed their KYC verification and have been using the exchange to trade a few coins without complaints. The only time I have issue with this exchange is when I lost access to my Google authenticator bind with the exchange and I can't apply for for it to be disabled reason being that I was not close to my required documents, so I decided to create another account which I used to make a deposit and tried trading the coin which took me there before the price will go against me.. but after my trading I was not allowed to withdraw my funds saying I must pass my KYC, when I contacted there support I was given just one option, which was in other for them to be sure I didn't use the exchange to launder money I should convert back my assets to the currency method I deposited with, and use the same wallet I use for finding as withdrawal address which was embarrassing to me but I had no choice, at the end of the day I took back my coin.  If you can make provision for their demands, try having a friendly chat with their live support, to which they are quick to reply. Maybe give them the suggestion of giving you back your deposited amount directed to the wallet used in funding the exchange.",

      "body": "Well, I would say thanks for the warning, and I think others would learn from your mistake too. Having to deposit over $100k to a centralised exchange is not even a good idea for me, unless maybe it's an exchange you have been using for a very long time and you know you really trust the exchange and you also know it's a good, reputable exchange. But despite being a reputable exchange or not, it's not even wise to have such a huge amount on a CEX.I don't think I have used Bitmart before, but even the name alone sounds like it's not a very popular exchange. Any time am using  CEX for trading and the traded amount is huge, like $20k+, I don't usually carry out the trade at once; I sell or buy and withdraw in fractions. I don't go one at a time but rather bit by bit. For example, if I want to buy Bitcoin worth $20k, I would rather buy $5k first and withdraw it to my account, up until I have exhausted the $20k four times. Any time I also want to sell, I do the same thing. The reason is because I don't even trust any CEX with my assets. CEX is full of excuses and issues; you can make some huge deposits, and they will just come up with one issue that can lead to your account being restricted, just like in your case. By the way, I'm sorry for the situation.",

I think almost all exchanges have withdrawal limits you might already reach the maximum limit that cause this issue you can maybe avoid it if you gradually withdraw them to small amount of $10k or $5k.If you are fully verified there I suggest open a lawsuit against them or report it to SEC here https://www.sec.gov/tcr",

When ever they detect any huge suspicious deposit from anyone they will definitely request for such documents, since they are also under some government regulation in other to protect their exchange and licensed. I guess their T&C quoted below is one of the things they usually use to hold their customers.Quote We reserve the right at all times to monitor, review, retain, and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, sanctions program, legal process, or governmental request.

But my bitcoins are clean.Providing the screenshots of the letters [I'll assume you're referring to an email chain] might help add more context and understanding here. With the current description you gave, is it possible that they're asking for Source of Wealth instead of the origins of the 100k USDT back to the very beginning? Like your employment slip, or some inheritances, whatever documents to prove the source of your wealth. Or, if they indeed asked for the origins of the funds in sense of the source of deposits, perhaps they're not requiring you to give a full detail of entire transaction back to a decade ago? Perhaps the last two or three transaction chains?Their 24-H volume for spot trading according to CMC is USD 1,127,413,542.60, and though you've said that their futures trading volume is fake, thus that number is probably also fake, the small numbers of raised complaints here [I just did a quick keyword search and glanced at the numbers, haven't look at each of the threads to see what's they're about] and that they've been around for several years tends to give them --big or small-- benefits of doubt that it might be a case of miscommunication. Thus, repeating what I said earlier, giving more context will likely helps us understand the situation better.",
