      "body": "So, I wonder, why don't you send it to any exchange and do the trade. I'm pretty sure the current exchanges have a minimum trade limit that is not too high, it should be enough for you to make any trades. Exchange between popular alt coins is not necessary, P2P is more time consuming, the exchange can do it well. Can you explain?",

Plus, if metamask ever does an airdrop maybe you’ll qualify for using their in wallet exchange. I imagine sites like Uniswap or whatever people are using nowadays would work also.",

I imagine sites like Uniswap or whatever people are using nowadays would work also. He can do the swap using Metamask but I think he's doing this because of the high fees that he can't bear. It will still require him to pay such fees and thus, he's looking for an alternative. @OP, it's still needed to pay some fee if this is the solution that you're trying to find.But check it out eventually later if the fees have dropped down, I guess that we're starting to see the drop of the fees.",
