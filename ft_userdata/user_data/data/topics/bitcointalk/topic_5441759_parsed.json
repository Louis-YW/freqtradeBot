      "body": "I guess the most important thing for a moderator to do is enforce the rules of the forum (whichever forum that may be). Bitcointalk is actually good in the sense that free speech is encouraged here, it‚Äôs actually quite difficult to get banned. There are no snowflake rules here & I love that. The most enforced rule I see here for bans distributed is for plagiarism. I see people getting posts deleted for being low quality of off topic, people enjoy reporting posts here so a moderator must respond to reports subjectively.I haven‚Äôt seen any bad moderating here, you can tell that because it‚Äôs very rare you see people starting threads to complain about the moderating.",
