Yeah, those can give you bigger wins, but you also wager like 100 times more for those bonus features. They have higher multiplier and payout, but there is a chance you will be also losing a lot too. More like you buy $100 worth of features, you either up winning only $10 or a huge payout of $1000. The former one very likely to happen. If you are not hunting for the bonus round, just spin the slots normally and if you get lucky, you will win the bonus round (which guarantees you a profit for that bet). But if you are looking for the bonus round, buy the features, you will likely be spending less when you instantly buy it instead of manually spinning for it.",

      "body": "Don't think about profitability when you are about to play some slots... normal spins or buying bonuses it's almost the same! If you get lucky you will win something, and if you are really lucky it means you hit some jackpot or max payout on some slot, but that doesn't happen to everyone... of course, if you are unlucky you will lose, doesn't matter did you play normal spins or if you were buying bonuses.As I said many times, from my experience, after playing normal spins (over 1000 spins on different slots) without hitting even one bonus round I think to myself that it would have been better if I had bought the bonus rounds. When I am buying bonus rounds and lose I think the opposite. But it's when we lose... By playing \"normal spins\" you can hit over x100 (my highest is over x200, with ordinary spin) payouts from a single spin, and with some luck, you can hit a bonus round in the first 10-20 spins (but that doesn't happen so often). But the reality is that we often run into some long streak of dead spins, without hitting the bonus even after a hundred spins (mine is over 500 spins without a bonus round, on the Pragmatic slot with the selected option \"double chance for bonus\")... I lost the entire balance and I didn't have money for more spins).Buying bonuses is definitely an interesting thing to do... but those \"dead spins\" can & often happen in bonus rounds as well! After a few bought bonus rounds with under x5 payouts will melt your balance pretty quickly.Bottom line is, slots are for fun and entertainment. If you play because you think you will make some profits easily you are terribly wrong. People should play slots with money they can lose easily because with slots it's easy to lose big money.",

Generally I used to play normally cause I am not someone who spend much on casinos but have a habit of watching steamers who usually buy bonus pack and win big but they are mostly sponsored by the casino itself and for me its a kind of promoting and another way to make money.",

When I started gambling online I also thought it would give you more to win, but in fact the outcome of the game depends only on whether you are lucky in the gaming session or not, and whether you can stop if you win. There were times that I won from bonuses, but they were small amounts, so I can't say that bonuses give any advantage against playing the same slots.",

Often, the higher the bonus, the higher the requirements are to clear the bonus. There are already many topics devoted to this on the forum, and that will not be the last time. If you can get a bonus that does not require you to wager any requirements then it is free and for free. I would also always check the terms and conditions. When you make a deposit, you can often choose whether you want a bonus or whether you want to refuse it. Cashback bonuses are also good, but that means you have already gambled at a loss.",
