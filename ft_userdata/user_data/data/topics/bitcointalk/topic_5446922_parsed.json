  "content": "Recently, some countries began to use their local currencies in trade with each other. It is true that there was no trade union between these countries, but these movements began to increase. This topic will shed light on some of these countries:China, Brazil strike deal to ditch dollar for tradeQuoteBRASILIA - China and Brazil have reached a deal to trade in their own currencies, ditching the United States dollar as an intermediary, the Brazilian government said on Wednesday.The deal, Beijing’s latest salvo against the almighty greenback, will enable China, the top rival to US economic hegemony, and Brazil, the biggest economy in Latin America, to conduct their massive trade and financial transactions directly, exchanging yuan for reais and vice versa instead of going through the US dollar.“The expectation is that this will reduce costs... promote even greater bilateral trade and facilitate investment,” the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (ApexBrasil) said in a statement.China is Brazil’s biggest trading partner, with a record US$150.5 billion (S$200 billion) in bilateral trade last year.The deal, which follows a preliminary agreement in January, was announced after a high-level China-Brazil business forum in Beijing.Pakistan, China agree to trade in yuanQuotePakistan on Monday announced an agreement with China to use Chinese currency for bilateral trade to end the burden of relying on U.S. dollars.'China and Pakistan agreed to start trading in the yuan instead of the dollar,' Fawad Chaudhry, minister of information, told reporters in Islamabad.This agreement, reached during the Pakistani premier’s current visit to China, would help Pakistan get rid of the dollar burden in $15 billion of bilateral trade, he added.Imran Khan’s four-day official visit to China is ending Monday.The move to Chinese currency would also help both countries replace the U.S. dollar for their transactions and investment in the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).This June, the State Bank of Pakistan formally allowed both public and private enterprises to use Chinese currency for bilateral trade and investment activities.China and Russia ditch dollar in move toward 'financial allianceQuoteRussia and China are partnering to reduce their dependence on the dollar -- a development some experts say could lead to a \"financial alliance\" between them.In the first quarter of 2020, the dollar's share of trade between Russia and China fell below 50% for the first time on record, according to recent data from Russia's Central Bank and Federal Customs Service.The greenback was used for only 46% of settlements between the two countries. At the same time, the euro made up an all-time high of 30%, while their national currencies accounted for 24%, also a new high.Russia and China have drastically cut their use of the dollar in bilateral trade over the past several years. As late as 2015, approximately 90% of bilateral transactions were conducted in dollars. Following the outbreak of the U.S.-China trade war and a concerted push by both Moscow and Beijing to move away from the dollar, however, the figure had dropped to 51% by 2019.Alexey Maslov, director of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Nikkei Asian Review that the Russia-China \"dedollarization\" was approaching a \"breakthrough moment\" that could elevate their relationship to a de facto alliance.",

It is clear that China is leading an economic war to whittle down the financial influence of the United States. I support the idea of using local currency for international trade because it helps to reduce the cost of such transactions and also eradicate the influence the dollar has over these economies. I am pained by the amount most developing nations have to spend on international trade because of the dominance of some currencies. These expenses would have been used to provide basic amenities for these poor nations. But these policies should be done with good intentions and not just to score political points.",

However, I am damn sure that Brazil and Pakistan won't last for very long. In the case of the Brazilian alliance, the US is the biggest obstacle for them and they would be let down by them in no time. When it comes to Pakistan, well what to say about that country, they already have their own issues of daily needs so what kind of alliance they are going to form with China? If they do it they are anyway lowering their own value in the process and if they do it, then they would surpass historical charts against dollar value. The basic needs are so high that people would prefer to die out of hunger but they cant really survive that situation. China is just plotting their next strategy to acquire the land and nothing else.",

India also has such a goal that they made several international trade settlements in Rupees. Kenya also ditches USD for shillings and in the middle east, PetroYuan is gaining.",

The problem is in the US pressures that impose their control over the world economy by controlling the production of the dollar, which the world considers the official criterion for determining the prices of important products such as gold, oil and gas.In addition to the examples you mentioned, there are other countries that are considering adopting alternatives to the dollar in their dealings with China, which will strengthen the position of the yuan. There are countries that are considering choosing to launch their CBDC currency to facilitate transactions with allied parties.",

Of course it is an opportunity for the United States Rivals to take US customers one by one and leave the dollar which is an alternative currency for global trade and foreign exchange, countries that have the courage and try to get out of the dollar ecosystem is a great opportunity, and as we can see from the data what was presented by the OP, they began to ally themselves through a trade cooperation approach and maybe for the next is military cooperation and forming forces such as NATO as a product of solidarity and resistance to western hegemony.",

It is good news in a way, but the world economy will face some ups and downs, that's for sure. It's like 2 sides of the same coin.

The US/EU doesn't like that and that's why they're putting sanctions from this possible trade up alliance.

Sure, the dollar's been king for a long time, but let's not forget, there are other players in the game. By utilizing their domestic currencies in commerce with one another, these nations are stimulating increased bilateral trade and investment, diminishing costs, and nurturing solid economic connections. This move might unlock new possibilities and openings for international trade and cooperation.Additionally, this transition to employing local currencies could contribute to superior financial steadiness and autonomy for these countries. By depending less on the dollar and more on their own legal tender, they can decrease their susceptibility to global economic swings and crises. To wrap it up, this shift away from the dollar, while gutsy, could yield remarkable perks for these countries and the international economy at large. Let's welcome this novel epoch of global trade and teamwork with open hearts and a positive outlook.",

China is just trying to strengthen its yuen by making these deals so I don't think it's much of a difference in the long run. However we do it, there's always going to be that currency that we used to measure the value of things on the international market, whichever it is; pounds, dollars, yuen, its not much of a difference because if that currency or economy suffers, most of the countries dependent on it suffers.",

Therefore, the BRICS bloc contributes greatly to the development of the global economy. Along with that, the countries in the BRICS bloc are increasing their trade with other countries in the world.

After the Opium War waged on China they went back to an old ideology that basically says \"be like grass, bend but don't break\". They built their economy up from having 85% of their massive population in absolute poverty to having 0% absolute poverty and the strongest economy at present. They did that by \"bending\" but not \"breaking\". Now they are taking revenge. The only thing that should matter to the rest of us is to not allow China to replace US after the collapse of United States like Soviet Union did before it.",

This is, as you all know, China. And it's not just that the slogan \"abandoning the dollar\" has turned, in reality, into the slogan \"everyone except China is switching to yuan. China remains with dollars.\" Why is that ? Because of all these \"equal\" members of the union, China becomes the OWNER of this union, and its satellites become its subordinates, whose economy will soon be completely dependent on China.At the same time, the Chinese economy depends on the dollar. Therefore, China \"supported\" this idea, but with a small caveat - China did not abandon the dollar, and \"put\" its \"subordinate\" allies on the yuan",
