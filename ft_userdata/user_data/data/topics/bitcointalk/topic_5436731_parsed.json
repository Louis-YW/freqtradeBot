  "content": "I'm looking for bitcoin-funded business ideas. Let's say I have some BTC that I want to put to work. However, I don't want to trade with my BTC, stake it, exchange for other crypto/NFT/whatever, invest in existing businesses nor I want to simply cash out. What I'm thinking is more like opening a business that I can fund with my BTC directly and start generating income. An example would be buying something in bulk e.g. some gadgets on Chinese markeplaces like Alibaba (providing that I find someone happy to take BTC instead of FIAT) and resell this stuff locally, on ebay, etc. Other example: rent bare metal servers for BTC, reconfigure and resell as VPSs or run some hosting service on them (minecraft server or whatever).Any other ideas?Conditions are:this will be a legit business under my real name so must be legalit must be possible to fund all expenses with crypto directly, so no exchanging BTC for FIAT firstI'm in the EU (it may matter for things like customs, taxes, legality)",

      "body": "You want to start a business where you will be able to pay for everything with Bitcoin, and I assume that you want your clients to pay exclusively in Bitcoin or not? I think that this way you are only complicating your life, especially if you are within the EU in one of the member states that do not have precisely defined laws when it comes to cryptocurrencies.As for imports from outside the EU, of course you have to count on the fact that you will pay customs duties and everything else that the law stipulates, and for me personally it is no longer worth ordering directly from China because, apart from the fact that the parcels can travel a long way, all parcels are subject to VAT of 25% (which was not the case before) + customs if it is about perfumes, alcohol or tobacco products.In addition, I guess you understand that at any moment there is an option for someone to ask you to prove the origin of your capital, i.e. where you got your Bitcoin from. Therefore, if you can't prove it, you better not start the business.",

      "body": "Those are too many restrictions but if you want to start it anyways then you can explore online world. May be have e-commerce which only accepts bitcoin as mode of payment. You can always tie up with the gift card making companies where you can register your business and have your customers liberty to get coupons using which they can pay you. Why? So these coupons would be one of those where people fund them with bitcoins or other crypto. Then they can use it to buy services or product from you. Now the headache of exchanging their fiat to crypto would be theirs only and not yours. It seems complicated really but thatâ€™s best option considering your stringent rules of setting it up.",

      "body": "You don't necessarily need to import goods from Alibaba or China. I don't know how the demand for such cheap product in EU is, but I guess you could try something more refined and elaborated. Since you want to invest your BTCs, the most logical alternative is imports, without any doubts, as Bitcoin is a boardless currency, very convenient to negotiate with people from other countries in an accessible way.But first, check what the demand in your area is for, then go for that category of good, but not the cheap, copy ones. Import original goods of high quality and look for customers who are willing to pay the fair price for it. And don't stick to China only. Maybe you could even import something from an european country which you know you are going to resell easily.",

With not many good methods of recycling.Many discarded bottles are composed of PET plastic which can be recycled into PLA filament for 3d printers, without specialized skillsets or tools being necessary. The following youtube clip demonstrates the process.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eecbdb0bQWQPerhaps BTC can be exchanged for parts and equipment necessary to achieve this, in which case it would also serve as a positive environmental process. There are many different niche ideas flying below the radar which are not currently being used. Being a local business it would depend upon the needs of your area. In my case, electricity is expensive here. Alternatives are in high demand. If I was starting a business it would revolve around methods to diminish electrical consumption. Which might invoke things like solar panels, windmills or solar water heaters. In europe's case, it might be alternatives to natural gas. Things like firewood. If someone had space to grow trees or plants, they might invest in fast growing trees to quickly generate and replenish firewood stock. If they were serious they might learn to turn wood into charcoal using 55 gallon drums for higher efficiency. There are instructional clips on youtube demonstrating the process:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_CK1nSD9Q4Most believe they need a big down payment to start a business. I think producing charcoal from woodstock and turning PET bottles into FLA filament are both businesses which could be started for less than $500. There are a lot of businesses which could be founded without a large capital investment.",

      "body": "If you already have experience or knowledge about running a business and you just want to fund this one with BTC, it will be outright easyIt becomes a bit harder if you want to charge your customers in BitcoinAnyway, you have two very solid ideas there, both renting servers or paying for foreign goods in BTC will be not too difficult, your main obstacle may be if you need to pay some of the customs, taxes and the likes before generating income (if you're planning to charge in Bitcoin you will need to cashout for taxes, is unavoidable)My suggestion will be engaging a small percentage (up to 35%) of what you can invest in the bare bones server rent, it scales well, both down and up, can be wholly funded in Bitcoin and you can offer several related services with itIt will let you test how funding your business with BTC actually works in your location and discover the small pros and consI myself have run a similar project in my home city between 2015 and 2017 (I payed the servers in Bitcoin and charged in fiat) It worked well for a time, mainly because local hosting providers used to charge too much to small business and individuals",
