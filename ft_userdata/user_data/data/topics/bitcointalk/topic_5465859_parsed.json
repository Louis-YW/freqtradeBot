Life is about risk which you have heard  countless times but it will be unwise to take loan to buy bitcoins. I take trading as some sort of gambling, and even hodling Bitcoin could be seen as a bet too, due to political/legal uncertainties and price volatility. That said, the same bad mistake that would be to take a loan to gamble (incredible for many like is, but still too frequent) is to take a loan to trade or invest in crypto.As you said, it would be better to make the effort and earn some spare money that you can use to invest, or if you don't have a job or it doesn't give you spare money you could even work for crypto in your free time, instead of doing other hobbies that would increase your expenses.",

Life is about risk which you have heard  countless times but it will be unwise to take loan to buy bitcoins. It's not even compulsory to invest in bitcoin by the way. The problem is that majority don't have single knowledge about bitcoin but want to invest in it because they heard people talking or making it from bitcoin without knowing the sacrifice and the patience involve in the process. Not only about bitcoin but no any investment worth borrowing money for as it might be backfire anytime. Work on yourself to establish before thinking of investment because an hungry man can not invest while the stomach is crying for help. No investment is greater and more important than investing in one's self.",

FOMO is one of the causes of all the eagerness to have invested before the bull run, and we all know the results of FOMO: it always leads people to make wrong decisions while investing because they have no time to do research because they are afraid of missing out. Moreover, that can be the cause of some people taking loans just to invest in cryptocurrency, and the funny thing is that some will not even buy Bitcoin because they were told that altcoins bring a higher return than Bitcoin, and with the intention and aim of making money fast, they will be tempted to buy altcoins they don’t know about, which can result in a loss of money.Some people have yet to experience the bull run, therefore they are attempting to make as small an investment as possible before then, especially since the price of Bitcoin is still very low. Buying Bitcoin now against the bull run is a fantastic investment, but always invest only what you can afford to lose.",

Calm your pressure because Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme if you don't have money to invest in Bitcoin keep working on yourself and learn more about Bitcoin until the time is ripe for you to invest in Bitcoin. You might take a loan to invest in Bitcoin to make a profit in the short run without knowing you are in for a long ride. When the time to repay your loan surpasses there will be no money for you to repay the loan. Just calm down and don't allow \"FOMO\" to push you to borrow money to invest in Bitcoin.",

If you must borrow, let the amount be minimal. This is where the knowledge you have gotten from the time you spent studying would be of help to you.

The best time to buy Bitcoin was in 2009 when it was created and basically worthless and the second best time is today. We're still early because the potential that Bitcoin has is more than anybody can imagine. Looking at the price today it's trading above $25k and if you would have told people 10 years back that the price will be this high they would have probably laughed at you and called you crazy but here we are predicting the price to go higher in the coming bull market. It isn't late to buy Bitcoin today because we aren't yet close to the adoption that bitcoin will have in the future. It's best to have a seat at the table to witness it all.Quote from: Forever101 on September 06, 2023, 12:57:53 PMCalm the pressure my dear friends, don't borrow money, I repeat, don't borrow money to invest on Cryptocurrency, because it is a volatile asset.Instead of borrowing money that won't give you the peace of mind that you need as an investor, DCA into Bitcoin by investing the little you have whenever you have it and in no time, you would have invested more than you could have ever imagined. People would borrow to invest don't always have a happy ending and the crypto space isn't somewhere you should be having baggage over your shoulder like a loan that you have to pay irrespective of how the market plays out. Be wise with your investment and cut your coat according to your size.",

Well, if someone offers me money in the form of long-term loan to pay when I can regardless of the duration, and the person doing it just to assist me financially so I can have my full independence, I will consider accepting such money and investing a very huge percentage of it to bitcoins. If I have not planned any business to invest the money into, investing it first in bitcoins will be what is best for me to do since I know there is a potential for t to be profitable. I do not advice you take loans, but there are some situations where you can accept some kind of money from people who offer you loans with no collateral, no interest, and no duration to pay back.",

I agree with you it's not worth to borrow money in order to invest in any crypto-currency even Bitcoin because we aren't sure that in which direction Bitcoin's price will go and if someone borrows money in order to invest in it then I would consider that as a poor decision. The ones who borrow money will have to pay huge interests and sometimes they won't gain much profit byinvesting in Bitcoin and the interests grow much high over time that they can't recover those with the profits they earn from Bitcoin investment.",

If you do not have money to invest now, please ease the pressure, you may have more than enough to invest in the future. This is very underrated advice. A lot of people feel left out, they feel they're missing out because they don't have money to invest. Yes, true, you might truly be missing out, but if the reason is because you lack the funds to invest then don't beat yourself up. If you don't have money to invest in Bitcoin, and you're focused on investing in Bitcoin then you're misplacing your priorities.Your priority should be how to earn more money. You can either get a job or start a business, whichever it is, but get something that gives you money. It's people who have money that invest in a project, any investment at all, not just Bitcoin. So instead of putting pressure on yourself because you don't have money to own Bitcoin, why not channel that energy into something else that will make you earn money? Also, the good thing about Bitcoin is that you can buy it with any amount you have. Don't look at the price. Just see it as your little investment. That can motivate you. If you can invest when you are not making much, how much more will you do when you have? You can always start small.",
