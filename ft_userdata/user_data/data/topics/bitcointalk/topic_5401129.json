The general sentiment of crypto market is bearish so does Ethereum sentiment. The chart shows there is big gap because of Ethereum massive growth in 2020 and 2021 and it is very reasonable to see it will be corrected to fill these gaps.So if gaps filled, Ethereum will be fallen to $1000 or $800 before we see a new bull run for it.Quote from: JeffBrad12 on June 02, 2022, 11:56:59 PMThe postponement has been giving a big drop for ethereum last week, Bitcoin sentiment is still unpredicatble.

ETH 2.0 was postponed many times, many months and years so if you see price of Ethereum rises or falls with news release about ETH 2.0, it is not real reason.After having enough accumulation, price will rise and news about ETH 2.0 is only coincidence or support to its rise. If news released when price already grows too much and general market has to be corrected too, news is not real reason of Ethereum correction",

If the inflation goes down by a considerable amount, then they’ll increase the rates slowly by .25% and it won’t affect crypto much. This is all about the fed and the inflation now. My guess is that the FED can’t play this tough guy game for long. They’ll become dovish again one way or another.",

A lot of people are talking about looking forward to November being so good for the start of a significant uptick. I agree with your analysis, sometimes the season of the bear and the season of the bull from per year the percentage up and down is different",

There is nothing special in this year than mimicking 2018, and if it fully mimicked 2018, very possible we are still going more bottom before this year ends.Quote from: goaldigger on June 03, 2022, 09:55:12 PMIt’s always like this, we are fully dependent to the price of Bitcoin so expect a more related trend and if Bitcoin continues to sideways, ETH will also follow that.

Not only ethereum that will follow, all other cryptocurrencies are going to follow, this is a time for bear market, some coins may even become dead.  There is no safest price, it is possible that ether can go below $1000, anything is possible during bear market as it happened in the past.",

As for the price, I like the way ETH is actively leaving exchange traded wallets and increasingly settling into cold wallets, for long term investing that's a good fundamental factor. I've also read that the pace of ETH burning has slowed down a bit and that may be affecting the price rise. ETH has only lost 62% of its value since its last ATH, some expect ETH prices at $1,100-1,300 in the not too distant future when the bearish trend enters its final phase.",
