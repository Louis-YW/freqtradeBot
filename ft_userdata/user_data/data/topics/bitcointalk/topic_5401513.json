Any idea/documentation/thread/input is highly appreciated.Are you aware of this Bitcoin Core limitation?Quote from: achow101 on May 30, 2022, 03:40:02 AMI would not recommend doing that. Bitcoin Core is not well equipped to handle both large wallets, and a large number of wallets. Either it will perform very poorly or it will consume more memory than you have.It is not possible to get a wallet's balance without loading it. Loading a wallet can take a lot of time, and constantly loading and unloading wallets will waste a lot of time. When a wallet is loaded, it is entirely loaded into memory and the entire wallet is iterated at least once.Quote from: NeuroticFish on June 06, 2022, 09:20:55 AMMaybe you already know, but I want to be sure:You will probably have to run bitcoind (i.e. the daemon, not the wallet UI).When you start wallet UI (Bitcoin Qt), the daemon (bitcoind) also running on background. But OP should use bitcoind directly for server.",

(i am thinking to run umbrel on a side project, not sure if it worksfor my proof of concept idea)If it's all about Bitcoin payments then I think you can check BTCpayserver.I don't know what do you mean without any wrapper but I guess you don't want to use any 3rd party? BTCpatserver can be self-hosted it doesn't have any 3rd party and all payments are direct to/from your wallet, and I think you can integrate it into ERP. Check it here https://btcpayserver.org/ You can start playing it with testnet and then later switch to mainnet.",

(i am thinking to run umbrel on a side project, not sure if it worksfor my proof of concept idea)BTCPay usually is best option. But if you're looking for cheaper/easier setup and don't mind reduced privacy, consider Mycelium Gear[1]. While it's 3rd party service, only you have access to your Bitcoin since they only ask your xpub/master public key. And there's no fee when your monthly volume is 0.1BTC or less[3].[1] https://gear.mycelium.com/[2] https://gear.mycelium.com/docs/creating_a_new_gateway[3] https://gear.mycelium.com/pricing",

The docker image sets up mainnet transactions by default.That is, not only will you have to run bitcoind in testnet, you also need to run NBXplorer (a BTCPayServer progam) in testnet mode as well.",

(i am thinking to run umbrel on a side project, not sure if it worksHow externally do you want to call it?, if you want to work only on your LAN then it's simple as opening the ports on ubuntu, but if you want to call it from the WAN then you will have to take down your modem firewall, set the machine on DMZ and set up a no-ip.You could create a page to call those functions, but since you don't want to use any wrapper, then SSH could be the right tool to connect directly to the machine and use the bitcoin-cli tool to work with the transaction.",
