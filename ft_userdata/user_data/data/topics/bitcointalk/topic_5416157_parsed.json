I want to know of there people who trade synthetic indices and do you see yourself or think of stopping it anytime soon.?",

Because of this, various derivatives, algorithmic stablecoins, synthetic products and other products become dangerous for investors.Exactly and new traders are advice to stay away from these alternative trading methods. The most common which is future trading is already dangerous and has liquidated more traders than those it has been favorable to. Don't be fooled by what you see online or on crypto twitter because for every success story you see they're either fake or we have hundreds of unsuccessful stories been hidden. I'm just getting familiar with the team synthetic training after seeing you topic, I have to go look it up and then I understood why it isn't a common term atleast to my knowledge probably because I'm not much active in the trading sector.The industry is very much new and things aren't yet mature enough for this other methods of trading to be popularized. For now spot trading has to be the most advisable form of trading as with spot, the balls is in your court and if you do your analysis properly you can easily outsmart the market. If spots doesn't favor you then fall back on investing (buying and holding) as it has been proven to be very effective in the short lifespan of the industry.",

      "body": "This is more of a more confused kind of terminology in trading. I rather stick with what is already difficult than compounding a difficult situation   All that a trader is looking for is profit and to dive into a more confusing system is sure a way to loses. Learning the spots trading is better. Moreover I use to hear the word in gambling how come is making it way in trading ?",

However there are market makers that hedge and keep everything in close price. There is also the funding rates which are to control that the mark price will be close to the index price. These also exist in any other forms such as CFDs, options, forex, etc.",

The most common which is future trading is already dangerous and has liquidated more traders than those it has been favorable to.You are not wrong but future trading has its own advantages too, but newbies prefer to just use it to leverage 2x or more and it become very risky.I will not advice anyone to go for future trading because of the leverage temptation which might likely be what would happen and money loss. But there are few advantage of future trading:Going 1x which can be like spot trading Going shortNot you key not your coin. It offers you the ability to reduce the fund you have on exchanges. Assuming you have $1000 you trade with, you go for 1x leverage. You can just move $700 to noncustodial wallet and trade with $300 with 3.5 leverage. Knowing that you have $700 on noncustodial wallet which can be a collateral in case, but depending on your trading. Many long term future trading holders gindirnthis option.But future trading is truly riskier.",

What it did was make me lose money.",
