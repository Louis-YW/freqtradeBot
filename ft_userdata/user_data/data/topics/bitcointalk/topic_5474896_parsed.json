I struggled to fight the temptation but the excitement led me to play again and again.How about have you at any time blamed the one that led you to gambling in your mind, or even told him face to face?",

      "body": "I was not introduced into gambling by anyone, it was a decision I made myself after I won with a random bet I got in a dream. Yes dream! I got the game in a dream and when I woke up I walked up to a betting shop and played the game and won making a profit of X150 of my capital and that eas how I started gambling till date. At thise early stages of me joining gambling, it was actually easier winning even though the amount won were not huge. Now that I take gambling as a big business the winnings are not coming regularly but I'm actually applying risk management to be able to remain in the business.",

      "body": "You do not have to blame anyone because the person introduced you to gambling. If your friend is doing something, that does not mean you also should begin to do it. I have friends, they know that I am gambling but they are not gambling. Individual should also use their brain. It is true that if something like loss ift money begins, the gambler may say he should have not met a friend that let him know about gambling, but gambling is everywhere today and there are many ways someone can be exposed to it.",

      "body": "Lots of Filipinos started on that game. Not me though. My first time gambling was with card games called Tong-Its in our country. I cannot even remember who taught me how to gamble or I learned it myself by watching the older people while they are playing. As a kid, I was always curious about what was happening in my surroundings and sometimes I wasted a lot of time just watching people play cards, mahjong, and lucky 9. Until I got my own money saved from my allowance and my portion from selling fried bananas with sugar. That's when I started gambling in small amounts and it's all kept a secret from my guardians. After that as I grew older someone taught me how to play \"Sakla\" the Spanish card game where you need to win by a pair. I don't blame the one who taught me that but I am actually glad that I experienced this kind of thing growing up. Better, it made me realize how important money is because I experienced losing in that game the money that should've been my budget for a week going to work. I ended up borrowing money from my sister and after that, I didn't play that game again.",

These were something new to learn and apply for me. Hence I dont regret it.",

It's not like I was told I will always win so I knew what I was getting into.People who blame others for their voluntary actions simply lack accountability. Even a teenager who already understands how betting works shouldn't use age and the influence from peers as an excuse.",

I think my decision to gamble was a decision I took consciously so that any consequences that occurred were my own responsibility. I got to know gambling from a close friend of mine, at first I wasn't interested, but because he often gambled online when we were together, I became curious to try it.",

Also you can't feel any guilty feeling with that since you are not in proper mind to take good decisions while you play. Now since you already realize that you are wrong with that time since you are in charge with decision you do then as grown up man now for sure you learn a valuable lesson from the past and will not blame the current or existing people that might convince you to gamble on a casino.Nothing wrong to gamble its just we need to set up some good attitude about this since if we don't have plan and let the game flow until you already done then provably this will not give us best result since we already got broke on that conditions.Use your experience as a kid to learn from your mistake and for sure you became more better gambler with these incident happen to you.",

Because I only play computer games and I'm addicted to it but when my friend introduced me to gambling I became interested in it too and that's why I lost a lot, wasted a lot of money but never once did I blame my friend because it was my fault too.

Gambling is not something you should be referring someone to, especially if they are close to you, because it will just make you look bad in the end, only very limited amount of people won't put blame on you if they lose money.",

Maybe consider this friend a hero or something like that. I can't remember who taught me how to gamble when we were just in grade school there are so many faces I can remember their names still as I can see my friends in my hometown still.  The only two gambler friends I have are brothers, one has a reputation for robbing the nearby chicken farm but we are friends. I can't remember to blame them every time I lose since after the game we play we always use the money to buy burgers for ourselves.",
