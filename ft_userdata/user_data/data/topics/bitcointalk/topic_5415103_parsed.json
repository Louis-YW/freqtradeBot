Just add \"site:bitcointalk.org\" to google search to limit the results to bitcointalk.org.Here is an example that you can try:Quote from: mk4 on July 03, 2022, 02:46:52 PMCode:site:bitcointalk.org what is \"crypto\" -dogehttps://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en",

Take note of that.We have alot of pinned post on different boards of the forum. Do yourself some good to goggle around each board -- most especially -- meta and the \"beginners &help\" which is prolly the same board we're talking.Take note of the PROs and CONs and stick around. You'll learn more as time fades. See you out thereCheersSandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

First, I would like to say welcome to the forum, i hope you find what you are looking for, as well as have a wonderful stay here.Concerning your query, based on my experience using the forum's search engine, I wouldn't guarantee it's effectiveness at all times, I mean there are times you search for something, and you end up with \"No Results Found\" even when that thing is something that's been discussed several times here.But here is what I do most times, I use Google search to find topics/discussions on this forum.For example, If I want to find discussions on this forum on buying bitcoin with credit card, I simply open Google search and type...Code:Bitcointalk buying bitcoin with credit cardAnd hit the search button, 90 percent of the result you will be getting are gonna be discussions on this forum partaining to the searched keywords.Example is the screenshot below...It's works, just make sure you type \"Bitcointalk\" first before typing what you are searching for.",

If you search a long sentence and use the search engine, you will many thread that doesn't related with the sentence. It's only good to search about particular word or phrase, not in sentence. Since your crypto journey begins today, I advice to avoid the whole shitcoins aka crypto in general and only focus on Bitcoin. This because there's many scams on crypto that would make you get scammed.",

It has a curation-based reward mechanism and decided to integrate a GameFi dimension into its ecosystem. Users who want to participate must have NFT glasses in order to curate or like the NFTs they believe are valuable. The greater the future value of the curated NFT, the more token rewards users will receive. Under the influence of incentives, users are more inclined to make wise choices. As a result, EyesFi intends to create a more efficient value discovery platform with the assistance of all participants and contributors.
