If this is the case, then it is questionable who the Bitcoin developers were who changed the blockchain nodes.The token can make the blockchain more developed, and it can also damage the reputation of the blockchain. For example, the presence of junk tokens in smart contracts of Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and others makes the blockchain reputation deteriorate and the trust in the tokens developed is lost. It's not interesting if this happens to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is better single than having children who can destroy it. Lol",

LN never has. LN has no consensus thus anything can happen. LN could build anything without touching bitcoinbut i am laughing that blackhatcoiner suddenly want to call LN a subnet when its bridged to a blockchain/allotment of units he doesnt want to use in LNanyway.LN has too many liquidity leaks, bottleneck flaws. multiple ways to abuse the system. its been done many times even by the LN devs. so i dont see why anyone would try to bridge LN to anything unless LN tries to fix its flaws.so far LN is just a niche service for those that dont care about long term store of value security.more likely a completely different network would be created that bridges to bitcoin and other networks including a new stablecoin(doesnt have to specifically be tether brand)",

It's funny how others immediately post that it's not possible without double checking things first in the internet. Things are changing fast you know and experts won't stop until they come up with a better solution which can help improve the lives of the people.First, we have tron and the next one is this. I think this will attract more people to use tether and forget its flaws because the lightning network is much faster and cheaper compared to other networks. By the way, that taproot name is kinda familiar to me. I know it sounds like a rooting application for android phones lol but I don't know if they are from the same company.",
