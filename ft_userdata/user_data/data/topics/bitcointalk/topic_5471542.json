I don't care if Blackrock delists it permanently, I know that in 10 years the Bitcoin will be worth a lot more than it is now.

I know these tricks, I've seen them many times with shitcoins and \"fake listings\" where a currency pair appeared on some exchange and disappeared in a moment, but I managed to take a screenshot. The amount of FOMO has always driven the price up significantly. I just didn't expect such cheap tricks from such a large, regulated institution, but obviously I need to lower my expectations.2- \"That's so wrong\" for you, because you are the one who just get outplayed. For them, it's just a way to make a few million more. Perhaps part of a larger strategy to move the price from the point of accumulation to the point of distribution. Starting with the fake news from OCT 16, through the current manipulation by several others to set the price where they want and build hype to the level they need to book profits.3- At the moment, they do not have customers invested in Bitcoin through their instruments. that's what's at stake now (aproval of bitcoin ETF)4- Their here to scam us and make money. Get used to it. Thats their attitude:Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on November 22, 2021, 07:30:06 AM\"JPMorgan fined $1.26 billion for manipulating precious metals\" - https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/jpmorgan-fined-126-billion-for-manipulating-precious-metals-treasury-market\"JPMorgan slammed with $920m penalty\" - https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/9/29/bbjpmorgan-admits-spoofing-by-15-traders-2-desks-in-record-deal\"EU Fines Banks For Manipulating Currency Prices\" - https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2019/european-union-bank-fines-currency-manipulation/\"Deutsche Bank to Pay Over $130 Million to Settle Charges\" - https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/deutsche-bank-reaches-100-million-deal-to-settle-u-s-charges\"Deutsche Bank Fine for Silver Market Manipulation\" - https://www.swissbullion.eu/en/posts/deutsche-bank-fined-for-market-manipulationThats after 5 min research in google. I could find 5x more examples of manipulations using banks in next 20 min, internet is full of that, frauds of banks and regulated brokers that \"operates in a legal regime and all its activities are regulated by law\". And its always the same way. Banks don't fight those penalties. Each time someone catches their little deceptive hands they say \"ok, we will pay\". You want to know why? Because if they would try to argue someone will check them better and another even bigger muck will show up. They pay fine and continue the manipulation because they earn 10x more from manipulation than they pay in fines for fraud.",

You are right, they should take full responsibility for their acts, but I was going through from these terms and policy and they have mentioned there that such acts are not their problem, you will find this line on the first page and it has been bolded and oversized by them so that anyone can read it. Although I read that policy even before reading this topic, I read it yesterday to know the impact of DTCC on the overall market. But I did not find anything useful. This is not some kind of glitch, it is done on purpose, they first delisted it, and we can even see the archive of it, and after delisting they shut the website maybe due to overloading as you have said but I don't think the website was overloaded because the news was just out for like 1 hours maybe and it should have not got big traffic yet, but it is all just a manipulation of the market.They are misusing their authority, they should value their rank and the impact that they can make, Cointelegraph is better than DTCC as they took all the responsibility for the fake news from them and asked forgiveness.",

Overall, you guys can check for yourself too. The whole thing looks like a plan to manipulate the price of Bitcoin because I don't see why they would announce the listing of IBTC on Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), only to delist it and enlist it again. It was reported yesterday that it has been delisted, though I didn't bother to check but most crypto platforms reported about it and with screenshots.

I think they want to manipulate the price and by doing that they will delist it and then list it again. This only proves that it shouldn't be one platform or website that a person should check or use but more than one because some cases are the information is not always on positive side. My gut tells me that they are only aiming to earn lots of money just like those shitcoins.",

I don't think it is a coincidence but it is a plan that plays well by market makers.Every time Bitcoin needs to move after technical indicators were bend enough to a point for big movement, news and events like this come out. By that I believe no coincidence at all and market makers do all of these to convince us that Bitcoin has to rise up or has to fall down because of well-planned news.It was there since August 2023? I am not sure but let me check it with Wayback machine.Unfortunately, no snapshot in 2023 before October.The latest snapshot is in October 2022 but it is not what we need as evidence.https://web.archive.org/web/20221025035624/https://www.dtcc.com/products/cs/exchange_traded_funds_plain_new.php",

Then there will be tens of trillions of dollars pouring into the market and we will witness a crazy price increase.

Because let's just say 10 years have been passed and now is the time to book some seed profit or want an exit (just assume) but you are not keeping the track of economy and not listening to any of the news. Then you might not be able to get full benefit from the market. But you have already made up your mind that's why you don't keep awake at night.

Gary Gensler is not making any statements in against BTC instead he even don't consider it a security and will not make it one. They are going to make hell lot of money so why would they go against it. But they are forcing people to stop using decentralized platform, like the recent patriot act against BTC and mixers raises concerns.",
