It does not force anyone to come in neither does it bend to the will of slave masters and their slaves.. It's voluntary system and has to be used properly,according to it's good ideals.",

The press release clearly states that cryptocurrency is not supported by the government of Guatemala, and although they may be looking into it at to some extent in the back scenes, it doesn’t seem to yet have the required political support, thus falling pretty short in comparison to El Salvador.See (Google Translated):https://republica-gt.translate.goog/finanzas/se-pueden-usar-la-criptomonedas-en-guatemala-tienen-respaldo-legal-en-el-pais--202313112520?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp",

Bitcoin adoption and everything that happens around that country looks a little bit mystic for me.At first I thought that one or some gangs have El Salvador government by balls and they pushed their president to adopt a bitcoin in order to easily launder money, do illegal activities and move without cash, easily with bitcoin.Then I thought that maybe Bukele and people around him are corrupt too and in case they face sanctions from USA, etc, they will have zero problem because of bitcoin.But, I frequently read that Bukele is doing well, crime is declining, people feel better, economy is slightly but going up, they are opening Bitcoin Embassy in the USA and so on.Great, congrats!",

Several countries have their respective legal currencies, but although the dollar is not the official currency in many countries, it flows at a parallel currency rate.So do not come with stories of impositions, if you do not know how \"cobre/plata/billete\" moves through the region.Educate yourself well about the countries of the region, especially El Salvador and Central America, nowadays is an myth to think that, because you do not live in a region, you cannot know the country situation well.But the issue is that some confuse reading an article and five minutes of information, then to they already pretend be experts.Quote from: avikz on March 15, 2023, 01:09:23 PM...But still the Bukele government managed it properly and now enjoying their independence from US dollar. No! there is no such independence.So, it is the goal in the importance, hence, yes!,  bitcoin exists as a legal currency, but this does not imply independence. At least not now.__Finally, the matter should not refer to a country specifically when talking about bitcoin, since it circulates as a parallel currency in many countries (in the dark, in legality, in legal vacuums, etc. call it what you want, but circulate, flow bitcoin.)And! that is happening and it is not necessary to put borders or the name of a specific country.",
