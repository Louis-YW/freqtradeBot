Do not be wasteful but understand that this is life, and while you are in it, you have to be careful of not only living life to chase and keep money. While in the business of life, it is important to be alive and not just in existence. Be disciplined with your capital, but do not become parsimonious in the process.Invest first and enjoy from the profits of your investments, not enjoying first and then investing what is left. Invest in meaningful relationships with people who you know can make you better. An information from a friend who you have invested in and built a meaningful relationship with can change your life forever.",

You just can't save and invest enough if you don't have enough income to begin with. You can do the calculation for hours to allocate your small income, but it won't make it bigger. So the very first thing is to make sure you have a high income before you invest. If you don't, invest in yourself first by buying training and stuff, to boost your income level.",

      "body": "It all encapsulates inside what they call behavioural economics, the source of income largely has an effect on how you spend it. Those who work hard for their money will think twice before they squander it on things that are not worth it. And in yours, you called it either gimmicks or scams, so it has already spoken for itself. Those who earn money so easily or scammers are living large and the reason is obvious. They always believe they will get it back easily in the same way and mistake it for their own source of income, it's often late before they realise this.Personally, I don't waste my advice on scammers as I always wish they become broke, repent and learn from their mistakes. As for those who earn easily but still legitimately, they should learn a business or buy shares or properties instead of wasting it on frivolities.",

Many people are drawn to making cheap money by unscrupulous ways, but they don't realize that capital growth is the key to wealth. Open finance is changing the financial game. This is especially true for Bitcoin and other blockchain currencies. Instead of reading about financial markets, you should grasp cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is more than a digital coin due to its volatility, decentralization, and inflation resistance. A financial change, not just a digital coin. Your steps, especially not spending more than you earn and saving, will always work. They can be used to buy equities or satoshis. Respect all money, from pennies to Satoshis. But don't forget the change right in front of us. Accept, understand, and exploit it. If not, you'll lose money",

There is no 100% guarantee that any kind of investment asset will continue to go up, even Bitcoin, but especially stocks and bonds and stuff. In fact, the exact opposite might happen, and your investment value might go down. So do not rely on investments to bail out your expenses, and you must find work for that purpose.If anything, an investment is just an investment, that's all. Not a salary (unless you are also being paid shareholder dividends).",

The price of basic needs is increasing and you have to spend all you earn and even borrow to survive. To invest, one needs to cut so many expenses from our budget. Spending less on less important trivial needs and seeking other means of income is an option.I also agree that we should not underrate any money we have no matter how small. Some people feel that the money they spend on cigarettes, alcohol, snacks, and other wasteful spending is not relevant.

Learning is just the start but applying is the hardest part.

There are several factors that limit the ability of young people to develop capital, there are those who still follow their desire to live a glamorous life in an eccentric style, there are those who like to spend money in gambling establishments and have fun with their friends in nightclubs. They do all that because they don't have life dependents or their mindset is still just having fun.Of this percentage, there are still some young people who dedicate their lives to developing capital in various ways. Their mature mindset will save their life or be guaranteed when they are old with the wealth that has been accumulated over the years.",

The way one gets his money will determine how he will spend it. For example,if a gambler hits the jackpot,he will end up been broke after a short time because he will spend it back into gambling. Likewise,those who got their money through scam or in a dubious way will end up lavishing it on material things believing that they will have more tomorrow.

Honestly, not everyone's on board with having a life goal that's supposed to outshine the current state of affairs. Some folks are just kind of banking on things magically falling into place without really pushing for those uncertain somethings. But hey, every desire and wish needs a dose of action to balance things out.Having a big-time life goal demands a big-time effort too. When the hustle is real, that's when someone can start applying success smarts and spending their hard-earned cash wisely.Our job isn't just to be impressed, but at the very least, to take a leaf out of others' books on how they're chasing their dreams.",

Anyway, there are a lot of factors why youth are having a hard time to develop capital. It can be a personal factor or economic factor and such.

In this way, they can help people to make decisions with their money wisely. But, it is still our own responsibility. Quote from: FiveG on August 15, 2023, 04:21:30 AM1.
