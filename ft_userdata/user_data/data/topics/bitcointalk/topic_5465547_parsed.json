  "content": "People's lives have changed a lot since the advent of cryptocurrency. Investing in crypto in particular has produced enviable results for many. If a person improves, it contributes to the improvement of the society and at one point the country. At present Cryptocurrency is leading the world directly and indirectly which will be visible in the future. Today I will discuss the role of crypto in global financial development. How this cryptocurrency is helping the entire global economy.                                                                        Easy and cost-free transactions: Cryptocurrencies can be transacted more easily than banks. Due to its reliance on blockchain technology, there is virtually no comparable bank. Transactions can be completed with little cost. Another advantage is that transactions here cannot be deleted. So, all types of information are available. There is no room for cheating. You can make any transaction at any time.As a solution to hacking problems:The cryptocurrency industry is currently providing investors with excellent security options. Hacking is not possible using normally in blockchain technology. However, one must have a good understanding of how to operate these security options. A newbie must use crypto after gaining sufficient knowledge. Currently, the world's biggest companies have already taken all kinds of measures to use cryptocurrency.                                                                      Crypto banking benefits for poor countries:Currently, banking systems are in operation in all countries of the world. But customers of all countries are not getting full bank facilities, many of them are out of bank facilities. Cryptocurrency is a good option for them. They can profit by investing in crypto. He can enjoy this benefit from any part of the world. It is not just one person who is benefiting here. Through this, the country is making great progress. Developing countries are still lagging behind if they can implement it well then the country can become more developed quickly.Importance of crypto in financial activities: big companies of the world are now paying special attention to crypto. As a result, they are encouraged to invest in cryptocurrencies and some companies are already accepting their payments in crypto and thus they are growing more and more day by day. However, not all companies will approach this in the same way. A lot of companies that didn't get involved in crypto on their own terms are coming back.Cryptocurrencies are being discussed positively today due to various reasons. Although there are some downsides to it, if there are more good things ahead, they should definitely be prioritized. All in all, cryptocurrency will gain more public support in the future and will play an important role in all types of financial activities in the world. Do you think that within 2030 we will find crypto currency almost everywhere in the financial sector?",

What's powering the global economy, 400k transactions a day, and a market cap smaller than Norway's GDP?

Due to its reliance on blockchain technology, there is virtually no comparable bank. Transactions can be completed with little cost. Depends on where you live and what kind of transfer (not transactions as you don't transact banks!), if it's the same bank or national bank the banks win, if it's a transfer outside the country BTC wins, if there are large personal sums moving out of the country, you wouldn't want to be using banks at all.Quote from: Dimitri94 on September 03, 2023, 08:07:54 PMThe cryptocurrency industry is currently providing investors with excellent security options. Hacking is not possible using normally in blockchain technology. In theory, it is possible, not \"hacking\" but different types of attacks, also you shouldn't generalize, some shitcoins blockchains that are heavily centralized or rely on just a bunch of nodes are just as susceptible to attacks as banks, remember the DAO hack, the ETC attack and let's not even mention all the shitcoins that die each week because of bad programming.Quote from: BIT-BENDER on September 03, 2023, 08:27:49 PMHacking is very much possible in Crypto-currency there has been lots of times individuals wallet was hacked and the hackers made way with the individuals funds.

Bitcoin is easy and cost free transaction system, but when are they used. When sanction imposed over Russia, the country people used cryptocurrencies.

The world economy is on own it own looking at how bitcoin is going to be. The world is still afraid of cryptocurrency specifically bitcoin because of it decentralized nature and it value in the stock market. They are afraid that bitcoin might take over the economic system of the world and when that happens, it will affect their personal interests.Cryptocurrency has elevated plenty lower class people to middle class. And cryptocurrency is a threat to the fiat economy because of the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin network. Because the world leaders can not have access to the network to control the technology to favour themselves.",

That's still considered as a short time but we don't know what will actually happen. What we're just sure about with cryptos is that they're growing faster, especially with the main thing in this space which is Bitcoin. We might be getting the idea right now that many companies in the financial sector are have their share already on it. Some may go crazy as the others that's been known to be investing millions to billions. It is what it is but 7 years from now on, there could be a huge growth that we have never expected and the market will grow vastly and I'm optimistic with it which it goes with two halvings by that time.",

Developing countries are still lagging behind if they can implement it well then the country can become more developed quickly.The decentralized nature of Bitcoin gives everybody equal and free access to its network from any part of the world. With robust mobile and internet connectivity, India has one of the fastest-growing Fintech industries in the world. Yet about  22% of Indians are unbanked as of 2021 and a recent report put the number at 190 million people. Cryptocurrency indeed can be a banking option for them to save and also make some transactions. But it would be wrong to assume that cryptocurrency is the solution to all their economic problems. Cryptocurrency alone can not make an underdeveloped nation develop. We should understand that cryptos are alternative currencies and investments but not a quick-fix economic development tool. QuoteDo you think that within 2030 we will find cryptocurrency almost everywhere in the financial sector?Currently, cryptocurrency is a big player in the global financial system since it is used either directly or indirectly in many parts of the world. To challenge the progress of the crypto industry many central banks have introduced CBDCs. These CBDCs have similar qualities to altcoins due to their centralized nature, but none can be decentralized like Bitcoin. So for anyone to enjoy the true benefit of privacy and security Bitcoin is the only option. With the recent improvement in bitcoin awareness and adoption, by 2030 more nations, corporations, and individuals will embrace the technology but I doubt if it will spread to everywhere in the world. Most nations might still be lagging due to stringent laws and infrastructural deficits.",

Overall, the cryptocurrency industry has huge potential and if we exploit and focus on developing it seriously, it will play an important role in the future economy. But I agree with your realistic assessment, currently cryptocurrency is just a speculative market so it is not entirely correct to say that it will have a positive impact on the economy. Apart from bitcoin, which can become a means of payment, the rest of the market is purely speculative, with no real applications or use cases. So, to be fair, cryptocurrencies haven't brought much impact to the national economy, let alone the world.",
