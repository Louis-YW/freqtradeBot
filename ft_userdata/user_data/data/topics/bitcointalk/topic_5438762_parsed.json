They have video tutorials too which can make learning about spot, future and other trading types easier. You will have to learn more about indicators from external articlesRead more on risk management, very important. Do not use the amount of money you can not afford to lose to trade. For start, use very low amount of money that is even less than the amount of money that you can afford to lose to trade.",

Also don't rush to put up some amount to invest on your trades learn more first to sharpen up your skills and also read up the links and suggestions provided by fellow user on this thread since that is helpful for your future trading career.",

      "body": "My question is that are you sure that trading terminologies is the main challenge that you have because I have not heard such complaint from traders. What I believe is that every field of life has its own terminologies and you need to study and understand the field before you get to know the terminologies there in that field. So by the time you are learning and studying the field, you also get to understand the terminologies naturally. Likewise in trading field, you won't be outside and try to understand everything that goes on in trading, if you start learning through demo practice then you can natural understand them but if you want to understand it without being a trader then you will have more time to understand it because you won't be meeting them often. Well some of those terms I think are bull, bear, rally etc. You can also learn more from this board.",

You must gain experience in learning methods of analyzing markets and trading, and there are many resources on the Internet that will help you with that, such as books, websites, videos, etc. Also, you should focus on market terminology and trading terminology and tools and understand them well, and you should get acquainted with risk management orders, as they will help you identify places to enter and exit the market without falling into potential risks and avoid entering into losing deals and buying currencies that cause a lot of hype in the market, Trading cryptocurrency is an easily hard for many beginners, and it has many positives and negatives, so I advise you to avoid falling into the trap of the negative and invest in the positives to make a profit.",

Many people have suggested this to you before my post, including the names of the exchanges. After that it is important to know all the terms of that exchange, because many times newbie traders have to suffer big problems due to not reading these terms. And the most important thing is this, learn as much as you can about the crypto market because if you fail to do market analysis then all your previous knowledge will be wasted. Market analysis is most important to be a successful trader.",

If he maps out 2hrs a day for trading tuition online and learning the meaning of the terminologies he'll achieve a lot before 30 days and his questions here would improve as well.",

He doesn't explain much but he looks like a guy who wants to get into trading because he wants to make easy money, when it's very difficult, there are very few who make money consistently and it requires knowledge and dedication that he doesn't seem to have. I would rather take advantage of the forum to acquire general information about bitcoin, and consider whether to invest for the long term. If he decides to trade in the end anyway, let it be with more knowledge than he seems to have.",

It’s normal to feel like an imposter in the first few weeks, we all have been there. I encourage newbies to find a particular area of the forum to focus on, You have a genuine reason for being here since you’re interested in developing your crypto trading skills I suggest you frequent  Trading Discussion. There are lots of useful information you will find there from experienced members. Your poll is kinda confusing, bitcoin trading has nothing to do with merits I assume you meant “how to grow in bitcointalk”. I will say don’t worry too much about merits, it’s easier for newbies to get merits nowadays.",
