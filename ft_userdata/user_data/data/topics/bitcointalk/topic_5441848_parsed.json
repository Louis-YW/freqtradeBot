  "content": "Proudly Nigerian here, I have read a lot and ask question about hardware wallet too, I am now fully ready to make my first purchase of a hardware wallet,  the problem I am facing is the official hardware wallet says they don't support my location. I want to ask 1. Is it safe to ship the hardware wallet to my cousin in the UK and he will send it back to me in Nigeria or this is a good idea? I read that it's safer to buy from official than going to third-party store,  I don't want something malicious inserted in the hardware wallet,  waiting for my first deposit into the wallet. 2. I am sure that we have Nigerian on here, how do you guys get your hardware wallet? How do you order for one and get shipped down to Nigeria?",

Which hardware wallet are you buying? Just to let you know if the company producing the hardware wallet can be able to ship to Nigeria, or to check for official reseller that can ship to Nigeria.",

Or if you get stuck, I think you should ask your cousin for help, never buy hardware wallets from third party stores.",

This is safe because this is just another form of drop shipping. I’m not from Nigeria but I this when I bought my first hardware wallet before there’s official reseller here in my country become available.Buying on official store is indeed safer that buying on random guy that reselling this item without license since they might tampered the hardware that will put your investment at risk. If you don’t have any way to ship directly the hardware wallet to hour house then doing this method is your safest way assuming that you can trust your cousin in UK.",

All countries seems support location for purchasing hardware wallet although your country have banned Bitcoin.Usually each country have store official and you can buy there without need to import from other countries, but will be highest values than official store with your hardware wallet to buy.",

I would like to know if there is a hardware wallet shipment system in Nigeria with Bangladesh?It is true that cryptocurrencies are banned in Bangladesh, but I was surprised that Trezor support sending to your country, I also later checked Ledger Nano lists of unsupported countries, I could not see your country among as well. If you have tried to order hardware wallet from a hardware wallet company to Bangladesh and not able to, I mean if the hardware wallet is returned back to the manufacturer, maybe it is possible to buy one from a neighboring country.",

It should be sure if he makes a purchase for hardware wallet from official shop or from UK resellers, and then send you the unopened package.Anything can happen in customs, but you can always confirm if wallet is authentic or not, and generate brand new seed words for your wallet.You can also make your own alternative DIY signing device (krux, seegsigner, diy trezor), or you can use old smartphone as offline wallet (if you remove sim card and turn on airplane mode).",

I read that it's safer to buy from official than going to third-party store,  I don't want something malicious inserted in the hardware wallet,  waiting for my first deposit into the wallet.I used the same logic when I bought my hardware wallet so instead buying it from a computer store in the city I live I ordered it directly from company but then unfortunatelt that Ledger data leak happened and some of my info went public. So, there are certain risks in doing it either way. Quote from: Z390 on March 02, 2023, 12:52:28 PMI am sure that we have Nigerian on here...You obviously didn't know, but you guys recently got your local board so that's also a very good place to ask something specific to Nigerians, like in thia case.",
