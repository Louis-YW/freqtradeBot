      "body": "Most EU countries allow gambling in one way or the other.My advice for you is to go through the TOS of some gambling sites, look for the European Union countries that are restricted and research more on them. Most of gambling sites will have almost the same countries that they restrict. Use the gambling sites that have official threads on this forum to do that.",

      "body": "Well why do you need an EU country first?Most online casinos here that operate with crypto are friendly enough to offer us the same if not better than what those EU casinos like bet365 offer,in fact in here no one will disable your account for winning like bet365 does and it is a common procedure that they freeze your account as soon as you hit 3000-4000 EUR profit.So when all of these other huge casinos offer us much better than that why bother in the first place asking and checking which EU country is friendly for overseas gambling?",

I'm sure the sports there are also found on Stake.com.  If I had to move there to EU myself, I'd probably just choose the cheapest country to live in. Pretty sure not a single country banned crypto casino.",

I think bet365 is headquartered in Stoke-on-Trent, this would have made UK a good choice if they had not exited the European Union. Other places that could serve as good alternatives include Gibraltar and Malta if you may not like Romania and Kosovo.",

These include Georgia, Sri Lanka, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain, UK, USA and Panama.\"...\"In some of them, there are prohibitions inside their own jurisdictions, so that citizens cannot engage with local operators.

From my own experience, these types of cases should not be avoided.Casinos are very good, they are antgups and they have a great skill to be able to accept people from all over the world, we have stake.com, and we have bitcasiono.io that accepts the VPN, for people in the USA we have stake.us that Mostly there are many problems for them to be able to accept online casinos in the USA, it is very banned, I don't know what reason makes them able to keep it that way, but those are restrictions that make no sense to me, that is why crypto casinos never offer any. circumstance they should accept the condition of banning countries.",
