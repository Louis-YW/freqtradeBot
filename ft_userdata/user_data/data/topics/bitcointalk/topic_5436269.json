  "content": "It's true that despite the negative reputation that crypto assets have, they have been performing well in the beginning of 2023. Bitcoin, as an indicator of the overall crypto market, has risen 27% since the start of the year, while the S&P 500 has only risen 2.6% and gold has risen 5.4%. However, it's important to remember that the crypto market is still in a bear market and the bottom has not been reached yet. The editor of Daily, Teeka Tiwari, is a long-term bull on crypto but he advises caution and patience in the current market. He believes that there are several negative factors that need to be worked through before the long-term rally can restart.It's important to be aware of these negative stories and to not let the bear market trap you.It's also worth noting that the crypto market is still relatively small, so it's not necessary to make large investments to see significant returns as the market improves. It's recommended to be cautious and to focus on incredible buying opportunities when they arise. Despite the current market conditions, the future of crypto remains promising, with institutions like Fidelity launching new bitcoin products and more favorable regulations in countries like Brazil. Over the long-term, the outlook for crypto is positive.More info at cryptocartel.co",

The best thing right now is to DCA even if one has large amounts to pump into it. An every 3 days or weekly DCA could actually help this period.

Yeah some self acclaimed experts will come out with price predictions or some will try to put investors off accumulating bitcoin. We might be having a test of rise of rice now but this isn’t bull period yet. If the tag “cryptos will continue to flourish is only related to bitcoin I would agree but for some other coins I don’t think would continue. Most of them will fall off after a huge rise and luring some altcoin investors into buying them. I don’t see them coping with the trend when bitcoin starts to rise in bull period, these coins rising are all bull traps most especially the ones of the top 10 altcoin chart",

      "body": "If we always exercise caution even if the opportunity already presented itself, we will never really get to something and we'll only regret not doing grabbing these opportunities in the future. You'll never know if we've already hit the bottom or it's just that the price is low. That's why DCA is a great buying technique to use when you want to be in the game long term. If you only buy when the price is rising, you'll really have a hard time convincing yourself and analyzing whether the buy is good or not. But if you halt into buying no matter the price, you'll never have the coins and you'll never reap the rewards when it starts to rain.",

Until the confirmation is there that we're on a bull run then we're on it. But as of now, the market is still uncertain, yes we see some ups but that doesn't verify yet if it's going to be stable there for a long time. Unlike with the $16k mark and $18k, it had stayed there for quite a while determined that it was likely the bottom of it. Right now, proceeding is the typical response we'll give to it but those that are scared of the volatility of it should think first before taking the risk.",
