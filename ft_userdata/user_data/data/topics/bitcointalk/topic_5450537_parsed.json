It’s very rare to see an 80% win rate tipster because the average win rate is 60% to 70% only. Probably you are looking for an exclusive tipster that doesn’t provide picks most often just to maintain this kind of win rate. There’s no existing tipster like this here and most user here is not confident using this kind of services. You best place to find this kind of service offered is on other forum that has a huge community for sport betting. Bitcointalk forum tipster is not that popular service here.",

You won't find what you're looking for (fixed matches) so easily, because if such matches exist (and they do exist), big money is made there, and no one shares them online or sells them for a few hundred dollars.From my experience with such things, no one will let you verify such things for free, you always have to pay in advance, and in case the bet is successful, they usually ask you to pay another part of the won prize.",

If I have the data of fixed match, Why would I sell it to a random user while I can take a loan and bet on it without a problem that someone leaks my income.I wonder who’s in the right mind that has fixed match that will trade a golden info like this for a measly subscription fee. Nothing is impossible but you should choose a better place to hunt this kind of service because this is not being fetched randomly.

There are still people who make money out of that scheme, but of course they are good with their analyses that they are giving to their clients, otherwise they won't be successful.To wrap it up, tipsters could be legitimate or fraud. But in case you found yourself having one, make sure to utilize the information they have given to you. Try to think critically about their suggestions and then decide if you should follow it or not.

Yes, some may perfectly hit and win, but most of them still fail to win.

The forum you are talking about, is not ask gambling but askgamblers. And it is nearly impossible to find a very good tipster because I have seen most tipsters doing the following:- They remove the lost bets from their history (channel)- They don't show their actual win % (based on the previous point)- They advertise fake things about themselves to get new gamblers to sign up for their VIP groups and other services, but in the end, gambler loses even in their VIP group and they take no responsibility for thatYou said 70%, I bet that a gambler who can make that much is wealthier than over 90% gamblers who lose more than even 50% of their capital. A tipster is also a human, and he can only predict based on research and 'assumption', and wait for the results. I was once a bettor of horse racing and I followed many tipsters, not one of them had even 50% win rate after I tallied their overall results after following them.",
