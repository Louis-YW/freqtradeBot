And for you to make sure others sees your thread you must keep bumping so the thread will appear on the top page of the board.Quote from: [CTM] CryptoTrafficMarket on October 16, 2023, 01:02:07 PM3) BITCOINTALK FORUM- We will create an engaging ANN (Announcement) forum topic for your project.- Daily posts and a minimum of 5 daily interactions will be managed to maintain continuous activity. Your topic will always be among the top threads.When it comes to advertising in this forum, ANN alone will not get you much traffic compared to when your using a signature campaign or a review to attract forum members. And besides making topic among the top thread isn't your doing but rather the choice of other forum members.",

Unless a member before me pumps the topic, it will not be ranked in advance or among the TOP TOPIC. Promotion does not necessarily require the presence of the advertisement, but rather the professionalism in publishing it, as I do not find that you have experience or a team in preparing a visual identity or at least some illustrative forms.

It's also a fantastic opportunity to save on your marketing investment.Best regards,CTM TeamIf you are looking for customers, analyze whether your product is being approached properly. I'm all for offering marketing services from some developers in the crypto space, but not in a spammy way on every platform.Furthermore, if you look at this service, I think the target audience will also be very narrow, because today's startups work very professionally and sometimes stereotypically, so product marketing is always an important part of any crypto.",
