  "content": "Hello everyone,Sorry for this being my first post here.I'm trying to get access back to my crypto. Com account since Friday. The support is useless as there was none.What happened was, I was checking my crypto as always and out of a sudden the app logged me out and whenever I try to login it gives me the following message: Error code: Auth restricted. After exchanging few emails with their automated AI assistant and providing them with a selfie and other info I been told I will get a reply soon and they stopped replying. Around 2k in crypto is just gone with no support to help. Can anybody recommend me what to do?Â  I used crypto com for over a year and this has never happened before. Thanks.",
