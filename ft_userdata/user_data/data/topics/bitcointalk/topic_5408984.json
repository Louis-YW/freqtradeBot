  "content": "Recently El Salvador confirmed bitcoin magnets tourists to the nation. Claims bitcoin attracted 1.1 million visitors in 6 month was opposed by the wall street journal, saying most visitors never used bitcoin in the bitcoin beach and other stores that accepted bitcoin in the country. Given an example of a small bohemian hotel “Lagarza\" owned by Daniel García, who confirmed only 15 bitcoin transaction since it became a legal tender in the country. He went further saying that most visitors in the country paid with bitcoin to brag, though, it was made known in the article that, some vendors in El Salvador don't have a bitcoin wallet. And the country need to teach citizens how to transact with bitcoin to enable swift transaction. What could have attracted cryptocurrency tourists to El Salvador if not bitcoin?

The article on Cointelegraph says 'last year' but also refers to it as 2019, which must be some sort of mistake.Needless to say, if 1.1 million is a total figure, it certainly can't all be attributed to Bitcoin (and from what I've seen, it's not). And if last year is 2021 (not 2019), then the increase can be easily attributed to relaxation of covid policies. In 2019, El Salvador had 2.64 million tourists. It doesn't seem like this year will beat that, even.",

Having said that, the people that visit El Salvador do it for other reasons than Bitcoin, Bitcoin isn't widely accepted but there are one or two places one can spend them in their own country instead of travelling to El Salvador to do so. El Salvador have invested in Bitcoin so they can prolly make ROI in the long run.",

What they did with bitcoin perhaps helped with their PR, and introduced them to a lot of people that never knew them before. Perhaps what happened is that people got curious with El Salvador because of bitcoin, but after some careful research they went there because the country has something to offer which attracted them. A few percentage of those tourists may have actually traveled there because of bitcoin, but to say that a lot of them went there due to that fact is, IMO, reaching.",

That country is far from the security that an average European is used to, but maybe it's less of a problem for tourists from the US, to whom gangs and violence are nothing strange.",

      "body": "Bukele is attributing the results due to bitcoin, surf and the crackdown on gangs. Nevertheless, though these factors likely weigh-in to some extent, there is no real evidence that they do, nor to the extent that each one applies. The World Tourism Barometer report give El Salvador a 6% increase in tourism earnings over data from 2019. 2019 is used as a reference pre-pandemic reference base, thus this increase is seen as a sign of recovery. This other document from the UNWTO gives El Salvador a -1% decrease in tourism arrivals vs 2019 (see slide on page 15).All the above, albeit not being much in terms of depth, suggests that tourism in El Salvador is essentially as it was before the pandemic, but does not reflect a boost of any kind compared to 2019 that we could say is heavily influenced by bitcoin. Logically on a personal scale we’d find hundreds of testimonials pointing to them using bitcoin there and having fun in the country, but that does not seem like something to extrapolate as being a core driver in recovering pre-pandemic figures, and it certainly does not seem to show in terms of a boost up from 2019 figures.",
