  "content": "Currently bitcoin volatility is still very high with price movements up and down in the $20k-22k price area.In this high-voltage condition, the reactions of the respective market participants towards the purchase of bitcoins, especially the Whales and some large investors, can be seen.A number of different holdings seem to have reacted differently in this condition of vitality. Not only whales, Bitcoin investors under 1BTC also make purchases regularly.From a data report made by Glassnode, which is one of the world's leading Crypto Analysis companies, small and small investors have recorded significant Bitcoin purchases in June 2022 and even the most aggressive purchases since March 2020.It was noted that small investors on average made purchases of 36,750 BTC per month until June 2022 with a total ownership of 1.12 million BTC in small investors or about 5.33% of the total Bitcoin supply.This indicates that retail investors who are generally considered small investors still seem to believe in the future of bitcoin.While Whales according to Glassnode data make purchases of 140,000 BTC per month until June 2022, there is an estimate from On Chain data that whales currently own about 45.6% of the entire Bitcoin supply.Also looking at IntoTheBlock Data, by looking at even bigger Wahles with 100,000 BTC holdings also made significant purchases.It can be seen that whales who have Bitcoin above 100,000 Bitcoin experienced an increase in purchases of 17.16%.And from the data it can be seen that the big wahles currently control around 779.550 BTC or about 4.08% of the total bitcoin in existence.This proves that from small investors to big investors still believe in the future of bitcoinsource: https://app.intotheblock.com           https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2022/           https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1544352880123170817",

The whole world is yet to utilize this financial liberation but how?how bout its priotized limitations?N/B objections from anyone is welcome but not without certainty; alot of ignorant minds are reading this.voice of the peopleSandra",

This metric, as some Twitter commentators already pointed out, probably reflects a lack of trust in the exchange's solvency, rather than an actual demand for coins. The existence of whales, a difficult-to-measure group of buyers, certainly raises the price, but their weighting isn't made public.",

Of course, they and all of us here should, if big companies and a country have the courage to invest bitcoin why not for smaller one if the whole point of investing is to get profit even in this current times Smaller ones just needs to learn that no need to hurry and avoid panicking when a sudden dump happens its part of the risk if so better to go traditional investments instead.",

It is just in their nature.Trust is indeed associated with investors or long-term holders, and they are starting to hold bitcoins again today. On previous ATH as you said maybe they have sold it and bought again in the current price range. Those small investors believe to make more profit if buying in the current position. But it's different from Whales who have more Bitcoin up to more than 100,000 BTC.Quote from: Husires on July 08, 2022, 02:12:08 PMI became less confident in Glassnode's data, for several months and their data continues to show that we are in a good position and more cash flow is coming, but the negative data is much more than the positive they are trying to distribute.I am not saying that their data is wrong, but it is wrong to rely on them in taking investment steps.Do not rely on any data, you only need to rely on your own mind to choose and sort out which information or data is really appropriate. More negative data will not be good, but more positive data will make bitcoin better.The data presented is presented as is and there are many other crypto data analysis companies that you can compare. We have to be smarter and don't just rely on one data.",

Most of time, it will be delayed like fhe end of last bear market.The pandemic occurs suddenly and a crash in March 2020 is insane. It blows minds of every model builders but after that event, Bitcoin moves back on track and a bull run begins.On chain data in this crisis time must be used to combine with social, geopolitcial, army problems to make a guess on how Bitcoin will move in future of this bear market.",

Maybe it just seems that way to me, but the increase in the cost of living has forced many to change their strategies when it comes to finances - in other words, inflation has taken away from many the part of the money they used for investments.",

Because bitcoins are kept in the exchange to make it easier for people to sell. But when it is moving out, it usually means, it is going towards a long term storage somewhere safer than exchanges.

Those company shares pay out a dividend of profit sometimes every three months, those dividends buy more shares so in 3 months time your dividend payout increases. So you have money making more and more money, what does it matter to you if you drop a few million into a risky asset class? No big deal if it goes to zero with all your other investments going strong. That's why the average user should not put too much faith in what the whales happen to be able to afford.",
