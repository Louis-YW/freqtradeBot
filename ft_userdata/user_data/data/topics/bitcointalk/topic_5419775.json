  "content": "I've been scouring through my old hard drives to find an old wallet containing some BTC I purchased many years ago, 8-10 years ago approximately. Most were formatted and some were damaged. After 2 months and searching through 7 old drives, I finally managed to recover what looks like a wallet.dat file using the method outlined in this old thread below. I would have done this years ago if I knew deleted data is possible to recover. But I am not very technical. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25091.0Note, I tried several different ways to search for the wallet, and that is the only method that managed to recover something. Here are the challenges I am facing and need your help to understand if recovery will be possible. 1- This particular hard drive unfortunately was formatted at some point. I have no idea what else it might have gone through, but the recovery tool posted by @makomk managed to recover 1 key, and it generated a .dat file with it. 2- Loading the wallet.dat into Bitcoin Core gives me a corrupt wallet error. Using the -salvagewallet command in bitcoin-wallet.exe did not work. 3- The wallet size is concerning, it is only 16KB. The -salvagewallet tool doubled the file's size for some reason. And after some googleing, I found that wallets are typically 100KB and up.4- Opening the recovered wallet with a Hex editor I can find some clues that this is possibly the wallet I am looking for. I found sequence 0201010420, but its followed by zeros. Also found the sequence 03 6b 65 79 41 and KeyA, which is also followed by zeros. According to this detailed French guide https://www.radjaidjah.org/index.php?post/2014/09/07/Sauver-ses-bitcoins-de-la-corruption these are relevant to a BTC wallet. I'm not technical or knowledgeable enough to know whether these sequences are related to something else or not, and this could be something other than my lost wallet.  With all the above in mind, a few questions come to mind.1- Could this be a partially recovered wallet since the sequences mentioned above are all followed by zeros, file size is too small, and the hex file is generally empty?2- The wallet is possibly encrypted and hex editor will not reveal any keys? 3- Has the wallet file been partially overwritten? 4- Are there any other methods I can use to rescan and extract the wallet file?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

I used Recuva and Rstudio so far, and several other recovery software that managed to recover no files at all. 3- I ran the pywallet script but it does not generate any new wallet files, nor does it give any errors in the CMD prompt. I will attempt another scan with Rstudio using a custom extension XML I found online that targets specifically BTC wallets. I am also considering running the search and recovery option in Pywallet. Besides this, I am stuck for now and do not know if I can find someone trustworthy enough to work on the recovery. If there is anything you recommend I do please let me know.",

Do you mind creating a new clone drive again and repeat the procedure to recover the wallet.dat file? This time make sure to use other software to recover them and other tools to create a new clone copy of your disks like Acronis, ghost, or Clonezilla. I suggest burn a Hiren's BootCD or BartPE. It has  many tools to use to clone and recover deleted files.",

Bad news, pywallet didn't manage to print anything after nearly a whole day search.Good news, I ran the corrupt wallet command using pywallet on the file I initially found using the other tool, and it managed to pull a public address and what looks like a private key. Now this isn't the wallet I am looking for as it only has .03 btc, the one I'm looking for has more (glad I at least found something after all, its worth $300-400 so worth getting recovered), but when I input the key in Bitcoin Core, I get \"Invalid private key encoding (code -5)\".The private key I have starts with a 5 and is 51 characters.Did some googling but none of the solutions I found worked.

It managed to find one wallet, but it was corrupted.Then I used pywallet to dump the keys from the corrupted wallet.dat file that was found. In the wallet.text file that pywallet generated, I found this 51 character key, along with an address. The address is valid and had one transaction as per blockchain explorer all the way back from 2011. Its a miniscule amount, though worth recovering as I am taking this as a learning experience incase I find the real missing wallet.So not sure where things have gone wrong in the process, potentially the wallet.dat is incomplete or partially overwritten and pywallet generates an incorrect key because of this. For all I know the address could be incorrectly generated as well. But what are the odds of generating a random public address that has some balance  . I have no records of this address but it suits the timeline for the wallet I was originally looking for but not the amount.",
