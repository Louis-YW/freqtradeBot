Any random guy can have a blue tick now & I don’t see anything good that you get for it.I have actually seen memes of people making fun of dudes who pay for the blue tick. I definitely won’t be getting one.",

I think check mark is the more popular, Americanised term but yeah, it’s commonly referred to Blue Tick by people in the UK.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_verification",

So, I do not think that paying the eight dollars a month is worth it at all for a regular person like me. I do think that for businesses it is worth purchasing the Twitter Blue subscription. This way, Twitter can provide a better resource of news and get rid of lying people.",
