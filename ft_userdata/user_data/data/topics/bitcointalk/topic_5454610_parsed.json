  "content": "We know how crazy the last couple of weeks have been with the network congestion and transaction fees. Even some signature campaign managers have had to open it up for the participants to choose whether they want to be paid monthly or biweekly. This was one of the solutions to reduce the time it took for a transaction to confirm and save some costs. For participants of other signature campaigns who didn't have this option, they had to wait two (2) to three (3) days before their payment arrived.While browsing the service board, I came across a user's post advertising a free or paid bitcoin transaction accelerator (please note that the purpose of this topic is not to discuss the user's reputation; I am indifferent to that. However, I noticed that no reputable member has interacted with the thread). In simple terms, a bitcoin transaction accelerator is used to speed up the confirmation rate of transactions.My questions are:First, do bitcoin transaction accelerators actually work as they claim, or is it just hype? Second, aside from bitcoin transaction accelerator services, are there manual ways to speed up transactions? Third, does using a bitcoin transaction accelerator reduce the high transaction fees during network congestion, as we experienced?",

Third, does using a bitcoin transaction accelerator reduce the high transaction fees during network congestion, as we experienced? Yes they do AFAIK. Some in their description tell you that they only rebroadcast your transaction, ViaBTC helps to include transactions into their blocks for mining, for free submissions it has to be below a certain size and the tx fees have to be above a certain sat/vbyteThe only way is to bump the fee paid on the transaction if RBF is enabled. You can take a proactive step to consolidate your inputs when fees are low so the feerate on it is low even when the mempool is full.No, it does not reduce the transaction fees it only helps to accelerate transactions already in the mempool- Jay -",

But because ViaBTC has not mined for long, I knew it will be very soon that ViaBTC will soon mine a block and it mined the next second block. So it depends too.",

Second, aside from bitcoin transaction accelerator services, are there manual ways to speed up transactions? Third, does using a bitcoin transaction accelerator reduce the high transaction fees during network congestion, as we experienced? 1. One can work as it claims and one can scam. Overall, bitcoin transaction accelerators have relationship with mining pools and if you pay the service fee, they'll include your transaction in the next block they mine.2. Manual ways are to use a wallet that support Replace By Fee function and make transaction from this wallet or your second option is Child Pays For Parent. In this case, the receiver can pay higher fee but receive less satoshis. It works like, imagine I send 1BTC to you but fee isn't enough, so, you use Child Pays For Parent option, pay 0.1BTC in fees from that transaction and finally you receive 0.9 Bitcoin.3. Bitcoin transaction accelerators always cost more than network fees, that's why they make money. If the recommended minimum fee is 100 sat/vByte to get transaction confirmed in 1 hour but 150 sat/vByte gets your transaction confirmed in next block and your transaction has 50 sat/vByte fee, be sure that transaction accelerator services will charge you way more than 150 sat/vByte.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on May 31, 2023, 09:14:15 AM3.

Therefore, High fees is only problem for users who use it periodically for daily transactions that are less than the transaction fee or are repeated several times a day.The outputs are many and some managers can send the coin from more than one address which adds to the transaction fee. When bitcoin mempool was above 300 sat/vbyte, campaign managers complained, they use high fee and the transaction took time to confirmed after paying more than $100 or $200. If there is any need, I can look for some transactions like that. Example of a campaign that asked their participants about what to do is this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5451232.msg62224465#msg62224465What can help is for the campaign manager to use either RBF or CPFP like Bestchange did. Participant in a campaign can not use CPFP because the fee will take all the coin send to the participant, it may even require more fee because the transaction weight of such transaction is huge. In one of Royse777 campaign, SFR10 did something like that using his his own coin paid to do CPFP.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434037.msg62173376#msg62173376",

Therefore, High fees is only problem for users who use it periodically for daily transactions that are less than the transaction fee or are repeated several times a day.Yeah, I have the same question because I have never heard a campaign manager to ask the users to wait for a month to receive their payments. Our signature campaigns have been working on the basis of weekly payments since the start and I have never seen a campaign whose payments are done on monthly basics. The campaign managers have been sending the payments even in the congested networks and they are well aware of the conditions of the network. They even pay higher fees sometimes when the network is congested.@OP, the only trusted accelerator service known in this forum and is currently working to accelerate the transactions is the ViaBTC txaccelator. The best thing about their service is that it's totally free and anyone can use it to accelerate the stuck transactions. The only drawback with their system is that users can accelerate up to 100 transactions within a hour. But, I personally think that 100 transactions is far more for such a service and only few people know about it and use it on daily or weekly basis.I think other pools should also offer such services for the advanced users because such service could be very helpful in the times of network congestion. I hope that in coming days other pools might consider offering such acceleration service for free, and the users whose transactions are stuck could get accelerated even if Via BTC txaccelator gets busy sometimes in speeding up of transactions.",
