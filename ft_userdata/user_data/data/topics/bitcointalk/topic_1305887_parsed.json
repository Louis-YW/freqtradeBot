Grabbed all unique public keys in the blockchain and placed them in a local Database2. Coded an app to generate private keys from Bigints (Both compressed an uncompressed) with multiple RNG types3. For each PVK generated the app checks the Database for a possible public address match4. A txt file is created with the PVK and Public address in case of a match5. I will run the app for the next 464656656565656566565646367618239128323718298319239129309 years to see if I get any good addresses ))I got dozens of used addresses but they were all empty already.Also did with dictionary attack and got dozens of used addresses, all empty also.",
