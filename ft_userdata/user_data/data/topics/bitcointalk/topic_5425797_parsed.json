How are they making money?I mean it's damn hard to build a crypto wallet that's secured but where is the money coming from? Closed-source wallets may charge a fee every time a customer makes a transaction, and this fee is so small that it goes unnoticed. Depending on the number of users of such a wallet and their overall activity, the revenue may fluctuate significantly. Moreover, given that users or other developers cannot inspect the codebase of a closed-source wallet, it enables wallet creators to conduct malicious activities that also go unnoticed; for example, they are collecting and selling user data with information about senders and receivers, their balances, and their location. In other words, in the case of closed-source \"free\" wallets, you are seen as a product, and you are sold as a product. On the other hand, the business model of open-source software is pretty straightforward and transparent: in most cases, it simply doesn't exist because all contributions to the codebase are absolutely voluntary. Some wallets, especially those providing CoinJoin and other mixing services, may collect a fee for facilitating transaction obfuscation, but this is the exception rather than the rule.",

Some wallets operate free as it's just a medium to see how much cryptocurrency we've got on the block chain ledger and they provide keys that enable users to access their coins in the ledger. That's why with your key you can redeem coin in any wallet. Since we all are marketers one way or the other, an app that generates huge traffic or has lots of users will definitely venture into affiliate marketing and make some profits. Some wallets get commission for swapping coins through shapeshift and other do get commission for referring users to buy a particular hardware wallet. https://hackernoon.com/the-business-model-of-crypto-wallets-89aeed8322dc",

It works like an exchange that when user invites a lot, there are other who will use the app as well and this will increase their user base. Im not sure if there is really an additional fee aside from the on chain transaction being imposed here cause we can see the transaction and confirm in the explorer, I dont see any ads too when using it so it will be coming from trading fees ans transaction fees.",

You are thinking either of multi-currency wallets or custodial clients. And those exchange features that are supported by such wallets, aren't usually natively developed by them. It's part of a partnership with a 3rd-party. The two most popular bitcoin wallets, Bitcoin Core and Electrum don't have internal exchanges, for example. It's interesting that Electrum doesn't even have a donation address. Not one that I am familiar with at least. The wallet's developer, ThomasV suggested a long time ago they don't request donations, and suggested to donate to those operating Electrum servers instead.Quote from: ThomasV on June 18, 2014, 11:09:22 AMThank you for your support. I usually do not request donations for myself, because I do not think it is an effective way to incentivise free software. Developers who request bounties tend to finish projects quickly, and do not really care about long-term maintenance.However, you you can donate to the people who run public Electrum servers. Electrum does relies on servers, and we currently lack an effective way to reward the server operators.Also note that I created a company that will distribute Electrum, sell paying services to Electrum users, and fund further development of the Electrum software.On the other hand, Bitcoin Core's donation address has received over 13 BTC in donations in the last 2 years alone in over 1000 transactions.",

You need to read what others people posted before you, like what OmegaStarScream and ETFbitcoin posted. Example, that is Electrum wallet, the fee belongs to miners, not Electrum developers.",

That's because you are depositing to Binance, and there are no deposit fees on that exchange. If you make a trade with those coins, Binance will charge you trading fees. If you withdraw them, they will charge you withdrawal fees.

You are forgetting one very important way to make money for exchanges: listing fees for altcoins and shitcoins. Those aren't cheap. It's the dream of every altcoin developer to get listed on Binance because they know the amount of traffic and trading activity that takes place on that exchange. Unless the coin has strong fundamentals (many don't), where Binance sees it as an advantage to add support for it on their platform, they will negotiate with the devs and charge them a hefty listing fee.",
