If you are so certain that you want to risk your livelihood on something where the odds aren't truly 100%, that would be unwise. If the odds are actually 100% and there is provably 0% chance of losing...then why not. The outcome is certain? This is entirely unrealistic though",

I think that would be much more interesting.",

If it's just someone who overheard that the fight is a fixed fight, then probably just 10%. But this is if I see people are actually betting on that team as well. When it's a fixed fight people usually know but still leave doubt like Ngannou vs Fury. Pretty sure this is a fixed fight but it may still depend on who is running the show and sometimes politics are involved.",

How does your friend know with 100% certainty that one team is going to win? I would be very sceptical when it comes to such statements and don't believe it. Why would anybody give you the information for free? The more people know about it the higher the chance the scam will be uncovered. Taking out a loan short term without collateral will lead to very high interest rate and you could be stuck with repaying the loan for many years if things go wrong.",

Don't be rash to bet big, let alone follow someone's predictions. It's best to follow your own research. After all, to get big profits, it all depends on how we do research, as well as luck. because everything can not be separated from luck. unless I'm the richest person in the world I'd bet over $10k",

I don't aim to maximize profit in the first place in gambling, I just play for fun so I don't really have strategies or avenues in trying to actually aim for something, regardless of whether it's guaranteed or not. I set bets on increments that I think appeal to my confidence level, I don't set bets assuming I'd hit X amount if I bet Y amount, it sounds like a rather dumb way to bet.",

Otherwise you're just carrying out a transaction, like getting paid an interest rate from a bank for storing money their for a certain time period. The answer would be yes to such a proposition, because as you state - a hundred percent chance of winning guaranteed, is a zero risk proposition. However, what you're really like to be asking is if you have a bet that has a 97% or even 99% chance of winning, would you take it? In which case the answer would be no, because from personal experience I have seen such bets fail several times and fortunately only had tiny amounts at stake.",
