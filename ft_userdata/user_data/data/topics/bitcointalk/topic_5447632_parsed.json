This could be another reason why Bitcointalk is such an interesting place for quality discussions with knowledgeable members.Another benefit is that, at some point, there are interesting project that people wear on their signature which is quite interesting. It could be their own made bitcoin related projects that anyone can visit and learn, a list of resources and sometimes a cause for something debatable topic/ issues around bitcoinverse",

      "body": "The signature is a space in your profile that has a maximum amount of words it can contain depending on the member's rank, and this space allows you to advertise either a paid campaign or a charity campaign. The advantage is that it can enable a project to get exposure after putting on the signature and making some quality comments on different boards of the forum. The second advantage is that you can earn bitcoin from the signature you advertise if it's a paid campaign.There are two kinds of paid signatures: the first one is on the Altcoins bounty board https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0, and the second one is from the first link provided by PX-Z.Signatures on the service board pay memebers with Bitcoin, while signatures from the bounty board pay memebers with either some altcoins or fiat crypto.The disadvantage is that if you post shites, no campaign manager is going to accept you into signature on the service board, but you can be partially considered on the bounty board.",

Then youll get compensated by exposing these ads through process called signature campaign. Of course there are different rules on that but youll only needign to post across different threads and show that signature on your profile to make it expose to more people and thats marketing. But some uses the space too for their own business or services here. Its depend on the user how he will make use of that privilege when he got a higher rank for the signature codes and avatar.",

Signature space virtually becomes available once your member and from Full member, you can have your avatar space opened for you.Avatars are simply a branding logo and it applies just as the signature except for the fact that, Avatars are images and have got no link embedded but signatures comes with links in some configured codes. The signature space one has varies based on ranks as there are acceptable number of characters within a space.Benefits one can derive from signatures and Avatar spaces is nothing more than exposure. Now, its either you are advertising your brand or that of someone else or company and based on what is agreed, you might get paid or get incentives from referrers.At the moment @OP, you don't have that leverage and you should be more focused on improving your crypto knowledge.",
