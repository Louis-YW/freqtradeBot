  "content": "Hi guys! I have been with sportsbet.io for many years, and always felt safe when betting there. I just browse the IN-PLAY catalog and finds matches to bet on. Then i see that there is 1 match under Basketball. A league called “ China - New league”. Guangdong Miners - Liaoning WarriorsLots of points have been scored in 1st and 2nd quarter (+50 and +60) and i was sure it maybe was a reserve league for the big teams. Like G-league for NBA.  Here you often see many points. So i did bet over 47,5 in 3rd quarter. I then went on 1xbit (which i have used often before, and now only uses for streaming). I found the match with live streaming on 1xbit and found out that this match is one of those fake matches 1xbet, and 1xbit is behind… im sure people who has been playing there knows what im talking about. Those matches where players dont go for the free basket, but instead passes it.. where every referee whistle for fauls doesnt stop the clock - and where there is absolutely No defending.. 47 points were scored with 1,30 minutes left of the quarter, it still felt wrong inside me because i know these games from 1xbit - they suddenly becomes very unlucky before the reach the spread. Players started to pass outside the court, having to wait 20 second for the ONLY referee to walk slowly to the other side of the court to give up the ball, while the clock is still ticking. 1 minute left, now they start to foul eachother for the first time of the quarter. 2 fouls in a row which milked the clock because it doesnt stop while the referee have to walk to the ball and give it up - lost bet only 47 points. I know i sound like a bad loser, but honestly - it is a rigged match out of many hosted by 1x-brands. The first 11 minutes of this game was also just so scammy.. No definding at all, every missed ball gets fast passed down to a players alone on their side court, one and one with the basket but they intentionally stops up, dribbles a bit and pass it on to a player back court. I dont mind these games to be on 1xbit, because they are a scammy place already.. you see these fake games in football, handball, basketball and all that inside the 1x brands but i never expected these games to be hosted on “trustworthy” site like sportsbet.io. Its fake games, fake league only made up to host a event for online bettors. Mostly its russian matches, but i did also include some chinese matches now i see. There is no audience watching the matches, its not the players, a referee and a camera man. After seeing these matches on 1xbit before, i am also convinced that there is another guy or a screen behind the camera which tells the players the result they should go after. Its 100% matchfixing. When 2 out of 2 quarters was +50-60 points, the majority bets on over 47,5 to odds 2.00.. this way they can help the bookies to make their players lose their bets. I contacted sportsbet who didnt care about my issue and just said they had a license and doesnt offer fake games bl.a. bl.a. bl.a.. but now all of you know! I learned my lesson.. i should have checked the match before betting on it.. but Thats just my style, and i always felt safe there.. never seen any fake shit before. It was always professional sports ( i know they offer ebasket and efifa which is also pure scam, but here we at least know to be careful ).. I want my bet voided cause it was not basketball. Basketball is a game with 3 referees, clock stops on every whistle, and the league you are betting on would be operated by Thats countrys federation. Like during friendly football matches - sometimes the game only last for 80 min, or sometimes 120 min with 3 halfs.. Thats happening sometimes and if you win on a match like that, they void it because they only expected it to be 90 min.. here is it the same.. the quarters are 12 min, but its 12 straight mins, No clock stop, No time outs, every foul takes 30-45 sec. Freethrows can take up to 1,5 minutes!! Its not basketball rulesWhen i opened the stream, and saw what i just did bet on, i knew my bet was lost instantly. I was so surprised when i saw it was one of those matches hosted by the 1x brands. You can often spot these fake games if you can find a live stream on 1xbit that has top notch quality (all live streams on 1xbit is often very bad quality), clock never stops, and players look lazy. Also 1xbit always offers a big range of total points scored on normal matches like from 41,5 - 51,5 points.. but these self hosted fake games they only offers a range of 3 points. Thats how you spot them. Often they also uses names like “ Barcelona vs Juventus”. Then you see 5 russians on each team with a Barca and Juve shirt on. 100% matchfixing, and i wish that somehow one day - 1 of the players comes out telling us all the names of the bosses, who is in charge and how its 100% works out when it comes to scorings.. then i hope the big teams will sue their asses, for using their names to host fake matchfixed games. Sportsbet.io are not trustworthy, they joined the russian gang.",

I bet on the event before i found out it was a 1x match. You see 2 quarters have been +50 and + 60 points, of course majority bets on over 47,5 - Thats the catch. Did you even look at the record i made?If i did place a bet on under 47,5 and won, i would have taken the money and minded my step on this site after i found out it started to open up for these 1xbit matches. You only finds these type of matches on 1x-brands. I wish someone who knows 1x- brands would step in and share their knowledge. Everybody can go on 1xbit now, Press basketball and scrooll down to the last events bottom list. Like “Basketball rocket league”  or “IPBL Pro division”. Games are running 24/7 and you can see just by watching 1 minute that its no go. But ok, even for the people who thinks im just a bad loser.. would you think it was fair to place a bet on a basketball league where they clock never stops? Does that ever happend in professional basketball.. so if you bet on over points, would you not be angry? When i bet on basketball, i expect that it follows normal rules otherwise the match should be in another category. The same for icehockey.. imagine yourself if you have a bet on icehockey or basket, where the ref interferes so often, and the clock just keep on running. This is so important knowledge, that me as a bettor should be aware of that. They could put a note or place it in another category “Basketball freestyle” or whatever. This match is listed between serious leagues!",

      "body": "It is completely understood that I don't know any of the teams. I placed my bet based on the data I could see for the game, specifically the number of points scored in the first and second quarters, and quickly decided to bet on over 47.5 points in the third quarter. The statistics were in my favor compared to where they had set the spread. I would follow the game and went to bet365, but the game was not there. So, I tried going to 1xbit and they even showed the game live. I opened the live stream and immediately saw that it was one of these so-called fake matches from the 1x empire.I believe that the organizers of these matches have made a deal with Sportradar or another reporting service that reports the scores. I know that Sportradar also reports how much is being played on which outcomes. Sportradar is often used in the fight against match-fixing by reporting obvious large bets to football associations around the world so they can investigate if there has been any match-fixing involved. Unfortunately, the organizer of the match is simply the big player behind it all (1x empire). In this way, they can ensure that the markets that most people have bet on do not come to fruition. This is a big advantage for the 1x empire, and it allows them to finance these matches running 24/7. We are probably talking about at least 10 different matches across all sports going on at the same time - 24/7!. There are both Russian matches, but there are also matches in China like the one I bet on. I know it sounds strange and crazy, but it's true. It's totally shady. When I used to play on 1xbit, I learned the hard way and have always been cautious about which matches I played on there ever since. I always had to make sure it wasn't one of their own hosted matches. It's just to my great surprise that I come across such a match on sportsbet.io now. Would it increase my credibility if I ask the official Chinese basketball federation if they are familiar with a league called New League and if they know either of the two teams? I warn you. Check if the game is official before you play. I discovered this today. It surprises me that people haven't brought it up before.Trust me, I have gambled my whole life and seen the industry from behind the scenes through my many years as an affiliate. These Corona matches are a huge problem. They bring sports betting into disrepute.Quote from: holydarkness on May 04, 2023, 05:52:07 PMQuote from: fritvalg on May 04, 2023, 05:13:36 PMSorry!

Now you make me really confused about what you're trying to say. You can withdraw big amount from SB, you lose \"a small one\" from a rigged match, set by 1x-emperium, which happens to be on SB, and you place these bets not knowing it was 1x-game? If I may revise my previous sentence, do you think a man from 1x, this time the name is Roman, will call Steve and say, \"Yo Steve, your buds Roman here. Sup, buds? You know we rigged games, right? Well... you see, this match from this club against that club is one that we rigged. Could you please not remove it from your book?\"As for your statement that you didn't know it was 1x-game when placing your bets on SB, kindly refer to the part of your post I bolded, you're saying you placing a bet on a game where you have zero knowledge of? Never heard the team or the event where the teams compete?",

      "body": "Hi buddy, I was looking for people who have claimed for this kind of matches. I also have has situations like that, and in the most of the cases the games are from ukraine or russia. Specifically from ukraine, I started betting in the famous esports battle basketball, in which at the beginning I stared betting overs between two players that, in theory, they are coming scoring, i dont know, for example, over 80 points and allowing 80 or more points. In theory, you must bet over in the next match, and you know what? They usually scored between them, 130 or 140 points. And its ok, it could be possible, it could happen in the best leagues, but if you see the match, god damn. At least, you can hide your intentions and play a good defense, I dont know. They failed easy shots, they used the 24 seconds in the shotclock and lost the ball. I read once, that they are playing according with the bets. For example, if the player with the best odd (2.5) get 3000 bucks in bets and the other one with other odd (1.45) get 10000, automatically the player with the best odd will win. Is a good profit for the bookmaker. With that kind of games (play in) happen strange situations too. They doesnt score, the free throws they take along 1 minute to shot them, and the best is they doesnt score lol. I dont know but I consider these games are not legal. Some day it could be investigated.",
