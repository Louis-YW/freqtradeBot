If someone is willing to pay 16 BTC up front, I’ll hand deliver the coin myself with a smile and throw in a free beer. I think the problem is mostly that buyers want to pay 10.5 BTC for these coins and sellers have 0 interest at that price. The other problem is that most of the inquiries I get on the high value coins end up being lame scam attempts. If someone was serious and willing to pay the price, the rest of the issues are easily solvable.",
