As a result of the decrease in orders, Worldwide Logistics tells CNBC it is expecting Chinese factories to shut down two weeks earlier than usual for the Chinese Lunar New Year — Chinese New Year’s Eve falls on Jan. 21 next year. The seven days after the holiday are considered a national holiday.“Many of the manufacturers will be closed in early January for the holiday, which is much earlier than last year,” Monaghan said.Supply chain research firm Project44 tells CNBC that after reaching record-breaking levels of trade during the pandemic lockdowns, vessel TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) volume from China to the U.S. has significantly pulled back since the end of summer 2022 — including a decline of 21% in total vessel container volume between August and November.Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/TR4BmSv/chinese-imports.jpgAsia-based global shipping firm HLS warned clients in a recent communication about the ocean transport business climate.″It seems to be a very bad time for the shipping industry. We have the combination of declining demands and overcapacity as new tonnage enters the market,” it wrote.HLS analysts are predicting a further 2.5% decline in container volumes and a nearly 5-6% increase in capacity in 2023, which will continue to negatively impact freight rates in 2023.“The container shipping market will be further complicated by economic uncertainty, geopolitical concerns, and also the increasingly heated market competition,” HLS wrote.OL USA CEO Alan Baer tells CNBC that there are some early signs of an inventory correction. Overall business volume and order flow out of Asia continue to be muted as carriers cancel more vessels, and there is little upside momentum leading into Chinese New Year. But Baer said, “Space has already tightened, so while demand is soft, space may be at a premium in January and throughout Q1. On the plus side, inventory depletion and the need to restart the order and delivery cycle appears to be inching upward.”U.S. West Coast ports take biggest hitHLS cited trade data showing that U.S. imports from Asia plunged in October to their lowest level in 20 months. The spot rate for a container from Asia to the U.S. West Coast has crossed the breakeven point, “with little room for further reductions,” it wrote.The large West Coast ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have experienced the largest drop in trade, according to Josh Brazil, vice president of supply chain insights at Project44, as shippers also rerouted some of their shipments to the East Coast to avoid the risk of a major union strike at West Coast ports.HLS expects most carriers to extend their West Coast rates until December 14, holding at $1,300-$1,400 per forty-foot equivalent containers (FEU). However, U.S. East Coast rates are expected to drop by $200 or $300 to average $3,200-3,300 per FEU in the first half of December.The recent rise in Covid lockdowns in China continues to impact manufacturing operations and delay cargo outputs. There are also local access obstacles for cross-province and cross-city transportation, mostly related to truck driver testing requirements, with trucking capacity to be largely affected.The fight for vessel space, the rollovers of cargo, and the slow trucking is tracked by the CNBC Supply Chain Heat Map.Blank (canceled) sailings data shows the cut in vessel capacity on the transpacific route (China to the U.S.) continues at a significant pace. The 2M Alliance of Maersk and MSC has suspended almost half of its U.S. West Coast services for December. The Ocean Alliance (CMA CGM, Cosco Shipping, OOCL and Evergreen) and THE Alliance (Ocean Network Express, Hapag-Lloyd, HMM and Yang Ming Line) have cut overall vessel capacity by 40-50% up to Chinese New Year.As a result, space for shippers is considered tight for cargo bound for the Pacific Southwest route and service reliability has declined, with carriers including MSC and Hapag-Lloyd rolling (not accepting) cargo on sailings in an effort to make up time. According to logistics managers, this is creating two weeks of delay. MSC said in its latest notice to clients, “ETAs are indicative and subject to change without prior notice.”The drop in manufacturing orders from the U.S. and the E.U. is also impacting Vietnam, which has been booming as a manufacturing hub as more trade moved away from China.Since early this year, 12,500 companies were closed per month, a 24.8% increase year over year, according to the Vietnam General Statistics Office report. The combination of the lack of manufacturing orders and loan interest rates increasing from 6.5% to 13.2% in Vietnam led many companies to close factories instead of signing new order contracts, according to HLS. Canceled ocean sailings bound for Vietnam are up 50% for December.Surprise European manufacturing increaseUnlike the decrease in orders out of China, trade data analyzed by Project44 indicates that the Europe-to-U.S. route is “one of the possibly most surprising and certainly most significant developments since early 2020,” Brazil said.“This sharp rise cannot be explained by the pandemic alone. But a strategic shift from over-dependency on trade with China and geopolitical tensions over Russia are the main drivers of the EU-U.S. trade boom,” he said.Image link:  https://i.ibb.co/1ssfr3B/european-imports.jpgThe global trading map is being rapidly redrawn, with EU-U.S. trade and investment in U.S. rising sharply as economic ties between the West and China are subjected to critical scrutiny. This year, the U.S. has imported more goods from Europe than China – a big shift from the 2010s, according to Project 44.“For their part, Europe’s manufacturers battling sky-high energy prices and inflation are increasingly exporting to and investing in the U.S.,” Brazil said.Germany’s exports to the U.S. were almost 50% higher in September year over year. Germany’s mechanical engineering sector has boosted its exports to the U.S. by almost 20% in a year over year comparison of the first nine months of 2022, according to Project 44.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/04/manufacturing-orders-from-china-down-40percent-in-demand-collapse.html....According to this, the united states has seen a decline of imports arriving on the west coast from china. Accompanied by a simultaneous boost in the arrival of imports from europe on the east coast. This shift in trade routes from west to east however does not do anything to counteract the high decline in shipping volumes.This reflects a significant decline in the purchasing power of american consumers. As the world's largest consumer market the united states represents a significant portion of global purchasing power. A market which major exporters of the world have catered to. The US consumer market however appears to be drying up as rising fuel and food prices cut into the disposable income of average to even middle class consumers.While many might have the impression that rising prices affect low bracket earners for the most part. Recent studies have concluded that many middle class and even high income earners also do not have much salary left over after deducting the high price of rent and other monthly fees. So it seems that everyone is tapped out due to cost of rising expenses.What we have seen so far could only be initial reactions. With bigger shifts coming later on.",

This shift in trade routes from west to east however does not do anything to counteract the high decline in shipping volumes.United States imports from China might be declining because most critical manufacturing industries have left the Chinese shores to other friendly nations. The number of companies that left China during the tenure of Donald Trump and because of strict Covid-19 restrictions are enough to impact on import statistics. While imports from China is decreasing, India and Vietnam are taking the over the gap. In the third quarter of this year US-India trade increased by 40%. Vietnam's trade with the US have kept growing over the years making the country one of the largest trading partners of the US. It is also a great news to see that European nations are also penetrating the largest consumer market in the world.",

For example China reduces export to US while significantly increases it to elsewhere specially to Russia after they were sanctioned and the West stopped a lot of exports to Russia. On the other hand US is starting to import goods from elsewhere even though I wonder how much EU can replace China specially in this heavily competitive world where production cost (hence product prices) are heavily increasing in EU with expensive labor and energy.",

The world equation is changing drastically along with the economic scenario and also with the cold powerplay between US and China. Apple has already moved out of China and started building their production hub in India as a JV with TATA group. Canon has closed down their factories in China and moved out their production to elsewhere. I think it's a cumulative effect that China is facing. Also I think it's great for the world economy because China is the biggest threat to world peace after US. While US attacks the oil rich countries, China attacks their neighbours. If global institutions are moving out of China and their exports are declining, that might balance couple of things for the rest of us.",

When they don't outsource jobs and products to get from cheaper countries, they need to produce stuff on their own. Meaning more jobs and more quality products and self sustainability.And on the plus side no need to bow down at dictatorships because of fear of losing trade deals.But transition time will be hard for Americans, that's for sure. I guess they just need to \"man up\" now to put in terms of toxic masculinity.",

Thus, they want to stop supporting the Chinese economy as it seems dominating from the usual that we've seen before. Well, in sum to this, we're still experiencing too many crises right now.

And it was China that \"showed the way to solve at least two problems in the United States.\"What does the US get with this vector?Yes many !1. New jobs in the US. This is a reduction in tension, this is a \"+\" in the karma of the president, this is a \"return\" of the status of an advanced technological country, from the point of view of a full cycle, taxes, and much more2. Everything is the same, only with a MINUS sign for China. For China, which decided, under the guise of the global crisis and the terrorist war unleashed by Russia in Europe, to show its \"protruding ambitions.\" This applies to Taiwan, which is very significant for the whole world and the United States, in the first place, where the lion's share of microprocessors of the \"major league\" is produced.3. Show the whole world that the US can both easily give (technology to China) and easily take away. And who would not say anything about the huge economy of China - it is DEPENDENT on the West. It depends on how much the West will buy (paying with hard currency, which is critically needed by China). And the Chinese economy is dependent - TECHNOLOGICALLY. And technology is the west, not the east ....",

And technology is the west, not the east ....Might also remember while hard cash is needed, China is also sitting on a huge and growing pile of foreign reserves (1/3 of the world's foreign reserves, which it of course needs to continue sitting on in the short term to continue their export policy).I wouldn't say it's critical. They may be forced to finally show their hand and that would actually be a bone-cruncher on the rest of the world.Tech not in the east? Not sure that's going to be the truth for much longer, if at all now. Japan, SK, Spore, even China itself, at least on a more distributed level.",

The markets are shifting and you seeing more exports from China to other parts of the world, specifically Africa .... where they can dump a lot of technology that cannot be manufactured in those countries.

They keep printing money and then buy something with it from other nations and then they print more when they have none left and we act as if that's okay.I am sorry but USD doesn't really have the value it used to have, we put value into it, normally I would prefer to go towards Euro a long time ago, even if that doesn't look as strong right now, it has a clearer future right now and looks to be backed by people with actual economic goal, not people who just do whatever they want and show you a guy afterwards to make you accept. China is doing worse because they dependent on others money, that is the main issue.",
