      "body": "When transactions are broadcasted, it got into a memory pool, waiting for miners to include it into a block. If miner select the transactions (which are not yet confirmed), they included the unconfirmed transaction selected into a candidate block. The candidate block is first created and each node tries to add the candidate block into blockchain.You need to read these, short and simple:https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/candidate-blockhttps://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/memory-poolLet me make it easy. Candidate block is a block that miners included the unconfirmed transactions, miners can add the transactions of their choice, if the miner mine the next block, nodes validates that and becomes a valid block mined.Quote from: Dzwaafu11 on February 26, 2023, 08:14:10 AM*I'm curious how the memory pool works and why there is only one temporary storage location for bitcoin at the moment.One? No because all nodes have their own memory pool (mempool)",

The blockchain will be updated with the block that a miner is currently working on. In order to validate them, Miners select the unconfirmed transactions from the memory pool to their candidate block.And then,Memory pool is like the store room for unconfirmed transactions. Transactions yet to be confirmed are held in the momory pool and lined up waiting to be confirmed before being added to the block.",

I’ll make corrections to that. Miners select the unconfirmed transactions from the memory pool to their candidate block. Thanks",
