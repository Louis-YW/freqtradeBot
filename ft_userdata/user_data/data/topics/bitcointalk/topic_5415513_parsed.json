  "content": "They proclaim bitcoin to be dead, but all I see is their ego dying. Spain's largest telecommunications company is now accepting bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as payment on its ecommerce site. It is only a matter of time before Bitcoin becomes mainstream. Right now, all we can see is that our patience is paying off slowly and steadily. Today it is Spain, tomorrow it will be Portugal, and then Egypt, and then Morroco, and then Finland, and soon enough it will be adopted in masses all over the world.QuoteTelefónica, the largest telecommunications company in Spain, now accepts bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as payment.The payment method was added to Telefónica’s online tech marketplace Tu.com in a partnership with Bit2Me, the largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency in Spain. Customers can take advantage of the “revolutionary payment method” by simply clicking the Bit2Me Commerce payment method at checkout, per the company’s announcement.Additionally, Telefónica has reportedly invested in Bit2Me. Details of the investment are expected to be released in the coming weeks.Despite the fact that users looking to take advantage of the new feature simply need to add the product to the cart and select Bit2Me Commerce before paying, there is a purchase minimum and limit set between $200 and $500, respectively.Upon the completion of the checkout process, Bit2Me automatically converts the chosen form of payment into euros in realtime, removing any technological barriers for merchants such as Telefónica. Spanish interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to grow as this past summer, the RCD Espanyol professional soccer team became the first La Liga team to accept the new form of payment.Additionally, Spanish airline Vueling is also set to begin accepting bitcoin in 2023. However, Vueling chose to partner with cryptocurrency payment service provider BitPay to facilitate its new form of payment.Source: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spains-telef%C3%B3nica-begins-accepting-bitcoin-crypto-payments",

Even though we want it to happen because it will increase the demand and the price.But if bitcoin becomes the part of mainstream economy, it will be subject to more scrutiny and regulations. Which eventually might risk the concept of financial freedom. That will definitely not be great!",

Many time making payment for my data subscription using the bank has been very frustrating especially when I need to make use of my data Urgently. I have thought about the fact of using Crypto-currency for payment and the simplicity, speed and efficiency it would bring in.

Even no one can resist technological advances, but the need for the use of bitcoin will be increasing widespread throughout the world.",

      "body": "I would downplay it a bit for now though. Telefónica is of course a giant it its playing field, but for now, this only applies to one of their ecommerce sites (which incidentally, strangely enough, I’ve never heard of before today), and is actually being labelled as a pilot roll-out for the company by the local media I’ve read today. They are probably wading the waters to see how well crypto is going to be accepted by the general public, whilst gaining corporate experience in the field. Two things to consider here:-   The deployment is not on their core telecom subscription websites (Telefónica, Movistar).-   In Spain, being Bit2Me also Spanish, it is very likely that the combo will pass data on to Hacienda (Spain’s IRS). There is some work in progress to this effect going on, and likely every crypto accepting business will soon have to report data on customers using crypto. We’ve yet to see how this finally plays out, but is could be a deterrent for many (I presume).Getting back to the site, it doesn’t seem to have a language selector, but GT can give us a reasonable translation of what’s on for sale on the site for crypto, and how it works:https://www-tu-com.translate.goog/pages/criptomonedas?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wappEmulating a purchase with crypto on the site, one of the first disclaimers one reads there is that:QuoteI accept that, in case of desisting from the purchase through Bit2Me Commerce service, the return of the product will result in a coupon redeemable at tu.comNot my piece of cake …",

The acceptance of bitcoin as payment from different such companies surely help with the increasing real-time usage of bitcoin and also lets people know about bitcoin.

It also seems plausible that some other companies in Spain might want to follow if there's enough hype over the adoption by Telefónica. However, I wouldn't get too excited about it. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it's a domino sort of situation when one does a big step forward in terms of adoption, and then it triggers a series of movement. El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender, and since then Central African Republic was probably the only country to follow (and given the extremely poor level of Internet penetration in CAR, it's more likely a symbolic move than any real adoption). Many companies adopted or invested in Bitcoin at some point, but it's been many years without it triggering a major global adoption wave. So far, adoption is occurring quite slow, and these are all baby steps if we consider the population of our planet.",

This is a clear proof that Bitcoin is a key player in the world payments system and neglecting it would lead to the loss of a large client base. This adoption might not be the ideal way we expected because of privacy and security challenges but at least this adoption is giving Bitcoin more publicity. People that have never heard of it would be opportuned to get information about it. It would also have ripple effects because other companies would also adopt it because they would not want to be left behind in this era of financial revolution.The adoption might be slow but the beauty of it is that Bitcoin is moving. I always celebrate any form of Bitcoin adoption even if it was done by a small business.",

There is a big potential of BTC to be accepted everywhere if there will be more stores that caters to it.
