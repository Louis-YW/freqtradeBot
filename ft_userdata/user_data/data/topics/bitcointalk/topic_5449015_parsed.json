It's true that the bookmakers have less involvement into the outcome of the game. They don't have to deal with the traditional house edge and fairness of the game unlike in casinos. They get their profit by working with the odds provided for each match.",

My advice is to bet responsibly, wisely and use money where you are prepared to lose.",

In theory it should be like that but it is not unfortunately.They cannot fine tune the game like they can do with their slot machines yes but still there is the referee there whom with his decisions can tear even the best team apart.I remember a funny phrase from a coach in my local league which is not a well known one when the best team lost to the last one in the standings and he said explicitly \"with this referee even Brazil would have lost the game\" blaming all the blame to the referee.If referees were all as correct as you describe and that they would not impact the game it is surely better to bet on sport bets rather than playing on casino games like slot machines.",

You are mostly right. But the casino don't win directly when you lose money. The odds are designed in a way so, it doesn't matter which side you bet on, the casino will make money. When you bet on team A, team B and draw at the same time and you win one of these bets, you will still lose money. That's how the casino makes its money. (it is called the house edge) Obviously you are not the only player on that casino so not everybody is going to bet on the winning team. Some other people will bet on the losing side because who knows why.This becomes a problem when the casino don't have enough players. That's because the casino don't calculate the odds by itself. It takes it from somewhere else. So if somehow there are more winners than the losers on a day, the casino will have to pay the winners from its own pocket and that's a big problem for the casino.",

In sports betting, casinos only place or offer bets between teams that are competing.It is true that the casino cannot manipulate the results of the ongoing match because the course of a football match is not regulated by the casino and every team competing definitely wants to win so that the final result is determined by the two teams competing.Casinos can only give gamblers a chance to win when betting, so if one of the stronger teams usually has a smaller chance so that if a gambler wins, the casino only gives gamblers a low winning advantage because the odds are lower.But keep in mind that there are several football matches that can be manipulated where a team that, if we do research, should win, ends up drawing or losing because of acts of manipulation such as bribery for the team to yield or draw a draw.",

It's the spontaneity and uncertainty of the outcome which excites and makes every gambler to bet more. It's the constant release of dopamine that is addictive that any person would continuously look for once tasted as good.Well of course you're right. It exists not only in football but also in other sports such as basketball, boxing, or ufc fights. The only intervention there is to find an edge on which one to bet is actually the quality of players and performance of which team you are taking. Other than that, more concern is when there is an inside anomaly or internal arrangement. This happens when a certain player was being paid to throw and loses the game intentionally. Sometimes it is the referee who calls wrong and untrue violations intentionally to the opposite team.It's a sports betting, all are most depends on the outcome of the game.",

Technically house edge exists, so gamblers don't necessarily take 100% of their wins, casinos take something you can call a tax of sorts so that they profit even if winners actually win. Other than that, then yes, casinos don't really have anything that they can do to tamper with the results since matches are pretty public nowadays. This doesn't consider the matches themselves being fixed though, regardless of the casino's intentions, since that kind of stuff happens all the time in sports. Besides, both in casinos and in sports betting, due to house edge existing, gamblers would always 100% lose compared to the casino.",

I mean people should always consider this, all kinds of gambling is always against gambler. But that \"being against\" is very sensitively done so you don't feel it and its definitely NOT unfair.",

It is logical that you cannot compare sports betting with any game in a casino, so even though they have something in common, they are two different games. Although some will say that there is a method of \"prediction\" in some games such as blackjack or poker because some players know how to \"count cards\", it is mostly a combination of luck and patience in the game where the player tries to outsmart the game and the house.Sports betting has a completely different component in the sense that it is possible to analyze each individual event in great detail, and thus filter and find those that have the highest chances in our favor. Of course, everything depends on how skilled someone is in gathering information and how many resources they have to minimize the risk as much as possible. Sports such as football, basketball or handball have three possible outcomes (1x2), while for example tennis has only (1 or 2), which means that in the first case there are three possible outcomes, and in the second only two.If you play type 1, in the first case you have a 33% chance of winning, while the bookmaker has 66%, and in the second case the chances are 50-50. In the event that you combine several events, your chances drop drastically, while the bookmaker's chances increase significantly, so I would conclude that in that case we can already talk about classic gambling.",

A lot happens in soccer betting where teams don't want to work with each other, which ends in losing.Overall online casinos that provide sports betting always place bets on the strong football team at low stakes and high bets on the weak team, otherwise consider a draw.Example:1.1 x 1.2 x 3.5This is in the sense of words, they know the team that will win, if they win they only pay a small amount to the bettor, so if someone places a bet on a weak team and loses, the online casino dealer will brush off your losing money.For that sometimes it has also happened the other way around, but that rarely happens, roughly the conclusion leads as you say.",

Your bet is on the game's result, what doesn't necessarily mean the most skilled team is going to win, since luck is also a decisive factor in sports matches. Let's say team A control the whole game (more possession, shootings, free kicks), however it might take only one chance for team B to score a goal and keep it for the rest of the game. So even if you are a specialist on sports, more specifically soccer, there are still chances you are going to predict it wrongly.But yes, the house only profits from gamblers who lose their bets.",

We can see from the quality of the players they have and how the performance of each position on the field is for us to compare with our opponents who make conclusions later on which club to bet on. But sometimes we only bet on the clubs we like without looking at their performance.Looks easy indeed, but not as easy as what we imagine.",
