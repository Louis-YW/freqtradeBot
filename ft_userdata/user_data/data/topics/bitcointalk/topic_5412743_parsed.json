  "content": "I believe there have been intentional attack on Tornado Cash contracts. Although it was sanctioned, Tornado Cash frontend is still usable if you access via IPFS (tornadocash.eth) and use a different RPC node. It worked fine for me until I ran into this issue recently.I deposited into the 1 ETH tornado cash pool 3+ weeks ago and am now unable to withdraw my note. I believe there has been an attack on the 1 ETH pool that now prevents all users from withdrawing. It appears there have been no withdraws in the past 2 weeks from the 1 eth pool.I get the error \"Failed to fetch all deposit events from contract\" in the GUI, console further reveals an error \"Missing deposit event for deposit #51577\". When looking through the deposit events array, 51577 has failed the \"checkCommitments()\" call (https://github.com/tornadocash-community/tornado-classic-ui/blob/a83fae0772c8da084c0e76b3a756b456f5b9f5bb/utils/crypto.js#L93). This is because in this specific deposit the leafIndex variable does not match the position in the array. I am not sure how it was possible for this event to be emitted, possibly by error or malicious attack.See the following events on chain:Code:Deposit #51576:leafIndex=51576tx=\"0x5edd0931ce53ed5aafec9842d238fea7e222bfd37c3d81ce6e8fa1e0e3da61d8\"Code:Deposit #51577:leafIndex=51578 (double increment bug)tx=\"0x5468c98b5590dad45f6ae3929df644d7e29ec74272b44941234e26191cf78e16\"Because of this error, the signing algorithm no longer works to withdraw coins from the contract. I attempted to manually modify the RPC responses and correct the leafIndex in the events to be sequential but it did not work. I also tried removing the leafIndex check from the frontend source and that also did not work.Reward token: Code:tornado-eth-1-1-0x246528b30a8270c44d6f5317c37c0fbe893889f7b7c723575bb49cf224422505ce64b1f5f266500c92a2e3cbe0b7249dafb3f4708fe7bae1ff87ae823ce2If anyone can figure out how this attack was performed, and how to actually withdraw stuck funds, feel free to keep the 1 ETH reward attached to the note that I put above. The fact that this happened right after Tornado Cash was sanctioned makes me believe it could have been a nation state actor trying to brick the contract.",

I've also tried a locally hosted version of the web UI, as well as the command line utility.unfortunately, i don't have a good enough understanding of the cryptography or math behind how this all works to manually generate a proof and test it. i was hoping posting my 1 ETH note would compel someone with the proper skill set to try to figure out what is going on here.im not sure if this was done intentionally, or is just a bug in the contract, but the fact that it happened right after TC was sanctioned is strange to me, and i'm very curious what is going on.it seems the 10 eth and 100 eth contracts are okay still, but i don't believe anyone is able to withdraw funds currently from the 1 ETH pool.",
