  "content": "Hello everyone. I bought some BTC on binance lately. I wonder which \"wallet-ui-label-network\" should I choose. I see there are BSC, BTC, BNB & ETH networks. BSC's miner fee is lower than BTC. My BTC address is generated by Bitcoin-core official client. I don't know what kind of network does it support. Can I choose BSC and send my BTC to my address? Or it wouldn't work? Must I choose BTC network?Yeah, it's a super noob question. Could any good man tell me?",

I see there are BSC, BTC, BNB & ETH networks.You should read their warning that means both from and to address should match with each other on a same network.QuotePlease ensure your receiving platform supports the token and network you are withdrawing. If you are unsure, kindly check with the receiving platform first.QuoteBSC's miner fee is lower than BTC.Not correct. It is not miner fee but a withdrawal fee charged by Binance.In addition, BSC is not a Proof of Work blockchain so no miner on that chain. Usually withdrawal fees from exchanges are more expensive than average transaction fees on blockchains if you make your transactions from non-custodial wallets.Old story. Exchanges get profits from users' withdrawal fees.QuoteMy BTC address is generated by Bitcoin-core official client. I don't know what kind of network does it support. Can I choose BSC and send my BTC to my address? Or it wouldn't work? Must I choose BTC network?Because of your receiving address is Bitcoin address (real Bitcoin, not a token on BSC or other chains), you should choose BTC (Bitcoin) on Binance to submit your withdrawal request.For your receiving address, from Bitcoin Core, you should choose Segwit type because with this address type, later you will have to spend less transaction fee.",

      "body": "What do you need to understand there's 3 major Bitcoin address, it's legacy, segwit and native segwit. Right now every exchanges and wallet already support it, so it doesn't have any problem if you want to send from legacy to segwit or legacy to native segwit and vice versa. There's new improvement that called as taproot address, it's still new and not many exchanges or wallet still support it.BSC chain isn't a Bitcoin exchange, it's a shitcoin chain that's centralized created by CZ.",

Not all, not every. Bech32 adoption shows that.QuoteBSC chain isn't a Bitcoin exchangeA blockchain and an exchange are different terms, you should not make them as the same. If you want to compare, you should compare Bitcoin blockchain and Binance Smart Chain. If you want to compare exchanges, let's compare Pancakeswap (for Binance Smart Chain) and Uniswap (for Ethereum blockchain) or something similar for other blockchains.Quoteit's a shitcoin chain that's centralized created by CZ.Did you use Binance Smart Chain?I disagree to call everything as shit coin or shit chain just to try make your post stronger and impressive.",
