However, I have not use this before, and don't have much to say about it, but one thing for sure is that if this wallet is truly coming from official \"Opera Mini\" company itself, then it's likely to be legit. But moreover, always trade with caution by using an amount you can always afford to lose if you will like to give it a try (i.e test it).",

I don't think anyone is recommending the Opera Mini wallet.No one is going to recommend the OP to store assets on opera mini browser wallet for obvious reasons. First and foremost for me the most important feature to look out for when choosing a wallet is the source type. That is, is it  closed-source or open-source? My question to the OP is this, is the opera mini browser wallet open source or closed-source. If it is closed-source you cannot inspect the code to know if there is a security leak in there or not to steal your asset. I have been using Electrum wallet for Desktop for some months now and I do recommend it.",

It is just that Opera mini since I have known, is a browser app. The latest technology breakthrough in Web3 and Blockchain has sure triggered a ripple effect of change across major platforms that has been used to having an online base of customers patronizing their services. Opera mini sure has taken a cue, and Op, if you do try using their wallet, let us know. Otherwise, it is advised to do as others have done and use a major wallet service provider like Electrum which has proven to be rather reliable than others. Also, Opera mini wallet is an open source wallet according to the FIO protocol it uses.Just do the necessary KYC verification and biometrics and try to remember your key phrases, for any new wallet you use.QuoteYou can access the Opera Crypto Wallet by downloading Opera’s Crypto Browser. You can download it here.To set up the wallet, click the wallet icon on the left sidebar. You can set up a new wallet or restore your existing wallet with your recovery phrase.https://help.opera.com/en/crypto/opera-wallet-integration-guide/QuoteThe FIO Protocol is an open-source, decentralized usability solution that works across all blockchains, and uses human-readable Crypto Handles (e.g. hello@opera) to replace the complexity, risk, and inconvenience of transacting with long-string public wallet addresses.https://blogs.opera.com/mobile/2022/03/opera-fio-protocol-crypto-wallet-handles/",

For what you said op and what others have said, it is not advisable to use online wallet for storing coins. @Dr.Bitcoin_Strange said he has used it before and that means there is an element of genuineness it not I would have said you should not even use it for transactions. Because you don't know where the coins would have entered. But since Dr.Bitcoin_Strange said, he has use it before then there should be no panic again. He will tell us more of it. He can give us the review part of the wallet in the local board as a new thread. I'm waiting to see that thread.",
