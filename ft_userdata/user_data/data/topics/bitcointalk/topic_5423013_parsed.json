Some people feel comfortable with this \"not broken, why fix it? mentality, but it always is important to have a plan in place to stop accidents from repeating itself.",

It could give them a golden opportunity to put into practice the words they so graciously offer to others.Hopefully everyone learns valuable life lessons and becomes better people as a result.Crisis make people to think outside the box for solution. It seems to bring out the reserved strength in people and make them achieve what they wouldn't have in their comfort zones. But it has also led to suicide, depression, drug addiction and even other health issues. I have tried my hands in the motivational speaking field and I think I know what its like. Most of what these influencers say are read from books or heard from other speakers. Most of them have never practice what they communicate, its just theoretical knowledge. They are just trained to make the audience feel good by feeding them with fantasies and they go home to face the reality.For me I don't need war or crisis to make me a better person. I am always humble because I know that I am not better than anyone. Who I am or what I own today is because of chance and privilege. That rural herder in the jungle of Africa would have been better than me if he had the privileges I had. Currently, I learn from everything and spend more time meditating or reading instead of listening to motivational speakers.",

Becouse theybeen through crisis.Crisis is not the only reason why older people seem to be more humble, there are many other reasons but the major one that I know is experience. Before they had gotten to old age they have faced and pass through many experiences, they can share some stories about some, and others that they cannot. Some of these experiences that they have had has made them realise that there is nothing in this world that warrants pride. Younger and the more inexperienced people haven't had those experiences yet, the experience comes with age",

The older you grow, the more experienced you become about life and other stuff. Older people are faced with the reality of death while it may not be so with younger people who think they still have a long time to live. People get scared about death and that sobers them up.",

Becouse theybeen through crisis.Not everyone who has experience crisis is humble and not all older people appear humble or are humble as the case may be. People have different ways in which they understand things and when it comes to people staying humble, Imho I will say that crises don't make people humble rather exposure, level of education and understanding makes people humble. Older people sometimes appear to be humble because there is a popular story that says that older people thinks and conduct themselves like children when they get older so just like most kids are humble older people become humble because they now think like kids at old age.",

But some crisis and war are functional. It's funtional when it brings unjust and equal distributions of the Commonwealth of the people.  Most crisis and war are caused by the oppressed class, and it takes crisis to get whats rightly Belong to the people back to them. Some crisis and war if probably investigated are good for the benefit of all, it might cause death and destruction of properties but at the end the people will smile if they succeed in the war.",
