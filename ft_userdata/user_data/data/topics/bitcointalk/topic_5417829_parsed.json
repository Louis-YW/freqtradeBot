  "content": "okay I have a noontime sun  it shines downward at a 90 degree angle say at 12 noonI have four drones holding a 10 by 10 tarp.on the ground that tarp would have a 10 by 10 foot area of shadeso if the four drones lift the tarp 10 feet in the air the shadow will be larger than 10 by 10how large.and if the drones go to 20 foot highhow large is shadow.I read a lot about shadow length calculations cant find info on shadow expansion.obviously for a really perfect example 12 noon on the equator.but not necessary to be perfect.just assume sun is at high noon shining downward on the tarp.I used drones and 10 by 10 tarpbut it could be poles and a ten by ten tarpor blimps and a 200 by 200 tarp if blimps the tarp could let a lot of air pass through it as long as it blocks sun.actually a 2000 foot high set of blimps holding a 200 by 200 foot tarp makes a shadow of what size on the earth below? would be my question it would be larger than 200 by 200  but how much larger?",

The Arctic ,Greenland and Antarctica  all have long summer days. So how hard is it to cast long shadows to cooling the melting ice. I am near latitude 45 n and for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening I cast very long shadows.Why can't we shade the ice during the long days of summer the sun is low and would cast very long shadows from 9pm to 3am. just saying why not.",

Lean over (or use a stick unless you can be propped up) so you are again pointed at the sun and the shadow shrinks again.Now as to why the edges of a shadow get fuzzier the further away from the edge you get, that is caused by diffraction. To explain *that*, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction In simplest and broadest terms it's kinda like the turbulence produced when air mores around things.",

Even if you placed the tarp as far away as the moon (about 1.3 billion feet) the shadow would still be ~10.027 feet (i.e. the shadow would only be bigger by about 1/3 of an inch).Here's some rough python code for the table above, in case you'd like to experiment: Code:import mathdef noonShadow(elevation, tarpLength=10):    distanceToSun = 491 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000    angle = 2 * math.atan((tarpLength / 2) / (distanceToSun - elevation))    shadowLength = 2 * math.tan(angle / 2) * distanceToSun    return (elevation, angle, shadowLength)print(noonShadow(10))print(noonShadow(100))print(noonShadow(1000))print(noonShadow(10000))",

The fuzziness of the shadows that we see are caused by the apparent size of the sun. I don't doubt your microwave diffraction experience, but the the wavelength of visible light is 400 - 700 nm and the wavelength of microwaves is 150000000 - 300000000 nm. That difference in wavelengths has a huge effect on diffraction.Try this: view a shadow of yourself on a wall when lit with a larger source like a lightbulb and when lit by a smaller source like a phone's flash, both at the same distance. You will see a difference due to the change in the the size of the light.Ask any photographer and they will tell you that the size of the light determines the softness of the shadows.",

[...]In image synthesis (ray tracing), soft shadows show up as soon as you start sampling the light sources in more than one position (i.e. not treating them as points). Unless I'm missing something obvious (wouldn't be the first time) I agree with @odolvlobo that diffraction isn't the right physical mechanism to be thinking about at these wavelengths. If you wanted to synthesize pedantically realistic images, then you'd have to account for diffraction, but as an explanation for why shadows don't have hard edges, I don't think it's the right one.",

In short, due to the scattering of the sun's rays in our atmosphere, the whole atmosphere acts as a secondary light source. The light from the sky doesn't contribute to the fuzziness of shadows, but it does explain why shadows are not completely dark. Since the light in a shadow cannot come from the sun, it must come from elsewhere, such as the sky and reflection off of surrounding surfaces. The light from the sky is what makes things in shadow look a little blue.",
