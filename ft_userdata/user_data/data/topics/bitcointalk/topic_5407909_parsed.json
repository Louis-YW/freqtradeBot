Then, just recently I thought that something can happen so I deleted all my posts in that topic.I know things can not be erased entirely on the Internet after it was published. But back in days ago, I did not know how to change title of all posts in my topic and because I thought post titles can be keywords for search engines. That is why I sent DM to some posters in that topic.Later, Loyce taught me how to do this, so I changed all post titles by myself. So is it fine?When I received your DM, you instantly asked why I sent that DM. Is it on behalf of other forum members? Can't understand why you thought like this.",

I wouldn't see it as intentional abuse of the trust system, but more so mis-use of it. Clearly adding users they trust to their trust list, as opposed to users they trust their judgement of. It also seems that a lot of users do the same, this being just one example. Users adding others to their trust lists not for the reasons they really should be. The irony being that each users trust list is more or less their own business, it's not the same as leaving +/- trust, even if it is \"self-scratching\". By the looks of it, tranthidung would barely make that list compared to others though.The real question is does it make tranthidung's trust feedback less reliable (untrustwrothy) by adding users they trust to their trust list? Probably not. But it does probably make their selection of DT2 members unreliable, if they are simply DT2 as they are trusted by tranthidung, as opposed to having trustworthy feedback. This should all be relatively self-explanatory for DT1 members at this point.Either exclude tranthidung or exclude the newly found DT2 members if you have a problem with it.",

If the threshold for DT2 promotion is 10 ie., no drama with DT1 members and their trust list.  Your vote (simply by having ten or more merits) counts towards others being selected into DT1, so your choices are at work seven days a week year 'round whether or not you are on DT1.Some months your trust feedback score is lower e.g. +3 while other months when you are DT1 that number jumps to +9 which makes your BPIP score \"most trusted\" jump higher and in turn your overall \"most recognised\" score then becomes higher.  The perception when you are DT1 is that your are more trust worthy due to the higher score.I could demonstrate by doing it with my own received positive trust feedbacks, take a screen shot then return those values to where they were to demonstrate, but I fear some DT Trolls would perceive such a move as an attempt at self scratching on my part and fall out of their perches in indignation.",

Any logic here. Maybe you mind about ranking on BPIP but I don't mind. Sometimes I look at it but most of time I don't.

It's very obvious we will never be completely happy with whatever system is in place, there are too many wanna be alphas on bitcointalk(including myself) who think they are never wrong. Just scrap DT and move to a reputation based system where everyones feedback counts the same. If someone reads feedback(which they should if dealing with a user for trading or work), then they can judge for themselves how much they trust a person. As it is now, it's easily corrupted and a big joke.",

I barely add users to my trust list though, very hard to get there. Agree with you here.QuoteJust scrap DT and move to a reputation based system where everyones feedback counts the same.It is better than the past with old trust system. I recalled that when a DT1 member (or even DT2 member) with high power weight (not sure how it was counted with past trust system), a negative trust feedback will be shown with very big multiplier like -100, -200 in dark red. That causes a lot of panic and drama.Fortunately, with current trust / feedback system, all is the same (at least in visual display in orange). But again, a drama is moving to a third party site (BPIP - early after the launch of new trust/ feedback system, they used the old trust algorithm for people who missed it. Maybe months later, they changed and applied a new algorithm (or their own) for Recognized page. I don't follow it so I am not sure) I am not here to be recognized on BPIP",

Seems like you have misunderstood him.Quote from: tranthidung on July 29, 2022, 02:47:17 AMIs it a mandatory condition that I have to look at their trust feedback on others, before including them into my trust list?The system is very much simple.If you can trust someone with fund, send them positive feedback. While on the other hand, if you can trust someone with their judgement, you can include them into your trust list.

It was something like as much as the feedback gets older, it gets more value. I can't remember exactly though. But it was not something like with more DT2 inclusion, it will get big multiplier.",

Some users had \"hundreds\" of points whilst others had just ten or twenty points.Your green +9 is actually 90 accumulated points - nine months from when the last positive was received.OTOHA negative trust feedback increases (badly worded) by a factor of two points to the power of however many negatives are received from DT1/2's.One negative = two points removed.Two negatives = four points removed.Three negatives = eight points removed.That's negatives from DT1/2 members in any given month (see below). (To clarify - one negative per DT1/2 member regardless of however many negatives they post.  The same applies to positive trust feedback from DT1/2)Effective immediately.Feel free to correct me if my information is incorrect.(Below - any DT 1/2 with a negative score don't have their posts counted in the above, but that's another off topic discussion of its own).",

I am not born and living in a nation that has native English so probably I am not perfect in English. But honestly so far I don't believe I misunderstand your question with the proposition 'of' and I believe my answer is very clear with the preposition 'from'. If I denied that I did not send any DM to other posters in that topic, I would write \"No DM to anyone else\" or \"No request to anyone else\". Make sense?Still not sure why you used 'of' in your DM to me in that questionQuoteHave you made this request of others?My misunderstanding possibly come from 'of' that you used. I thought it is on behalf of. Sorry if I extrapolate it inaccurately. In my second DM to you, I wrote nothing to be serious and explained it clearly.QuoteI see via BPIP that you have removed those users mentioned earlier and I for one thank you for doing so.Sorry, removed who?QuoteThat's just a deflection from the topic at hand being \"self scratching\".I agree (as wrote above) but I think yahoo has a valid point. This drama is because I am in DT1 and when I add one member in my trust list, it means I promote them to DT2. Now, it's gone. I am in blacklist of theymos, forever.Back to your story, do you think that if someday you is in DT1 and your alt will automatically become DT2, will it trigger another drama? Now, you are not DT1, no drama. So how about future?I see LoyceV did not add his alt, LoyceMobile in LoyceV's trust list but DarkStar_ add his alt in his trust list as same as you did. Right or wrong, it depends on how you look at it. Personally, I see it is not serious but not adding your alt to your trust list would be a better option. I don't use to trigger a drama card if your alt won't be used to scam anyone. However, if someone want to trigger drama, they will have reason to do that especially if someday you are DT1.QuoteRegarding the various questions around points accumulated via positive or negative trust feedback (and even if you don't use BPIP, the point of this thread is that you are infact using the Trust Feedback system).It seems you love the past trust system and try to stick with BPIP and old algorithm that I never spent my time to read it thoroughly. If you love it, just stick with it but you should not ask other members to use BPIP and consider the trust algorithm on that site as official one of the forum. What I am using is the current version of Trust feedback system, not an old version years ago.Reasons why we have a new trust feedback system. Because past algorithms cause drama when people can paint other walls in dark red. How it becomes darker with time, as said, I don't spend my time to learn its algorithm. But now, it is gone from this forum, isn't it?",

Leave feedback!Did you see users who left accurate Trust feedback on many accounts? Add them to your Trust list!Anyone can leave feedback, and anyone can customize their Trust list!But unfortunately, many people have a different interpretation.Quote from: tranthidung on July 29, 2022, 02:47:17 AMIncluding someone into your trust list means you trust that one.You forgot the word \"judgement\". Trusting someone with money is not the same as knowing they leave accurate feedback. But since you're excluded from DT1, it doesn't matter to the rest of the forum anymore if you follow a different line of reasoning.Quote from: Timelord2067 on July 28, 2022, 05:24:54 PMYour vote (simply by having ten or more merits) counts towards others being selected into DT1, so your choices are at work seven days a week year 'round whether or not you are on DT1.A user needs 10 votes to reach DT1, so individual votes barely mean anything.
