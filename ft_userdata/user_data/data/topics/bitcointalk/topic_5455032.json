Maybe this topic will save the Meta section from turning into [UNBAN APPEAL] and will help global moderators to navigate faster in requests for unban.",

      "body": "In fact, according to what Theymos said before, exceptions to permaban and giving a second chance to a banned forum member can be granted in special cases where that member is of great importance to the entire forum due to his reputation, because of his great contribution to the entire forum community etc.Such cases are very rare, but the number of merits can be one of the indicators of the importance and reputation of an individual member for this forum and maybe show whether that member has a real chance to get a new chance on this forum after permaban.Theymos always takes into account the opinion of the forum community before making a final decision.Quote from: theymos on February 24, 2019, 03:57:17 PMThere's been no policy change. redsn0w wasn't permanently banned due to several factors which made me think that permabanning him would be a net negative for the forum. Nobody is banned strictly because of \"the rules\"; it's always handled case-by-case, but almost always, plagiarists deserve to be permabanned.If you think that a ban should be ended, make your case in a new topic from a \"good for the forum as a whole\" perspective.",

Maybe on a very good day, moderators may want to review ban appeals and with this thread it will be easy to locate the appeals.I don't actually know why you approached the OP with so much -ve energy. If you feel the OP did rubbish you could atleast scroll pass and allow others to contribute  Op, I see that such a thread existed...just that it was abandoned and last update 2019. You can make this more standard and keep updating it.",

It's either the issue gets resolved which renders the appeal thread unusefull or the account in question gets revoked.Either ways, a thread such as this seems unnecessary for me. Should one need yo make reference to appeals, they could always use the forum search function.Like others have said, it's irrelevant creating this sort of thread and I doubt anyone would be submitting appeals to you. Those who owns an appeal thread could always just bump it should they need it at the top of discussions.",

Why it's too hard to understand the purpose? I find it useful. He just combined the data and added the ban appeal thread link here in case moderators want to take a look. Indeed, the right decision was already made. But, Don't forget that if a ban appeal were created and they got some support from the community, moderators might unban them. This thread could help both Banned users and moderators as well. I didn't know that many ban appeals were made. Let's say someone was banned and created a ban appeal thread. Some prominent members know them and see the user as a good asset. They might want to help them by supporting their ban appeal. From this thread, more people will be able to review their ban appeal and leaves their opinion about the ban. If a banned user gets a good number of support from the community and moderators feel they deserve a chance, they might unban them. Global mods are not always active. they might miss some of the ban appeals. This thread's data could be useful for them as well. They can check the ban appeals from here as well.",

I had no idea it happened that way years back but based on my existence on this platform I thought OP did not calculate or possibly missed it somewhere so I had to call OP attention to it for correction. As you have said, I am just knowing or hearing it for the first time that merits was airdropped based on forum rank achievement then. Now I get it clear why OP did that and it seems that was the only efforts that account has made in getting merits  since their existence here.It is nice you mentioned that Sir.
