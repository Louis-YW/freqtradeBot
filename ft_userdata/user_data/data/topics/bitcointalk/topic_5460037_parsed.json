  "content": "So there was this platform, that I came across a few months ago and I'm not sure if I shared about it here or not but I want to check it out again.IIRC, the platform/bot used AI and wasn't available for everyone, so you couldn't just make an account and start trading (at least not back then). I also believe they had a partnership with OKX?The site had a very basic layout, nothing too fancy or complicated. I'm not sure if anyone here came across it before, but if you did, I'd appreciate it if you could share the link.",
