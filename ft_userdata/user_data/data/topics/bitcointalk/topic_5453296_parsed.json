  "content": "I broadcasted a low fee (11sat/vbyte) transaction last week, just at the time when they fees went up.I knew that the fee was low and that the transaction would take a few days to confirm (according to https://twitter.com/CoreFeeHelper , it would take around 3 days) but it's been a week and my transaction is still in the mempool. Sometimes my wallet (electrum) shows it with a blue \"unbroadcasted\" icon and I have to rebroadcast it again. I also sometimes use \"free\" tx accelerator services which basically rebroadcast the transaction everywhere.My question is what is the algorithm that a miner picks a transaction from the mempool to include it to a block?Is it a greedy algorithm which just picks the ones with highest fees? Is the \"age\" of a transaction in the mempool also a factor? Or is it just a combination of fee and a random choice?",

I have tried most of these accelerator services, but they are not much different from where my transaction was before.I think you are talking about RBF or replace-by-fee, while CPFP is the receiving end making a transaction with higher fees so when the child transaction is included on the block, the parent transaction will also be included.The speed of the Bitcoin transaction to be confirmed is dependent on the fee.  I do not think there is any algorithm that can bypass the transaction fee hierarchy except if a huge mining farm operator decides to include low fees when they mined a block which rarely happens since most mining farm operator has the default option of picking the highest transaction fee before the lower ones.",

Highest total fees after filling up the blocks is probably how they go, rather than just blind highest fees (e.g. if you can fit 11 txs with average fee of 10.1 sat/byte rather than just 10 txs with 11 sat/byte, that's what they'd go).You can't really blame \"greedy\" algorithm, OP. It's a cost-revenue thing, quite literally.Obviously, you can still see low fee txs, I suspect that's paid for in different ways (e.g. viabtc's paid accelerator... as opposed to broadcasting, which doesn't... accelerate).",

The more fee rate you use for your transaction, the faster it can be included in the blockchain. @OP, if you are in a hurry to make a transaction, increasing the fee rate will ensure that you are given priority and you will not have to wait so much. In the mempool every transaction has a priority depending on the fee used if you check, there is a low priority fee for people not in a hurry, medium priority and high priority depending on how quickly you want your transaction.

I won't call the algorithm greedy rather I'll say it rational. If you see in a real world this is only the case. You'll always pick up highest paying person when you are given an option to do just a small task for someone. Can't blame miners when they do this.Talking about rebroadcast. So rebroadcast does nothing but brings your transaction in the top of the pool again for miners to choose. But eventually if the fees is low and the current rate is still higher there are very less chances any miner will still pick it. If you really want to do the transaction your best bet will be to make it to redo the transaction with the higher fees the old one will get declined automatic.",

I have asked a very similar question here and o_e_l_e_o kindly answered in detail. If you read that post I think everything should be answered. Miners will process transactions paying the highest fees and they are constantly building a \"candidate\" block which is adjusted on a highest fee first principle until the next block gets mined. Even if you are part of the candidate block for a second, your tx will only confirm once it is part of the candidate block that then also gets mined. Until your tx could be dropped and another one paying a higher fee be included instead. This is why I thought broadcasting a tx when fees are low in a certain moment will also ensure that your tx gets processed, but that was wrong because it could still get dropped again if the block hasn't been mined and a higher fee tx gets preferred over yours.",
