  "content": "Mining will continue:Bitcoin technology company Blockstream has announced that it plans to reveal its highly anticipated Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miner in the third quarter of 2024. This marks the culmination of years of engineering work for the company. Blockstream CEO and co-founder Adam Back made the announcement during the company's inaugural media briefing. In 2021, Blockstream acquired Bitcoin mining hardware maker Spondoolies.Previously, Blockstream successfully raised $125 million to expand its mining operations, and the company now plans to secure further funding. Initially scheduled for a 2022 launch, the release of the new ASIC miner has been delayed, and Back now expects it to be available in the latter half of 2024. Back explained that there are two manufacturing approaches, with the first being a test run referred to as a \"shuffle run,\" which is anticipated to take place in the third quarter of the following year.",

NOTWell, it would be pretty useless to announce the specs when the miner is at least a year away from coming to the market, this will only make competitors aware of the specs and rush to make a better/cheaper one.With that said, I don't imagine they will have much success in competing against Bitmain and MicroBT, if the miner is made in the U.S and isn't subject to the U.S tax on Chinese products that would give them a 20% price advantage when selling to U.S miners, but will that be enough to offset the manufacturing cost in the U.S vs China? I highly doubt it.Besides, Bitmain is already ahead in this regard and they started migrating the production out of China to places like Malaysia, MicroBT has some production in Thailand, so that tax advantage can't be there forever, I don't see a bright future for this project, but let's wait and see.",

      "body": "Quote from: ETFbitcoin on June 22, 2023, 11:58:44 AMThat makes sense, but i agree their announcement isn't useful since they don't even mention any advantage of their ASIC (e.g. most energy efficient, low maintenance).It is useful for them, they need to announce it in order to raise funds, so it's either they secretly announce the specs to the investor or the investors would blindly invest in the project which is likely the case.QuoteIn addition, it's known what Blockstream product have mixed result. For example, their satellite and Core Lightning (LN software/library) are great, but Liquid (Bitcoin layer 2/side-chain) and Green (software wallet) has some issues with small user base.That's a good point, and that is just the software level, this is going to be a combination of both software and hardware, Intel tried to make mining chips and sold them to mostly western companies (U.K, U.S, and Canadain based) such as Hive Blockchain Technologies, and ARGO, it's evident that all of them failed in competing with the Chinese giants, and intel had to stop it's mining chips production.Blockstream is now probably limited to TSMC (Bitmain's friend) or Samsung (MicroBT's friend), they need to outperform the chip design and cost. So unless they have invented or discovered something new, it will be very difficult to beat the Chinese in this regard, and all of this could just be another failed project.",

But talking about hardware and mining,1. They also create hardware wallet called Blockstream Jade. But it's relative new product.2. They have 2 service about mining which are Blockstream Energy and Blockstream Mining. But it's not aimed for individual, so we don't know how good or popular are those services.But at least they shouldn't be clueless about mining/ASIC.",

      "body": "Bitmain's S19 Bitcoin Miners Account for Bulk of Network Hashrate, Says New Research Three models of Bitmain mining rigs account for 76% of computing power on the bitcoin network, according to new research published by Coinmetrics on Tuesday.The Antminer S19j Pro accounts for 34.3% of the network hashrate and the S19 for 28.1%, and they have been the most used machines on the network since March 2021, Coinmetrics found. The Antminer S19 XP accounts for another 13.7% of the network hashrate, said the report. Meanwhile, MicroBT's M50 is below the threshold of detectability, the researchers said.Blockstream will have a hard time competing with Bitmain, but Blockstream has a big business of mining and hosting mining hardware.",
