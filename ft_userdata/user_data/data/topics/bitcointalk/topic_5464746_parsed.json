In some cases you want to search for information you have no data on, you don't have any option but to the a broad search. Quote from: Bureau on August 28, 2023, 06:10:03 AMThere is another option that is always available if anyone is unable to use the internal search or Google search. You can go ahead and ask the community and you will surely  recieve helpful guidance in an ethical manner. I would prefer asking the community over Google Dorking search. It is imperative to learn how to use the internal search because it is the easiest means of researching on the forum and the community will always refer you to this option. It is after you have tried and failed to get the information that you can come back to ask from the community.",

      "body": "On the matter of using Google search, I often use it with different search patterns, and one of them is to browse through bitcoin related news over a given period of time. Unfortunately, as of late, I’m getting a lot of junk in the search results, with dozens of entries pointing to a single same domain that apparently (as per Google’s short description on the result’s entry) verses on bitcoin, but that are really pointing to a suspicious site that has nothing to do with the topic that leads you there. Something like what I show on the captured image in this post.If anyone encounters a similar situation, whilst still wanting to use Google to search for their bitcoin news, they can resort to excluding the malicious domain from their Google search pattern like this:Code:bitcoin -inurl:https://www.asiainsurancereview.comThe above is one of the said malicious domains that’s managing to appear on my Google search results under false claims of providing bitcoin news. The \"-inurl:\" excludes the site from the results.",

A lot of good information on how to search efficiently is provided by various Legendary members, should help them a lot. And let's not forget lmgtfy.com, It's a fun website which is sort of a joke that stands for \"Let me google that for you\". I have used it in the past and people usually get upset when you reply it with it.",
