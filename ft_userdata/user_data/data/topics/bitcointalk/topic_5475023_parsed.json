With several tokenization platforms currently emerging, world will need a standardized platform like ASSETX to facilitate the trading of these assets.Additionally, tokenized assets and NFTs (asset-backed NFTs) are entirely distinct concepts. You might want to delve deeper into understanding the differences between them.Quote from: Vod on December 01, 2023, 12:05:26 AMI connected with you per your request.   Please don't.

If you intend to pursue a project to fruition, you must be open to constructive criticism and not attacking people with words when they state their concerns. Imagine handing your finances to someone rude just because he has a business idea.The last time you walked into a bank and got attneded to sub-substandardly, that bank lost a client, if it continues in that dierection, it seizes to exist. Investors (which you are soliciting for) care more about these than solutions. You might want to revisit the approach of entrepreneurs towards pushing businesses.",
