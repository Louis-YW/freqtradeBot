No idea how they managed to get this all sorted within a little over a week. Not sure who will headline out of the two co-mains but I'm sure we'll get a face-off between Aj and Wilder after and especially if they both win their fights.Full line up:https://boxing-social.com/news/card-confirmed-for-joshua-wilder/QuoteAnthony Joshua-Otto WallinJoshua looks to make it three for three this year against Swedish southpaw, Otto Wallin. Wallin took Tyson Fury the distance back in 2019 and has built back with six wins. The currently ranked IBF number two could provide a stern test for ‘AJ’ but, if he passes, a statement win would end his 2023 on a high. He’s expected to fight Wilder in the first half of 2024.Deontay Wilder-Joseph ParkerThe Joshua fight will only be the case should Wilder beat Parker, the former world champion who has bounced back from a punishing loss to Joe Joyce with three lower-level wins. The American looks to add a 43rd knockout to his record.Dmitry Bivol-Lyndon ArthurBivol was facing a year of inactivity before this card came about, but will now fight his one bout of 2023 against the UK’s Lyndon Arthur, who has built up four wins since his loss to Anthony Yarde. Bivol will be looking to remain undefeated, keep his WBC Light-Heavyweight World Title and push for a unification against Artur Beterbiev.Jai Opetaia-Ellis ZorroOpetaia takes on his second British opponent in a matter of months, this time defending his IBF Cruiserweight World Title against 17-0 Ellis Zorro. A win for the Aussie sets him on the path of defending his belt in a rematch against the man he won if from – Mairis Breidis.Daniel Dubois-Jarrell MillerThe post-fight debate of Dubois’ loss to Oleksandr Usyk in his world title attempt was all about a low-blow, but many felt they didn’t see enough heart from the young UK heavyweight. That will need to be on show throughout fight week and in the ring against undefeated brash American, Jarrell Miller – best known on these shores for squandering an opportunity to face Anthony Joshua by failing doping tests.Arslanbek Makhmudov-Agit KabayelTwo undefeated heavyweights collide, with Makhmudov the one with the momentum despite being three years older than 31-year-old Kabayel. The Russian looks to keep up his reputation as a knockout artist against Germany’s Kabayel, who has has fought once per year since 2017.Frank Sanchez-Junior FaUndefeated Cuban heavyweight Frank Sanchez faces New Zealand’s Junior Fa, who was knocked out by Lucas Browne in one round in mid-2022 before returning with a low-level win this year. Sanchez, trained by Eddy Reynoso of Canelo fame, looks to move 24-0.Fillip Hrgovic-Mark Di MoriIBF number one contender Filip Hrgovic faces 41-year-old Mark De Mori in the strangest match-up of the card. De Mori was knocked out by David Haye in one round back in 2016, but has recorded 11 wins since in mostly eight rounders. Fans expect Hrgovic to keep his mandatory position.",

It is natural for me to support Anthony Joshua when he fights, so I will still be supporting him in this fight, and hope that he can knock the lights out of Wallin when they meet in December which will be a good statement to say he is ready for Wilder. I will like to see the Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder fight.",

However, before they face off in the boxing ring, they are unaware that the boxing organization has another plan for them. The new rule, which calls for Wilder and Joshua to fight independently and prevail before their fight takes place by next year, is intended to demonstrate their physical strength and position as being among the world's best boxers. They(Wilder or Joshua) can't earn it without having a tough opponent from time to time.",

Despite the lop-sided odds, I still think Parker can upset Wilder. As to Joshua vs. Wallin, I'm not expecting much. It will probably be not as explosive as the other bout.",

Despite being still young AJ is not as good as before after his first loss or there are just fighters that he couldn't really beat because of the Southpaw stance. Saudi is ramping up because people there are hungry for entertainment and they are very rich to hold events like this. Ngannou could have been in this card if he just agreed to fight Wilder.

But most important of all is that he may just have a rank in WBC once he gets into the legitimate 12-round bout and not just the crossover fight hype. Fighting Wilder will put him as a pro boxer.He is hoping that Fury will once again fight him when he knows it will take long because Arum already arranged for Fury vs Usyk and all they are waiting for is injuries to be healed.",

I believe both AJ and Wilder aren't as mentally stable as before. But in these fights, AJ is fighting the better opponent. The last time there were odds between these 2 popular heavyweights was when they were undefeated and AJ is always favored. Wallin is unbeaten since losing a decision to Fury a few years ago so he will be more confident of an upset while Parker at this current stage of his career is just too slow to threaten the unskillful but dynamite-fisted Wilder.But I'll be more interested in seeing the world champions in this event, Dmitry Bivol and Jai Opetaia. Jai had confirmed that he will be helping Tyson Fury after his fight. The bad news is Jai also vacated his belt already because he prefers the life-changing offer in this event rather than face his mandatory.",

The thing is, when Wilder struggles against his opponents, he tends to lose, and that has only happened against Fury. So, against Parker, I believe it could be an easy KO for Wilder. Despite being defeated by Fury, Wilder is making a comeback, and if he continues to improve his ranking, there's a good chance he'll make a strong return.Looking ahead to Fury vs. Usyk, if Fury wins, both AJ and Wilder might be forced to fight the champion for another shot. If that happens, fans might not be as excited, given Wilder's previous losses to Fury. However, against AJ, it could be different as we haven't seen him fight Fury. Yet, according to the books, AJ appears to be an easy target for Fury. These are just possibilities for the future, so for more exciting bouts in the heavyweight division, let's hope Usyk can beat Fury, as things could become uncertain against AJ or Wilder.",

They started to become a boxing hub, not that we don't like to see fights happening in the Middle East, but they have open their doors and willing to shell out money to have this kind of stage in their country. And I do agree that we haven't seen this kind of card  that is pretty much stacked up. As for Bivol, I was surprised to read that he had his hands operated. So meaning that he has been suffering pain in his right now during his win against the cash cow Canelo Alvarez. But now that it is completely healed, then there should be no problems and it will be scary to see Bivol hand's throwing at 100%. So hopefully after this win, we can see him and Beterbiev fight in the future for the undisputed LHW champion.",

Despite being defeated by Fury, Wilder is making a comeback, and if he continues to improve his ranking, there's a good chance he'll make a strong return.Looking ahead to Fury vs. Usyk, if Fury wins, both AJ and Wilder might be forced to fight the champion for another shot. If that happens, fans might not be as excited, given Wilder's previous losses to Fury. However, against AJ, it could be different as we haven't seen him fight Fury. Yet, according to the books, AJ appears to be an easy target for Fury. These are just possibilities for the future, so for more exciting bouts in the heavyweight division, let's hope Usyk can beat Fury, as things could become uncertain against AJ or Wilder.I think against Ortiz, he also struggle as Ortiz is very strong in the first early rounds. But when Wilder started to get hot and then he is hitting those bombs against Ortiz, it was just a matter of time before he caught him good and knock him down. However, against Fury it's a different story though, Tyson Fury was really controlling the fight and didn't get Wilder some space to make him comfortable.And I do agree that this fight is just a busy fight for the two, Wilder and Joshua.We might hear Parker and Wallin talking about derailing the supposedly Wilder vs Joshua. But I don't think that there will be surprises here.",

If that happens, I agree with your that Wilder would be the favorite. And I also think that Wilder might knockout Joshua. That is the plan in the beginning, Wilder and Joshua having a tune up with low risk opponents, just to get that cobwebs out before this two fight at the undercard of Usyk vs Fury. So far Parker 5:1 underdog against Wilder. Otto Wallin, almost 4:1 underdog. So that speaks that this is just a confidence boosting match.The odds will be decided only after the fights because it also depends on how they perform. I believe both AJ and Wilder aren't as mentally stable as before. But in these fights, AJ is fighting the better opponent. The last time there were odds between these 2 popular heavyweights was when they were undefeated and AJ is always favored. Wallin is unbeaten since losing a decision to Fury a few years ago so he will be more confident of an upset while Parker at this current stage of his career is just too slow to threaten the unskillful but dynamite-fisted Wilder.But I'll be more interested in seeing the world champions in this event, Dmitry Bivol and Jai Opetaia. Jai had confirmed that he will be helping Tyson Fury after his fight. The bad news is Jai also vacated his belt already because he prefers the life-changing offer in this event rather than face his mandatory.Yes it is interesting to watch the world champions in this event as well but the reality is that Bivol and Jai's matches are more lop-sided than Wilder and Joshua's. They are all favorites but Wilder has odds of 1.15 and Joshua has 1.22. On the other hand, the inactive Bivol has odds of 1.01 and Jai has the same 1.01. If odds truly reflect the probabilities of all fighters to win then Wilder and Joshua's opponents have better chances of getting an upset than Bivol and Jai's. It seems Bivol and Jai are already sure winners if we look at their odds.",
