There serval reason for the S to be used as you know in the mini private keys there some uppercase, lowercase and Numbers mixture with the total 30 characters. So sometimes what happen people gets confused with the 0 and O for this reason in Base58Check encoding for error free encoding of data eliminates such latter's and numbers.Simple answer is because its Base58Check so it starts with \"S\" as for the public keys there some standards.Taproot address - P2TR : bc1pBech32 / Segwit: bc1qScript address: 3Legacy address: 1  Quote from: Upgrade00 on March 06, 2023, 08:08:40 PMYou could also wait for other members who may have more appropriate answers to respond, if there is such answer.There is no such answer as its commonly considered because of its encoding type..",

Is there a specific reason for it? I would imagine so but I dont know what it might be. The reason why mini private keys always start with the uppercase letter \"S\" is that cryptocurrency users need to somehow distinguish important information from random gibberish. That is why standards exist. For example, if you are familiar with standards describing the creation of these mini private keys, every time you see a string starting with \"S\" and consisting of 30 characters, you immediately assume that it is a key that can be converted to another key. But how do you know how to convert it? Again, mini private key specifications describe the process: just take a sha256 of a given string, convert it to WIF format, and import it to your wallet. Without standards dictating in which format data needs to be written to be distinguished from other types of data, you would have to try hundreds of different algorithms to convert it to a correct output.",

If you look into bitcoin addresses, you will discover that same pattern of letter is common to each type of address generated, either legacy, taproot or segwit address all have their own unique identification character they begins with, so that once seing any you could easily predict the address type, this is also common to other cryptocurrencies, each have a unique means of identifying their own addresses, but the reason to using this is best known to them, but what we could predict is for easy identification.",
