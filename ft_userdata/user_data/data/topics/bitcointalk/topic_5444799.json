  "content": "I wanted to start a new thread.  This is a pre-sale with no payment required at this point; however, please be serious if you are ordering.This is only for large quantities, 200 or more chips.  Price is 52 cents per chip payable in BTC after I receive the chips (plus shipping from my ZIP 85044 to yours).Please DM me an order such as this:Denomination   Quantity$1   $5   $10   $25   $100   $500   $1,000   $2,500   $5,000   $10,000   $25,000   $50,000   The individual set of 12 will be available, after I get enough interest to lock in the price.  NO NEED TO RESPOND if you only want the set of 12.Sorry for the multiple posts, but I am trying to do this without profit, hence why the back and forth.Final proof is here:If I cannot get the 2,000 chip order threshold, I will see still move forward.  I am going to likely make 2 sets of chips for myself (1 for sure, 1 if needed to hit the 2k threshold).   No deposit needed, I will only ask for BTC after I have the chips in my possession.Thanks!Mark",

Reminder, this is a one time deal, I will not create a 2nd batch.  If anyone else is interested, please let me know in the next 24 hours.  Again, this is for the large quantity orders.   For commemorative, there will be a very very limited number of 12 chips and I think those are now all spoken for from the previous thread and or direct message. Thanks!Mark",

BTW, the set looks great!",
