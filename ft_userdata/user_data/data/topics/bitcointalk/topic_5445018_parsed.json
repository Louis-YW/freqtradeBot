  "content": "In my opinion, if you buy some bitcoins instead of keeping money in the bank, you can benefit from the current market.  Because Bitcoin is known as the godfather of digital currency around the world.  Your bank will give you a small profit on your capital month after month.  And besides, the bank can be robbed.  But if you keep buying bitcoins then bitcoins will not be lost at all. Even if the price drops a bit it will reach such a price and height that your capital will be doubled.  So I think it is better to buy bitcoins than bank.  Then he acts as he pleases.  This is my personal opinion.  thank you",

We can praise bitcoin all day but there are downsides to this as well, bitcoin is volatile and is unpredictable, while the bank interests of a savings account may be small, for bitcoin it may take longer that you think before you get x2 of your capital. If a bank gets robbed, your money is insured by the bank and the robbery doesn’t affect your money. For bitcoins, if you lose your private keys or store your bitcoins in a centralized exchange or closed-source wallet you stand the risk of losing all your bitcoins with no hope of refund. One of the best things about bitcoin is that you get to be your own bank, but it is a responsibility that some people do not handle well.",

Fees and delays with withdrawals are the downside of banking and also taxes of ofcourse. But its edge over other digital assets such as cryptocurrency is for being widely used acrossed countries.
