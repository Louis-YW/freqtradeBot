Haven't you thought of those who have been scammed before? Do you want it to happen to people?",

Story is quite impressing, like after reading the news shared by Charles-Tim, it says, Binance came to know about Nigerian Binanace exchange when SEC sued Nigerian Exchange. Like how it can be possible for binance a big exchange to bear someone using there name and benefiting themselves while real Binance is earning nothing.  Well, let's see where this fud leads to, as nigeria is a big hub of crypto users and i am really interested to know how much traffic that local exchange was getting. I hope, if op could share the link to that exchange (local one) if it still exists.This is something new, as scammer do make exchanges with the main purpose of scamming peoples and those are know as fake exchanges, but I did not know they would use the same name as of Binance.",

CZ is the owner of Binance while Binance Nigeria use their brand name impersonating that they are local Binance for Nigeria. Most likely this company is scam a like even they are still not scamming anyone for now because legit business will not use a popular brand name without permission. This is a clear sign of malicious business and using this services is very risky. It’s clear that Binance Nigeria is impersonating and leeching the Binance popularity.I’m not from Nigeria but I assume most of its user mistook it as local branch of Binance that’s why they use it.",

It's less of an accusation directly at this company, although who knows what \"extracurricular\" activity this local entity got up to, and more of a swipe at Binance as a whole which is getting targeted worldwide by almost every regulator. They cannot go after the larger company, only attempt to take a cut by targeting this smaller subsidiary that was setup to handle operations in a single country. It's a common setup for most major multinational organizations and you are likely confused with \"scam\" and \"fraudulent\" which have widely different contexts. They might be committing fraud by not adhering to the laws of the country, but otherwise be operating reasonably legitimately, but scam implies that there is nothing real about the operation when they are fairly successful at offering trading / exchange services.",

Those who came up with this plan and set it up must be highly clever, as well as eager for Binance's attention in the country. I'm not sure what their primary goal was, but effectively creating and managing similar businesses in another country and reaping the rewards raises red flags for me. It was commendable that CZ came out publicly and called the company's operations a sham. This was only feasible because it occurred in a country where the laws were not as stringent. If they've been running it for a long, the government should have requested the SEC to tax them for their operations in the country by now. There will be no more panic for the average Nigerians that are sourcing for income from the use of binance p2p.",
