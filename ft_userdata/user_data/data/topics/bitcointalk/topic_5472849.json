Your coins would be a once upon a time It’s been a popular complaints here and that’s because, some beginners are more matured than others and some don’t really know what they are out here to do just yet and how pro-Nigerians here worked themselves out to archive this milestone.It was a hard win victory to have got ourselves this space where we could be free to be Nigerians and be that Nigerian with a quality and having to see some users just come around and downplay all the efforts that’s been put in really hurts.Maybe it’s because there isn’t exactly any moderation to the locale yet, we still try to see ourselves as one Nigeria/Nigerians as it ought to be and perhaps these guys don’t understand just how hard won the efforts took in consistency and years but, I would say, let’s not push our luck here.You guys have to watch it. If you were introduced on here by someone, seek there consult on certain activities you perpetuate on here and those bringing in these users, be dutiful to coach them not to spam, it’s absurd.",

In as much as local board is all about discussing crypto and other related country issues doesn't mean that we should be bombarding our local board with information that are not even supposed be discussing here, also if we watch closely you will see that there are more than three the same topic in local board and they keep doing it all the time. Actually I no that we are all trying to make our local board very active and entertaining but we should abstain from creating unnecessary topics and repeating topics because it doesn't make sense.",

I believe we are mostly focusing on replying on topics instead of creating much topics which I know is a good steps, I know everyone wants to grow in knowledge and in rank but lets do it responsible without littering the board or turning it to a competition ground where topic are flying like bullets, actually no rules that says we shouldn't creates much topics or much post but we should act responsibly that is why if you checked at plagiarism section you would see lots of people has been reported.",

I have came across similiar conductive complainers threads as this, but cautions has never been adhered.It has been suggested recently to have an off topic board where posts that are irrelevant and not adding value to the community can be moved there. The number of new topics created in this local board have increased since the local board was granted this year. It will be very sad to see a reduced number of posters here because of restrictions putting in place to regulate the board of shit posting or irrelevant topics. That will not be nice, but while wanting a lot of discussions in the local board and making it a good place for community members, we should also adhere to posting quality content here in the local board.",

I believe say some of dem dey do as a kind of advertising strategy to take get more people to read their post, but the fact be say, if person no find the content of you post useful e nor go give you merit. Though another thing wey I get to talk na be say, even sometimes our big boss dem for this local board dey say, one of the function of the local na for newbies dem to dey post until dem don sabi post good quality post, before make dem spread their hand outside the LB.

And it's very annoying knowing that some newbies create spamming post without referencing the thread or post dey got their idea from, that is why is I am still saying newbies please do enough study about the forum and not only about Bitcoin, yes Bitcoin is the major aim of this forum but the forum on the other hand has rules that are supposed to be respected. With just little knowledge about this forum rules you are good to go provided you'll obey them, one thing that makes you rank up easily is not because of your vast knowledge about Bitcoin alone, your discipline and originality of your posts also matter.

If you are asking for knowledge, from research you can get that because if you go back to your  first topic in the forum,  when you introduce yourself, there are many educational links that have been shared with you in order for you to understand and know many things about bitcoin. So to me, if you can engage in adequate research, you will have great knowledge in which you will be ready to teach others because if you base it on just the local board, you won’t have enough adequate knowledge. What you need is not that in this local board there is not a good adequate topic in which you can have knowledge, but when you engage in other boards, you will have more knowledge of understanding. I will suggest beginners and help and bitcoin discussion for you to have more knowledge for knowing.",
