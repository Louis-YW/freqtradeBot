      "body": "I remember the worse pain ever felt in my entire life was when I passed a Kidney Stone. I was walking in a parking lot going to get some dinner and I suddenly fell over in a extreme feeling of pain. There was a ambulance called for me and I went right to the emergency room, I will never forget this day for the rest of my life.  The Doctors told me this was a worse feeling of pain then a woman giving birth to her child. I can not wish this pain on my biggest enemy it was so painful.",

      "body": "I’ve never had a kidney stone but my sister had gallstones & had to have the whole gallbladder removed. She said it was the worst pain she’s ever experienced. It’s important to be aware of your body & see your doctor if you experience any ached or pains.Kidney stones are very unpleasant but not life threatening. They’re usually diagnosed by having an ultrasound scan. Just be aware of any changes you see & report them to a doctor. Delaying seeing a doctor can cause you much more problems & much more pain.",
