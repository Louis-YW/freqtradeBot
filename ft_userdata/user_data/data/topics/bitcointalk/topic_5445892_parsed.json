  "content": "Betting on sports is a fun way to spend time and it's a great tool to make watching sports more interesting. No doubt why it's so popular.But it has never been introduced in crypto industry till these days. There is a project - Better Fan - which is a leader of betting on sports in crypto. They called it Predict-To-Earn. Better Fan app is easy-to-use, beautifully designed and very unique. Here is a link to the app, check it yourself: https://app.better.fanYou can register with your Gmail, connect Metamask and enjoy betting on different kind of sports. It's in Beta now, so everything is basically free but the tokens you win for predicting will stay with you in mainnet. Now is a good time to start exploring Better Fan. I genuinely recommend you to look at them. Start with CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/better-for-fans/On CoinMarketCap you are going to find everything you need. Predict-To-Earn is definitely has a potential and if it blows up, you know who is going to lead this. It's Better Fan.Now the marketing has to step in. There is a potential and it needs to be advertised. What do you think? How Better Fan can bring more people into this industry?",
