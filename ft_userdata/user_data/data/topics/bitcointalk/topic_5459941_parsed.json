I often wonder what would have i done if there would be cryptos around back when i was young, i most likely would have taken a student loan and buy them. Which is a horrible idea i know. But that would have only way for me to aquire them as i didn't have a job that would pay enough and neither i had rich parents.",

It's just like any other industry out there imo, just that there are a lot more opportunities here since it's new, and there's a lot of information that's available since it was released in an age where the internet was prospering. Proof of that is there are a lot of young people who were able to take advantage of the boom of crypto, but at the same time there were also a LOT of untold people who got lost in their way and just crashed. Plus, in this industry if you want to be a developer of it, you'd either have to study marketing or development. Some people who just didn't (or don't want to) study this would have to go to investing, which is another whole study, so it's not really for everyone, especially for young people who tend to not like studying, at all. It also doesn't help that this section isn't really taught to them in school.",

It caused problems to some project after the public knows that the developers where young ones, community doesn't really believe that young people can handle projects and they don't think that the money they put into them wouldn't be used properly.
