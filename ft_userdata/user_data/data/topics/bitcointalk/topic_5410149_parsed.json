  "content": "QuoteMany Big Tech companies have been laying off then employees and the latest company to join the list is Google. According to reports, Google executives have warned workers to either boost performance or prepare to leave. Insider report revealed that a company-wide message said that if the next quarterly earnings has not improved there will be \"there will be blood on the streets\".The report also claimed that Google Cloud sales leadership has threatened employees with an \"overall examination of sales productivity and productivity in general\" before the third quarter evaluation. The message has left Google employees \"fearful of layoffs\". The news comes after Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported weaker-than-expected earnings, and revenue growth was slowed down to 13 percent from 62 percent in the same quarter last year, April to June.Another report in The New York Post revealed that recently Google also quietly extended its hiring freeze this month. The company had decided to stop hiring new candidates for few weeks to review the current employees and decide on the future course.Last month, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai had also told employees that they must improve productivity due to fierce economic headwinds. He asked for ideas on how to get better results faster, he was quoted saying, \"There are real concerns that our productivity as a whole is not where it needs to be for the head count we have.\"According to Pichai, \"it's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead\".For the unversed, some of the other companies that have resorted to layoff include LinkedIn, Meta, Oracle, Twitter, Nvidia, Snap, Uber, Spotify, Intel and Salesforce, among others.https://in.mashable.com/culture/36747/google-executives-warn-employees-about-layoffs-says-there-will-be-blood-on-streets....It appears many silicon valley icons are resorting to layoffs in an effort to boost flagging profits:QuoteSome of the other companies that have resorted to layoff include LinkedIn, Meta, Oracle, Twitter, Nvidia, Snap, Uber, Spotify, Intel and Salesforce, among others.Another route they could take is to cut CEO salaries. I don't know if CEO's earning $10,000 an hour is a good payrate in terms of their productivity and overall value to the company. Bill Gates said most of his time as CEO of microsoft was spent reading and responding to emails. I would guess the daily structure of tech CEOs in the modern era hasn't changed. CEO's likely spend most of their time reading and answering emails. Unless they're the CEO of tesla or space x who spends a lot of time doing actual field work and testing.It will be interesting to see how much of a hit to US GDP these layoffs and potential economic recession contribute. Silicon Valley is arguably the backbone of the american economy. Its a huge part of why california would have the 5th largest economy in the world if it were ranked as a country. Layoffs and slowdowns there could affect american wealth and standard of living significantly.",

Quote from: Hydrogen on August 16, 2022, 10:26:06 PMIt appears many silicon valley icons are resorting to layoffs in an effort to boost flagging profits:...Another route they could take is to cut CEO salaries. I think that in some cases it could be positive for companies to reduce CEO salaries and make workers participate in profits, either with a percentage of net profit, stocks or similar options, but being private companies, it is something they have to clarify with their shareholders. Quote from: Hydrogen on August 16, 2022, 10:26:06 PMBill Gates said most of his time as CEO of microsoft was spent reading and responding to emails. I would guess the daily structure of tech CEOs in the modern era hasn't changed.This example you give could not be more biased. For starters, Bill Gates was not just a CEO, he is the one who founded the company. But I can assure you that an important part of the work of CEOs of non-tech companies today consists of answering emails, in addition to phone calls and videoconference meetings.But the emails they respond to are not the kind that can be answered by the last employee to join the company, which you seem to put on a par. Or I don't know if you are one of those who believe that for someone to get paid a lot for their work they have to sweat and can't get paid a lot for being in front of an air-conditioned computer in the office. Anyway, nothing new, as soon as the economy recovers, these companies will hire again, offering quite high salaries, but they will not make a drama in the media about it.",

They draw the cycles like this (sorry for the poor paint job). The economy grows but the debt grows too, then there is small high inflation periods when economy shrinks (the green dumps) but eventually all of it is accumulated and causes a massive dump that they can't do anything about regardless of how they change interest rates, etc. That is when the recession occurs (the red part) and the economy crashes.Due to the way the debt-based economy works they must have recessions like this, in other words it is guaranteed. The last one was in 2008 and we are getting closer to the next one. In fact some people say US is already in a recession.",

They usually have to delegate and ask other execs questions, if they need an answer. You see this happen in earnings reports all the time. If the CEO needs an answer they ask the CTO or another exec. They're usually not hands on enough to keep track and know the details of what is happening in the company. There's nothing in the job description of being a CEO that the average person couldn't do.

Many corporations and institutions admit their CEOs are mere figureheads and spokespersons who do not engage in important decision making regarding the brand they represent.There are engineers and many in the IT field I could cite, who outright lambasted CEOs for typically not being good at their jobs. In Bill Gates case its been rumored he helped write FAT16. The 16 bit, linked list, windows file system. Bill Gates tried to trade all of his shares in microsoft for lotus stock, before windows became successful. For which many accused him of being the worst businessman of his era. If you think Bill Gates has special accolades or accomplishments which put him head and shoulders above the average businessman or entrepreneur, I would be curious to know what they are.",

Now the figures only from the US show that the situation is even worse than it seemed, but no one should be surprised that companies save in this way, because people are always expendable for them.Quote from: https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs-2022/After a banner year for tech, layoffs are here. In fact, as of early August, more than 37,000 workers in the U.S. tech sector have been laid off in mass job cuts so far in 2022, according to a Crunchbase News tally.I will not even comment on the position of any CEO, because there are those who do it very well and deserve to be paid excellently for it, but there are also those who do it very badly and cause damage to the companies they represent. At the end of the day, they are the ones at the top of the pyramid and in difficult times feel the least impact on their position.",

The issue comes down to the fact that tech companies operate a bit different then a lot of other places.Quoting myself:Quote from: DaveF on June 16, 2022, 12:50:07 PMI know someone who was just let go from Gemini. As she put it: Now she gets to spend the summer living off her severance package while doing nothing. As opposed to getting her regular paycheck to do nothing. The project her group was working on ended sometime in late 2021 with the deployment in early 2022. For the last 3 months she joked that her job was head youtube video watcher. So them letting those people go was not a surprise to any of them. BUT had this been a bull market they probably would still be there waiting for the next project while watching videos......If things were a bit different Goggle and others would keep people on because in tech it's usually cheaper to pay someone to do nothing for months and months then it is to fire them, hire someone else later and train them.Picking on Ford, when the orders for a particular model slow up a bit, and you no longer need 3 shifts but only 2 people get shown the door rather quickly. And if needed can be hired right back a few months later with 0 training. Same with a lot of other fields. The odds of a programmer that you let got a few months ago being available are a lot less. So you keep them on if possible. When you have downturns like this that may cover large segments of the industry it *may* be a bit different, but with unemployment at the moment being at an all time low it's a calculated risk.i.e. using the example of my friend above. She was let go around June 1st, did nothing for 2 months. Seriously my girlfriend and I asked if there was a crazy glue accident and she was attached to her couch for life as in do nothing. Anyway, she started looking for a new job last week or the week before and has a start date at the new job Sept 6th. 100% remote work. So it's not like everyone is laying people off. -Dave",

Many corporations and institutions admit their CEOs are mere figureheads and spokespersons who do not engage in important decision making regarding the brand they represent.There are engineers and many in the IT field I could cite, who outright lambasted CEOs for typically not being good at their jobs. In Bill Gates case its been rumored he helped write FAT16. The 16 bit, linked list, windows file system. Bill Gates tried to trade all of his shares in microsoft for lotus stock, before windows became successful. For which many accused him of being the worst businessman of his era. If you think Bill Gates has special accolades or accomplishments which put him head and shoulders above the average businessman or entrepreneur, I would be curious to know what they are.What you say is such nonsense that I doubt what to answer you because we start from such a different vision that we are not going to reach an agreement.So yes, you are right, the training, intelligence and ability that the person who cleans the WC of the company has is the same as that of the CEO.",

The CEO position in a corporation is very similar to being the principal of a school. The job doesn't go to the most talented, hard working or smartest person in the room. There are an entirely different set of criteria for who will be appointed to the role. Which have nothing to do with the work CEOs do being outside the qualifications of the janitor sweeping the floor.MBAs are a fast track to executive and CEO positions. They're known to not do the best job covering the basics. Recently there have been recommendations made to avoid MBAs as they trend towards producing CEOs who don't understand many of the key points of what happens in the company they're head of.Some CEOs are paid upwards of $10,000 an hour. Which is the same as paying 1,000 employees $10 an hour or 500 employees $20 an hour. Unless someone will claim CEOs do as much work as 500 to 1,000 employees. I think we have to agree that they are overpaid.",

      "body": "The corporate companies in America have been doing this a long time. They can't post profits and can't perform well? Blame it on the employees who are doing what they're told and threaten to lay them off if the next quarter is still in a slump. Nothing new here, it's just that Google is a big company that's why they're put on a spot light most of the time. Quote from: Hydrogen on August 16, 2022, 10:26:06 PMAnother route they could take is to cut CEO salaries. I don't know if CEO's earning $10,000 an hour is a good payrate in terms of their productivity and overall value to the company. Bill Gates said most of his time as CEO of microsoft was spent reading and responding to emails. I would guess the daily structure of tech CEOs in the modern era hasn't changed. CEO's likely spend most of their time reading and answering emails. Unless they're the CEO of tesla or space x who spends a lot of time doing actual field work and testing.Doubt they'll be doing this. Even though CEOs don't do much except for being the face of the company, they think that they still deserve the bonus and an absurd amount of salary compared to their hardworking employees who are doing the bulk of the job. This culture will never change no matter the weather, be it an extremely prosperous economic year or an entire year of bad luck. Those at the top will always want to get the \"mile high perks\" while the rest under them are carrying them to get their riches.",
