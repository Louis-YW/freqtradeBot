Here is a link to their page.   https://docs.zkswap.finance/I had received ZKF coins as airdrop sometimes ago, and I am glad to see that this project is progressing and adding new features to its network. I didn't sell tokens and had decided to put them on staking to receive regular staking rewards along with potential  capital gains. Recently they have recently announced their third launch pool project Merlin-chain, which is an interesting project and operates on Bitcoin network.https://twitter.com/BitalkGlobal/status/1759053759316160910",

If you have a min of 100k ZF staked you no longer have to pay gas fees when swapping coins on their DEX.Can you give specific methodologies on how is this possible? The DEX doesn’t have any control to the transaction fee for the network except for those extra they are charging on every trade since DEX transactions is on chain unless your DEX is CEX then this is possible.I’m interested to know how can you cover the transaction fee using the ETH for the Zksync network? Will you refund the gas fee to the users wallet address once they initiate the trade?",

Here is a link to their page.   https://docs.zkswap.finance/Ive used this platform before and got some airdrops they have indeed a good dapp for zksync eco. I only received few but this is a good product, I wished I had focus on this one and allocate more funds before but its fine profit is profit. With their paymaster options which likely boost their token worth probably one of the best alpha on zksynv eco.",
