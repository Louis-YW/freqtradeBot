For bitcoin, I prefer Electrum, it has its own own seed phrase differently, you can import BIP39 seed phrase on Electrum, but you can not import Electrum wallet seed phrase on BIP39 wallets, except Bluewallet. Electrum support lightning payment.I like Bluewallet also, newbies can use it for lightning payment and support BIP39 and Electrum.Never reveal your seed phrase to anyone, anyone that knows it can spend you coin.",

I was not too happy about the need to have only a file backup of your wallet and you had to be careful to always have a backup of the most recent version of your wallet, as there was the possibility to loose keys and funds when your most recent backup was outdated and your last copy of your wallet. (Not going into too much detail why.)I don't remember when I first heard about Armory which to my knowledge first implemented some sort of deterministic key derivation (not compatible to todays HD wallet derivation schemes). Early Armory didn't use normal words, though.Quote from: Bennoko on August 15, 2022, 02:56:50 PM...Could be something with derivation path (but I wouldn't assume this to be a topic in those early years)?Which software version did you use to check your old mnemonic words?",
