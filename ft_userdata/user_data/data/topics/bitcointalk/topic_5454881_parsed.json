What specific series you are interested to watch because most of the series and movie are already available on some streaming website even the newest and ongoing series. You can use Fbox.to or Bilibili app to search for the series that you want. I’m using these website to watch all the series that I want like The Last of Us and so on.You can use IDM if you want to download it. It’s a waste of money if you will purchased a subscription for just a single series that you want while there’s a lot of uploader available online with HD quality too. You can DM if you need help for the setup and apps for the IDM. I have the crack version.",
