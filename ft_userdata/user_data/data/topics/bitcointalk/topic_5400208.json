      "body": "Glad to see Indonesians here offering services, I'll just give you a little feedback on this topic (of course from my POV). First of all, before offering services, you should have portfolios to convince potential clients that your services are good services for them. For signature campaign management and website reviews can seem a little hard to come by, but for translation, it shouldn't be hard to have.You can make a translation of a project topic (announcement) that is on the Announcements (Altcoins) board, then post it on our local board. Apart from that, you can also collect your portfolio by translating a project article on Medium and then reposting it on your Medium page.As you're a good poster on this forum, we have 2 campaigns for review/test at the moment, i suggest you to participate there and then you can make your work there as your portfolio.- Utopia P2P Ecosystem ðŸ’Ž | Review Campaign ðŸ”Ž| Participate Now!- [PAID TESTERS NEEDED] Zenland Marketplace | Up to $30 (open)That's all my feedback, hopefully in the future we will see people who will use your services, and don't forget, you also have to look for them, I mean don't just stay on this topic.",
