      "body": "You can't have an option of both safe and fast since different exchanges have their own advantages and disadvantages.The most safest to buy Monero is using decentralized exchanges, but lack of liquidity e.g. Bisq.The most fast to buy Monero is using popular centralized exchanges, but lack of privacy since they record your IP, email etc and foremost collect your KYC e.g. Binance, Kucoin, FTX.",

Many people do often use same email and password for their personal and exchanges, this will leak your privacy. More over the IP address, they will know your location, you can't use Tor to access KuCoin.",

Avoid Changenow as it's one of those controversial services that has complaints when it comes to freezing funds.Use exchanges that are listed on Kycnot.me like Bisq, Elude, Majestic Bank etcFunny thing is that ChangeNow is listed on Kycnot.me with a score of 7/10, but then they say this about ChangNow's KYC policy:Quote from: https://kycnot.me/exchange/changenowChangeNOW is a non-custodial crypto-to-crypto exchange where you can trade a large number of coins quickly, conveniently, registration-free, and without any limits. Although it normally does not require KYC it could be that one of your transactions is marked as suspicious and then they will require you a KYC procedure. The suspicious transaction detection system is not public so we can't know what may trigger this. You can get a refund to your address if you don't want to provide your information (without KYC).As for some of ChangeNow's \"scam accusations\" I suspect they largely stem from their use of blockchain analysis to blacklist UTXOs.  It's really quite odd that exchanges will pay for a service that only results in alienating their customer base. It's worth noting that the only exchange listed with a perfect score (10/10) is Bisq.  Not surprising, due to the way bisq works it's quite likely the safest p2p exchange in existence.",
