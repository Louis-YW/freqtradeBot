Panicking here  Your funds are gone and that's the bitter truth. An hacker has stolen all the funds from your wallet and transferred all your BTC to his address. The transactions made via Bitcoin are irreversible and all the funds are now in his possession. You can not do anything because the event has already happened.In online world anything can happen, I recommend you to save yourself from further attacks by reinstalling your operating system, and by changing the passwords of your accounts. You should also change your bank account passwords if you have saved those on your pc or smartphone.If you really don't want to lose anything else then follow the above mentioned instructions. I am very sorry for your loss and I feel really bad for the things that happened to you, but unfortunately I can not do anything to reverse your loss no one else can do that either. Other than that I recommend you to be careful next time as events like this can happen anytime in online world. Always keep your passwords and seed phrases to your self to be on the safe side.",

Somehow an unknown person got access of your seed phrase and they took the coins from you. You should not hope for anything. Sorry for your loss. When you are in crypto this is the risk you take unless you are knowledgeable enough to protect your virtual asset. I suggest you to learn from this experience and in the future either use multi-sig wallet or use a hardware wallet. $5k+ worth of btc is a good amount and a hardware wallet would cost you not more than $100. Check this. The same happened with another user recently.",

Panicking here  Im sorry to hear that you have experience a loss of your BTC OP, it is possible that your wallet has been compromised. It might be phishing attacks, malware , or social engineering. Phishing attacks can trick you into disclosing your private key or seed phrase. Malware can infect your computer or mobile device and steal your private key or seed phrase when you enter it into your wallet. Social engineering tactics can persuade you to reveal your private key or seed phrase through fraudulent emails, phone calls, or messages.It is also possible that there was a technical glitch or vulnerability in Electrum that allowed an attacker to steal your funds. However, without more information it is difficult to determine the cause of the issue. If you haven't already done so, you should immediately contact the support team for Electrum and report the incident.Hope it helps, and again sorry for your loss.",

Anyone has any idea of how this can happen? Bitcoin transfer doesn’t contain any virus or whatsoever to gain access to your wallet. Probably it’s related on the external action that you do prior to receiving the Bitcoin. By any chance do you click any link that promises to received Bitcoin by doing certain task. You might accidentally downloaded a malware that exposed your private if the hacker can transfer your funds without your permission.Quote from: scammedbysomeone on May 01, 2023, 02:03:36 PMAny technical glitch or my money is really gone forever?

If you haven't already done so, you should immediately contact the support team for Electrum and report the incident.Electrum does not have a support team the way crypto centralized services do, so the way you'll run to Binance support if you have an issue with your Binance account isn't the same if you have issues with your Electrum wallet, and that's because Electrum is open source and everything about their code can be verified. You can only report the issue here like OP is doing or also in GitHub, so the community can assist you in finding what actually went wrong, but still it isn't possible for anyone to be exactly sure what happened.There is no glitch or vulnerability in Electrum, the problem is from the op's operational security, and there are many reasons why their funds was stolen: it could be malware attack, exposed seed phrase or keys, fake electrum, etc.",
