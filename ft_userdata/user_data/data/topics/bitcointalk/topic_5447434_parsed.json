Does anyone know the reason behind it? Does Elon just playing around?Or is it has something to do with the matter of Elon's lawsuit in regard to market manipulation with Dogecoin?UPDATES:Quote from: vv181 on April 09, 2023, 06:35:41 PMA few days ago Twitter changes back its logo to the original one, the blue bird. As the hype and FOMO wind down, DOGE prices follow the sentiments. As of now, the prices lose almost 30% from the peak of the surges which is around 35% according to current CoinMarketCap data.Based on my observation, there is not any further news about the assumed linked motive of his absurd lawsuit. Regardless the fact, I'm very sure the \"mockery\" surely hits the prosecutor and other parties who are in favour of it. I guess the current fate of Doge is only in the hands of big names or influencers, and I believe somewhat loses the meaning of its meme-based community owned status.",

Does anyone know the reason behind it? Does Elon just playing around?Or is it has something to do with the matter of Elon's lawsuit in regard to market manipulation with Dogecoin?At this point it is impossible to know what Elon is thinking but to me it seems that he just likes to play around and feel the power he has over dogecoin, and obviously dogecoin holders love this as they know that this coins can go up in value literally overnight for no reason at all, after all even if Elon did this and the Twitter logo was changed to the logo of dogecoin, in which way this changes anything at all when it comes to the supply or the adoption of dogecoin? Nothing has changed, but speculators can use this to manipulate the price and earn a lot of money relatively quickly.",

It suddenly can change the market by a simple prank but I still can see the Doge logo. What happens to the Twitter coin plan if he will just use Doge on Twitter?",

He is playing the market before and promoted Dogecoin, everything that happens to this project will always address to Elon Musk's idea. Surprising? Not really as we are aware of the possibility that one-day Dogecoin will hype again due to the influence of Elon. Though not already it was in that situation however it gives us an insight into what is likely to happen when he promotes Doge as followers will then follow.",
