  "content": "Shiftcrypto today released a warning that hosted service ActiveCampaign they used for sending newsletters have been compromised.Unauthorized party downloaded email lists containing customer name or alias, email address and computer IP addresses. Other personal information like postal addresses or any information from BitBox hardware wallet was NOT compromised according to Shiftcrypto.Real danger of this dat breach is that you could receive phishing emails pretending to be Shiftcrypto, so you should be aware of that and never enter seed words anywhere online, or download any software from received emails.Shiftcrypto wil not be sending any more marketing emails until this incident is resolved, and this reminds me on similar situation that happened with Trezor and their newsletter partner.This things are going to happen in future with all hardware wallets, so I see a big value for DIY signing devices like SeedSigner that uses RaspberryPi.Shiftcrypto was using ActiveCampaign, small cloud software platform based in Chicago, and this shows that it's much better to use your own platform instead of using third-party partners.Instead of learning from bad examples of Ledger and Trezor, Shiftcrypto did nothing until it was to late.Official Shiftcrypto blog post with more information:https://shiftcrypto.ch/blog/data-breach-of-marketing-platform-activecampaign/",

Those companies share a lot of user data between them, and our personal information is just shared again and again... and sometimes, one of these companies is just careless about its security and we see some \"data breach\".The best way to protect ourselves is just to avoid sending our data. Create a lot of throw away emails, one password for each site (using a password manager), never complete KYC unless strictly necessary, etc...Because soon or later any data you put online is going to the dark net and will be sold and used for phising/spam",

Create a lot of throw away emails, one password for each site (using a password manager), never complete KYC unless strictly necessary, etc...You can't really avoid completing KYC procedure when you are ordering something like hardware wallets from internet.Only way you can bypass this is if you purchase device locally with cash, or if you use alternative name, shipping address, temporary email, etc. foir ordering online.Generally speaking I suspect every email that I receive, especially if it's something related with crypto.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on July 21, 2022, 12:31:53 PMThis is concerning since you could get decent amount of information from IP address such as region where you live and ISP you use. It's worse for BitBox customer whose ISP give static IP, but has default poor router security.It's easy to use Tor or vpn in 2022 to mitigate this issue, but I think that identification from smartphones using combination of imei number and ipv6 addresses is revealing even more information about your location.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on July 21, 2022, 12:31:53 PMOnly if they bother to afford security expert and someone with experience of running self-hosted email server.I think that only Foundation Passport is using self-hosted email server from all hardware wallets, but there is no perfect protection from leaks.You can always have insider leak from someone who was working for hardware wallet manufacturer, but I guess risk is much less this way.",

They even mentioned below that they didn't get answers.Quote Their security team informed us that an unauthorized party downloaded email lists, even though we are using their additional comprehensive security measures, including mandatory 2FA account access. Despite pushing for details, ActiveCampaign has not provided answers to fundamental questions yet.Frankly, the reliance of these services on third-party applications is an excuse for them not to bear the responsibility of protecting currency data and to ensure that they can provide it to any new third party, now they can sell that data and make arguments and importance as what happened above.",

Of course, I'm not expecting most of them to do this, especially if they hare heavily dependent on them for advertising.Of course, this makes it extremely hard to send newsletters in the first place, because most mail services will just block addresses that send bulk emails to many different receipents.",

I understand it could be fancy to outsource everything what is not the core business, but at the end it causes only the problems. It is much better to invest minimum effort and be able to say that any aspect of business (especially when you are into crypto-sector) is self-controlled.

They did get IP addresses and many of them were probably not masked in any way.Interesting thing about the official Shiftcrypto announcement is them saying they \"anonymize personal information after 30 days\". So they are not deleting info about their clients, just removing identifiable information. It would be interesting to see what it is they do exactly and why not delete it all in the first place? Maybe they have backups and ways to restructure the anonymized data if government institutions ask them about it.",

This might mitigate consequences of such data breaches a little.So far, I went the route to create my own signing device, mainly because I'm not too happy with what commercial hardware wallets offer or cost and I don't feel the urge to need a commercial device yet.",
