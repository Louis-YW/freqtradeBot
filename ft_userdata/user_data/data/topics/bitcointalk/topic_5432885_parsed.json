There's probably a way to change the version string and regress the file to.a form an old wallet will accept but I don't know why you'd want to. Also you can always import private keys into old software (providing it's compatible).",

Since those are soft-fork updates, your node will also still accept and relay SegWit / Taproot transactions.",

Bitcoin Core wallets use a versioning system where you have to explicitly upgrade the wallet using an RPC call if you want it to use a newer version. They are not automatically upgraded when they are imported into a newer Core.Even if you could manage to import the newer wallet format into an older version, the older Core versions have no taproot or Segwit support at the consensus level.",

Go get a copy of Microsoft Office 2021 create a word document then install a copy of office 2003 and try to open that doc. It wont. Its the way software has worked since forever, older versions of applications cannot always open files created with never versions.You could probably tweak the code a bit and compile it that it will open it, but you can't be sure that something else isn't going to cause an issue.-Dave",

Besides, i find it's ridiculous idea to use SegWit/Taproot wallet on client which doesn't implement SegWit/Taproot.Quote from: DaveF on January 04, 2023, 08:32:36 PMYou could probably tweak the code a bit and compile it that it will open it, but you can't be sure that something else isn't going to cause an issue.More recent Bitcoin Core switched from Berkeley DB 4.8 to SQLite as wallet.dat database, so simple tweak won't do the job.",
