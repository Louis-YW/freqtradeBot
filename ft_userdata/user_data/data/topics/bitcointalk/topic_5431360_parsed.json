They should have just left it for just one country to host. Well, let's see how it goes. As for the the 48 teams instead of  32, I like it. It would make it possible for more countries to be part of the tournament. The world cup is always an interesting tournament no matter what but it's going to be really difficult to see a world cup more interesting than the one we just had in Qatar. I'm a big fan of the world cup and I always anticipate it. I hope the next one proves me wrong and becomes more interesting than that of Qatar.",

Just for twenty matches adding two more countries isn't needed. Those 20 matches in Mexico and Canada isn't gonna make any big contribution to the nations. Qatar have done with perfection, but human lives lost during the process hasn't received proper compensation. Anyhow USA will try to make it better than the World Cup in Qatar.

      "body": "It is a nice idea to organize the World Cup in different countries. But in terms of transport, it is not optimal for the players. You will always have to travel up and down, which is not great for your preparation. And the distances between these countries can also be considerable. Mexico and a World Cup, we've already experienced that once before in 1986. I thought everything had gone pretty well then. It surprises me a little that they organize the World Cup, since America is not really a football country at all. At least, football is not among the 3 most popular sports. Maybe not even in the top 5.",

This Qatar world cup so far has been one of the most interesting of all world cup i have watched due to all the drama, suprises and history made in the world cup. For the 2026 world cup to be hosted by three nations is not a great idea for me, i don't see any necessity for that because its just going to be an expensive transportation system for football fans to be traveling to and fro through out North America.  For the additional teams its a wonderful idea because i think the chances given to European teams in the world cup is too much and with this addition of more teams,  fifa should just try and make everything fair and add up more countries from other continents.",

As far as I know Fifa will increase the maximum of 1 match for the team to be championInstead of 7 games as usual, it will be 8 games in total.The group stage will probably have the same 3 matches, what will be different is the group format, and the new 32-team stage, instead of the round of 16, will be round of 32.Probably 12 groups of 4 teamsWill be classified the best 2 teams of each group + the best 8 3rd places = total 32 teamsVery weird format, but this is acceptable and viable to have 48 countries participating",

The final match of this event is scheduled at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the stadium has a great style for fans and gives them a better watching experience.

Because this is 1st world cup event in 3 countries, how can they handle flight and match?Because I have to think how tired a team is if wants to meet from the last match in Canada and have a flight to Mexico which need 5 hours flight. Maybe, the official has a plan to reduce tiredness on a busy schedule for the team like a private plane or ease of transportation to reduce the tired.And, the final match is also interesting to guess, we know the USA has been the host of the world cup 1994 (Rose Bowl Stadium, California). there is a possibility that they are not allowed to be the final host again, while Mexico has a world cup host in 1970 and 1986 also. so I have to guess the opening and final ceremonies in Canada.",
