  "content": "About three weeks ago, Egypt signed a currency swap deal worth $1.4 Billion with the UAE. UAE swapped 5 billion dirhams for 42 billion Egyptian pounds. Currency swap deals is usually carried out by a country with economic crises with another country with strong economy so as to boost the economy of the former.The Egyptian situation is similar to the Nigerian situation. Both countries are passing through inflation. Within the past year, both countries have devalued their currency more than once and has seen it loose almost half their value against the dollar.My question now is what is stopping Nigeria from signing a currency swap deal with a country that has a stronger economy and currency?",

You vote for president, house of representatives, the governor, house of assembly, senators, chairmen and chancellors. You people are voting for them. It is Nigeria that I know that literates have month and use social  media but the illiterates are the ones voting more.With what I noticed about Nigeria, we are not caged, but people are frustrated because of bad economy and poor standard of living.Quote from: Chilwell on October 20, 2023, 08:28:24 PMWhite still decide for us in time of electing a leaderHow?

I don't the freedom as an individual but the entire country that we are been control by white.

White decided for you on whom to vote for?No they don't decide for us for whom to vote for, but they call the attention of all strong political parties that they know one of this parties will emerge as president, here the only play smart that the president will come out of these parties.

      "body": "Talking about national economy booster is not capitalized on currency swap and that is not the basic problem of our country Nigeria.The national economic team and its leaders has failed to put effort and concerntration on the super factors that had the potentials to evaluate and proffers itself economic growth such as * Failure of human capital: The country has ignored to invest on infrastructures with the aids of proper educational systems, negligence to install hospitalities with international standards, no improvement to impactment or encouragement of talented masses in skills and creativities.* Adamant to Labor force: The government plays ignorantic role on the masses failing to pave opportunities on how the masses who are fit and qualified to bring its potential abilities to work leaving majority of the masses jobless where there are means and vacancies on job creations where the jobs resultants is termed to bring about economic values and development to the societies.* Ignorance on capital increase: The federal government is not focused to provide relieved provisions and creating of accesses to support production such as the Agricultures, the creativities and the entrepreneurs sectors with an aim of achieving proficient expected outcomes of its fields and also as the ability to fit produce materials for a finishing that is determined to assorted produces.This is liable to attract international traders and basically give reliance to the societies.Apparently our government fails to understand that bringing about amenities to job entitlements in the country with a system of taxation is an increase to economic value.The government fails to build and or create infrastructures supposed to attracted foreigners into the country such as educations, hospitals, technologies and the agricultural  instead they ignores and underrates its own while patronizing with other international countries without undermining how improductive they are to other embracing countries.I am personally going to say a monopoly system of the government is strongly affecting our economic system of today's in the nation and the country is just seemed as carrier/talent hinderer where they fails fails to breed and encouraging who is of Worth providing a national to international needs.So I can say that it is not about the currency that is devaluing but the economic system itself and the swapping currency is just not a solution to the system.Even if you swap the country to USA and USA to Nigeria today with the same running governing systems of today, the Nigeria government will still remain the same .",
