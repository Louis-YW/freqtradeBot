I really hope that the days of his \"superpower\" on Twitter are over. at least not as much as it was before. We certainly do not need one individual to be able to influence the market so much. This is certainly not good and is very susceptible to manipulation.A similar thing happened with China and their regulation, where twice a year they announced a ban on cryptocurrencies only to later accept them again. as far as I remember, their latest announcements did not have such a significant reaction on the market because it is obviously recognized as manipulative actions. I expect the same from Elon Musk's pump/dump speech.Quote from: avikz on November 29, 2022, 11:23:09 AMSo if Elon does it again, it will probably shake the market, but in a positive direction! unless it suits him otherwise.",

It was a significant crash for crypto. Quote from: avikz on November 29, 2022, 11:23:09 AMCrypto definitely could use a strong promoter like him because his tweets on cryptocurrency are mostly on a positive note and about the great future of it.Musk is not promoting crypto, he is only promoting doge.Quote from: examplens on November 29, 2022, 11:41:23 AMI really hope that the days of his \"superpower\" on Twitter are over. at least not as much as it was before. We certainly do not need one individual to be able to influence the market so much. This is certainly not good and is very susceptible to manipulation.I noticed doge increased 9% after the announcement yesterday, I can see coins like Dash that have grown 7%. But on the long favourite coins list that I have on the exchange I am using, doge increased most today, but this time and the few days ago increment was not significant like when he bought Twitter that doge increased three times the price it was before the announcement that he has bought Twitter.",

He wants to give freedom not a manipulation so that everyone can be free to express there opinion on anything especially political views. He can’t manipulate the market by just using Twitter because there’s other social media channel that can be use to share information while manipulation is clearly using all the social media channel to control the news.People is just dumb enough to use Elon statement as signal for there trading activity. Elon is just sharing his thoughts while people speculate base on it. A real manipulation is when someone gives you advice for your next action such as buy DOGE. Speculation is what makes it looks like a manipulation. Price will not move in either direction if no one will speculate to his post that has no direct mention crypto.",
