  "content": "Hey, Anyone here owns or knows of anyone with >1,000qty of Antminer S9 miners and want to offload them? It could be just the miners/psu or the whole lot including hosting/farm. I'm looking to get these miners for some testing. Am willing to buy up to 10,000 pcs. If you know of someone who know someone etc, do let me know. I'll be keen to offload these miners that are currently not profitable instead of collecting dust somewhere. Thanks!",

(just curious)In any case there is a very large supply of these miners and they could even come in handy in the future, since people already start to recycle the old chips for small home miners.Basically testing for certain conditions for hash collisions for single and double SHA256, nothing that will break SHA256d but testing some thesis.If anyone has a large supply of S9, T15, S17, T17 era miners, I might be able to work something out to make it profitable to start those machines up again. Else I may consider to purchase the machines and run them on a separate mining facility (not preferred). Basically I need machines that can run AsicBoost (overt) and non AsicBoost (version rolling). Secondary to what I'm doing, I think it's good to reduce electronic waste and make some of these legacy machines possibly profitable again. Hi there, I'm have sent you a PM.",
