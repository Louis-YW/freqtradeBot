  "content": "somedays ago once our local thread member shared tutorial how to mint NFT on Btc chain. i was surprised to see that now its possible to mint nft on btc chain also because before this i was thinking that btc is just a single token which biggest usecase is just payment and asset solutions. Quote from: AnonBitCoiner on March 06, 2023, 05:04:24 PM ORDINAL NFT ON BTC CHAIN How to Mint NFT?NFT mint k liye apko Ek website  Ordinal Bot  par jaan hoga waha se ap ne koi be image upload karna hai aur Recieving address mai Ordinal supported wallet address dina hai. Us k bad 3 qisam k option aenge 1) Economy Fee= 6$-12$(24 hour-72 Hour) 2)2) Normal Fee= 25$-40$ (1 Hour)  3) Customsab option select k bad Submit and Pay invoice pe click kare tho apko ek address denge jaha par apne same utne Satoshi bejne hai jitne likha ha. oper apko order number bii dia hoga jaha se ap apna transaction aur nft confirmation track kar sakte hoI also tried to mint nft and someone told that BTC early NFt collection Pixel was airdropped to theirs discord user free of course and now floor price is 0.08BTC which us really amazing. BTC nft trend is looking so positive for future and this attract me to mint atleast one NFt. when i was minting it Satoshi number was under 300k and now it may be above 500k but i think we Still early if we mint before 1 million. What do you think about this new revolution in BTC chain. Number of nft holders increasing day by day? is this is just because of current hype or it will last for long time. ?Is it worth Mint to NFT by paying 10$ worth of Btc and expect big profit in future?",

      "body": "My take on NFTs and their current popularity in the cryptocurrency space is that the number of NFT holders is increasing, as more and more people are attracted to this new form of digital asset ownership and speculation.It's difficult to predict whether the current hype around NFTs will last, or if it's just a temporary trend. However, NFTs have demonstrated their potential to create new markets for digital assets and provide creators with new ways to monetize their work.Whether it is worth printing an NFT by paying $10 worth of BTC and expecting a large profit in the future depends on various factors, such as the quality and uniqueness of the digital asset and the demand for it in the market, and the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market.",

I get so many benefits like profit sharing and monthly free bet tickets by owning them there. The only thing that concerns me is some NFTs made by some random companies/artists that doesn't offer any value on it. They think NFT is a normal gallery to sell their paintings or artworks with expensive price tag. You can check this an example, what's the point someone purchases this photo.Quote from: hugeblack on March 16, 2023, 03:35:11 PMI can't understand why people love NFT?

Like I mentioned above, Rollbit offer generous benefits by owning their NFT, which you can earn $30-100 monthly by just holding it from profit sharing program, depends on its rarity. Beside that, you can sell it anytime in their marketplace. But I dont know about other NFTs and what values the creators offer in it.",

Rare the NFT, higher the price will be. in the real world we have seen that one big branded company logo are highly demanded and one simple logo which can be easily created by any user worth more than 5000$. similar NFT price depend upon the creator such as Degods,punks and other big name. NFTS is not just an image as many users thinking but it has also many other Usecase too and in the future we can expect that every artist, stadium ticket will be in the form of NFt.Btc ordinalwallet nft is also more demanding because of new hype and specific Satoshi number allocated to it. peoples are taking small risk if 10$ to secure place under 1 million and in two years if it reached 1 billions the price of nft under 1 million will worth more. when i was creating this topic total nft minted was under 500k and now number of minting NFTS are almost double.",

      "body": "Its a protocol that enforces a separate set of rules that exist outside of what has been coded into the bitcoin core software. Counterparty uses a protocol as well. You can't infer Counterparty NFT transfer just by reading blockchain data with that either. It needs to be decoded with an off-chain PROTOCOL. So why is that OK with you whereas the Ordinals protocol is not?We've been over this a dozen times and you refuse to take ten minutes to learn how it actually works, thus you will forever be confused. The sad thing is its actually quite simple.This isn't for you so much as for anybody else who actually cares to understand ordinals:- The Ordinals protocol is a special set of rules that exists outside of the blockchain (same as Counterparty).- A data inscription is made in the witness space during the transfer of 1000 sats from one address to another (could be a media file or any kind of data).- The protocol forever ties one particular sat in the 1000 sat output to the inscription data using Ordinal Theory.- Per rules of the protocol, ownership of the inscription data is passed from address to address along with the sat assigned to it during the initial inscription. This is accomplished via coin control, aka selecting which input(s) is/are going to be used and for what purpose when making a transaction.Here's a pretty good analogy:https://kf106.medium.com/rodamors-bitcoin-ordinals-explained-e0cb775c68ddQuoteImagine that every ten minutes an apple farm ships out a canvas bag containing 100 apples. They’ve shipped fifty bags already, so that means that five thousand apples have left the farm. That’s apples 0 through to 4999.Now they’re preparing bag fifty-one.They put a hundred apples in a bag, label it [5000..5099], and send it off to the grocery store. We now know that the bag contains apple 5006, say, but we don’t know which of the one hundred apples is apple 5006.At the grocery store, someone asks for six apples. The grocer takes six apples out of bag fifty-one, puts them in a paper bag, and labels it [5000..5005], and then change the label on bag fifty-one to [5006..5099] so they don’t forget.Finally, you come into the store and ask for an apple. The grocer takes an apple out of the canvas bag, puts it in a paper bag and writes 5006 on it, and changes the label on bag fifty-one to read [5007..5099]. Then the paper bag with 5006 written on it is handed to you.Congratulations! You are the owner of apple 5006.Now imagine the apple farm put a stamp of a picture of a monkey on Apple 5006. Congratulations, you are now the owner of the monkey stamp in addition to the apple.Now franky1 says that because the apple farm didn't clear the apple monkey stamp rules with him, you are not the legitimate owner of the stamped apple. Yet other people are willing to buy the stamped apple from you who agree it is in your possession regardless of what franky has to say about it.QuoteUnspent transactionsThe bag of apples that the previous customer received, and the bag with one apple that you received are called “unspent transaction outputs” in Bitcoin. Your bag with one apple is available for you to spend, if you happen to be living in a country where bags of apples are an accepted form of payment.And because every transaction is public on the Bitcoin blockchain, we can track down all the unspent transaction outputs, which is something that we cannot do with bags of apples in the real world.This means that the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain allows us to know exactly who owns a particular numbered satoshi, even if we do not know which of the satoshis in their unspent transaction collection it is.Degen #1 pays you $10 for your monkey-stamped apple. He hands you $10 and you give him the apple. Everybody is happy with the exchange, except for franky1 because he still disagrees with the rules made by the apple farm.",

      "body": "as for nuttys apple narrativethe analogy is more likenuttys girlfriend who is a apple farmer etched/carved a dickpic into the bark of an apple tree. and then plucked a couple apples off the tree and gave them to a couple people and said one of you owns the dick etch.. saying how the seed of the apple proves the dick etching.. but it does not. there is no dick etch reference in the dna of the apples seed nor does the apples show proof of one or the other being an owner of the tree let alone the etching.. neither of either holders of an apple proves which apple holder is the owner of the etching in the mother tree.. infact no matter what the apple farmer says.. the etching is still stuck on the mother tree on the farm. and does not movethe apple farmer may say person A owns it. but can easily without asking for proof of apples. say B owns it tomorrow because there is nothing in the apples to say otherwise....the protocol sets the blockdata and the blockdata proves the protocolthus the block data stops random idiots from changing the protocol so easilybut caseys ordinals does not have any proof of transfer on the blockdata to lock in the code. thus the code can change..so save having to repeat the obvious in many posts becasue nutty cant quite grasp reality/logic.. ill just say it a couple times in this post.. if nutildah wants to remain ignorant.. thats up to himfunny part is nutildah cant even answer the question i last asked about the human readable transaction example i gavewhich reveals alot about stuff nutildah cannot understand so avoids discussingcaseys ordinals scheme does not have the blockdata proof... it only has one side. the edicable code.... and because its not locked by block data to enforce/ensure the code stays inline. the code can change with an easy decision, pretty much one line of code changeatleast learn the purpose of a blockchain. and how important the blockchain is to a successful economic systei know you fangirl over systems without blockchain. but your fangirling insecure stufftry to learn the purpose of blockchains and the symbiosis between protocol and blockdatalearn which proves which and which restricts whichlearn the function of each...then you will realise is something is not enforced by valid data. then the rules can change without playing with data. meaning the rules are not immutable. the rules are just crappy decisions that can changerules that can change so easily is a bad system. rules that are not even rules is a broke systemcasey can easily change the code to display different owners by changing one line of code. thats how broke it is. because the rules are not protected or enforced nor proven in blockchain dataif a bank told you to put gold in a vault. but then didnt give you a key or a receipt or any contract to prove the gold is yours.. ,,, guess what its no longer your gold. you have no proofyou can try writing your own code to pretend that it shows something. but if there is no real world data to back it up.. even a court will laugh at you for your failed attempt..",

      "body": "franknbeanstry to learntry to readyou say i am the one who is ignorant yet ive very clearly demonstrated ive a better grasp of not only how the ordinals protocol functions but how NFTs in general functionnot forgetting the NFT market which you have never cared the slightest bit aboutwhich is why its very silly to continue this conversation as you have nothing interesting or new to add to it, just the mindless repetition of your opinion... based on nothing but steadfast ignorance and an unwillingness to LEARNyep you are just wasting everybodys time at least 90% of the timeheck your desire to prove that you are a big man who is never wrong clearly overshadows your desire for education and thus there is no point in continuing on with youthis has been obvious in your posts for the last five years at a minimumi recommend everybody do their own research on the matter instead of wasting their time attempting to apply franky's unsourced drivel to reality... it is the same as attempting to hammer a trapezoid through a circular hole",
