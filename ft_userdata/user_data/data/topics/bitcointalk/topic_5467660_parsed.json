No need to actually see what is going on.I was randomly browsing miningpoolstats and came across this coin and, since it had AI in its name, decided to check it out.  I have the website pulled up in another tab and haven't read it in full yet but this statement in their description has me confused:QuoteWith MECUAI, you can mine. You can run your own smartnodes, and you can buy and sell your MECU to others.1. Saying \"With coin X, you can mine\" is more fucking retarded than someone born with spina bifida, fetal alcohol syndrome, and trisomy 21.  There is nothing special about being able to mine any coin.2. Does the running of a smartnode function differently than any other coin that has a smartnode feature?  3. Saying \"With coin X, you can buy and sell coin X to others\" is just a nonsense statement.  Hey ladies, with this 9 inch dildo, you can buy and sell this 9 inch dildo to others!Christ, I hate to call someone an insult as old as mouthbreather, but I think that's exactly what most of these new shitcoin developers are.  Clone someone else's clone, use alt newbie accounts to bump the ANN thread on this forum, get Zergpool, RPlantxyz, and the usual pools that don't give a shit to let idiots mine it, and get it listed as fast as possible on Xeggex so that the devs can dump the premine coins or what they get from the block rewards generated from other miners (which is basically just like a tax on mining).  That's the formula.Don't be a sucker who follows that formula.  Electricity is expensive and these shitcoins are useless.Quote from: Cynce on September 22, 2023, 01:26:27 PMDev taking 25% in the early blocks and 10% forever... no thank you.That's fucked.  But did you really have to quote that huge block of text just to make that comment?",
