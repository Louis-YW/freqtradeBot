When I try to take my money they send me KYC which I completed fully. And they told me that I used bots against their terms and don't give me my win.How can I take it back? I didn't use bots.Unfortunately, there are new issues just two days ago against Bitstarz and those complaints are not yet addressed but yours is a big amount compared to the other two, I suggest that you create the right format for your accusation to verify your accusation, your chances are not good there is no active representative here of Bitstarz and they ignore all the other complaints they are verified as a scam casino now.Code:[b][color=black]What happened:: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Scammers Profile Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Reference Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Amount Scammed: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Payment Method: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Proof of Payment: [/color][/b][b][color=black]PM/Chat Logs: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Additional Notes: [/color][/b]",

You should mention how much you have been scammed and how you have been scammed. As much information as possible about them. And it will be better if you write that in a good format as mentioned by aioc.",
