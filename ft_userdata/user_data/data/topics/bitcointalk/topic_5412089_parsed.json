Onboard video is when there is some  basic GPU already built into the motherboard.Most likely it’s trying to mine on that card which obviously doesn’t have enough memory. You should manually try and select a GPU, try GPU = 0. You can also try changing the platforms around and see if it works.If it doesn’t then make sure your virtual memory is very large. Sometimes this can be an issue.",
