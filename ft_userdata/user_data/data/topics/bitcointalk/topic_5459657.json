I could remember a Bitcoin signal group I joined, as someone that has less knowledge about trading and how sure the group signal works, so I decided to seat back and watch how the trade will work, on the contrary it moves opposite direction and that was not the first time, what they normally do was to get some screenshots from other successful traders and posted on there telegram group to draw more attention so people could pay before joining.

This topic perfectly belongs to this Trading Discussion board. You may move there or it is probably okey in this board too. Most of the signal groups are pretend to be scam or offering to Join VIP groups. But some are different and there are some signal groups which have a great wining ratio. We have to remember that it's not possible for anyone to predict and provide signals accurately. But you can choose 1/2 signal groups in your list who provide technical analysis based signals, have risk management, have take profit and stop loss and have the most accuracy. I will add some more. Don't only depend on these signals even they are too good. After getting a signal try to research by own and visit TradingView site and observe others prediction. Then you decide if you are quite confident about the signal. That will provide you a significant result.",

Although there are some crypto trading group that are legitimate whereby signal are being passed from an insider just as binance or any other exchange out there, such users may have an information about some token that is about to list in their exchange and they may discussed with project owner to know the maximum and minimal amount they would list and if such worker has a group he could post it on his or her group asking his subscriber to get ready for a list of token \"A\" and if they got signal very correct they stand in a better chance to buy cheap and hold for the next few months when they planned for to price to reach some certain high.Most at times people do create fake group to impersonate the original group and most likely sharing the same information as the original group, those people who does that are insider who already belong to the crypto trade signal group.",

But if you want to be good and know more about bitcoin signal, you have to follow some people and organizations on Twitter and to be active on Reddit, you have to learn about the technical analysis and also the fundamental analysis. You have to learn about the fundamental analysis about what could affect the price of bitcoin. What I am looking forward to now is bitcoin spot ETF and 2024 halving.",

So what do you guys think, let's share knowledge. Unfortunately I don't often trade full time due to other jobs around my own circle but if you are an average trader and not very professional with the bigger trades. Of course there is a lot of knowledge that you still need to know and I think this is not only related to a signal from a group even though you say that not all signals from a group are wrong. But try to see from some of the signals they give through the group, are there more wrong or more right?I'm sure there aren't many correct signals through any group because some of them just rely on instinct and guesses based on experience in the past, while for sure there will always be more misses than what they expected. So you also don't need to be fully guided by the signals they give in certain groups even though they have shown the evidence and you yourself need more knowledge about trading matters. Because not always the direction of the trading signal can be the same as before in the market.",

Know the kind of people you deals with for them to have offer you the advice of joining their own group for signal, can you trust them to that extent.2. If you joined, carefully understand the things they are posting there on the group and if it does not tally with the main aim for joining the you should exit3. Using a trading indicator or signals is not a guaranteed means to having a perfect result, it only helps towards having a desired research or findings.4. Don't make deals on the platform with them for buying anything from them to facilitate your trading experience, without the group you can learn trading and be good at it if you give it time.Please i will advise that you move this thread to trading discussion board which is best fit in for this discussion.",

Most times those signal channel start off as a free signal channel but as time goes on they'll surely ask you to pay some certain amount to be added to the vip group which could just be a means of scamming you... I would like you to take your time to leave how the market works, learning how to read the market properly would be much better than relying on the signal of a stranger who never shares his/her losses. Just sacrifice your time to learn more about trading and trust me when you finally get a hold of how everything works you will never regret learning it yourself.",

I also know of many groups that try to attract users and pump/dump some cryptos, actually through as many groups as I understand the nature of each type more, users are simply tools for them to achieve their goals. destination. As for the places that actually share knowledge, they are usually quite picky because as what they give and advise us is always quite harsh, I also feel quite happy to see some groups warn of scam signals in this space, and sometimes seeing the dramas they assign about crypto trends and doing my own research, it gives me a lot of tools to research this market.",

There is no free lunch, remember that and you will figure out facts behind free signal groups.They do not charge you any joining fee initially but they will steal your money by giving you some signals and make you excited, greedy to buy up tokens for them to take profit.Paid groups can be scam too. They can be other versions of free signal groups but try to double scam you with joining fee. Very few paid signal groups are legit and good but you must pay ridiculous expensive joining fee. I am sure you will not be able to join those groups if you are not rich and have big capital.You can use your money to buy a membership from on-chain metrics websites like Glassnode https://studio.glassnode.com/pricingGlassnode Insights has weekly free reports to read https://insights.glassnode.com/",

Well i cant say paid signal group is baf but some of them have reputation to exploit money but not giving enough results or gains to subscribers. Plus there is no guaranteed of a win, so basically you just joined to learn and see how they given up signal for a possible or chance to win a market trade. But isnt that like a prediction which you relie on someone? Learning trading isnt easy at all and time consuming so there are groups like this. But please be reminded that theres also chance of losing on these signals.",

If they give you a free signal then you can give it a try, as we have nothing to lose, but if it is a paid group, you don't need to think much and stay away from them immediately.
