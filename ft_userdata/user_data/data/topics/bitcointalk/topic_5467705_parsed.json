They probably see my thread Betting significant amount and assume I'm a whale gambler(FYI I'm not whale gambler). They are offering a huge money to bet on your account then they will give you a commission. Sounds interesting right?But the danger in this deal is you might be connected to the match-fixing syndicate which will jeopardize your integrity since you KYC already on the casino if you are betting a significant amount like me. The worst is you might be flagged as a money launderer once you connect with them and accept money as payment.

Of course it's a no-deal, I will avoid also because you're exposing some of your sensitive data.But.... are you sure they want \"play\" with your account and give a profit? It sound good ... if you have maybe nothing to lost it could be an option ....Personally, I will pay attention also to scam pulled with your account!Likewise they use this account to ask loans, sell fake items and more and more... If they can't withdraw they will lost money. but in this case they can easily get some earning without risking nothing.",

So basically, their purpose is just to steal your account and lure you with promises that they will not fulfill. I guess no one should fall for that. It might be attractive if they were to cash out some money to send to your account, and you'd be the one gambling with their desired picks. At least then, you'd only worry about possible connections to illegal transactions, but you'd also have some hope of making a profit. Either way, it's still risky, and it's up to the users to decide how much risk they're willing to take and how cautious they are.",

Sharing your casino account with anyone, especially if you don't know them well personally or have no guarantee of their intentions, can indeed lead to serious legal and integrity issues, and I would never do this either.This can lead to serious consequences such as identity theft, financial loss, and involvement in illegal activities.

But I think I have come across such an offer in this forum where a gambler was asking for casino accounts he could use to place bets. He claimed that he had exceeded his maximum limit and needed to use another account to continue his bets.  He promised that anyone who agrees to assist him will be paid some percentage of the win.",

What I just know is that it will finally lead to ban of your account or you may be arrested.Or it can be a scam attempt.I hope this will teach people lesson.

Never share your casino account to anyone here especially those so-called whale bettors because you might be connected to whatever shit they are doing illegally.I haven’t really thought of it that way as, a bet fixing syndicate but, that could easily be the case with whale gamblers. I mean, my ideas has always limited me to what damage they could do with your account, having it blocked and funds confiscated and all that but, it’s interesting to know how wide it gets.I am curious though,What was your experience with on the situation, how damaging was it? Without making speculations, I’ll like to see what it was.While most would be skeptical of this offer, there are some greedy gamblers that would easily play into there part. One time last year, I saw a user create a thread with this sort of offer.Don’t forget, it’s against betting company policies that, you take bets for another user or bet unbehalf of or any form or representation gambling. We all know what happens when this is found out and so, which ever way you might reason it, it’s not a chastised practice and should be avoided.",
