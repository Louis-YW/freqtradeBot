For exemple, they acquired a firm in 2020 to act as its UK subsidiary and named it Binance Markets Ltd. Few months later, the FCA issued a warning for not having the relevant permissions to operate in the countryhttps://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-warning-binance-markets-limited-and-binance-groupIt's true in the UK, the agencies are quite bothering with CEXs, but if companies don't follow the regulations, it won't help.Adding the fact here with PaySafe that decided to stop making business with Binance... the result is normal.",

I reached out to the support as well, and they said they haven't got any information about the matter, so they also can't comment.",

I knew and I know that. However, currently the banks tend to look worse than Binance and they do need the extra money, so - sooner or later - one will turn a blind eye to Binance's fishy behavior. Of course, it will take time, as I already said, but it's most probably not impossible to find a partner bank.Please don't imply that I would believe that Binance is rock solid. I don't know, maybe it is, maybe it's not. But they do their best to leave the impression they are solid enough.",

Other places are more legit then Binance and Paysafe is looking at them and planning to get as far away from them as quickly as their contract allows.Too many places leaving them and they are leaving too many places to be just anything else. Their refusal to open their books to regulators just screams something is wrong.Remember, it's not a conspiracy or campaign against them if there are legitimate reasons for things to be happening. -Dave",

The company failed to obtain the VASP License in Austria so they decided to withdraw its application. If you fail, you give up and move on.The FMA financial supervisory authority didn't want them so no license given. And with no license, Binance is an illegal refugee there. They were already operating without it since the begining.Bitpanda has the VASP license in Austria and it didn't have a problem to get it, I guess. Why? Because they're fine.Which means there is something not right with Binance, and Austria is not the only country to think the same (Be, De, US, Ca think the same)Binance is perhaps the most urgent company to halt its expansion. The others will no doubt follow later. If this is not the case, it really is a question of economic strategy on the part of the USA.Americans are very vicious.Perhaps the same things with the European countries but that will be surprising knowing they can be dump sometimes. When USA talk, EU shuts up and follow",

Neither is this a case of all countries suddenly waking up simultaneously. This has long been a pattern of Binance's fate in many countries. It's not because of the US SEC; it's because of how Binance conducts its business.We take note that Binance withdrew from Canada around a month before the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance and CZ. Furthermore, Binance has been struggling with UK's FCA for years now. It also faced similar problems in Australia. It was also blocked from Italy. Binance was also kicked out from Japan. It was also compelled to shut down its Singapore operation. Binance also faced a criminal complaint in Thailand. It was also banned in Malaysia. The list goes on. And it's not because of something initiated by the US; it's simply because Binance operates illegally, gets caught, attempts to register and submit to regulatory policies, and then they either succeed or they pack up and leave.",

The USA orders Nvidia and AMD to stop selling AI chips to China. Both of them have Asian CEOs, but it hasn't ordered the same to IBM, Intel or Alphabet, these corporations don't have Asian CEOs btw.",

I wouldn't rule out that EU hates tech progress so much that they are throwing Binance because of that  Rarely 5G, still have to pay with cash in Bus instead of cards, oh shit!Btw why do you hate Europe?

Binance can still operate in Germany but it only cannot advertise in the country. There is no impact on the users' ability to deposit, withdraw, buy or sell. As of February 2023, Binance had as many as 2 million German users, per Wirtschaftswoche, which makes the exchange one of the biggest platforms in the country.
