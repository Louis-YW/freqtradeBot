  "content": "A mind map of \"The Bitcoin System\" has been created. The goal of this visual representation is to draw attention to the fundamental components that go into making Bitcoin a functional technological advancement.My motivation for undertaking this project is to gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin as a system, which is defined as a collection of interconnected or interdependent components. In particular, I firmly believe that people who want to learn more about Bitcoin should have a basic understanding of these components. These elements act as important markers that would be routinely evaluated in order to determine the course of Bitcoin's evolutionary development over time.Can the elements be better presented or simplified to aid understanding?Once I have the feedback I will update the mind map and show it to the Bitcoin community.Government                                                                       Miners                            Altcoins                                                                             Developers codeHacking---Threats                                      Government---Bitcoin protocolTrust Forks                                      Scams                                   BITCOIN SYSTEMInternet                                                                             ExchangesDark web                                                                           ETFTransaction------Network                          Crypto Market--BrokersMiners (nodes)                                                                   Trading strategiesWallets                                                                               LiquidityTimes stamp                                                                                                           Data                             Bitcoin blochain                                Research (analysis)                             Patents                Source: understanding bitcoin system",

Crypto Markets:you should add the P2P trades, not all the trades are done online, there are some people in real life selling their coins to family and friend.",

Learn how to create table from this thread. But before then you need to learn more about bitcoin. Read the link provided by tranthidung or go though this simplified guide on learn me a bitcoin.HackingBitcoin network is never threaten by hacking but rather it is your storage method. If you store your funds in places where they’re vulnerable to attack or misplace your keys, then it is your fault and not the bitcoin network. ForksThey are not also threats because even hard forks like bitcoin cash or bitcoin gold that were created to solve some of the problems assumed to associated with bitcoin and up till now just like Alticoins they are still behind bitcoin in terms of popularity or adoption rate which signifies that there are no threat to bitcoin. Soft forks like segwit are actually a Consensus protocol that was actually an upgrade to make transactions faster and not really a threat",

And what is the relation of the government section with developers' code? Why the dark web is included in the network while we are talking about BTC and crypto?

Just find one on Google.Anyway, you didn't mention anything about offchain/sidechain solutions like the Lightning Network. They are also a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem(even though they are kinda outside the BTC blockchain). I know that LN isn't very popular, but we have to bear in mind that such offchain solutions exist.Also don't just put the term \"exchanges\" in your mind map. Why don't you differentiate centralized exchanges from decentralized exchanges(DEX)? I think that the centralized exchanges are more like a Threat to the Bitcoin Network.",
