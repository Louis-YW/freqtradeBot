No, you just need to open the wallet after you setup the wallet to generate keys and addresses and do the signing as OmegaStarScream commented. Electrum is noncustodial wallet and do not need login like on custodial wallet.",

This is a very confusing statement. What are you trying to do? You can't sign a message with your password. You need the addresses' private key to create a valid signature.Why are you trying to sign a message in the first place? You don't need that to receive bitcoin. Who is asking you to provide a signed message? Does it have anything to do with Hey Newbies! Can You Sign A Message? Your business partner can send coins to any of the addresses you copied from the addresses tab in your Electrum client. You just need to check the characters of the copied address to make sure it's the same as the one shown in your Electrum wallet. Did you do that?",

      "body": "Since you have a choice between using Trust Wallet and Electrum as your go-to software wallet, Electrum is the obvious winner in that category. It's been around for many years and hasn't caused headaches for its users except in cases that were directly or indirectly their own fault. I am thinking of the arbitrary server messages that led to users downloading fake Electrum apps that caused the loss of coins. But that's a thing of the past now.  We don't know much about Trust Wallet. It's a multicurrency wallet and non-custodial. Electrum is Bitcoin-only and also non-custodial. But it has the added advantage of being open-source, which Trust Wallet isn't.",

Is this what you are trying to achieve?If I understand you correctly, then your confusion is due to the fact that Electrum, unlike trustwallet, generates a new address each time you click the receive button, and you want to sign the message with the first address you generated, right?If this is the case then follow hosseinimr93 instructions on how to get all your addresses then copy the one you want to sign the message with. Open the sign tab then paste the address there and type your message.",

The language barrier is the problem here, plus OPs lack of knowledge. I think he was trying to say that he used Trust Wallet in the past, and got used to the way that wallet works. But now with Electrum, things are different. I have never used Trust Wallet, but I am pretty sure that they work in completely different ways. It's still unclear why OP needs to sign a message at all as he didn't say.  @Merit.sThis forum has local language sections where you can post in your mother tongue. Maybe you will be more comfortable explaining the problems you are facing that way. If you tell us what language you speak natively, we can link you to the correct board?
