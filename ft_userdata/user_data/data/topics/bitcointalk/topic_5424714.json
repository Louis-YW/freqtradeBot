      "body": "Technically, if the wallet is built with adhering to industry standards, the coin won't merely be lost. Instead, it just can't be accessed, assuming it's the address generated by the wallet. I think it is just simplified technically-incorrect advice to their users. So, they won't bother explaining it thoroughly.In any way, the industry standard of the cryptocurrency space should give transparency as much as possible, in a wallet, it can be done by making it an open-source application. It is not the case with Coinbase Wallet. Any users who are using it should reconsider if they are going to continue using this wallet.",

The former is the brokerage or the the exchange while the latter is the self-custody wallet.....Migrating through the seed phrase could be a hassle since you're not sure if other wallets supports all those delisted cryptocurrencies. It's better to just send those coins. Fees aren't going to be a problem anyway.",

      "body": "That is a good heads up for anyone holding these coins. At last they have made proper announcement well advance in time so that they could give up the custody of those funds to owners. Now if all of the exchanges promoted the news and also announcement like this within time then it could make good relations between two parties. I am saying all this in reference to the current FTX drama that happened and all the coins were lost and unrecoverable considering “non custody” of the coin owners (the FTX users). I hope coinbase handles it properly.",
