Finally, it was only through cryptographic technologies üîí that we could ensure all our players a provably fair and verifiable randomness for all odds ever played, and our randomness is also equitable ‚Äì only through blockchain technologies could one verify randomness in any deal and gamesüìè. Even with quantum computers, we still have to trust their captor and who takes the measure ‚Äì not in BetSwirl!
