  "content": "I want to share my extremely negative experience of playing at MBit Casino and explain my problem.On May 19, 2022, I won 16045 DOGE at MBit Casino. However, during all this time I have not received my winnings. I was verified via Skype. They promised to respond according to the verification result within a day, but they sent a letter that verification is still in the process, so the result will be later. I never received an answer, and my casino account was blocked. WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE REASON. No one responds to my messages by mail. Apparently, they decided to pretend that I don't exist.I won't even say how wrong and outrageous this attitude towards the players is. Okay, you blocked my account, but at least explain why. I really hope that this problem will be solved (although it's been 3 months), or I'll just find out why my account was blocked. I truly hope for the reaction of the MBit casino representative.I have already seen similar complaints about MBit on other sites, so I also decided to leave a comment. On the one hand, it is a pity that people so often face unfair treatment towards themselves. Still, maybe it will become an indicator of quality and someone will pay attention to this problem. If the casino does not withdraw money, this means poor quality and a disgusting attitude towards players. I would like to see this situation finally resolved.Now they claim that they cannot confirm my identity, even though I was verified via Skype! They asked me questions, and I answered them! They have seen my face and confirmed my identity, and now they are trying to convince me that they have blocked my account because they cannot be sure of it! It's just absurd! I have screenshots of our correspondence, where casino representatives assured me that the procedure was successful. I left a complaint on several sites, including AskGamblers and GURU, but the casino doesn't seem to care!",

I am not saying that you are lying but there have been a lot of false accusation that has happened here in the forum and people need evidence that supports your claims. recently there was a post about Mbit not letting a gambler on their website withdraw the OP on that thread didn't provide evidence supporting his claim. anyway, I am not really sure what happened to that issue or if there will be an update since the OP on that thread locked it.I can't withdraw my winnings from the MBit Casino for 2 months. Please help!!!",

That is why it is good to play games in a well known casino sites, if possible the reputable casino sites in this forum is even preferably. I do not think that those people would respond to you again based on your narration. I am trying to think that the amount you won is big and they could not dispense such amount to a customer that is why they are ignoring you. But we thank you for reporting them here. We have known them as scammers in the casino world. You would have provided their site link. And also, your evidences are not enough. Though we looked the site with red tag.",

That is not good just by agreeing to do KYC via Skype that means you have nothing to hide if they are not satisfied then they can ask for other methods of verifying since OP is very much willing to undertake any method that they are given, they should give them a chance if they are 100% sure that he is providing false documents then provide their finding to make it transparent, this accusation will stand and OP has a case.",

And I guess for this issues its good not to take the offer of un reputable casino because we don't know on how long they last before they turn scam and that's so bad for us.",

I wonder how they verify other accounts is it through Skype also, and how good are they in concluding that the person showing his face and his documents are fake, Skype with you holding your documents is the surest way to verify your account because its face to face for me it's unacceptable unless they show us how a face to face through Skype with all your documents can fail a verification, this is the kind of casino that is risky to play.",

Getting a response from them here is going to be difficult. If I understood correctly, they suspect that whoever used Skype to verify their account isn't the same person as on the ID. I would suggest that you post all the evidence you have including links to conversations on Casino.guru or any other sites where you are communicating with a 3rd-party or the casino in an attempt to solve the dispute. I don't recommend that you post your ID or identifiable information. You shouldn't do that. It's impossible to know though if the documents are yours or if you bought them somewhere because people do that. And the two individuals can look alike. Criminals in my country have also been known to go abroad with IDs from other people who resemble them.",

Op was thoroughly KYC'ed even on skype then still telling him that  they are unable to verify his account and banning him coz they accuse op was using different identity which is one of the bullshit thing i've ever read today.I remember some complaint regarding KYC too that after the account provided KYC it was blocked and the platform didn't provide the reasons why it was banned because they have the rights to not to tell which it was mentioned on their terms too, what a BS.This become common scams, the terms of these platforms become shits everyday to do stupid stuff. Then scam users and hostage their balance until these users lost hope claiming their funds there  because of those stupid reasons these platform have.",
