If that's what you are thinking then you are apparently wrong because even the men do get infected and still pass it on to their wife's or their girlfriends after getting it from some of their concubines",

This is not a lifestyle by naija alone, it's a normalize life you see even outside naija because people try to show what they really not are, they want to impress people when they don't have nothing and I see that as nothing but inferiority complex.It doesn't have age bracket, it can happen to people who suffer from peer pressure, people who try to impress women that are not their class but will go a lengthy leg to want be part of their life, people who want to show off their financial status when they don't have nothing in their bank account. Some of them even borrow car to take a girl on a date just to fell among and I get sick on this simping lifestyle.However, I don't blame people who do this sometimes. When you show the world that you are doing the right thing and you are not there yet, nobody will take you serious. People want to live the present in the future and in a society when there are not plenty of opportunities, compromised is the only alternative and no wonder we have now high numbers of fraudsters(yahoo-yahoo) in the country, may God help us.",

She go use persin house pose as na she get am for social media and the real owner got her arrested. The worse part be sey na most of those people wey our youths dem dey worship as their role models dey do dat type of thing pass. Borrow pose. Dat attitude crisscross d entire human race, nor be only Nigerians dey do am. For me, anybody wey dey do am nor be principled person. In fact, the persin na mumu because im suppose sabi sey e nor good to lead ur life to please anyone.",

This country na cruise sha, you go see pesin wey no get house go dey claim big girl or big boy for street,  you no get food for house you dey select food mean while the pesin no even get something to eat. Too many things dey happen for this our country oooo but I come dey wonder waiting be the need of all those lifestyle.    Fake life na normal life for this country ooo. Everybody dey try impress everybody. Person go jus dey try live above him means, which dey very wrong. Girls especially, na Dem get hands for this kain thing, Dem wan be like, Dem wan feel among, you borrow everything for party wey nothing comot or to go catch man by deceit, the same man wey go follow catch you by deceit too. Sometimes peer pressure dey responsible for the fake life because why on earth would someone wey no hold wan dey act like say him hold. This country no dey better, people dey struggle to live through their normal life, na him person go just stay decide say him wan live the life wey big pass am.   We go hear say oga travel, leave house for gateman to look after, gateman get mind, call him irresponsible and unreasonable girls, lie to them say na him get am, sounds funny but na reality. Normally you dey try eat the little food wey you get for house, but as a guy wey dey expect girl, you go come go above your means to impress girl wey nothing fit comot wey you no even know if she too dey follow chop your normal routine for house. As a girl, you comot with man con use am as an opportunity to rip the guy apart financially, all because you wan show say class dey. E dey better to really dey contented o because if the economy no kee people for the country, na the thing wey yoruba people dey call \"ojukokoro\" go kee Dem.",
