Not to mention, using a web wallet is generally not recommended.Quote from: hasti.asadi on November 18, 2023, 02:07:34 PMthen I see a form that I send my name and city but then I could not login finallyDogeChain login processes did not show or require inputting name and city, the form only available upon creating wallet process, are you sure it shows when you try to log on?Quote from: hasti.asadi on November 18, 2023, 02:07:34 PMthen I wanted to try with 2FA.com application, I had back up file and I restore it to get code, but when I want to login to dogechain.info it does not accept the code that I receive it from 2FA application , and said it is invalid code , and it does not send 2fas code to my email too and I can not login to my account at all.That is now how it works. 2FA from the web wallet is different from the one you usually set up. This website only sends 2FA to your registered email, so you can not use it via application.Quote from: hasti.asadi on November 18, 2023, 02:07:34 PMjust in case I create new wallet in dogechain but in that one I receive the code in my new email for new wallet In that case, wait a few hours or a day, your account might get a rate limited due to many failed logins. One thing you did not explain clearly is why or what kind of reason/error you failed to log in, so you better explain it concisely about it.",

      "body": "yes I am sure , it was weird for me that ask that question , but after that nothings happenwhen I had created my wallet I enable 2fas. I had installed 2FAs application and get the code for enter the dogchain.info web site .now when I want to login it needs the 2FAs code , it just send me to my email just one time , after that each time I want to login , it does not send any thing to my email.But because I had my 2Fas backup , I restore it to application and now I get code , but when I want to login to dogechain.info , that code does not work and doge chain said in is invalid code!!  and the other site the code was not send to my email I think , may I restore wrong back up ? an d it is not 2fas for Dogechain? but when I create wallet i save all information and it is for that timeas I said , I Crete new wallet on doge   chain and I get the code easily in my new email and can login easily it doesn't work on my old wallet and my old email and I said I have exported encrypted file that I don't know how can I use it ?for this question:One thing you did not explain clearly is why or what kind of reason/error you failed to log in, so you better explain it concisely about it.I did not get any code to my email from dogechain.info, and backup that I have , that i approximately it is for Dogechain , I get code from it but when I fill that code after login to dogechain.info , it doesn't accept it and said : Invalid 2FA token specified.",

      "body": "I see. IIRC DogeChain does have many changes,  and I may forget what changes they have made, including the 2FA codes. One thing to be sure, I remember some users also have some 2FA-related problemAlso, a lot of users complain about the web wallet here: https://ninjastic.space/search?title=dogechainSomewhere, the site also questioned a lot at: https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=dogechain+infoUnfortunately, I'm afraid I can't do much for you, I would suggest trying to run through the above site's posts, maybe some posts contain a piece of information to solve your similar problem. If in any case, there is not any luck, since you have exported some files, you can consider using some wallet recovery services, such as keychainx OR https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/",

I think the fact that it's not happening may indicate some irregularities on their part. As for the issue regarding not receiving code from the 2fa app, it is important to verify that the time on the device where the 2fa app is installed matches the time on the internet. Time discrepancies can cause this error. And the encrypted file you mentioned (starting with `salt(+xTuGfX+WWf/Tzb5AYv1TA==)...`) seems to be an encrypted data file, probably associated with your wallet information. It is usually used for recovery purposes.",

I checked my email for dogechain.info, and luckily, I hadn't deleted it, so that's where you'll find your wallet ID.

I see many users are having problems with it. Not to mention, using a web wallet is generally not recommended.Don't criticize any of these sites because every team is putting in their best to suit themselves and perform the duty which they were meant for. There's a team behind dogecoin and they're working entirely to fixed whatever problem that's been posed by the site and users are finding it really difficult to contemplate on their decisions and this is problem on the site is putting them in a compromising position. DogeChain.info seems to be trending online because there site have been having issues for a long time and there's definitely no other pattern than for their users to continue complaining. I agree with you to a point but not to the point where their incompetencies wants to either cause inconveniences or further delays when people wants to assess their funds/wallets.Creating a wallet takes more than just the glory of creating one, I consider wallet creation one of the most complicated developments in the space for security reasons. They have to step up to it or give an official announcement as to what's happenig before other people further exacerbate what is left of their reputation.",
