Storing it is my personal responsibility, so I move it to my private wallet (self-custodial wallet), to be precise. I don't leave bitcoin in any exchange, but I leave some funds in some exchange as a result of me using them to place a buy order, which I don't expect them to execute at that very moment. Only those funds on an active order are what I leave in an exchange; the rest of them are moved down to my private wallet. Not your key, not your coin.It's safer to store it in your wallet, where you have full control over it, than to keep it in a place where anything can happen at any time, such as fund freezing, hacking, bankruptcy, etc.",

There's no problem with Bitcoin users who are maintaining certain amounts of Bitcoin on exchanges for as long as they trade. If they aren't, their coins have no business on exchanges. Their funds should be pulled out. They are courting unnecessary risks.

Trezor has all the guides on how to do it. Just make sure you're on their official site. Trezor's Learn page is comprehensive. It's complete from the most basic up to the more technical ones. It's probably more intimidating to make a paper frog than learn how to use your Trezor.",

Usually I just leave some shitcoins that I buy hoping to sell them for a decent profit, so since I place a limit order I need to keep them on the exchange but, at the same time, their value is not very high so in case something bad would happen I can take the loss.

So I keep 90% in my wallet, and maybe around 10% is on crypto gambling websites. When I need to exchange BTC for fiat, I use local exchanges where you don't store money but send it directly to a specific address when placing an order. This way, I get by without using centralized exchanges. I realize that keeping some funds on gambling websites is similar to keeping them on exchanges, but it's very convenient for gambling, so I'm okay with it. It's not a form of storage to me, it's just some funds that are there for gambling, so it's fine.Keep in mind that wallets can also be different, and centralized wallets have the same issues as exchanges, so, of course, I assume that by wallets you mean non-custodial wallets.",

I think most people in this forum will advice you to not storing your Bitcoin in exchange wallet, and they are not wrong it's very risky, the exchange can just freeze your account or some hacker might stole the exchange fund.

But thanks to the people who have been concerned and endlessly reminding everyone that it's not safe to keep your BTC on exchanges, they've just learned their lessons from the cryptopia and other exchange debacles where most of the BTCs that have been deposited with them have never been returned or if they were, it took time for the retrieval of it. And that from then, I've learned that it's best to keep it on my wallet and that's what I've been doing and passing the info that I've learned from them to the newbies that if you're going to store some money on an exchange, make sure that they're just actually for trading and not for long term holding.",
