  "content": "Hello all.  First time poster but long time lurker/reader .I’ve heard and looked up 3-phase but it’s not a possibility.  What’s the next best option for a home mining set up? Currently on a standard set up but have an electrician coming to have a look and quote.  What should I be looking for and requesting?  Any thoughts on max amp, armoured cable thickness, plugs etc etc  Set up in a small garage at the bottom of my garden.  I’ve been mining with S9’s and an innosilicon on standard 240v / 13A and I am looking to expand into 1-2 S19’s and see how it goes from there.  If I get the opportunity I want to run as much as possible safely.Any advice would be great !",
