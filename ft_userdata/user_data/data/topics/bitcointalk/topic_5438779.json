Suggestions from other people are needed, but we only make it limited to additional information. because still we have to research further what other people suggest to us before we finally decide to take the suggestion or reject it. This is DYOR. you analyze and you take action on the basis of the results of your own analysis then you alone will be fully responsible for all the actions you take.",

Well it is pretty much self-explanatory just like on how you conduct your own feasibility study. Doing technical analysis is more of in a trading side actually rather than helping you in deciding whether it is a worth of a coin to be bought (I had used TAs back when I was day trading).How did I DYOR? Multiple sources and making sure that the sources are also credible so it is not that just simple research and draw conclusion. I had seen plenty of ICO review sites that are just straight up paid reviews. You just pay some advisor to bring good reviews to your ICO project and slap it with \"KYC passed\" just to ensure your team looks legitimate.",

Is there any audit for the contract?Then i move to team, Who they are and are they real? How much tokens they got?

Why do they state \"DYOR\"? It is because it may work for themselves but no guarantee to work effectively with others. For example, I am successful with a day trading strategy but others may fail using the same strategy. It can be caused by the different characteristics of the individual. So, when I am telling you that day trading is the most effective strategy, it cannot guarantee that you will be successful as well. It depends on many factors, including personal nature/characteristics. At the end of the day, everyone must do their own analysis to know which strategy will fit them.

It depends on what to be analyzed.Quote from: alastantiger on February 08, 2023, 01:02:08 PM- How did you or do you DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ?If it is about analyzing a potential project, I analyze it from all the crucial aspects. I analyze the team members, its products/MVP, community, social media, partnerships, its usecase, the road map, the whitepaper, and many others. We need to analyze the whole aspects of the projects, so we can conclude whether the project deserves to invest in or not. How to get the information about the whole aspect?
