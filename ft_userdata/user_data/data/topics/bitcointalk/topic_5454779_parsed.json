I hope there will be a serious improvements for tron in the future to be even more friendly being used by dapps developers to issue their dapps on tron blockchain. The problem is its CEO was very arrogant. he was also wasting money like they can get it for free anytime as they want. I do know that if Vaneck I knew if vaneck is one of its major invetos. It's holding tron ETN worth billions of money. https://twitter.com/trondao/status/1476822285273432068",

      "body": "What I like about tron is their fee its quite cheap and always using that when transferring to cex. But aside from that yeah they lack more utility and more dapps are still on major L1 like eth, avax, bsc than tron. Anyway knowing Vaneck holding that worth now, hope he dont dump it when the time comes.Also Justin Sun is quite a guy whom how could I say, more like CZ but the pretentious one.",

Without USDT, trx will lose like 90% of traffic and most likely 90% of its price. And we all know that the future of tether is uncertain (it's possible that everything will be ok, but personally I would avoid projects whose future depends mostly on 1 product in addition not owned and controlled by the creators). Also justin sun ... he's not crystal clear to me. In my opinion, it is steeped in many strange activities.",

      "body": "Cheap fees, fast transactions. It's not really different from XRP when it comes to just about the coin and not the whole project behind it. I mean, XRP had its trouble while Tron does not and yet there are still people who are supporting it. Tron is cheap, and so do XRP. I like them both but I think Tron is widely used especially in online gambling platforms that accept it. I was once tipped by a gambler using TRX and that's when I got curious about it. I didn't know they are trying to use the real estate industry (if it's true) as their asset to keep their money from depreciating but I doubt this is a good idea. I think it's still better to keep it as a cryptocurrency because it will not be hit by inflation. Well, good luck to them.",

      "body": "Personally, I have had trx in my portfolio for a long time and I am happy with it. Back in the day, TRON blockhain was very popular for play-to-earn game dapps. A few years ago, using cryptocurrencies was not always as easy as it is now, and thanks to trx and wallets such as tronlink, transactions were very cheap and fast. Personally, I like cryptos that offer staking options, and with trx you can count on about 5% per year.",
