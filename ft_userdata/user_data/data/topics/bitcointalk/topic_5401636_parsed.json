Any idea what sort of markup you're looking to pay?  I'm sure we'd all like to buy silver Casascius coins.  What brings out the sellers is knowing what price you're offering.  I have all of the silver Casascius coins and there are prices I would entertain for offers, but it would be nice to know if we're on the same page as far as price is concerned.  These silver ones are getting pretty rare these days.  You may have to do some enticing with ballpark figures on your offer in order to get some out of the woodwork.",
