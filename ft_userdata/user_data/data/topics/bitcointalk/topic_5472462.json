  "content": "Hey guys I'm pretty new here but I created an electrum wallet for my BTC back in 2021 that was a multi-signature.I tried to migrate the BTC back to my account via cosigning but nothing ended up happening, I've tried using both the cosigning plugin and also loading the partially signed transaction and opening it on my laptop wallet. Turns out 2 /3 of the cosigning accounts used were both 2fa instead of being a multi-signature wallet.I have access to all of the wallets via passwords and seeds but I've been having a lot of trouble trying to restore my wallet with the multi-sig wallet that has BTC on it. Everytime I attempt to recover the wallet with the seed phrase + extended custom words, it just loads an empty wallet with no BTC.I've been attempting to find the seed phrase for my 2fa laptop wallet but it's grayed out and I'm unable to select it in the menu unlike the multi-sig wallet.How do I find the Public Key of my cosigners ? Also is there any way to change the wallet used for cosigning?",

      "body": "Your question is not straight forward, but I also understand it as hosseinimr93, the seed you seem to have is actual that of a 2FA wallet which is a 2 of 3 multi sig wallet and not directly or the regular multi sig wallet you might be thing thinking. As such in trying to restore the wallet you can follow this guide to restore the 2FA wallet  https://trustedcoin.com/static/recover/standalone.htmlQuote from: purepwn8830 on November 01, 2023, 04:22:54 PMI've been attempting to find the seed phrase for my 2fa laptop wallet but it's grayed out and I'm unable to select it in the menu unlike the multi-sig wallet.This is a case of security measures, according to trustedcoin, youâ€™re only able to see the display seed phrase once and that is when you were creating the wallet. It is because with that seed can be used to disable the authenticator.",

Without the seed you only have access to one master private key per 2fa wallet. If it corresponds to the master public key you used then you are good but if it doesn't you have lost access to the coins. To see if the master private key stored in the wallet file corresponds to the master public key you used open the 2fa wallet and go to wallet menu > password and enter the password in the first two fields but leave the last field blank. Click on ok to disable the password. Then go to file > save backup and save the wallet file somewhere convenient. Open it with notepad and search for the master public key you used in the multisig wallet. See if the corresponding xprv is present or not. For example:Code: \"x1/\": {Â  Â  Â  Â  \"derivation\": \"m/0'\",Â  Â  Â  Â  \"pw_hash_version\": 1,Â  Â  Â  Â  \"root_fingerprint\": \"4a92ff79\",Â  Â  Â  Â  \"type\": \"bip32\",Â  Â  Â  Â  \"xprv\": \"ZprvAk1Z5ih7iCiGSgtQJ7CRSSW1mWJg6sH1qcPUmQiwbZEJkbySoicmAJ94P4UxMbJdUBfuwRLzf2L4pkE485boSZv2FvYaLMWJjD3Xn54CbPd\",Â  Â  Â  Â  \"xpub\": \"Zpub6xzuVEE1YaGZfAxsQ8jRoaSkKY9AWKzsCqK5Zo8Z9tmHdQJbMFw1i6TYEJ9frswkq8qK6RxCjVruypj3Wm81tpHEF8M4ZeipSq5xhmgLgP1\"Â  Â  },In the example above the xprv is present. If you see the corresponding xprv then you can use that to restore the multisig wallet and spend your coins. To restore the wallet you select \"use a master key\" in the \"add cosigner step\" and then paste in the xprv in the next step.",

I ended up sending only 10 dollars CAD worth, and the transaction ended up completing, which is \"8547a96e35a3b2d29eeb08c621ce649c77bdbc0b7c133d5d91fcccb68b07a865\".So I figured I'd be good to send another transfer of BTC. I'm able to cosign on both wallets now I'm getting an error when attempting to broadcast the local transaction:\"The server returned an error when broadcasting the transaction.Consider trying to connect to a different server, or updating Electrum.bad-txns-inputs-missingorspentYou might have a local transaction in your wallet that this transaction builds on top.You need to either broadcast or remove the local tx.\"I'm really concerned? because as far as I'm aware my BTC is still confirmed on my main multi-sig wallet . On the wallet that I recently restored via your advice(laptop). I'm currently shown the original BTC transaction, but with a local transaction that is adding almost the same amount of BTC to that wallet but the inputs for the address are unknown, which shouldn't be possible?!Did I get hacked somehow?",

I'm currently shown the original BTC transaction, but with a local transaction that is adding almost the same amount of BTC to that wallet but the inputs for the address are unknown, which shouldn't be possible?!First thing first, the error is caused by spending that local transaction's output as input of the transaction that you've broadcasted.Since the network isn't aware of it, it will cause that \"bad-txns-inputs-missingorspent\" for spending a missing input.Don't know how you got an inbound local transaction but it's mostly caused by having an unconfirmed transaction dropped from the selected server's mempoolor for outbound txns; created a transaction but didn't broadcasted it and used \"Add to History\" instead.\"Address Unknown\" are just scripts that Electrum can't decode, you can try to tick \"download missing data\" in the setting icon on the top-right side of it to see if it'll update.If not, it's impossible to tell without the actual raw transaction.In any case, backup it first by opening the transaction (double-click) and using \"Share->Save to file\" menu; (in case you need to restore it)so that you can safely remove it from your history via \"Right-click->Remove\" so it wont be used in your transaction.Alternatively, you can enable the coins tab via \"Show->Coins\", then go to that tab and freeze that specific output through \"Right-click->Freeze->freeze Coin\".",

On the wallet that I recently restored via your advice(laptop). I'm currently shown the original BTC transaction, but with a local transaction that is adding almost the same amount of BTC to that wallet but the inputs for the address are unknown, which shouldn't be possible?!First thing first, the error is caused by spending that local transaction's output as input of the transaction that you've broadcasted.Since the network isn't aware of it, it will cause that \"bad-txns-inputs-missingorspent\" for spending a missing input.Don't know how you got an inbound local transaction but it's mostly caused by having an unconfirmed transaction dropped from the selected server's mempoolor for outbound txns; created a transaction but didn't broadcasted it and used \"Add to History\" instead.\"Address Unknown\" are just scripts that Electrum can't decode, you can try to tick \"download missing data\" in the setting icon on the top-right side of it to see if it'll update.If not, it's impossible to tell without the actual raw transaction.In any case, backup it first by opening the transaction (double-click) and using \"Share->Save to file\" menu; (in case you need to restore it)so that you can safely remove it from your history via \"Right-click->Remove\" so it wont be used in your transaction.Alternatively, you can enable the coins tab via \"Show->Coins\", then go to that tab and freeze that specific output through \"Right-click->Freeze->freeze Coin\".Thank you so much for your help! if I could I would kiss you!Â    Removing the local transactions has fixed the problem and now I've transferred all of my BTC out of my electrum wallet.",
