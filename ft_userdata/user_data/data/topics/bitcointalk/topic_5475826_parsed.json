  "content": "So as we are here, the world economy is in a mess. The world population is increasing, and the amount of land per person is decreasing. People are running out of options and opportunities. In this world the situation we are in right now, which one should you choose or have chosen? Both options have their pros and cons. I want to know from your experience, which one is better than the other. Are you satisfied with the path that you have chosen or do you have any regrets about it?To explain it a bit more, inventing a job means doing something on your own and creating an opportunity for yourself. This could also include creating opportunities for others too. Those who invent their own jobs can design positions that are in line with their particular skills, interests, and values. This gives them a sense of fulfilment and autonomy that may not be available in traditional employment options. But it brings risks. In order to create or invent a job, you need investment. Each and every investment comes with risks and this is no different. Finding a job also has its pros and cons. One pro is that it does not require investment of personal assets. You are working for an organization and you will get paid at the end of every month. With that being said, it is hard to find a job nowadays. Less opportunities and competition have made it so hard that many people are staying at home unemployed after graduation. You need particular skills, knowledge and experience that are required in order to get that job. So which one should it be? Do you take the risk and invent a job or do you want to keep running the race knowing the possibility of winning is very low and you may never reach the finish line? [NOTE: if this topic has been discussed before then let me know.]",

There are people that wants to practice their profession but the capital to actually invent it is too high and risky. As for me I would prefer both. I have a profession that I would love to practice and also have my own business. So both have an advantage but inventing one’s business is definitely more appealing to many people because of the freedom that comes with it",

I think we are in a digital world now which people can make money from digital skills and we are in the time of networking that everyone run to the Internet, this days people do run their business on Internet which they make money.

[NOTE: if this topic has been discussed before then let me know.]I have done both (being an employee and starting my own business). To be honest, in my mind, working for another organization is much calmer than opening your own business, but the really exciting thing when we open our own business is that we find out that our abilities are not only As long as we work for other people, we can earn more money by opening our own business. Opening a business is never easy, so one way for us to remain consistent with the business we started is to continue learning and continue to be enthusiastic, rest assured, people who build a business from scratch, has the ability to survive better than those who only earn a monthly salary from working with other people.",

Like being a self employed or sole proprietor, you can have it on your own. I'm trying to be one someday but it's not that easy at all. I need foundations and capital as well unlike being emplyoed, you just have to apply and that's it.Because being a business owner, you have to do all of the necessary things, permits, compliance, etc. You know all of those stuff and they're a lot of it. As you miss one, you'll be having some penalties that will teach you more on how to operate a business. Operating a business is like a music to our ears but the struggle is real on it. It doesn't sound really an ideal thing when you are just starting out because it's not going to help you out when you have a weak heart. Most or I mean all of the successful businessmen now have gone through that hardship and it's not easy to start with. But once you are able to automate your system and business, your only job is to monitor your people.",

I have actually came across similar topic just that this looks more of well coodinated than the previous I came cross if I am not mistaking.People often generalize and make having a job seem like a very bad thing. Do you know the amount of business that survive? Majority of businesses fail within the first 3 years. There are jobs that are not good job because of the pay, work environment, time and so on, but there  are also very good jobs. Take football players for example. They have employers, they work for a company, they're not paid up to 10% of what the company makes, but they're richer than most business people. There are also those that work a 9-5 job and are still better than business owners. Maintaining a business is hard, so is working a 9-5. It's not everybody's dream. It may be your dream to have your own business, it may also be another person's dream to get a very good job in a very good company. It doesn't mean the person is not ambitious. He is ambitious in his own way, the same way you're ambitious in your own way. He wants to build a career while you want to build a business and that's fine.",

Your question can't be answered in general because in reality it all depends on the concrete case. A well-paying and easy employment is far better than a low-paying and stressful self-employment, although it also heavily depends on the priorities of the individual ans some people might strongly prefer one type over the other. To put it short, whatever makes you the most happy is the best, there's no ideal case that suits everyone.",

You are working for an organization and you will get paid at the end of every month. One could argue that what you need to get a chance to be hired is your investment. Money to register for a new school, buy books to improve yourself, get a certificate, etc. But yeah, there is no direct investment required most of the time. Some jobs don't require a high skill ceiling, but the payment and competition are insane. Probably just enough to get by without saving anything every month.Personally, I'm trying to fund a business since I have some spare money. Finding the right people is quite difficult tho, since I need to consider how trustworthy they are. I'm thinking of running a franchise on my own but my personality and health condition are not suitable to do it right now. Hopefully, I can improve it soon so I can dabble in some business here and there.",

But how can he invent a job? It's possible in a way because you could, for example, develop a new technology or discover something and hire somebody to become, say, a time machine operator. That's a new job, but it isn't available to the huge majority. The realistic option of almost everybody is to be employed, to be a businessman, to be self-employed. I guess a better way of putting it is to develop new skills or earn new knowledge. In that way, you can come up with new stuff which you can sell or offer services that others may need. I used to enroll in a resin workshop myself because I thought of making resin products. So that's like inventing a new job myself, but not literally.",

I did both in the past, get a job and be invested in a job. I work in the company and open a small business at crowded place. I opened an avocado shake drink shop and managed by 1 employee. So, after work, I have to check how much income today in the shop and then begin to shift with my employees. But, it's hard to manage my time, because I have 2 jobs. sometimes I am back at midnight, and back to the company to work in the morning. so at that time I had to think, I had to leave something behind, because my salary on company was bigger than shake drink shop, then I left my own business and focus on my main jobs.",

Or turning your passion into profit, or is it inventing your own product and sell it to the market? Well, this seems not an easy decision to make. You will need 2x or maybe 3x of your time to work on this, compared to when you're working for a company. You will also need dedication and perseverance to continue working even if you don't see much of a difference and meet your expected result in a certain period of time.

Sometimes, it requires investment of personal asset for you to be able to compete with the on demand skills, knowledge, and expertise especially in the freelancing industry nowadays. So, you'll need to enroll yourself into a specific course for upskilling and with that, you'll also need to pay for that short course.",

You already know that both has its advantages and disadvantages but I don't think there'll be anyone who will prefer to be a job hunter when they have opportunities to invent their own job. I will definitely go for inventing my own job if it's just about saying and done but no you must work hard to achieve that. By inventing your own job, you are totally independent with absolute freedom to do and undue. But it takes creativity, hard work, patience and of course a lot of money to invent a job which not everyone can succeed in it and that's why we have few job inventors with millions of job hunters around the globe. Being a job hunter comes with peace of mind because you worry less about prosperity and expenditures but there comes the tension of being fired at any time and all your dreams will seem unrealistic.Quote from: bettercrypto on November 29, 2023, 01:41:52 AMInventing a job is, in my opinion, part of a person's strategy to find a way to earn money.

Affiliate marketing or any other sort of online business and job is not job invention unless you own the site where people are working and you earn your commission at the end of the day if not you are still a job hunter and the owner can close down the site at unexpected time. Setting up a business like you listed in the second paragraph may fit in the category of job invention but you need money to do that.",
