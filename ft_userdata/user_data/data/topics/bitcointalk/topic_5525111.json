It's not about quick transaction time or cheap transaction fee, because you don't need to save some cents or a few dollars and take risk of losing $10,000 or $100,000 or bigger.",

Maybe we can surpassed the total transactions that bank has for a given year.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on January 03, 2025, 01:39:58 PMWith a bigger value of a transaction, there are more reasons to choose Bitcoin blockchain and refuse bank transfer as your payment method because your concern will be security and safety of your transaction and your money.

It might not be as instant, but you have total control of the transactions and the fees are less than what you will have to pay on a centralized 3rd party platform. So this number of transactions could double as we are getting closer to adoption.",

In next few years, it can actually double or triple up which may become a significant percentage of the total transaction volume worldwide. This is amazing and very encouraging! Bitcoin still has a long way to go but we are not much behind either..",

      "body": "It's interesting that other sources cite an even higher number:$19 trillion in transactions settled on the Bitcoin network in 2024 (Cointelegraph)This wasn't even the record volume according to that source, which was recorded in 2021, with 47 trillion.As the average BTC/USD price in 2021 was probably lower than in 2024, this looks strange at a first glance. However, in 2024 a lot of block space was occupied by Ordinals and Runes transactions, at least in the first half of the year. This in addition to the reduced block reward due to the 2024 halving (reward payments are also \"transactions\") could be the reason for that difference.I looked at the output volume chart on Blockchain.com to understand a bit better what was going on:- Output volume before the halving was roughly at 750,000 and 1,100,000 BTC per day. 99,000 of them (or 900 per day) were block rewards.- After the halving it fell to 600,000 to 850,000 BTC per day. 450 per day were block rewards.- This of course includes change, but we can't tell with certainty how much went to change addresses and thus are not really \"payments\".- It also contains output consolidations, CoinJoins, mixing and similar stuff.I guess the Coinmetrics 6.6 trillion number are an estimation for \"payments not including change\", while 19 trillion may be the raw value of all outputs, without change and block rewards. At least looking at the figures in BTC from Blockchain.com (the 600k to 1,1M BTC per day), the order of magnitude of the \"output value\" numbers gets close to the 19 trillion, while the Coinmetrics value is much lower.",

Well a couple of days back I was just surfing through the MEMPOOL as usual and I somehow toggled to blockchair explorer and I decided to view some major bitcoin facts and surprisingly I got to discover that the bitcoin network has literally transacted over 1.14 billion times and it may seem normal but it's literally massive for a crypto currency.Sometimes as bitcoiners we may just overlook a few milestones but in reality bitcoin has literally broken so many of them and that's part of the reasons it earned the title of digital gold.",

I can say it by myself, that it's normal with me and I am not looking for milestone like this, but I am honestly first that I did not know about previous milestones in total value of daily transactions on Bitcoin blockchain.It's not too interesting and important information with me, and I don't mind to find it and remember it. Because I know Bitcoin becomes stronger with time, its adoption increases and its marketcap, trading volume increase with time too. Higher values of daily transactions on Bitcoin blockchain are natural things so I feel normally with it.",
