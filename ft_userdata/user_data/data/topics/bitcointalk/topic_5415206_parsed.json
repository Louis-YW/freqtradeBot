I usually keep the spread at 90% bitcoin and 10% altcoins. You can vary it but watching the maximum returns come from bitcoin, I tend to keep that at the maxed out possibility instead of frequently trying to give weight-age to multiple coins and ending up with a hundred altcoins that will turn into shitcoins.But honestly speaking, I am bullish for bitcoin always than any other coin. This has come from my 6+ years of watching and trading on this market, along with past experience in stock markets.",

So I wouldn't left it on my portfolio. As for Ethereum and BNB, simple, projects are very strong because of the backing of the community.Quote from: TribalBob on September 28, 2022, 02:25:13 PMyou can also enter on coin-based games such as APE, SAND etc.just a suggestion not to applyYes and some P2E too wouldn't be that bad to add to his portfolio like Axie.Or the OP can choose amongst the top 10, you can't go wrong with it. They are currently cheap and you can buy tons of it and then hold and wait till the next bull run, easy but very effective strategy.",

These are legit coins that have low marketcap compared with bitcoin. Any coin have possibility to increase or decrease. If you wanna deal with the risk and then you may get more profit rather than focusing only with bitcoin. bitcoin will give you small amounts of profit. You must thinking about this dude. Try to see CMC for the best source to give you list of good coins",

Thanks in advanceI don't know if you will get really useful information and unbiased tips if you post such a general question in this forum. You alway need to be aware of the fact that probably 90% of the answers you will get are not an objective advice but a shilling of the token that the other member is fan of or is even heavily invested in if you ask such a question. So don't just go and buy the first coin that is mentioned here. Do your own research and then you have to take the risk of investing because you always have a risk in crypto. Losses (and of course also gains) of more than 10% per day are nothing unusual here. If you invest in new projects then it is also very much possible that you will lose all of your capital.My only tip is that you should never invest into meme-coins. They are absolutely useless.",

Do detailed and in-depth research so that you know what coin you are researching.Risk Warning:Trading crypto assets is a high-risk activity.

Thanks in advanceYour choice does not invest in Bitcoin and choose Altcoin in my opinion is very appropriate, because Bitcoin is already flying high and Altcoin is still in its bottom,even if you know fundamental then you will certainly choose Altcoin. List of some altcoin with good fundamentals and still very cheap is Verasity, nervos, algorand, Alchemypay, Pundix, Illuvium. Please select it and if you are still not satisfied try to analyze it yourself, I'm sure you will agree.",

Thanks in advanceIn my honest opinion, only ETH so far is the most worthy altcoin to invest. No disrespect though, but it's designed for long term and worth doing the DCA (dollar-cost averaging) along with Bitcoin. ETH so far is one altcoin that I am really bullish for long term despite that it didn't rise the way it should be after the merge. Despite there are no guarantees or promises, it's just worth holding ETH long term.",

Though, if you're looking for alternatives and want to invest in other crypto assets that have a chance of being profitable then there are a few options out there. You should look at the top coins based on market cap and liquidity. Those are Ethereum and Binance Coin. After that, you should go for coins which are known to have some value or one with a unique purpose. Finally, you can take the riskier approach, with coins that are totally unknown. Just remember that if they do turn out to be fraudulent or a scam, it's unlikely that you'll see any of your money again.",
