There sometimes members would post something and after posting they would discovered that they have done mistake so they went back and clicked edit to edit the post and saved it back again so I want to know if the two post appear in ninjastic.space or only the last post? Or the first post will also be the as well? Or there is a time frame that a post set to appear in the ninjastic.space so when the time has not elapsed and you edit your post, it is the last edited post will appear there since the time as not elapsed.",
