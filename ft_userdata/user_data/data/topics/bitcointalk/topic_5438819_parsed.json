  "content": "People who are in btc like grayscale CEO need to explain why and for what is btc.People talking about crypto blockchain that central banks and world move in blockchain.Clearly they Will choose one of the blockchains.Later they Will make it legit for example it could be ETH or other blockchain we just dont know it.Powers To be hide from others.Anyways the best thing to do is to buy dca most known crypto one of them could be the NWO order currency blockchain.The euro liquity is lowest so the crypto might replace euro becouse markets Are dominated by USD still.What i worry about is the XRP i dont see any big guys Actually buying xrp i see they are in XLM stellar but not in xrp.So far we know btc is commoditie the Same asset class as gold oil Silver Why i trust we can trust BTC ? Becouse it's commoditie at markets If anything happens with btc it means big wealthy guys lose a lot money so btc Are protected by the wall Street by the elite bankers for that reason.If Im checking one the big instutions data i see there is prices for btc up to 500,000$ what's for sure big guys have BIG plans with btc.The bigger plan could be due the war situation the great reset devaluation of euro first then russia and china place EU Under the crypto power.What i Will do ? I Will get rid of the euros becouse it look like crypto Will replace with the help. Of binance the euro currency.It look like all the Property value in Europe goes to Zero Under russian china power and you can reclaim your Property and assets with crypto but not using fiat.In USA there is different story there is allready USDT all the goverment can Do IS to connect ATM machines with USDT cash will stay just the new currency Will be BUSD USDT Or USDC Also blackrock is on USDC the Larry Fink very powerful person this guy Will not waste his time likely he know the future about USDC.World Will change all what it takes are just one more Crisis one more war one more global invent and we all Will be in crypto overnight.But this time goverment do the good thing becouse people like crypto we like USDT Also USDC Also the plan to connect cash machines with USDT Sounds great plan.Putin and grayscale might working together If you can connect the dots you can see The plan we should start asking more questions from grayscale CEO he need to tell more becouse he knows something what we dont. Know anyways wef Also involved and this forum admin Also knows all this plan.So we likely Gona have one more Crisis and then devaluation of euro and then crypto Will buy all the assets once europeans are Under china russia order.",

      "body": "This message contains a number of speculative and unverified claims about the future of cryptocurrencies, central banks, and the role of certain individuals and institutions. It is important to approach such claims with caution and to seek out credible and reliable sources for information about the cryptocurrency market.While cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in recent years, it is still uncertain how they will be adopted and used in the future. Predictions about the replacement of fiat currencies with cryptocurrencies, the domination of certain cryptocurrencies, and the involvement of specific individuals and institutions in shaping this future are largely speculative and should not be relied upon as investment advice.Additionally, the suggestion that governments and central banks will adopt cryptocurrencies in the aftermath of a crisis or war is also speculative and should be evaluated carefully in light of the complex political, economic, and social factors that would be involved in such a scenario.In general, investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks, as the prices of these assets can be highly volatile. It is important to thoroughly research any investment opportunity, understand the potential risks and rewards, and seek professional advice if necessary.Anyway i believe in Bitcoin.",

Right, and not even any other stablecoin might even qualify because I want to believe that they are all Â controlled by a centralized body and talking of Bitcoin. Do we really think that this assumption can even happen? Considering What Percentage of Bitcoin has Been Mined above 90%, are the Government able to mine the rest for themselves without any other person? or how are they able to run their economy if their fiat currencies become obsolete as some think and thinking they will adopt Bitcoin they cannot control? I believe Bitcoin will still remain as it is, mostly an Investment asset, and will be accepted by those who want it as a payment option alongside the existing fiat currency.",
