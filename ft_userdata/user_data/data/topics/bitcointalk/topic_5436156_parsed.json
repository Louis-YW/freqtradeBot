That is really awesome! No wonder that a bigger picture will be seen from that invention. Imagine we are playing like in a real life, wherein you can feel, touch and hear. VR reality is becoming advanced. And for sure, it will be a blockbuster when it will launch specially under crypto projects.",

I am looking forward whenever this VR glove will start its production.Or maybe it will fail to get wide adoption, because it will remain clunky and there's no much to do in it. Take the current state of gaming - despite VR being highly immersive, people still mostly play games on monitors and TVs, and it's not just because VR headsets are too expensive. Regular games are just more fun.",

Because, I personally didn't visit Singapore yet but from the news, I can see this country and especially the news related to blockchain, Metaverse, cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin I guess the government of Singapore is a very bitcoin and technology-friendly government where they also allowed to have activities related to metaverse in their universities and invention of the virtual reality gloves can be a good step forward for the metaverse to have felt like the real world more than ever.",

      "body": "Reminds me of japan's VR construction robots.QuoteGiant VR Robots Are Building Railways In JapanAPRIL 26, 2022Could VR-powered humanoid robots be the future of heavy construction?Over the years we’ve seen a number of major corporations try their hands at marrying VR technology and robotics, from VR convenience store employees and a remote-controlled bomb squad bot to a rather unsettling headset that uses a robotic arm to hand-feed delicious candy. And that’s just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.Earlier this month, JR West—a major railroad transportation company operating out of Japan—revealed plans to use giant VR-powered robots in the construction of future railroad lines. The multifunctional railway heavy equipment is comprised of a railroad construction vehicle merged with a humanoid heavy robot, resulting in a sort of blue-collar Transformer.https://virtualuncle.com/2022/04/26/giant-vr-robots-are-building-railways-in-japan/A feedback glove could be exactly what real life robots need to give their operators better sensitivity and feel for things.While technology movements like metaverse strive to make the internet more like real life. I think there is something to consider in terms of simplicity versus realism. The main advantage of the internet is it automating tasks and making everyday chores simpler and easier to perform. That functionality is one of technologies main attractions. Which could imply that its a focus worth pursuing for platforms like metaverse.As opposed to a trend where tasks that are fast and easy on the internet, become more like real life.",
