Our goal is to listen to tweets that happen... whether we want it or not, influential people such as Elon Musk have the power to move the market, and institutional traders already listen to such tweets. At the moment our product is still in private phase for friends and family, we slowly plan to release a public Beta version and we will add a Privacy Policy as well as terms ofc --- we do not collect data besides the necessities of creating an account (email). The API keys are hashed and encrypted too.

Are these the influential people you are talking about?Hey @yhiaali3 @JeromeTash & @mendace - the concept is to listen various tweets and trigger based on their news & keywords...Being \"first\" when such a tweet happens has a massive potential....  They are influential people as news medias will talk about their actoins and this will lead to a storm of actions that will be reflected on the market.... Some of them aare pseudoinfluencers its true, that certainly pocess no real value in terms of growth, but the market moves based on such people (they are influencers not \"teachers\" after all). Here for example the growth was massive - https://ibb.co/YfCQWTBOn other tweets Musk moved the DOGE coin 26% within minutes... I certainly wouldn't want to miss on this....From our perspective, news have the power to move markets -- and news are made by people. Twitter happens to be a platform for such people to tweet their thoughts....Quote from: DaveF on January 08, 2023, 12:31:24 PMSo after all the discussions about not your keys not your coins you are introducing a service that1) Makes people leave coins on an exchange while2) Is making trades based on tweets from a platform that has had a massive hack / data leak: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=54318223) Is leaving API keys in someone elses control: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=54322064) All with a site that gives no owner or contact information / no physical address.Don't think you are going to get a real positive response here.-DaveHi Dave, thanks a lot for your reply actually, you went quite in depth there and althrough it feels as negative feedback, at the same time it is a quite genuine one too...I will try to reply as best as I can and add more context in the hope of challenging your thoughts in this discussion.1) Fortunatelly or unfortunatelly, the CEX part of the business is not going away - at least any time soon (there are traditional industry brokers as well).... As Napcat, our main goal was to build all the service by connecting to DEX's, but we feel its easier to start as a CEX and then slowly slowly expand, in order to also do things right and not risk any potential hacks.2) We are mainly listening to tweets from influential people, the time will come however that the influential people will leave Twitter for a decentrilized solution, until that happens thought, there is a market fit.3) We are actually taking an approach of storing minimal data and the one that we do is hashed and encrypted - there are plenty of services that do just like that and are entirely secure. 4) The site was just constructed, we have not yet incorporated nor released a public Beta. We are not asking for funds, we just want to validate an idea.",

We are not asking for funds, we just want to validate an idea. Was not going for negative more along the lines of what to expect here on this forum.There are people out there that probably will like and use your service. But, here it's going to be a much tougher sell.You might get more people if you post in the altcoin parts of the forum. There are people who spend a lot of time trading, you will get people who are looking for every possible edge.Here you are probably only going to get BTC users who sometimes dabble in BTC trading but, for the most part don't spend the time that people who live in the alts do.And we are a lot more paranoid then others.Also, as I said with all the security issues and exchanges imploding & closing lately I see it as a tougher sell in general. You MIGHT get a better response if you set it up that people could run their own server / local application with the code that then makes the trades based on API calls to your sever.This way the keys never leave their control. <shrug> the other side of that is then it becomes the users responsibility to maintain a safe environment.-Dave",

To quote your example, the exact process would be the following:a) Assuming Elon musk tweets \"I will buy Bitcoin for 1$\" -> b) For your bot to be activated, you need to enable a \"Musk Bot\" by following Elon Musk, and at it add the keyword \"Bitcoin\". This will trigger a buy order at your Binance account...A good example would be to follow Musk and trigger buy orders with 2 keywords, Bitcoin and Doge... - Will the decision-making be based on keywords, for example, Elon, bitcoin, buying?Yes, to begin with. - Or will artificial intelligence decide?Yes, in the near future we will give this option, at the moment we use AI to understand images (for example Musk sharing a BTC image). We also use ChatGPT for additional help.  - Or will the algorithm monitor the market and from which the decision will be taken.Also yes in the near future, at the moment we are too small to be doing big steps though so we are first focusing on perfecting the basics. - Or will the influential people control the execution of orders?In a way yes, people with big influential groups have the power to move the market and we know for a fact that there are tons of institutions trading based on tweets (Alameda Research for example was also trading Musk's tweets).How do you take profit:A simple Take profit parameter that you will need to enter (otherwise you will never exit the position in the first place)What more: There is going to be an option for full sentiment trading based on the tweets, however at this stage we are simply going to perfect the basics...That being said, we would greatly appreciate any feedback on the product, feel free to contact us if any through Twitter or Discord!Thank you for your questions!Quote from: hugeblack on January 12, 2023, 05:46:25 AMWhat is the decision-making mechanism?

      "body": "Just like others, I have some concerns about the practicality and safety of this solution.First of all, relying solely on signals from Twitter to make trades is risky, as the information on Twitter can be unreliable and manipulated. The crypto market is volatile, and making decisions based on unverified information can lead to significant losses.After that, connecting a third-party platform like Napcat with a trusted broker like Binance raises questions about data privacy and security. How will Napcat ensure that user data is protected from potential breaches or misuse? As a user, I would want to know how my data is being handled and protected.Last but not the least, the use of automation platforms in trading can be both a blessing and a curse. We know that automation can streamline trading and reduce human error, but it can also lead to significant losses if not used correctly.",
