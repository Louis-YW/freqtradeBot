  "content": "Greetings!Let us introduce ourselves. We are the first generation of inhabitants from the Solar system that will live in the galaxy not so far away from Milky Way, the Unixy. We are the test subjects for this one of a kind experiment. An experiment where we tend to unite the inhabitants of Earth into a single galaxy, where every player owns at least one planet and one test subject card to travel across his planet. By default the planet has some basic infrastructures such as UniShop where you walk into the store and search departments (blockchains) for products (tokens, NFTs, etc.) or UnReal Estate to sell your planets land/buy other players planets land. Inhabitans are able to fight for rewards, trade, build infrastructures, promoting their artworks, watch and leverage their assets at Parralell Wall Street and much more.The Unixy token will be the main token in the galaxy and will be deployed across ALL available blockchains, starting with Binance Smart Chain.Token launch will be at 10PM UTC on PancakeSwap. Inhabitant cards will be dropped to Solana exactly a week after.Website: https://unixy.spaceTelegram: t.me/UnixyTokenOfficialTwitter: https://twitter.com/0xUnixyDiscord: TBATaste the future",
