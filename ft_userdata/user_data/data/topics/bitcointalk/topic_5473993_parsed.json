  "content": "Bitcoin Genesis block is mined on 3rd January 2009 and after that, many Bitcoin blocks found by miners. Many developers created abundant altcoins and they are even uncountable. Coinmarketcap or Coingecko tracked not all of altcoins and many of shitcoins die after a few hours because they are created by scammers and only appear on decentralized exchanges with liquidity pools from scammers to steal money from people who want to get rich without knowledge.After many years, Bitcoin is King.The graphics is for 2015 and later years but you can use Historical Snapshots from Coinmarketcap to have ranking tables back to 2013.2013 snapshot: https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20130428/2014 snapshot: https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20140105/More impressive if we expand it to global companies.

I think that's just how it is with bitcoin, the people knows bitcoin the most and so that's the one that they care to get into more compared to other crypto out there. Also, the idea that bitcoin is also benchmark or basis for a lot of crypto out there is such a good way to explain why bitcoin will always be king and even if you just look at how is bitcoin doing, you can easily learn about the current market situation.",

Bitcoin was not the first crypto coin to appear, but Bitcoin was the first crypto coin that succeeded in capturing a lot of public attention so many people thought Bitcoin was the first. The first cryptocoin was eCash which was developed by the DigiCash company in 1990https://www.investopedia.com/tech/were-there-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/Quote from: krishnaverma on November 14, 2023, 03:19:12 AM2) It has a solid foundation. Developers made this coin with long term vision. It is true that Bitcoin has a strong foundation and that is in its solid community which continues to develop this coin well so that many things arise to bring down this coin to no avail because the market still makes it the main choice in the market, so far it is true that Bitcoin is the king of dozens of existing coins.Quote from: krishnaverma on November 14, 2023, 03:19:12 AM3) It is a good option for current investors alao because it proved its worth in last 13 years. Other coins that appear are only developed for the purpose of enriching their developers, that's why you will see how many trash coins appear and when they first appear they are always said to have potential but the passage of time proves that they are really trash coins. Bitcoin has been around for a long time and those who believe in its future development will get the opportunity to make good profits from investing.",

Those persons who did not know about Bitcoin or even don't know of cryptocurrency saying this. At every bull run reach to it's All time highest digits and giving more profits to the investor. It's true that after some time Bitcoin come down I think last time came to 10k$ but why they did not see it's price at the bull run. At every investment, there are losses you can not earn a lot of profit without any loss and they know this but still, they hating Bitcoin for this. I am especially to beginners do not pay attention to this type of rumor,  those people who have nothing are mostly spreading rumors those who have some money and assets will support Bitcoin and they know the quality of Bitcoin.",

The halving event.Without making a comprehensive long post about why bitcoin is king of all cryptocurrency, you have simply summarized some of it's outstanding attributes. Bitcoin is the first crypto and it introduced decentralized digital currency into the financial system, it has no boundaries. Unlike fiat, that the printing of it's currency has no limit, bitcoin from creation has already been given a limited supply, very unique. The bitcoin p2p transaction is the first of it's kind, that does not require any centralized influence, except by choice of using exchanges. Many investors in bitcoin, have become richer, because of it's potentials, as a business currency.Bitcoin is a pacesetter for altcoins, it stands on it's own as \"the king\" of them all. Altcoins follows it's patterns to have relevance in the crypto market.",
