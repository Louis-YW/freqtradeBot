In the past, they only contained the one from ThomasV. I couldn't find the key via the fingerprint as explained in the article, but you can download and import the individual keys from the links on Electrum's download page. The final results look a bit different than what they did in the past but the software will tell you if the verification was successful or not.",

Are you using GPG4Win/Kleopatra, command line, or something else? What errors are you getting?",

It's very easy to update - just download the new version and delete the old one, make a shortcut to the newer one on your desktop and then it auto-updates your wallet version as well. It's also more foolproof than other methods. Complaints about libsecp256k1 dependency in particular, are very common using other methods.",
