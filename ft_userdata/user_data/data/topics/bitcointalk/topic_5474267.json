Any wallet on any online device is prone to hacking, so instead of you looking for possible kinds of malware, only store a small amount of BTC in your online wallet, that's an amount that you can afford to lose. Take note that a mobile phone is not also a good device to store a large amount of BTC, in that case you should buy a hardware wallet for your funds, or set up an airgapped wallet if you have the knowledge to do so.",

If you follow all the advice that you could read in this topic, you have a small chance of infecting your device with something malicious, although you should always count on something new and unpredictable that can slip under the radar and infect millions of smartphones in a very short time.Since you want to know more, the following link has a good summary of what you are interested in -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_malware",

As long as your phone is connected to the internet, there's always the tendency for vulnerability and in that case, I'd advise that you keep only a small amount of digital assets on your wallet. Download apps from Play store and not from unknown sources. Whenever you want to download an app, always check that you're downloading the original app and not a clone. Be careful of the apps you grant permission to access your device. Never store your seed phrase electronically such as emails, note app, cloud storage etc. Don't screenshot your seed phrase and save on your phone, it could be compromised by an infostealer.Don't use third party keyboard applications, your seed phrase or other sensitive information could be stolen by keyloggers.

A few years ago before knowing Bitcoin, I was quite active in flashing ROMs and Custom ROMs for several smartphones that I used.Indeed Custom ROM will be more dangerous because there are many vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed, it will be easily infected with Malware because Rooting that is done opens all entrances for Malware or ransomware. Some naughty people modify a Custom ROM and Porting ROM usually they embed phishing links, or Malware that will work to take advantage of smartphone users and even steal the identity of all logins made.Quote from: Lucius on November 17, 2023, 03:04:46 PMIn general, you can expect any malware/virus that appears in desktop versions, with the only difference being that malware adapts to mobile applications on such devices. -snip-Malware is now even more sophisticated and smarter.Even multi-device can attack any device.Like Xenomorph, which caused an uproar with its powerful intelligence to hide from Google Protect antivirus detection by hiding in commonly used applications.Xenomorhp even came again with more powerful power to steal all the identity of the device used such as bank data, account data, and crypto wallet Seed Phrase. It is very dangerous if you are not aware of the security of the device used. https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/xenomorph#xenomorph_is_back_once_again",

I know about Google Protect's weakness to ward off Xenomorph malware, but thanks to that Google Protect has been updated to address attacks of the same model. As long as you still use Android Google Protect will be the first layer of protection and additional antivirus, I only trust antivirus vendors that are already well-known such as Kaspersky, Norton, and others.Even now every Android smartphone has supporting protection that works together to become the default antivirus besides Google Protect.Do not install antivirus applications that you do not know and usually the latest Android smartphones already have a built-in antivirus, so there is no need for additional antivirus.",
