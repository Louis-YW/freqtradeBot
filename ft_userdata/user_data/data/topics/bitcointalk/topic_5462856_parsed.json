I didn't have the experience and the initial requirements to do a review but I was able to do it. The reason I think why he still applied is because he probably read that the payment will be given first and that's the beginning of your deadline for the review. The saddest thing about this is that he was willing to destroy his reputation for a measly $90 worth of bitcoin.",

It has already been 10+ days since he missed his initial deadline, and he was active on the forum during this period, giving him ample opportunity to return the payment if he really wanted to. The requirement for a refund is clearly stated in the initial conditions of the review campaign, which he had agreed to. Moreover, it's worth noting that the extension of his first deadline was granted at his own request, as indicated here. Given these circumstances, I believe that his current lack of communication is intentional.",

Although, he's a senior member by rank, but his activity and number of posts show that he has been quite active on the forum for a long time. I would always support Royse sir because I have worked with him and he's the kindest and most supportive manager on the forum. I have also participated in the same review campaign as well in another review campaign of Royse sir where he has sent to review money to my wallet before completion of the review. I have completed and submitted my review on time because if someone gives us such opportunity then its our duty to do our best to complete the tasks on time. It's totally unfair and inhuman to do something like this with a reputed manager like Royse sir, and if the accused gets my comment then I suggest him/her to refund the money and say sorry for his act. I'm quite sure that he/she may get another chance if he/she refunds the money after seeing the comments on this thread.I have noticed that the user hasn't earned a single merit in last 120 days and that shows clearly that the user is not contributing a lot to the forum. I recommend Royse sir to have merit requirement of at least 5 in last 120 days for the next review campaigns as the the users who have earned those merits will always try their best to complete the tasks on time because those users are mostly the active users of the forum and they would never do anything that may create problems for their account.",
