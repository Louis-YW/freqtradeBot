This third party server also is able to see the IP address your wallet connects from, which can provide them even more data to tie your Bitcoin addresses to your identity.  Quote from: wasabiwallet.ioWe live in an Orwellian surveillance society where your information is being used to typecast and manipulate you. Bitcoin projects are being pressured to collect more and more data, if possible. This is why Wasabi Wallet is programmed to be a zero-knowledge software. Developers can't collect any sensitive information about you. What you do with your Bitcoin is your business.Wasabi innovates on the light wallet design and solves these privacy leaks by masking your wallet addresses with client side block filters, and masking your IP address with Tor. Although combining these two technologies this reduces the privacy footprint for receivers to a single Bitcoin address, these addresses are still visible on a public ledger, so another step must be taken to hide the origin of the coins you received from the destination you send them to, and vice versa. This traceability is broken by coinjoins.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Wasabi provides blockchain level privacyWabiSabi research paper (Ádám Ficsór, Yuval Kogman, Lucas Ontivero, and István András Seres): https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/206.pdfWasabi's most impressive privacy feature is the ability to participate in coinjoin transactions. A coinjoin combines your coins non-custodially into a bulk transaction with other users in order to make your Bitcoin history untraceable when viewed on the public blockchain. The outputs of a coinjoin can't be tracked to the inputs because the outputs created have identical clones with the *exact* same value. Even the coinjoin coordinator themselves cannot determine which inputs and outputs belong to each participant:Quote from: Lucas OntiveroThe whole WabiSabi protocol is a really complex beast which involves a lot of cryptography from Pedersen commitments, zk-proofs, balance proofs, range proofs, ownership proofs, a strobe construction around Keccak and others that play together to create the credentials system. The protocol involves the construction of http messages that have to be sent to the central coordinator in a randomized schedule under different Tor identities to guarantee the unlinkability of the participants' transactions against the central coordinator.Here's an example of a coinjoin transaction containing 447 inputs and 469 outputs from different users: 93d31d3c51e48a5583ccdc2e9342e7c07c95531825c03e7dc6807cb27be48155=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Cold storage interfaceWasabi also allows you to connect your USB hardware wallet such as BitBox02, Coldcard, Jade, Ledger, or Trezor.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Reputation for innovationWasabi Wallet was awarded a share of Bitcointalk's longstanding coinjoin development bounty, along with JoinMarket:Quote from: theymos on May 30, 2019, 08:09:09 AMCongratulations to the Wasabi and JoinMarket developers! JoinMarket pioneered a lot of CoinJoin science (and BTW, belcher wrote an excellent & comprehensive wiki article on privacy), while Wasabi is the first wallet that implements CoinJoin in both a highly-usable and sound way. As both a signer and a donor to the CoinJoin bounty fund, I'm thrilled that these two pieces of software exist!For everyone looking to improve their privacy, I highly recommend checking out Wasabi, especially over centralized \"mixers\".=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Wasabi communities:Quote from: Wasabi Wallet",

Quote from: Kruw on December 01, 2023, 02:51:53 PMCold storage interfaceIf you initially set up your hardware wallet using Wasabi as the front end instead of the default Ledger Live or Trezor Suite apps, it will prevent your IP address and Bitcoin wallet addresses from being leaked to Ledger's & Trezor's servers. On a serious note. How would this work? You need Ledger Live during the onboarding process and initial setup. You need to install the crypto apps on the wallet. I guess the software already records everything it needs/wants at that stage. Trezors are shipped with no firmware installed on the devices, but I guess you can get all that from their GitHub. Can you install Ledger apps including the 3rd-party apps from their GitHub as well and set everything up through Wasabi?",
