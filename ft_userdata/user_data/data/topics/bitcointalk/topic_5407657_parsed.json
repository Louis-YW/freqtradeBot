  "content": "8220 Mining Group, was first publicly reported in 2018. The name 8220 Gang comes from the group’s original use of port 8220 for C2 network communications. Over the last month a crimeware has expanded their botnet to roughly 30,000 hosts globally through the use of Linux and common cloud application vulnerabilities and poorly secured configurations. In a recent campaign, the group was observed making use of a new version of the IRC botnet, PwnRig cryptocurrency miner (a custom version of the open source XMRig miner), and its generic infection script.Some more data: https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-8220-gang-massively-expands-cloud-botnet-to-30000-infected-hosts/",

Still good business if you have 30000 computers wasting electricity without paying for it.Well, $30k per month is not that bad, after all.And yeah, the number looks rather low, maybe the report didn't want to show overly big unverified number, especially as some of those computers most probably don't stay up 24/7 (however, since I do expect the numbers to be much bigger, I've done the math with those 30k computers running 24/7).Quote from: PawGo on July 26, 2022, 10:05:21 AMI've been preaching this many years ago: no matter what OS one is using, there must be tools you can keep on tray and show the CPU usage (I use that on both Windows and Linux). If one sees abnormally big and constant CPU usage, that must be investigated. Unfortunately few do that, few know how to look for that...",

I mean, if it's just a small percentage, can someone be exploited for years, without knowing about it? Also, have I understood it correctly that only Linux platforms are affected?Sorry if those are stupid questions, I'm far from being expert in this field, but I feel like I'd rather have some answers.",

I mean, if it's just a small percentage, can someone be exploited for years, without knowing about it? Also, have I understood it correctly that only Linux platforms are affected?I suppose it should be visible on the list of processes running.I did not investigate that kind of attack, but I will - maybe there are some information how to detect potentially suspicious behavior. For example - do they use 100% of the machine or maybe just 1 core, to stay quiet (many systems notify admin when load is high for a long period of time).I think good configuration of firewall would be the first and basic step to avoid problems.",

Still good business if you have 30000 computers wasting electricity without paying for it.Hmm, me too, and I'm almost 100% certain the massive botnet uncovered years ago had hundreds of millions of devices infected, even the one in the news last month had millions.A dollar a month is a lot! There are those manual botnets (forget what they're called but it's a sweatshop running 100s of mobile phones literally taped to a wall) collecting cents a day and it's apparently still profitable.",

What interested me in the article was the use of fake government domains, one of which is an active domain of the Brazilian government. What exactly would that mean?QuoteOne of the notable features of PwnRig is the fake pool request for government domains. Early 2021 versions made use of fbi.gov; however, the latest version uses fbi.gov.br and 161.148.164.31. While the FBI subdomain is not real, the IP address is the active IP hosting the gov.br domain – the true Brazil federal government domain.Quote from: Betwrong on July 26, 2022, 10:44:09 AMIs it possible to know whether or not your computer was infected?

CPU mining combined with privacy features makes it the perfect coin for a botnet.but monero has 'some' competing 'good miners' so the share of the ~430 a day coin. is not all going to end up in a botnets hands. there are many crap coins, with no real block mining competiton. this most reward can go to a botnet/malware, whilst also being such an unknown crapcoin no one spots the abuse happening to care to even want to fight it..there are some that make blocks in seconds (meaning far less than 10cent of CPU power to make a block) but had coins market rate at more then 3x of that cost. it doesnt need to be coins worth $150 a coin at 430coin a day rate(like monero) to make it worth cheating peoplescammers, hackers and just generally malicious people can do it on many coins. 30,000 botnets using a crap coin of 100 coins every 60 seconds where cpu cost is 0.04kwh electric=0.02 per cpu/hour=0.000333 per cpu/min=0.00000333 per cpu/coin=0.0999 per 30k botnet electric abuse per coin(not actual cost to hacker. but network underlying value cost per coin)~$0.10 network value per coin, but coin market rate is $0.50 per coin meaning $50 a block(minute) meaning $72k a day, where botnet gets most of the coins per day thus most of that $72k without causing speculation fear/changes of pricescompared to monero $64.5k a day where botnet would get less share of that amount and would cause more speculation fear and drop price thus lose out more.so yea there are many many crap coins that are not even worth a dollar each. but adding up how many coins are produced and the lack of competition meaning a botnet can get a large share of the daily coins means they can botnet/malware mine a few different crapcoins and net a nice hefty reward",
