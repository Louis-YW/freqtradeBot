This was false, the result of misinformation. The news lead originated from an unconfirmed screenshot posted by an X user who claimed it was from the Bloomberg Terminal.\"__Thanks to such news, first the short traders lost their money, and after information about the fake appeared, the long traders lost their money. Losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.That's where the real scammers are.",

What I believe is that they did this to take advantage of what the market will bring, and that happens real quick, so I also believe their objective has been achieved. Inasmuch as the news brought about a positive market response, manipulation is still manipulation. Who knows what they are going to do in the near future, and if they are charged by those who lose their trade as a result of this, will such legal charges be honoured and made valid? protecting consumers interests. These are the areas where the SEC is supposed to also act, and their citizen traders won't be left behind if they truly are working for the interests of their people.",

No, it is perhaps one of the most dangerous types because it often requires betting large amounts to obtain a relatively average profit margin.But at the same time, I do not understand why news sources that publish false information are exempt from legal accountability. There is supposed to be a regulatory framework for the activity of these institutions, on the basis of which they gain part of their legitimacy.

But this turned out to be untrue. When the number of shorts became high and it became profitable for the manipulator to take away margin positions, the price flew sharply upward on the fake news. I'm sure it would have happened anyway.Previously, the manipulator bought coins cheaply and made money on pumps; now the manipulator makes money by liquidating margin positions. According to analysts, the losses amounted to about 0.5 Billion dollars.",

Otherwise, you're just like an oil trader trying to sue a newspaper about news that \"might\" have influenced oil prices.It's complicated, it's ambiguous but, it is what it is and right now we're helpless !There were far worse cases without a better outcome, like one fake tweet and 20 billion wiped out:https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/14/twitter-fake-eli-lilly/",
