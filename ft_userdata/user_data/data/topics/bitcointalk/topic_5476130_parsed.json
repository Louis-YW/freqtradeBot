I cant remember the specifics about how he gave the 4 slabs away. It was either monopoly guy or the 3 coin set from that time. The squirrel was a very different company back then. Still very early, not a big following. It was really 1 month later he started getting a real following. The 6 months prior all his releases were like 6 or 7 mintage then slowly moved up. He actually had a couple pieces he put out in early 2021 but they werent called squirrel bits. They were like tin plates with cutouts if i remember correctly. Someone on the forum has them i saw pics not that long ago.",
