      "body": "It's a good idea, but hope should be kept alive that things will get better despite the unforseen circumstances. I have a little advice, which is to try to help if you see someone in need. One person may not be able to cause a change, but they can make a difference. Even if you teach people about crypto, some will need money to invest, and crypto is not a get-rich-quick scheme. While some people require a consistent income, crypto may not be able to meet their needs in the early stages of teaching it, but some will still appreciate the knowledge and can excel in it.",

So in this scenario, I will love to say that nothing is too big or too small, but only if we could help just a handful of individuals, it will literally go a long way at our various community.",

I understand your point my chief and sincerely I dey feel like say you never really get wetin I dey talk and I really dey try so hard to clear the matter..I basically no dey in support of parking people into the forum just for the sake playing a role in the financial status of a person.Basically any reward we dey get here na to use hold body and I know of some persons wey start their lives from here and along the line after getting to some stage, abandon their accounts for some greater course.The major thing be say make we try touch the lives around us no matter how little the help might be not necessarily bringing in people to the forum.Hopefully at the end of the month, I dey expect to make some outreach to persons who truly need it and by the grace of God I dey plan to make the activity a month one as I hope to use at least one week of my campaign money  from each month to touch lives of persons around me before extending and I urge we all do same.",

No be lie oh, as of last year and upper year the way this crypo scheme dy pop up every here and then especially for raido, no be the same way e be now and I no even dy hear say seminar dy self, everybody dy on low key and e get as e fit be self if them catch you them go label you as Yahoo boy or person.
