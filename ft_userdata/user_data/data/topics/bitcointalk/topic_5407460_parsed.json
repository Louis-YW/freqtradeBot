If one should examine this successful gambler you might be surprised they got one thing in common to say which is \"not being greedy\" . Eliminating that spirit of greediness when it comes to gambling is one very thing that has helped me in becoming a bit successful in this industry,  when I identified that I was playing with greed even after series winings, that's even when I do shits and will end up giving back the money to the platform and until when I changed my attitude towards gaming that Is when I started wining games.",

But I think this statistic is not about the total amount someone risked, but about the one-time bet that brought him that win. In fact, theoretically, these people could have played for years and lost in the past a much larger amount than they won",

So, if you're goin to play that amount you'll bet the entire reward while you're gonna win it  As always, play only for fun, and not for win, with this rules you'll maximize your experience at casino !",

Risk is for me related to the winning chance, when someone win a huge amount from small bets means that he play a high risk game where the winning chance is so small but may give really huge return when the luck come. So I think you should edit your title to \"biggest win with low bet\", low bet here does not mean low risk because basically the risk is so huge due to low winning chance. Lottery game for example, you may million dollar with few cents or bucks but your chance is so low = high risk and you may spend a lot of money before you hit the jackpot.",

Take a look at your post itself you just gave 4 examples but have you ever wondered what is the probability of happening this in someone's life? I won't say not even once in a million times so instead of spending $1 for million times to lose 1 million dollars with no assurance of getting any returns I would choose something better way if I am really interested in making money.Gambling is mainly for fun so you can take it as job and think you can get your main and only source of income from doing it.",

Also, it is included on the article where the winnings goes to. The 40 million jackpot winner, unfortunately lost most of winnings and has some jail time for things he had done. The 38.7 million jackpot winner haven't been able to receive the whole lump sum but it given on a 25 year basis. Lastly, the 18 million jackpot winner have paid off his father's medical bill before his personal expenses. Looks like all of them have different experience on how they were able to use the funds they've won.",
