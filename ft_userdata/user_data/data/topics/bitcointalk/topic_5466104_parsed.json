  "content": "So, I was wondering what could happen when someone lost his access to his non custodial wallet or died in the eventually long run then,  I came about this thread Quote from: BOARBEAR on February 28, 2011, 04:55:55 AMImaging bitcoin becomes popular and we want to use this currency forever, and some amount of bitcoin is lost from this economy each day.Does anybody think this is a problem?I found some interesting replies but I wasn't satisfied though. My thought is , if bitcoin has a fixed amount that could be circulated then,what about the shortage due to some occurrence. Among the replies I found one Quote from: Timo YMost sane people won't store most of their Bitcoins on a single wallet.dat file on their laptop, once Bitcoin becomes mainstream. Unless it's only a small amount.  At the very least they will make several backups and tell a family member about them. I found this helpful but what of vice versaSource: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3951.0",

So far those Bitcoin are untouched and Satoshi never attempted to make any transaction out of those wallets till this day. Let's say that if Satoshi never touches those wallets and allow the funds to stay in those wallets then in that situations those BTC are gone forever as long as someone else doesn't have the private keys of the wallets where Satoshi stored those Bitcoin. Let's say if someone knows the addresses of those wallets and has the private keys of those wallets of Satoshi Nakamoto then in that case the lost Bitcoin can be recovered and added into the market. Surely those may cause Bitcoin's price to go very low in value if they are added into market today. The investors will get a shock if they see 1 million more Bitcoin into the market and that's why most of them will sell their hold coins for cheap rates.",

I found this helpful but what of vice versaYou are reading a way old post, but still, this circulatory problem exists. To be honest, I do not know about others. But yeah! I also have these types of discussions with myself. Like, what if I die and all the BTC I have goes to waste? So, I have a little brother, and I have told him about the funds I have but did not tell him how he could access them because he is still young and I do not want my BTC to be spent on some games.So, I will just teach them until I have some point, and once I realise now is the time, then I might guide them about withdrawals and about keys. Till then, I am taking the risk of not telling anyone. I am honestly not doing it just because the satoshi will be wasted, because from one angle, that's good for the community, as the more BTC forbidden, the lesser the supply will be, and the more demand will increase the price of BTC.I am doing it because I do not want my earnings to be wasted.Telling a family member is the only way possible because I trust them more than some third-party company, which assures full confidence that they will provide the funds back but all they deduct is a small fee. hehe. I mean, why would I take the more risky option when I have a lesser one?",

It's stored in a wallet which results in a lack of supply because it's stored in a wallet that can't be reopened, and this is a good thing because it keeps the bitcoin price from continuing to rise.",
