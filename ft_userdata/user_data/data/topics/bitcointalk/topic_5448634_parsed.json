I guess the higher the bitcoin price goes the more likely it is that people move into bitcoin en masse. That would be a bank run of sorts & the economy is in enough of a mess without that.Personally I think bitcoin will best down any regulatory resistance & pressure from people in power to suppress it. Bitcoin is unstoppable, it’s like a ball being held under water, when it’s let go you know what happens.",

The government does not need to embrace it for it to thrive, they just need to not come up with stupid regulations against it. The Potus has implemented some regulations designed to stall bitcoin growth, the most recent being the proposed increase in excise taxes for bitcoin miners[1].This would slightly affect bitcoin, but the country would feel the most effect as the innovation of the technology would move to a more sustaining environment.

As long as individual have stated adopting bitcoin on their own,knowing that it is am asset and a store of value to save their investment from inflation. I don't think that there is anything the US government can do about stopping citizens not to adopt bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized in nature and makes the government not being able to give accountability on who is using it or not. Bitcoin spread and adoption can't be stopped by anyone,no matter how powerful you are in the world.",

You are right, US has the largest market and miners, but also has the largest bitcoin ATMs, far greater than the second. We do not have to depend on the government before bitcoin adoption would continue, but just that the government should not do something that can discourage the continuous bitcoin adoption.Also we should know that bitcoin is not only about US, it is about the world, even if US is discouraging bitcoin, what will happen is what happened when China discouraged it, governments on the world in all countries are not thinking the same, some countries will only see it as an advantage.Quote from: Merit.s on April 13, 2023, 07:01:37 AMThe US government especially Joe Biden sees bitcoin as a threat to the US dollar,and for this reason he doesn't want to promote bitcoin in his government but he has failed because bit coin don't need any promotion by government. I do not think he failed, because he did not promote bitcoin. If he remain mute and do not talk about bitcoin, US remain bitcoin friendly nation. President is not the regulators, but I know how the president of a nation can be very powerful though and how his power and legislative power can override.",

Some folks are freaking out that Bitcoin could mess with the U.S. dollar, but let's be real, it's our own policies that have been doing damage to our currency. Joe Biden has been yapping his trap about Bitcoin, saying it's gonna mess up our economy, but that's just a bunch of bull. If anything, Bitcoin and other digital currencies present a sweet opportunity for the U.S. to step up and be a leader in cutting-edge tech.I get why some folks might have doubts about Bitcoin, particularly with all the political talk around it. However, it's key to keep in mind that Bitcoin isn't naturally political, and plenty of advantages could arise if it becomes more popular. Whether you're keen on using Bitcoin to stash your cash or to make online purchases, one thing is for sure - it's a big change in how we view money and finance.",

If there are other nations which have more friendly policies for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, more companies will migrate from the USA. to those nations.

The citizens don't actually need for the government to embrace it; what's the need for that, unless you actually mean the government should put in some form of regulation? The U.S is among the top-rising crypto-friendly communities, with lots of functional Bitcoin ATM machines. What more do you need before you agree that they have embraced Bitcoin?",

So it's no wonder that they don't get why embracing cryptos is the way and feel protective over something more traditional and old. I agree that Bitcoin should be embraced because policies can be set up to ensure that the USD gets its fair share of demand (which it will get anyway, even if Bitcoin is somehow allowed to compete), and there's much to be gained from favourable attitudes to Bitcoin and crypto-related businesses (mining farms which seem under a threat in the USA and crypto exchanges which seem to be having a hard time with all the regulations they are supposed to follow).",

I don't know why you're trying to turn this into a political thing. Trump was also against Bitcoin. The only time he even mentioned it was when he said he doesn't like it. In fact the Trump administration was trying to push through some tyrannical anti-crypto rules in the last few weeks before they left office, but they weren't able to get them through before they left and Biden stopped those rules from potentially being put in place as soon as he came into office. But neither Biden nor Trump are bitcoin friendly. Most politicians aren't bitcoin friendly because most politicians don't know anything about Bitcoin. The few politicians that are bitcoin friendly are the few that know at least a little bit about it.Agree on your title at least, the US should embrace bitcoin, it would be good for the people and good for the country. But I don't know why you're trying to spread misinformation about Biden and Trump and make this a democrat/republican political thing lol",

No banks or governments can stop the growth of Bitcoin, because it's completely decentralized and unregulated. I believe that US government will not accept Bitcoin as a legal tender anytime because that will reduce the usage of US dollar worldwide. Let's consider if the US embraces Bitcoin then almost everyone will trade with US using Bitcoin rather than US dollar and that can be the cause of inflation and devaluation of US dollar in long term. As far as I know, the US public is adopting Bitcoin in masses, and the government is not putting any restrictions directly on citizens to not buy Bitcoin. The odds are favoring Bitcoin and if that continues things will be really good in crypto world in coming days.",
