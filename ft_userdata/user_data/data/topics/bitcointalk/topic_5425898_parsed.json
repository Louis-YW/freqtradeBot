Good to know that my accounts back then were already depleted of funds so I lost nothing. Now, am not aware of any similar platforms back in the 80s or 70s if there were like that. Good thing to know that more than 10 years ago, the birth of Bitcoin came on the scene and this time around there is no government that can shut it down for good.",

That is a completely centralized system that is more like something like PayPal which has nothing to do with decentralized money like bitcoin.",

      "body": "Ops you are overthinking things, and if you must know. According to the Bitcoin whitepaper, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital money unlike e-gold which was just an asset and centralized which make it easy to control and destroy, but Bitcoin does not have any of such primitive feature that allows third-party presence to the point that Bitcoin will be destroyed like the e-gold you mentioned. Agree every new invention goes through a lot of criticism and attempts to destroy it event the internet faced a similar early attack too but today internet is the greatest tool for human development same can be said about Bitcoin because to some bitcoin have died a thousand time in the space of it short 10+ years of existence yet Bitcoin is getting stronger over and over again, and that point to one thing that Bitcoin is immutable.",

      "body": "I think the concept of cryptocurrency and e-gold is quite different. If e-gold is backed by gold and silver and regulated, bitcoin is different, this is truly a revolutionary digital asset and makes it easier for people to make transactions globally quickly, securely, free from manipulation and government intervention. You can make transactions and it's really safe and secure and it can be read by everyone and you don't have to worry about your identity being exposed. This is the antithesis of fiat payments.",

Seems like a scam, wait whatðŸ¤”, after they shut down e-gold, BTC was born? wasn't BTC called the digital gold aka E gold by many adopters? Did they just made a decentralized e-gold system to attract more people?Now I have a few question, who controls and owns most of the gold supply worldwide? You think they just sitting and looking at the ordinary joe to take control of the digital gold ? Or they are also in control of everything here?",
