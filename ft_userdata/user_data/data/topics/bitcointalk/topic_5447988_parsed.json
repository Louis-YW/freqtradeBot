There are lots of alternative to use like tradingview or MT5 so it won't be a problem if other exchange do not have terminal app.there is just a sort of loyalty if the exchange releases thier own and it seems worth paying that trading fee than using the browser base. MT5 i think can be easier for them to modify as every FX broker did the same. if they are going to compete Binance, its got to be one of the fields to also cover.",

As others have mentioned, most exchanges do not offer a desktop app because maintaining it can be resource-intensive. Also, most traders find it unnecessary, normies like myself prefer web and mobile app, while the experienced traders often prefer using dedicated trading terminals for flexibility and cross-exchange capabilities.",

In fact, the main purpose of creating an application is to exploit your device's physical resources (RAM, or graphics card), which are two things that you do not need in trading apps, so there is no point in creating an application.Overall, do trading bots work? They are applications and provide the same services.",

But it is nothing more than the web version. Only Binance has been the one that I used that actually got its own different computer app which is very cool to use and very encouraging.

But money is not their problem, although they will spend more if they want to have a computer app.Quote from: mk4 on April 08, 2023, 02:11:11 AMI believe that OKX also has a desktop app, but I'm unsure how it compares to the web version's performance.It is just the 100% copy of their website, nothing added and nothing removed.",

I only use the web version on desktop whenever I am at home and using tradingview and checking charts. But if not or if not much analyzing is needed, I only use my mobile phone. Now having been able to try the app for myself, it's good but not something that I totally need at the moment. Like you said, it may be a matter of preference and the type of utilities that a user is looking for. Like if someone just wants to do simple and fast trading, the web browser would suffice but if someone wants to utilize more of Binance's features then I guess the app would be a better choice.",
