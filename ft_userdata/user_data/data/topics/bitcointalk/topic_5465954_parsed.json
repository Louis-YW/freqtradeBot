  "content": "Hi everyoneI found an old blocktrail.com wallet recovery PDF sheet.(As example, here is a public version on google https://www.scribd.com/document/433450775/bitcoin-recovery-key)Now i have a couple of questions:First off, i have 2 QR codes with an XPUB and derivation path. (m/0 and m/9999)When i scan the second QR, the XPUB shows a balance of roughly 2BTC on a P2PKH addressBy using the recovery tool at https://recovery.blocktrail.com/, i noticed the addresses are generated in P2SH and no balance is recovered.So my main questions are:- What do those 2 QR code represent actually? Are those real public keys, meaning i still have those BTC in my wallet?- How can i recover the wallet as P2PKH to actually access those coins?I've been through the entire blocktrail SDK, there is only the option to extract scrypt based xpub/xpriv.Thank you all",

That is ALL that should be needed if it's legit. Import the 24 words and that should be that. You may have to adjust the derivation path, but that is it.-Dave",
