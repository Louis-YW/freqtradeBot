  "content": "Crypto Signals are analyst updates that inform you when and which cryptocurrencies to buy or sell. The cornerstone of bitcoin trading signals is the technical analysis conducted by qualified and professional traders.Crypto signals are third-party suggestions on which cryptocurrency to trade at a certain time. To clarify, these are recommendations that are often divided into four sections. The first step is to buy cryptocurrency. Then there's the cost of purchasing it. Finally, there is the price at which it should be sold in order to make a profit. Finally, there is a level at which the reader should sell the cryptocurrency if things go wrong - the stop-loss.#MyCryptoParadise",

      "body": "lately there are so many channels on telegram that offer VIP group entry services for trading signals. but I'm not interested in that. because if we want to learn to analyze, now there is a lot of material and practical learning is already on YouTube and Google. so buying a VIP signal only makes us lazy to analyze ourselves later in the day. even though we cannot continue to depend on the signals given by other people. because it is the same as we have lost before trading. because we have to pay even though we have not made a profit.",

      "body": "My simple suggestion is to do your own research. These supposed chart analysts & influencers don’t really know s**t. How many of them predicted the top of the last bitcoin bull run price to be so low? Answer is none of them. Seriously these crypto signals are just noise. Buy & HODL, that’s the way.",
