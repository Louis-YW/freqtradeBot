But think about it, what kind of situation do you think can push you into stopping to hold bitcoins and invest more in it? please share your episode. Love is a big word.  Don’t love money too much even if it brings you so much joy. Bitcoin has changed a lot of lives and has helped a lot of people but at the end of the day it is still money and we shouldn’t love it too much.QuoteHas your love for Bitcoin surpassed your love for country? If your government threatens arrest for anyone found to still be involved in bitcoins, are you willing to go to jail even if it is just for a day? What is the point of using bitcoin if I won’t get too use it for the rest of my life as I am in jail? Bitcoin is great but I suggest we all follow the law.QuoteWill you be willing to relocate from your country to another region if the environment becomes unsafe for people like you who have invested in bitcoins?  If I had the money to relocate, I would but I don’t and that’s why I am investing in bitcoin. Don’t lose yourself too much in bitcoin and crypto. Don’t let it consume and control your whole being. It is our future but not our everything.",

But think about it, what kind of situation do you think can push you into stopping to hold bitcoins and invest more in it? please share your episode. The situation that can actually make me to stop buying and holding bitcoin is simply when i stop having extra income to invest or probably when i run into emergency and need funds to settle them. i can't be buying bitcoin with pressing things at hand it will only make me to panic when i hold.Quote from: Queentoshi on June 13, 2024, 12:52:52 PMHas your love for Bitcoin surpassed your love for country? If your government threatens arrest for anyone found to still be involved in bitcoins, are you willing to go to jail even if it is just for a day?Will you be willing to relocate from your country to another region if the environment becomes unsafe for people like you who have invested in bitcoins? first of all bitcoin is here to give one freedom and also ease the hassle of going through fiat centralization. You can't simply be investing into bitcoin at the expense of your security. if my country actually bans bitcoin i think it will be appropriate for me to abide by the rules, moreover bitcoin can be use anonymously, so why publicizing it to get the government at my back, even Satoshi wouldn't want me to go to jail just to use bitcoin. i will anonymously use bitcoin and wait till the government relaxes its laws. Yes in a country that i think has strict laws i would love to move away to a more friendly country not because of bitcoin only but considering other things too.

How should we react in such a situation.Bitcoin is just like fiat currency which is to be used for our financial benfits, it will be somewhat absurd or wicked to stack bitcoin when my family is in dare need of financial assistance, this has nothing to do with bitcoin.",

How should we react in such a situation.Well, honestly, I believe in the potential of Bitcoin, but that's not my priority right now. Another thing is that if I do a transaction going to fiat, most of my earnings will come from cryptocurrency, not Bitcoin, and this is why it's true that it's happening to me.Maybe when I do futures trading I can use Bitcoin to USDT pair, although the earnings I get are USDT when the technical analysis I made is correct.",

I don't obsess too much about bitcoin though, it feels really stupid to me that you would go so much at that point in something that could easily destroy your life if you do it wrong, don't be too obsessed like me, that's the logical thing to do and much healthier thing to do when you're invested in bitcoin.",

Well, it's because we know that bitcoin still has its disadvantages, but it is 8—meaning it has many advantages, and bitcoin has given me a lot of opportunity. It has made me independent when it comes to money since I was in college, and because of bitcoin, I have learned to become more money-oriented and business-minded. So in short, I love bitcoin because it changes my life and it keeps on giving more opportunity and, of course, money at this time. That's why, no matter what others say about bitcoin, I will never let go of it. I will keep on believing in bitcoin, and I will keep on supporting bitcoin until the end. And I think we all love bitcoin, because why are we here in this forum if not right?",

Besides the investment opportunities and savings opportunity of which is more private than using a regular bank for such investment activities, it is a strong hedge against inflation and the future currency of the world.",

I understand what bitcoin is, but let's not make it more than it is. It's not more important than the lives of our loved ones. If the financial need is very serious and the person is close to you, why not make the sacrifice? I mean, it's not like you're not going to make any money again to DCA if you sacrifice this one. We shouldn't look down on relationships. Bitcoin is money, most likely the best form of money, but it's still money nonetheless, so it shouldn't be treated more than it is.We shouldn't let money take centre stage in our lives. The people who love us and matter to us should take priority in my opinion.",
