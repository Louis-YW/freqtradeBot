  "content": "The most adopted and convenient method of making backups of an HD wallet is by writing down a sequence of words known as the BIP39 recovery phrase (or simply seedphrase) which when combined form a seed that derives the masterprivkey and, consequently, the child keys and Adresses.It is up to you to write down this seedphrase and store it safely in an offline environment, such as on paper, steel plates, etc. Never store it online i.e. in an online notepad or email, because if your computer is compromised, it becomes very easy for someone to steal your bitcoins.However, if you store it in a physical location such as your office drawer, and someone has possession of this seedphrase and has sufficient knowledge of the importance of this information, they could act maliciously and steal your money. A commonly used solution to avoid this problem would be to encrypt the seedphrase and there are several methods and some of them vary in security i.e some users encrypt a seedphrase with aes, gpg, compression tools like winrar, 7zip protected by passwords (I've done this a lot in the past) and also with BIP39 Passphrase.Of these methods mentioned, BIP39 Passphrase is undoubtedly the most used due to it being widely used by hardware wallets, as in addition to being the most secure, it reinforces the entropy of your seedphrase by combining your seedphrase + passphrase generated by you, resulting in a wallet unique access code \"hidden\" behind that password.Regardless of the method chosen, the user now has to save 2 information: Seedphrase + password, and in the case of BIP39 Passphrase, the passphrase must always be memorable, as there is no way to recover it if it's lost and it'd only be used if you fully understand how it works.Some wallets such as Electrum, Sparrow, Bitcoin Core and Schildbach wallet have a functionality to import/export encrypted backups with your wallet's encryption password, and this is very interesting, as in addition to being done in a theoretically safe way, you don't need to resort to other third-party encryption methods that may compromise your seedphrase. With this encrypted digital backup, you can easily make multiple copies and spread them to different locations such as pen drives, SD cards and the cloud.If you want to make encrypted digital backups, Electrum and Sparrow are one of the wallets that allow you to do this safely, but I leave some observations below:There are more than one type of seed: BIP39 and Electrum, BIP39 is accepted in most wallets, while Electrum seeds are only adopted by Electrum.If you want to do this on Electrum, your wallet needs to be created on Electrum, as a native Electrum wallet allows Electrum to save your encrypted seedphrase and whenever you need that seedphrase, you can view the backup and make physical copies by writing it down on paper, and a BIP39 wallet that was imported into electrum is not possible, because in this case Electrum don't save the imported seedphrase, it only uses it at the time of import to calculate xpriv/ypriv/zpriv, but if you want, even so if you saving a digital copy of a BIP39 wallet imported into Electrum, you can recover the funds, but your seedphrase won't be saved in the file (unless it's a native electrum wallet).If you want to make a digital backup of a BIP39 seedphrase, you can use Sparrow Wallet for this, you can either create a new wallet with or without a passphrase or import an existing seedphrase, encrypt the wallet with a good password. If you need to import your seed to another wallet, you can open the backup generated by sparrow (using Sparrow Software) using your password and view the seedphrase to import into another wallet.With the tips above, you don't need to risk your security by experimenting with encryption methods that could compromise your wallet. Of course, even if you follow the tips above, but do it on an insecure computer, compromised with internet access, you may still have chances of having your wallet compromised. So the ideal is to do this from an airgapped computer without internet access, preferably a computer just for this that you won't use for anything else.",

You extend the word with the 13th, 16th, 19th, 22nd or 25th word, depending on the number of word your seed phrase is. I prefer the lazy way which is the use of passphrase to extend the word. If a good passphrase that is long is used, to brute force the passphrase will be hard.",

So, if you use a strong password, you will definitely keep it in digital form, so reduce the number of online copies and keep the password on a separate device that does not connect to the Internet. Buy a high-quality USB stick to ensure a longer lifespan of data on a USB flash drive and better protection from shocks, as some bad types lose the data within 5 years.",

If it has at least 128 bits of entropy (e.g. a 12-word BIP39 phrase or a truly random 20-character password) then it will be effectively impossible to crack. For this reason, storing an encrypted seed phrase online and then storing physical copies of the decryption key in a safe place/places is a robust option for backing up crypto. Unlike writing down and storing the seed phrase itself, this method avoids a single point of failure. If hackers were to get your encrypted file from the cloud, it would be useless to them without the password, which they won't find online. And if burglars were to crack your safe and get the decryption key, they would not be able to access the coins without also having the file. It would be very difficult for an attacker to get both.",

The bitcoin core wallet exports this keyfile as the official form of backup, you can export the descriptors via the console if you want. The keyfile is encrypted with the password the user chooses when encrypting the wallet.2. Sparrow wallet, the exported keyfile is protected by the wallet access password, the same case as the core.3. Electrum = same case as Bitcoin core and Sparrow.4. Bitcoin wallet for android (schildbatch wallet) exports the backup file, but first the user must choose a password, the exported file can be protected by a PIN or not and can be decrypted via the openSSL Linux terminal, but if it has been encrypted also with a PIN, you must use bitcoinj's Wallet-tools.I used all the wallets mentioned.",

All BIP39 seed phrases have an empty (\"\") passphrase by default, and you can choose to extend that.Wallet passwords are used to encrypt wallet files (such as Electrum's password), but as I already said, that's going off-topic. I had already understood this and always knew it.The seed phrase is encrypted in the keystore of the aforementioned wallets with the password chosen by the user. See that I used the term 'password' for Keystore encryption so as not to confuse it with the term \"Passphrase\" from BIP39 which generates a new wallet using this as a \"salt\" on top of the seed phrase. OK?Why is this getting off topic since I suggested a viable and secure alternative of encrypting the file containing the electrum wallet, sparrow etc? Using these as an additional alternative (one thing does not exclude the other, you can opt for both) backup and not only write down 12 readable words that anyone with access to this could see and try to import to steal the funds (if the funds don't are allocated in a hidden wallet generated by the BIP39 passphrase).Encrypted keystore files you can save digitally and can use them to recover as well while the wallet seed phrase should not be stored digitally.Keystores are very easy to replicate, facilitating the backup process and saving to pen drives in geographically different and distant locations.Of course, we must always keep a physical copy of the seed phrase written down on paper, steel plates, etc. As I said, one thing does not exclude the other. However, it varies depending on each person's paranoia, if the person is afraid of having their funds stolen, they can use the BIP-39 passphrase and the method I mentioned in this topic: encrypted backups (in the same way as the wallet backup works bitcoin core, electrum, etc.).",

However, I liked the passport backup method better (I believe coldcard uses the same method), as it keeps the backup encrypted in a 7zip file.Encrypted backups with a sufficiently secure password help to duplicate backups more easily, as they remove points of failure, because even if the attacker has physical access, he needs the password to access the wallet.",
