  "content": "If you interview a lot of people about Bitcoin, some would tell you it's a crypto currency used for digital transactions, some could also say it's a digital currency that operates independent of the central bank. You could also here others say it's a digital currency that could serve as an alternative to fiat currency, well they're all right in their different perspective of description. However I also think Bitcoin could be refered to as the future of money. It is the mother of all crypto currency, and has inspired the birth of a lot of other crypto currencies. Well it might take a while before everyone accepts it as a legal tender, but it has the potential of replacing fiat money in the future.  Bitcoin have a lot of benefits and could affect a countries economy positively due to it's transparency and inflation hedge, however my major point of focus is on inflation. Alot of countries are undergoing inflation currently especially in countries with bad governance, high crime rates and war. Sometimes it's takes a long while for some countries to get out of inflation. But Bitcoin is known for it's volatility and can serve as an inflation hedge to their  economy if only they could adopt it's use for transactions or as an Alternative to fiat. It could be beneficial in several ways because.1. It is the fastest way to combat inflation, due to it's limited supply, making it more scarce and costlier, which could help strengthen a countries economy.2. Bitcoin has a transaction cost making it easier for financial industries and traders to carry out transactions without worrying about high cost of transaction fees.3. It's transaction rate is quicker and can help, business men, traders and individuals transact very quickly.4. If a government accepts Bitcoin as a alternative to fiat it could make currency exchange effortlessly and it cannot be influenced by corrupt governments officials.5. I've seen no reason why some countries would be fighting against Bitcoin instead of adopting it into their system, I think any country doing that is fighting a lost fight and would be forced to accept it on the long run.  Other countries should use see El Salvador that invested in it and adopted it for transactions as an example of how Bitcoin could affect an economy positively. It's helped  them to improve their enocomy by reducing the rate on inflation in their country, though it didn't occur as fastly as speculated, but in the bull season when the halfing fully comes as speculated their economy could become very robust, since it's adopted over there.",

Moreover, bitcoin must not be a legal tender before citizens will benefit from it, as long as bitcoin is not banned in a country, and it is legal to use it, then it will still serve its purpose. You should also note that it will be impossible for bitcoin to replace fiat in future, because it is limited in supply and cannot be used daily by everyone with the large number of population in the world.Bitcoin was created to be an alternative payment method to fiat, which is that purpose that it will serve. El Salvador adopted bitcoin as a legal tender, it has not change their economy, but it will do that in the long run, since the have the country's fiat reserve in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a hedge to inflation, but you should also think about the high volatile nature of bitcoin. Bitcoin is still facing a challenge of high transaction fee that do happens from those garbage that uses bitcoin blockchain, that will be the worst for bitcoin users when those token pop up again.",

If I'm to be in a country like that I don't think I will keep my money in the bank    because doing this after sometime you will notice that the money won't have value due to inflation. I will prefer to convert my money to bitcoin, l the price of bitcoin is increasing which is going to add some value to the money I already have than keeping it bank and I won't be able to solve my problem due to inflation.  Countries having serious economic Challenge right now, bitcoin can serve as a store of value right now because we are in a season the market is going up.",

      "body": "I disagree.For starters bitcoin is too volatile to act as a good hedge. It is a hedge on a small scale and for individuals, but not on a bigger scale for the whole country and its economy. You are also forgetting the bear periods where it continues going down like 2018 (price went from $20k down to $3k in a year). You can't shut down the entire country's economy because bitcoin is on a downtrend for a whole year and a massive downtrend at that (85% drop).Additionally using bitcoin to solve economic problems including inflation is like sweeping the problem under the rug. It is not going to solve it, at best it may only alleviate it in short term before it shows itself again.Solving such issues should start by first finding why the issue exists (like why is there inflation) then fixing that root problem. For example in a lot of cases inflation exists because the government refuses to reduce its expenses and faces a big budget deficit which then in order to solve it they print money hence create inflation! To solve this example (although I'm simplifying things) you should fix the budget, eliminate extra expenses, where money is being wasted, etc. and as budget deficit shrinks so does their money printing and consequently the inflation.El Salvador is an excellent example for this ONLY IF it is studied correctly not based on some news titles you read. This means the economic situation of this tiny country didn't improve because they adopted bitcoin as legal tender, it started improving because a million different things their government did over the past couple of years (attracting foreign investors, improving tourism economy, fixing the budget, battling corruption, crime and gangs, etc.).",

An individual can use the currency as an inflation hedge and one could make money from Investing in Bitcoin. There are several causes of inflation and it can be tackled using multiple economic measures. Some of the ways the government tries to fight inflation are by increasing taxes, changing interest rates, and reducing government spending. Favorable Bitcoin policies could be part of the measures but not the only solution.Quote from: Youngkhngdiddy on February 26, 2024, 08:11:44 PMOther countries should use see El Salvador that invested in it and adopted it for transactions as an example of how Bitcoin could affect an economy positively.

Investing in Bitcoin should be part of the measures to diversify the economy of the nation in a bid to reduce inflation. There is no proof or data that proves that Bitcoin has helped El Salvador to come out of inflation. The view or belief that Bitcoin is the savior of a nation's economy is a utopian one.",

Its purpose will be ruined if Bitcoin is adopted by centralised entities and forces people to use it. Bitcoin honestly cannot handle a mainstream transaction volume.

      "body": "I totally agree Bitcoin can be helpful for a country's economy when adopted as public long term investment by the government. However, not as the sole investment, neither as official main currency. Look the example of El Salvador: they did the adoption in the right format.Even though the digital currency is legal tender there, Bitcoin didn't replace dollar, which remained as the main currency of the country. At same time, they took advantage of the best Bitcoin could offer to the country. They have been buying the dip, that is, investing considerable amounts of money from the public vaults in BTC along past years and now that we are approaching a new bull run, they are ready to profit from their investments.Of course they risked money, but it was done in a calculated way, what means it wasn't going to completely compromise the country's economy if something went wrong. On the other hand, if they had adopted Bitcoin as the exclusive currency of the country, I fear it could end really badly, because Bitcoin is heavily volatile and prone to manipulation by whales. It's crazyness for a country to put all their tickets in BTC, even if it's done with a good intention of fighting inflation back.",

I agree that Bitcoin should be legal, so that people can avoid losing their savings to inflation by investing in Bitcoin if they choose to do so. But I also understand why some countries can be especially vulnerable when they are hit by inflation, and they might introduce restrictive policies to help stabilize their local fiat. It can be reasonable and very important because salaries, taxes (and thus the budget for all sorts of essential services) are usually in fiat, so if inflation gets too high and doesn't stabilize, lots of people and the economy get hurt.Bitcoin, in the meantime, can grow a lot, but if a lot of people start using it, it can create a congestion, with the fees spiking and transactions getting stuck. For a country that's already struggling economically, such complications can be an even bigger nightmare than inflation.",

The idea that deflation is disastrous comes from the fact that deflation happens BECAUSE OF economic collapse. If there is an economic collapse that means people don't have money to spend, so they spend less, so there is less demand for things, so prices go down (and therefore the value of the currency goes up in relation to consumer goods) and you get deflation. But its the result of an economic collapse, not the cause.Also, to point out the obvious, the reason money being linked to gold is called a \"gold standard\" is because many nations did this! You act like it never happened. The gold standard ended, which means it used to literally be the standard. It never caused economic collapses simply by existing, otherwise it never would have become the standard. The reason why no country in the world is on a gold standard ANY MORE is because politicians realized they have far more control and power when they are literally in charge of the monetary supply. I'm not saying I know what would happen economically if say countries started adopting a bitcoin standard (and I don't think that is something that will ever actually happen), but the idea that using a hard currency rather than a weak inflationary currency would cause economic collapse is honestly just modern monetary propaganda to make people think having a weak currency that gives govt/central bank tons of extra power is the only sort of monetary standard that could work. When obviously history shows that claim to be a complete lie.There are some things that are better about being on a hard currency standard (like all nations used to be), and some things that are better about being on a weak currency standard (like all nations are today). It's not that one is good and one is bad. They each have good parts and bad parts. I think the main problem is that since the gold standard was abandoned the world hasn't had a hard currency to use as an outlet for the good things it provides. Once Bitcoin becomes massively widespread globally so anyone can save and spend it with ease that's essentially, as someone people have called it, an escape hatch that people can choose to get away from weak currencies.There would be bad economic consequences if either inflation or deflation got out of control. But while hyperinflation occurs due to horrible monetary policy by the politicans and central bankers who just keep printing money because they have to in order to stay ahead of their debt, I believe a deflationary spiral would only happen if an economy fell into a depression that it just couldn't get out of. Because think about it, the only reason people are going to not buy goods is if they literally can't because they don't have jobs. People having jobs is going to balance out a deflationary currency because people want to buy things and they are not just going to stop buying things when they have the money to buy things. So it isn't deflation at all that is the problem. It is economic collapse that is the problem. Whether a currency is weak (fiat) or strong (bitcoin) people are going to spend money they have. I think the main difference is that with fiat currency the economy is debt driven because printing money and handing it out as debt is how the economy grows, while with a hard currency the money is limited so there is slower growth because its much riskier to take out debt when the currency is strong.I'm no expert in these things but it seems to me inflationary currency leads to high growth but very unstable economies, the must eventually collapse because govts are by human nature going to print more money and continuously wrack up more and more debt until its unsustainable and the economy reaches a break point (which is what a lot of people are afraid is going to happen in the coming decades, which I beleive people refer to as the \"great monetary reset\"). While being on a deflationary currency standard would mean less growth but a much more stable economy. People taking far fewer risks, so slower growth, but also much fewer monetary-related problems because the base monetary unit increases in value so saving is possible without taking on risk, and things can actually stay affordable rather than being destined to become more and more unaffordable.That's my take, which may or may not be totally right. But for sure your statement that a deflationary currency would automatically cause economic collapse is totally wrong, as explained at the top of this comment.",
