None of them deposit, and none of them do anything for you except show you have viewers. What good is that for you as a streamer? If you are lucky enough to find a casino dumb enough to take a chance on you, you will be fired within 2 weeks since you have 0 interaction in your channel and 0 deposits from your viewers. I struggle to find the pros of using this service. Feel free to comment and tell me the advantages.",

Feel free to comment and tell me the advantages.Don’t forget the part where if the streaming service finds out what you’re doing you’ll be shadowbanned and never allowed to make any real money. Even other streamers will quickly catch on and accuse you of view botting, resulting in your embarrassment and chasing away of any supporters you might have actually had.",
