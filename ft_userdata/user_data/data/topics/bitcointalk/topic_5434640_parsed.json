  "content": "QuoteNew York City Public Schools have blocked access to OpenAI's ChatGPT AI model on its network and devices, reports educational news site Chalkbeat. The move comes amid fears from educators that students will use ChatGPT to cheat on assignments, accidentally introduce inaccuracies in their work, or write essays in a way that will keep them from learning the material.ChatGPT is a large language model created by OpenAI, and it is currently accessible for free through any web browser during its testing period. People can use it to write essays, poetry, and technical documents (or even simulate a Linux console) at a level that can often pass for human writing—although it can also produce very confident-sounding but inaccurate results.Per Chalkbeat, NYC education department spokesperson Jenna Lyle said, \"Due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content, access to ChatGPT is restricted on New York City Public Schools’ networks and devices. While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success.”Educational concerns about large language models became widespread in September after someone on the OpenAI subreddit claimed that they used GPT-3 (the foundational technology behind ChatGPT) to write essays and answer questions for school projects. At that point, GPT-3 was only accessible through an API or a special user interface through the OpenAI website and for a fee based on usage. After OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to a much larger audience for free on November 30, calls of alarm became more widespread among educators.As a language prediction model, ChatGPT is a type of neural network trained on the text of millions of books and websites. The model's \"knowledge\" of typical text constructions helps it predict the most likely output after someone enters a prompt. So if given a prompt such as \"Mary had a,\" it might complete the sentence with \"little lamb,\" pulling from the most frequent statistical associations between words the AI model encountered during the training process. During a session with ChatGPT, the entire conversation history is the prompt that the model attempts to complete, albeit in a conversational form.Although ChatGPT will be blocked on computer networks in NYC public schools, Chalkbeat reports that individual schools can apply for access to ChatGPT to study the technology behind it. And while it's unclear if ChatGPT will have any of the feared effects on education, this move from the largest school district in the US may inspire others to enact similar bans on the technology.https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/nyc-schools-block-chatgpt-fearing-negative-impact-on-learning/....Is ChatGPT developed enough to author complete essays containing legit content for school purposes? If a student set parameters relating to topics like history, science, math. With specific parameters for topics they were given assignments on. Could ChatGPT realistically produce a written assignment which would be coherent and valid?Not knowing much about ChatGPT but having seen and operated a few bots. I feel skeptical chatGPT can accomplish some of the things it is given credit for being capable of.Students already have sparknotes and frameworks for comprehending school assignments which make assignments much easier in contrast to pre internet era education. Can a bot really have so much impact, as to merit all of these articles and journalistic pieces being written on it?",

They can ban it, but AI will continue to evolve just to avoid being detected when used, not only at school. AS I already said elsewhere, it's a cat and mouse race to be one step ahead of the opponent.",

The advantage of using ChatGPT for students to learn over students using ChatGPT to cheat in essay/article writing is greater use and the teacher could manually check if the students are using ChatGPT which could disqualify the essay/article if proven.We know how hard it is back in the days to look for information in the library during those days, we don't have to make it hard for students nowadays.",

It's similar to trying to ban violent video games in order to stop murders. If someone thinks they can cheat then they'll find ways around it. The one major thing that seems able to defeat this AI written content is something like an AI content detector: https://writer.com/ai-content-detector . It works surprisingly well and can judge how much of a piece is written by an AI. You could potentially have students rewriting the AI content but someone who is lazy enough to use it will likely find that just as difficult to do. I've used ChatGPT and it's surprising how well it puts an article together but apparently it follows an easily detectable structure.",

Some might verify if they saw it as well but I saw a website telling that there is some kind of website I guess or software that is being used to detect AI-made essays or paragraphs and the like. Right now, there isn't since it's just new but over time, I believe there will be some websites or software that will be created just to verify if it has been made by an AI or not.",
