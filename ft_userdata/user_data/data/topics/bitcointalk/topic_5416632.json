Investing in any of these 3 gives risk free system. I don’t see how Binance is an investment or a child of Bitcoin and Ethereum, did you mean BNB? With time you will centralized exchanges (Binance and the likes) are not best for hodling your crypto long term because of the risks involved with third party management, using a centralized exchange service means you’re not in total charge of your coins because you do not own the keys. Binance was attacked recently and a lot of money was lost. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/binance-hack-100-million-cryptocurrency-blockchain/",

Brand new projects can be profitable in the early phase and some never survive the bear market. It takes so experience and greed control to manage new project in portfolios that is why it is really not ideal for newbies without experience to go for new project. Lots of new project make 100x and more and when the crash the drop without a warning.As long as there is working strategy to know where to buy, sell and avoid the coin then the risk is worth taking. the sole aim of warning about new project is just to avoid using funds that should have given good profit on Bitcoin and crashing it on so called new project and end up tagging crypto scam.",

You simply buy at the ICO phase (or whatever they call it) then sell when it get listed on one of the known exchanges and you have to be fast before other investors or team members (who own most of the supply) start dumping.But this is not really what a good token project is. A good project is the one that has a true utility and solves an existing problem. Such projects never die (at least not so quickly) and do not lose their value because people will always need them.",

If we are talking about the entire industry, then I would say that two or three successful projects out of thousands of unsuccessful ones is not a lot.So, if you consider the entire industry as a whole, then I would have to say no, not really.I do not mean to discourage anyone from investing in new projects or coins. So if a new project has something that no other project has, it might work well. Each individual should always do their own research and make a careful assessment of the risks involved in any project. However, in my opinion, most new projects will fail. The number of ICOs is growing every day and many projects are more focused on getting funding than they are on creating a product that people want to use.",

There’s always risks in all types of investments, even bitcoin which we mostly think that it’s the most prominent coin and the best asset in crypto. The only difference is that some invest directly due to greed without gaining good background first on the project they want to invest. That way, it’s more risky to invest especially if you just invest without having to DYOR first.",

This is not investing, this is gambling on ponzi schemes. You can get lucky a few times and make a profit, but if you do it a lot of times, you will go broke, because the odds are stacked against you. All these \"new projects\" have zero utility and zero potential, they are nothing more than scams - some scams pull the rug in a few weeks, others go on for years, the end is always the same.",

Get something very important you don't understand about the cryptospace, your entry points and others might not be the same as you think. i.e, you may invested in a new project today while others might get the information in the next 4 months or so and invested as well your ROI might not be as similar with the other person and at then you might feel to go away with your capital and profits leaving those who just came to invest. At such time the project might be waving whereby the early investors have made away with their profits leaving just an empty project to those newly investors and at end if further investor do not come to invest where do you think those who invested last would or could make out their ROI At that points the project happens to be a dead project since the team made their profits, early investor pulled out their ROI what funds do you think can be used to further developed the project?So is now turning to be scam to those who just put their resources in the project, all less they have an angel investor whom came with $M to invest and revived the project.",

But it is better not to invest in new projects during bear market. Risks can be taken when the market is bullish.Maybe what you say is true because it is in a bear market condition as much as possible to minimize risk,Regarding new projects, it is quite risky and if you really want to invest, you have to be really careful and keep doing research first.",

If you want to go relatively safe then i think you should not invest into new projects because in the end the risk here to lose all of your funds is just way higher here in comparison to an investment into Bitcoin or the big altcoins.That being said there are definitely good new projects out there and i would say that those projects that are launching now in the bear market probably have a way higher average quality then the new projects that are launching during a bullrun because in a bull we have like dozens of new meme-coins (shit-coins) every day that just want to make easy and quick money.",

I usually paused for a long while investing in new projects, especially IDOs. It’s because when it gets listed on exchanges, either the whales would automatically dump it during the first minute after liquidity was added, or we see a temporary growth and then a pullback that would be really hard to recover, especially if the token is under vesting period. Some may be lucky enough to sell it during the first few minutes while the price is rising, but most of the time it just simply fell below the IDO price.",
