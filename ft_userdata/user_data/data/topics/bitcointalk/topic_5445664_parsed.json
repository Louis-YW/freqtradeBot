  "content": "Had not been in my electrum wallet for over a year. When I went in balance showed \"0\". Made a small purchase to see if it would show up. No luck. Did wallet new/restore using seed phrase. No luck. Went to BITREF to find all transactions I made were listed with the correct amounts and dates including the most recent on 3/18/23. No other activity. Was advised on another forum I need to open a different wallet in order to \"bridge\" the two wallets and transfer funds from electrum to new wallet. Is this a legitimate procedure or are they trying to set me up to steal the coins? The BITREF site and Blockchain.com shows the coins are still in the wallet address I own. Is there any possible way to access them since the electrum wallet doesn't seem to be functioning?",

I don't know what I'm looking at and don't know what's supposed to happen. I'm worried I'll do something that will make the wallet permanently inaccessible.Just don’t panic.1. Secure your seed offline and in a safe place : with the seed backed up, nothing can happen to your BTC even if you delete Electrum from your computer.If you don’t know how to do it, click on the lock at the bottom right in your Electrum (see screenshot under my message). Write your 12 words and hide the paper as much as possible. This seed, as you probably already know, is the key of your BTC wallet.2. Download Electrum from their official website (if you want you can verify the signature of the file to be sure it is an original one, but if you don’t know how do it, you could skip this step)3. Open your new Electrum freshly downloaded4. Create a new wallet > Standard wallet > I already own a seed and you write your seed previously backed up there (this step must be done offline preferably)",

The last was on 3/18/23 and the site had a note on this transaction saying the wallet needed verifying but the coins were delivered to my electrum address even though I did not verify the wallet. (This transaction is reflected on the blockchain site and Bitref as delivered to my Electrum address.) I will check with them to see if anything more needs to be done. Before that all my transactions were done between 4/21 and 8/21 and are checked off as completed.Get the extended pubkey from \"wallet\" --> \"information\"Make sure it starts with xpub/ypub/zpubgo to https://btc1.trezor.io/enter the extended pubkey and it should show your transaction history there, if there are any.Also click on \"file\", and then \"open\" and see if there are more than 1 files in the folder, if so, go up one directory and select all the files and make a archive of it and keep it safe.In the folder where \"wallets\" folder is located, there should be a file named \"config\"it will have something like this in it:Code:{    \"advanced_preview\": true,    \"amt_precision_post_satoshi\": 3,    \"auto_connect\": true,    \"backup_dir\": \"/home/satoshi/electrum/electrum/wallets\",    \"blockchain_preferred_block\": {        \"hash\": \"000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\",        \"height\": 0    },    \"check_updates\": false,    \"config_version\": 3,    \"decimal_point\": 8,    \"gui_last_wallet\": \"/Users/work/.electrum/wallets/default_wallet\",    \"is_maximized\": false,    \"num_zeros\": 8,    \"oneserver\": false,    \"recently_open\": [        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/default_wallet\",        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/wallet_2.backup\",        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/wallet_2\",        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/wallet_1\"    ],    \"rpcpassword\": \"dGhpcyBpc24ndCBteSBwYXNzd29yZA==\",    \"rpcuser\": \"user\",    \"server\": \"s.someelectrum.server:19492:s\",    \"show_addresses_tab\": true,    \"show_channels_tab\": true,    \"show_console_tab\": true,    \"show_contacts_tab\": true,    \"show_utxo_tab\": true}Does the \"recently_open\" have more than one path?the recently open in the above example config is:Code:    \"recently_open\": [        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/default_wallet\",        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/wallet_2.backup\",        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/wallet_2\",        \"/home/satoshi/electrum/wallets/wallet_1\"    ],so if your one has more than one path look at these paths.Also, this might help, if you are using windows download recuva (or another file recovery software, on linux i had good success with photorec)Scan for text files under 100kb (or however large your wallet file would possibly be), and recover from the whole disk, search the text files for \"xpub\" \"xprv\" \"stored_height\" or any other keywords you can find, it might be harder to locate encrypted wallets But you can still do so, This method found older versions of my wallet files, like at different states.I hope this helps.edit: Also don't ever load electrum seeds on other wallets, your going to lead to all sorts of issues, the other wallets have different derivation paths usually and you will have change outputs moving to paths that electrum probably or might not notice if you use the wallet to spend coins on another client.",
