      "body": "For readers, the link is not a phishing URL and I will show you that this idiot village is lyingThe link is a service from https://www.aximetria.com/ a crypto bank account in Switzerland, hence the link \"https://axicheck.aximetria.com/\"If you visit the company website you will notice the same link in the footer. Wow, so even the bank gives a phishing URL ??notice I didn't edit the original post, so he can't say I changed the link after his posteven if the link was a phishing URL, you can't do anything with only the first 6 numbers.... The guy above is just an idiot. The person is upset because he was trying to sell a fake covid pass and I hijacked his topicWho in this forum can think I could give a phishing URL to scam people. Soon, he will say the bank is a scam from me lolhe then gives me feedback insulting my mother and saying I scam people lol, with no reference link since there is no reference to find since I don't scam. Simple as thatQuote from: IP34TV on June 14, 2022, 03:46:50 AM",

Didn't OP mentioned that it's not the CC number that you have to put but the BIN?. What OP could be useful to me but I already have an exchange/wallet where I can sell my crypto to fiat and transfer to bank account with no hassle.

In 2016 my bank account it was closed due to transactions involving crypto. Now when I just re-opened it, this year, they have said they don't accept any kind of crypto transaction.Too many details, right? But ING is quite a big bank and if the site does one like this wrong, I can't except it to be right with any other bins.My humble opinion",

No idea honestly and it's possible that the service can check only some countries (in the eurozone I guess.To @saxydevING has different ethics I suppose. As you know they have banks in different countries in the EU. For France, they were considered crypto-friendly for French residents. Many of us (I'm from France) were using it for a long time.I say 'they were' because they decided to close the bank and every business in the country because it wasn't profitable anymore.I don't know about ING NH (I think you wanted to say NL?) but that's quite surprising from the Netherlands if ING is not friendly. At least I've never heard about it, but I believe you.",
