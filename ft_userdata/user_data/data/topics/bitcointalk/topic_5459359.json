If it's on a self-moderated topic, it will be left to the manager to do justice to that and save the Moderators the stress. If you have already reported them to moderators, then I think that's all that could be done. Since there are no rules set by the contest managers that they are breaking, they are all good to go.",

Mods can't ensure the user's initiative with the reserved post so there's some doubt. If the contest is currently running, your report may be rated as bad because entrants will likely literally fill the post with their work seconds before it ends.

I've report few posts and let's see what's the moderator will do with my report.Yeah, based on logic there's no reason to create reserved post because there's no difference with user who's apply or submit in the first with the last one.

Some members feel that it's necessary to reserve the first page so that their entries will not be lost on page two and others. But this is not the case because the panel of judges will always scrutinize all the entries even if they are on the last page of the thread. There is no need to reserve these slots because participants can always post their entries when they are through with their work. This will help reduce the unnecessary reserved posts that litter some competition threads. QuoteAside from reporting it to the moderator, what else can we do?But if you are too concerned about these reserved posts, it will not be out of place to send them a personal message. It would serve as a reminder for them to consider their post. Many of them might have forgotten that they made such reservations or they didn't meet up with the competition deadline.",

I think that was where the \"reserved\" thing started from. It then got hightened during the \"first come, first serve\" era of picking hunters for campaigns in 2017/2018. Then managers would just pick participants based on FCFS basis and not merit. Even when the merit thing came up, once applicants were able to meet the merit requirement they were picked based on who applied first.Now, selection isn't that way any more. How things changed. Really, it's no big deal. Obviously, those who posted reserved and not delete it after 24hrs must've forgotten they did and that's why it's still there. It's no big deal.

It doesn’t gave you an advantage when your post is on top even on tournament, giveaways or signature campaign application. It doesn’t count too for signature camapign quota unless you are doing a reserve now post later method which is technically cheating on signature campaign just to fill post quota.I notice a lot of this post on Roobet art contest which is not necessary since Hhampuz browse all the application from first to last submission as long as it was submitted during the deadline.@OP, Reserve post doesn’t hurt the forum either since that is just a few word post that can be skip with just a single scroll down.",

I was a bounty hunter before and i hope you do not know that some bounties are limited for some participants so whenever i new bounty came. Many users just reserved the post count and then after filling the form they edit their POA. I hope you understand what i am saying. And who failed to edit their POA their request to join the compagin is rejected. This was that simple. So, I don't think this cheating has anything to do with forum rules well that's what i hope.
