Does that 1 voided match is the only pick that makes your parlay decreases the payout? Looking at your post will definitely attracted me to follow your telegram. I think it’s better if you have channel or private group for your picks.congratulations on your win!",

If what you used it for it profitable, use just 5% or less of the profit on gambling. If you want to go for $1m, the betting can be lost at anytime as you will want to stake all the money to win again and again. Or maybe only one time betting remain, but I will advice your to use the money for something that can give you more money to gamble.

For most of that number of people is a miracle in his life, it will be very sufficient to have fun for a few months, really I personally do not have that big courage in gambling.",

Telegram: Ra3WasHere You again Napkins! Been following your stuff for quite a while now ever since you posted that 90k win you got from a 4k bankroll. I would be lying if I say I wanna have what you're on that gives you these sharp bets that bag you so much money but oh well. It seems like you're doing this for fun and the losses are just aftereffects from losing so much potential money so I think you're good and all that. There's a saturation of \"don't succumb to gambling addiction\" posts here already and I don't want to add up to them. Anywho, good luck on your future bets man and I hope you know your limits and all that so you could bag wins like these.",

Its better, keep half in the vault I mean 50/50 if you lose in next bet and there is still half left in your vault or withdraw. You have a target of 1m right? so it's better if half the wins are stored in your vault or withdraw. If you are too brave to bet again with a bet amount 446K I'm afraid you will lose again, like your last post.

Like, I can't keep throwing away money because I have bills to pay every month and I can't touch my bitcoin savings because the price is too low to waste it right now.

It is really just turning out that OP isnt really that contented on what he saw on his payout or winnings which it is really indeed that big. If he wishes on reaching up a millionthen he should do this now that he had more balance or making use of that 400k and make out some all in bet and just having that 2-3x odds then reaching out that 1M would be that possible.But somewhat making use of that whole amount is something that everyone wouldnt really be that confident on doing so. I would really be making use of those amounts on other means and wouldntreally be tending to make or lose it back into to gambling. lol",
