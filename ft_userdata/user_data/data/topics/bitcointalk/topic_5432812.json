  "content": "I'm going to make this short and cut to the point, although I am also going to give room for whoever that can potentially help to step in and give time tables.1/2/2023:I deposited about 0.05889819 BTC or $987.00 USD. Wagered quite a bit, unsure as to the exact amounts, but as of now, at least 0.50959006 BTC, and profited 0.09331052 BTC (Went on quite a bit of a luck streak after getting on and off). https://i.imgur.com/kqRfXoZ.pngWhen I finally attempted to withdraw to stop gambling, I was met with a notification: https://i.imgur.com/ON5Ux6B.pngI understand that KYC can be requested at any moment, although I have not done anything even remotely suspicious? I played the game, and I won. And yet, there is no need for KYC verification to further play, and potentially lose thousands. Or to deposit. I spoke to their live support (Acetehoge), and they told me that the admins would have to handle this situation within the next 24 hours and let me know where to proceed from there. From there, I did some digging and found someone in a similar situation, where I'm guessing the outcome was resolved. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335906.0I'm hoping on somehow finding a resolution to this issue, as according to that post, there was only a miniscule amount of times where KYC verification was requested, and it was for suspicious activity, nothing of which that I would say there was. I've used DuckDice.io since 2015 (on and off), and I've never ran into issues like such. I'm hoping it that it is indeed a system error like the post above. Will update when further information is provided.",

There could be various reasons why you were asked to verify your identity:- They suspect you use multiple accounts.- They suspect you gamble from a banned territory.- They suspect you of abusing bonuses or any other terms/rules.- You used a VPN that triggered some alarms, etc. If they insist that you have to perform KYC, I don't see any way around it unless you find a point in their TOS where it says you don't have to but can still get your money back.",

KYC is primarily just to identify a user's location, especially since oftentimes VPN use is detected for users from restricted countries (even if they don't do anything \"suspicious\"). In the end, users fall into more complicated verification than usual when making withdrawals.I found their terms clearly written:Quote from: https://duckdice.io/terms5.

You should lock this topic if you have received your withdrawal by now. They have requested KYC from you as your withdrawal requesting pattern was suspicious. None of the licensed casino will allow you to withdraw your deposits if you don't meet the rollover requirements. KYC verification will be triggered everywhere if you try to do that.",

It doesn't. That's what I said in the beginning. It's not a scam yet.     Quote from: Kirito89 on January 03, 2023, 04:07:03 PMRegardless Kyc is not something we mysteriously remember when people win, we've had withdrawals of 1000 eth , 20 btc etc where KYC was never a factor,  but in certain cases like OP's, yes, we are obligated to request the KYC verification. That was a general comment about the way crypto casinos go about KYC, and not something I meant specifically about your platform. Crypto casinos generally don't mind when players gamble and lose with multiple accounts, from restricted locations, etc. But they do mind if you break their rules and win.Quote from: Mahdirakib on January 03, 2023, 04:38:33 PM@fakeunholy, can you confirm whether you have received your withdrawal or not? Since OP only created his Bitcointalk account to make this thread, we might never hear from him again. Newbies have a tendency to just disappear without a word. I am sure if the casino still owns him money he will be back here to complain.",

The truth of the matter is that you don't have to do any suspicious activity to be requested for KYC, because withdrawing in most cases is enough reason to ask for a user's KYC, ensuring the money gets to the rightful owner. Moreover, this is not a \"scam accusation\" yet, just as you are yet to comply with what the casino asked you to do, as stated in the second notification given below, because until you do that and yet payment not processed still after 48hours, then can it be classified as scam.",
