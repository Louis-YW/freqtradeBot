  "content": "Due to recent events with (another) exchange collapse from hack, and millions in stolen funds that must have got mixed already, I got this concern of mine. Should users who advertise mixing services feel confident in this place? According to our Privacy Policy - Variation, administrator might choose to share individuals' information, even without law enforcement involved. Has it even happened, or does it seem probable to you, for some agency to request any kind of take down due to the advertisement of a service that might be one of the top targets of the authorities when it comes to bitcoin as we speak? As far as I can tell for ChipMixer, bitcointalk is the gateway. It's unlikely you happen to access it otherwise.",

It would also be sort of ironic for a Bitcoin oriented forum to work with the authorities to take down a privacy based platform which aids Bitcoin users.If there is a court order to that effect, it could be possible, but I don't see that happening.",

      "body": "Surely, the only way that would happen is if the party that's requesting that information has reason to believe user x has broken the law. Advertising or even using the service doesn't mean you're using it illegally. Many users who are advertising don't use the service. Then, as has been discussed several times over the years, many users use services like these to retain their privacy, and as we speak there's no laws against using it legitimately. So, if a third party did suspect someone in particular of using the service to money launder then they could potentially request theymos to release any information that could aid upon that. However, whether theymos complies is up to them, and probably done on a case by case basis. If governments start cracking down, and deem services like this illegal, then advertisers would have to make the choice of whether they continue to advertise the service, since it would be technically illegal to do so. Until then, I can't see any reason why a party would request this information, unless like I suggested they can tie a particular user to a money laundering case.",

This site though expects the community to take the responsible approach and not encourage or support users who would engage in the advertising of money laundering activities for their own benefit. Is it illegal to advertise? Probably not. Is it unethical and leads to scammers feeling empowered here, in my opinion, yes. Yeah, it wouldn't be a take down notice, unless they came after the forum for facilitating illegal services if they were ever made illegal, which seems unlikely. I imagine the majority of users using the service are indeed using it for legitimate legal reasons, such as retaining privacy, which is why I think it would never be made illegal. Since, cash can be used to money launder, but that doesn't make using it illegal.  It would be a information request on a particular user or a set of users. I don't think any party requesting this information would have much of a case unless they're already investigation a user that so happens to be advertising it too though. Since, there's no grounds to assume that someone that's advertising is even using the service, and even if they were that they're using it for illegal purposes. So, they'd have to have some suspicion that a particular user was using it for this, and would likely need supporting evidence. Unless, these services become illegal in the country of the requester. Then, they could investigate for another reason; advertising illegal services. That's at least how I'd think it work.",

Especially in the case that you could mess up while using a vpn or tor and log into a personal account, or log into a more sensitive account without the vpn or tor in place - I think this is done a lot with mixers in a lot of cases where people don't consider what they're doing before they do it - and it's one of the main reasons people get caught for any crime.A probe into mixers here, if done, would likely be done on cloudflare or amazon's side. I think a forum hosted on an onion domain for crypto wouldn't be hard to find either but would be slightly harder than clearnet if it had to go down that route (it might find other decentralised channels first though)..Presumed guilt is becoming a lot more common in Europe (again) and it's likely what the tornado cash developer was actually sentenced on.

REvil no longer exists and Lazarus is under extreme scrutiny.Putting on the conspiracy theorist hat, I'd say part of the honeypot is not letting the public know about exchange hackers caught who had used ChipMixer. Part of a good honeypot is you never know its one until after its all over (as happened with the Hansa darknet market).Regardless of whether ChipMixer is a honeypot or not, the fact remains you'd have to be out of your mind to be using them in Q4 2022.
