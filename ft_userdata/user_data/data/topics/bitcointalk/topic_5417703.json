Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on August 04, 2021, 06:46:02 AM\"it pays to be good\" - in terms of 51% attack - only if you have something to lose. When you attack BSV its free money. To mine BTC you need same equipement. BTC hashrate is 200-500 times bigger than BSV. Means that 0.2% of bitcoin hashrate (one big farm) can jump to BSV for 3 hours double spend as much as they want and come back to mine BTC. And looks like we see this now. It was crazy to think that BSV with 0.2% of bitcoin hashrate is secured enough to be considered safe.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on October 20, 2022, 04:07:53 AMthat's where you are wrong. which is why the story is important. this rogue miner is going to get SQUASHED. deleted from the blockchain and gone. like you swat a fly off a horse's ass. achived using centralized power? XD Great crypto. Real satosi vision Fun fact is that market did not react on this. There was no price dump. Really? in 2022 people does not even care if their blockchain works or not ?",

When an empire was built on fake promises, it usually collapse shortly thereafter. I was 1ondering why BSV took so long to collapse. Possibly some hopeful people kept on running BSV chain. But now it's completely clear what's going to be the fate of BSV. I believe multiple exchanges have already delisted it making it one of those token which cannot sell in the market. It's funny how BSV was faking Satoshi's vision and no ended up as a failure!",

I mean i am no IT guy but i just checked the price of Bitcoin SV and it did not move in the last few days. I would imagine that the price would heavily go down when news like the one that you posted become public because a blockchain that is completely controlled by one miner has nothing to do with crypto currency in my opinion because it is just as centralized and controlled like all the FIAT currencies.Overall i have to say that i have never really been a fan of such forks and i am always surprised that such forks are able to maintain a relatively high price at all. In the end such forks create a lot of money out of nowhere that needs to be bought up by others first. I am always surprised that people are buying that fork coins.",

Anyone who cared enough about this project was warned against it, and it was something that dropped significantly in the ranks even before any of this, and if they still invested then they knew the risks. Who would spend time on investing into something Craig Wright did?It’s obvious that dude is a liar and if you believed him then it’s your own fault. With this, it’s now proven that we are talking about something that is doing a bit worse, and not a shock to anyone like me who knew it was a bad project even at the start.",
