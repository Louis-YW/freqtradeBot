  "content": "It is unfair that bitcoin being a different digital money system something more egalitarian, at least not unlimited like fiat, has become so inaccessible to the people who really need it. I feel that having 1 million satoshis in a few thousand years will make you a millionaire and a more equal and free person. But what sense does it make to buy with your fiat money as many bitcoin as possible to become a millionaire and then sell it for more fiat money? I think this will make bitcoin more expensive for people who really want the currency, not to exchange it for more fiat money or other crypto, but because we know that keeping bitcoin will be fighting for a less corrupt world and those who don't have it can have something. I look forward to reach that peak of $3300 to also have the right to be part of this.  https://i.imgur.com/bLMHqEC.png",

Many people complain that they find it hard to buy bitcoin with their fiat, but how else do you get a different currency from the one you are paid with or the one your country uses, just one way and that is you have to exchange it for the other, that is the same thing applicable with bitcoin, if you want it you have to exchange it for your fiat.You can have bitcoin of any amount, start somewhere without setting yourself any difficult limit, everyone deserves to have bitcoin if they so wish and they can get it even if bitcoin is at any price, any small satoshi also counts as bitcoin.",

After all, if you had been buying a little bit of bitcoin since 2017, and had been patient, you would now say otherwise. But there are a lot of people like you. Therefore, without waiting \"several thousand years,\" you still have the opportunity to become the owner of Bitcoin. Just be a little optimistic in your predictions.",

I have been trying to figure out what your message was, but if I'm not wrong everyone deserves Bitcoin just as everyone deserves a good and better life but first you must know that Bitcoin is very volatile and not a get rich quick scheme. Though there have been cases of people who jumped into Bitcoin with little knowledge but plenty money and forged their ways through making huge profits. Just as it is with your regular business, so it is with Bitcoin, because you also need capital to start no matter the level of your knowledge about Bitcoin except in some cases of giveaways. Regarding people living a thousand year, no one is going to live a thousand year and you shouldn't expect Bitcoin to fall back to $3300 before you can level up on it. I have a friend who tries as much as possible to buy Bitcoin almost every week, no matter how small and I also admire that and working towards discipling myself towards that too.",

After that, they could use the fiat for other purposes.The time will come for bitcoin to hit $33k again, even higher than the previous ATH.

No, you are wrong. In fact, you can buy Bitcoin easily now as there are a lot of exchanges that would give you a favor. But the problem is that these people don't want to risk their money. Well, might think it is expensive but not necessarily do we have to buy 1 whole Bitcoin instantly, we can apply the DCA strategy but what really happens is that many people are impatient. If we really wanted to have Bitcoin then we have to do something, not by looking on it's price but the benefits and possible profit we get many years from now considering that this is an investment.",
