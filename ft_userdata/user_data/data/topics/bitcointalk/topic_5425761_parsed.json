  "content": "Blockchain Expo World will be held on 22-25 December 2022 at Istanbul Expo Center (IFC), one of the largest exhibition centers of the city.    The event is expected to attract 2 million digital exhibitors online and 50 to 200 thousand visitors in person, who will walk around 3 IFC halls extending over a vast area of 15.800 m2.   The event is, with great pride, the first expo to be approved by the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) with its addition to the List of Approved Fairs published on TOBB?s official Website.    The event will be the first and only expo of its kind to be held in Turkey and in the greater EEMEA region.   Blockchain Expo World, staying true to its title, aims to create a platform that will bring together the blockchain technology sector and all of its stakeholders (Blockchain technologies, the world of cryptocurrencies, NFT, Web 3.0, and Metaverse).   Blockchain Expo World will run in the Metaverse in real time, which will make it a pioneer around the world yet again.    The event will also feature a BEW Hackathon, organised exclusively for Blockchain Expo, where more than 250 participants will compete over a course of 4 days.   The sponsorship policy adopted for Blockchain Expo World requires the main sponsor to be an organisation that is not involved in the same sector covered by the event in an effort to keep an equal distance to all expo participants. This will, in turn, give the event participants the peace of mind of securing their presence in proportion to their scope of participation without any concerns of being overshadowed by any other brand from the sector. In addition, sector-specific sponsorships will only be accessible to organisations in charge of event support services (Gala Dinner, stand installation for university students? blockchain clubs, and the BEW Hackathon we will organise, etc.).    The same policy also applies to media sponsorships, which are, therefore, organised in the form of partnerships.   The expo has also garnered support from public agencies as evident in the involvement of numerous relevant agencies including, among others, the Ministry of Treasury and Finance, Ministry of Industry and Technology, Ministry of Commerce, and in the event as both supporters and participants. The event will have the honor of featuring the Minister of Treasury and Finance as the executive keynote speaker.    The event will also include conferences and panels with national and international leaders in the sector taking the floor, all to be organised under Talk Expo. The visitors will have an opportunity to hear speeches from David Palmer (Visionary & Global Platform Innovator Vodafone Business Blockchain Lead), Christian Gleich (International Ambassador European Blockchain Association), and Lavinia D. Osbourne (Founder of Women in Blockchain Talks).   Expo tickets will sell for TRY299 per day. The tickets will be assigned individually to the participants via a mobile application. Participating companies will add digital assets to the tickets, which the visitors will be able to use to purchase food and beverages in the designated area or to add to their digital wallets for investment.   10% of the ticket proceeds will be donated to the NGO which we will establish and to university students? blockchain clubs in equal parts.   The event will have a physical sapling planted for each paying visitor. The plantations will be located in different parts of the country, the first and foremost location being the destroyed forests of Marmaris. Ticket - Fairground rental and more info  https://blockchainexpoworld.com/             Entrance visitor  to the Istanbul fairground: 299 TL ( 15 usd )            Entrance visitor to the Metaverse fairground : Free  https://www.xperexpo.com/",
