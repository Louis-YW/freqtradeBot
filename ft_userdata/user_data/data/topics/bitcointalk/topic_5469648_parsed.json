The first thing is to decide/research on the subject you want to write on : it is very important to know what you want to write about and also analyze to know if the purpose is to educate or seek answers to doubt bothering you. After which you do your research to get facts and also check if a similar thing has been posted on the forum.2.  get some writing aid : even if you have the best idea, if you don't write it out the right way using the right punctuation Mark as well as the right word in the right place, your post might not be understood. The Grammarly app helps a lot with the correction of typo errors.3. Create a good title :  there are posts I have seen with great titles that even if I don't feel like reading anything at that moment, I just have to check the content of the post because of how inviting the topic is.4. Start your writing very well: try not to bore your readers down with lengthy post that has little information/message. Try your best to catch the attention of your readers within the first two lines of your post so your reader gets a clue about what you are writing and do not get bored while reading through your content 5. If you are replying, know when to reply, when to do a full quote, and when to quote a selected portion of a text you are replying to.This might help out. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5346341.msg57335807#msg573358076.  Always preview your typed work before posting 7. most importantly, be real: be yourself, enjoy the critics, make the mistakes, and don't be afraid to learn something new from every post and comment you make.Even when your post doesn't get recognized that much don't let it discourage you, learn your lesson and come back better.",

Well, coming back to the topic. I can not agree more with all of your points, because these are the basics and we all should be aware of it, whether we are a newbie or not, because what happens here is when a person becomes a full member or above he starts to ignore some points like not taking care of the pronunciation or using bashing words for the coming newbies.I don't like that.And the point of when to quote and how much to quote is something new to me, because I mostly quote when I have to talk about some specific thing in the post, but mostly I use this technique which I just use. --> which is to write some of the words of your posts to get your attention to those words only (which I have italicized).",

Just reactivate the discussion.I don't think it is bad to make another topic out of it, because even if the topic has been shared by many other members by different titles and contexts but every time each member comes up with a different and unique thing and to be honest, I don't think it is easy for a newbie to keep track of all the past topic created on the same topic. And why a warning is given on a topic to which there are not one has replied for the past 120 days? I mean that's an open indicator for those, to not post something in them but creating another topic on the same thing with different post content is okay. Don't you think, Just a curious thought, not implying anything? Quote from: goxcraft on October 08, 2023, 03:30:07 PMHere is another source from 1miau about how one can improve their post quality.

Are we sharing the threads here that would help others, as the OP wrote the title in a way that \"My little drop\" like he is contributing from his side? Well, whatever, I will also add useful threads that I have kept track of. These threads will help all of the newbies and ranked members of this forum.

Almost everything you have highlighted is valid but you don't need to write a perfect post to get the right response. It is good to write a post that is free from errors but the most important thing to consider is how helpful the post will be to the community. Many people are not native English speaker which means their grammar might not perfect. But if they have a good idea and their post contribute positively to the community it will be accepted. For me the most important factor is the relevance of the post, then the ability to write simply and understandably is my next consideration.
