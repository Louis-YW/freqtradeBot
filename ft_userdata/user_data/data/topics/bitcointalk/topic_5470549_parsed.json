  "content": "As Indians, we all know how much Gold plays an important part in our lives, inheritance, and solution to a crisis situation. In our culture, gold plays an important role. We are taught to keep our family's gold safe and add more to the existing amount. The reason is simple, which is to safeguard the future of our child or the generation that will come after us. The belief that Gold is an asset in times of uncertainty, a standard of purity, and an object of desire needs to be changed. We are in 2023, we Indians have now sent a rover to the moon and next, we might be on the moon. Still, we buy Gold because of our belief in gold and our obligation to our elders, why not change this attitude for the future of our children, why not diversify our portfolio of assets that we can give to our future generations?Let's do a small comparison as to why we should think about Bitcoin before we buy Gold. I will write about Gold and then about Bitcoin, you can add to my reasoning in your replies.Gold VS Bitcoin: Gold has a limited supply, which we do not know. Bitcoin has a supply of 21 million, which we all knowGold has an inflation hedge of +5%Bitcoin has a store value and +100% inflation hedgeWhat do you think would be the biggest difference between Gold and Bitcoin?",

      "body": "Basically, Indian subcontinent filled with rich kingdoms for thousands of years so gold also been a part of everyone's life even before 3 to 4 thousand years ago as per the research.From financial point of view gold has been the real store of value for centuries for average middle class family and bitcoin is hardly over 10 years old so it will take time to change a habit that has been in practice for generations. IMO gold is really important in everyone's portfolio and to be honest I will rate the gold one step over bitcoin but accumulating gold over 100 or 200 gms is not really worth compared to the returns that can be made by investing the same money in other assets such as bitcoin.",

According to Times of India, 83% Indians aware of cryptocurrencies but only 16% own it. The recent survey results say 20% own it. It's impressive that four percent increase in two years. Crypto users age from 25 to 44 old men. Only men have participated in this survey. Now back to the point. Indians still adopt gold because it's a part of the tradition. It's physical. Gold price is kind of stable and price increases over time and most of the time you can sell it for profit in the future. Compared to this, Bitcoin is volatile and not physical. It can give you profit in the long run but you might need urgent money during the bear market. So, you will be forced to sell at a loss. Still, we should stay positive. Increasing 4% in two years is a huge change, my friend. You will notice some big changes five or ten years later.",

Some people who are familiar with bitcoin and its benefits invest in it and view it as digital gold.You should always invest the majority of your money in safe investments such as gold, property, etc. Also, Indians have a special relationship with gold.",

Another important reason is marriage, gold is still acts as the standard of deciding factors of the brides family status so they can't get rid of gold.Apart from gold middle class people never exposed to other assets even they consider investing in stocks is only for richest community.",

Same as general Gold users who do not dig the gold from the gold mine. Right? We are just users. Miners verify blocks and they get a reward for not. There are mining farms that take energy from solar panels as well.",

These stories give you goosebumps but they are true.However the younger generation is gradually getting into crypto sadly this term implies mostly shitcoins that make quick bucks to them. I personally have the opinion that every asset has its pros and cons and all should be tried based on your own taste.",

So we can see that the number of people owning crypto is still very low. The current regulatory status contributes a lot to this low number.Hence Gold obviously becomes a major potential asset for all Indians and this is why Indians are not adopting BTC over Gold.",
