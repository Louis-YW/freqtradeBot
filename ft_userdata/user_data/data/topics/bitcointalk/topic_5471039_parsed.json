As i can conclude, rapprochement with China is only one side of the coin, as this is accompanied by declining cooperation with its classic allies India and Russia. The classical allies are those who strongly support the Bangladeshi economy for mainly geostrategic goals, which is to strengthen its position vis-à-vis its rival Pakistan, which is supported by the United States. However, it has been noted recently that the support of the allies has declined, forcing Bangladesh to turn to China.My information may not be completely accurate because I have stopped following developments in the Asian economies since the beginning of the Ukrainian war.",

As you said, you are a developing country, so we totally depend on the Tier 1 countries and also take loans from the IMF, etc. Which means the economies of those countries directly impact us.And at second, I will say, don't just copy and paste the news from the website, because it seems so unethical. If you really have some feelings or intentions to get some ideas, then add your words, ideas, and feelings in the post too. If a robot can do this work, we can ask them to add a bot like in the WO (we get graphs automatically) that could post all the news here.

      "body": "It is concerning to hear that a developing country is struggling to cope with the economic crisis. Bangladesh is having a tough time at the moment due to various crises in various sectors such as fuel crises, high inflation, weak banking sector, trade deficit, and depleting foreign exchange reserves. The economic problems that are happening in Bangladesh are due to poor state governance and have been ignored for too long, so problems that initially only have a temporary impact take root and become a prolonged impact. Bangladesh also needs support from other developing countries such as Indonesia.Last month Indonesia - Bangladesh had a Bilateral meeting which took place at the Kakatua Room, Jakarta Convention Center (JCC), Jakarta. During the meeting, the two discussed cooperation in the field of trade. Indonesia-Bangladesh friendship can continue to be strengthened concretely. One of them is optimizing trade relations between the two countries and removing trade barriers. https://www.kompas.id/baca/internasional/2023/09/06/bilateral-untuk-menghilangkan-hambatan-perdagangan",

Just like other developing nations Bangladesh is going through inflation, currency loss of value, and declining external reserve caused by a decline in export revenue. But the country's major problem is corruption.  Bangladesh is ranked 147 among 180 nations in the Global Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of Transparency International. It is also the second most corrupt nation in South Asia. In a country where the meager resources that would have been used to develop the country are diverted to the personal bank accounts of corrupt politicians, such a nation might never be free from economic woes. The citizens know that Bangladesh's main problem is corruption which is why there have been many public uprisings, riots, and demonstrations to remove these corrupt politicians from power but many of them have been unsuccessful.",

Recently there have been many new newbies that are posting this kind of copy paste news like posts in BD thread (We don't have own local board yet). I'm not saying it's bad but one shouldn't just join the forum and start posting news from various sources. If you look closely, almost all the newbies in bangla thread are doing this. As soon as a user registers, s/he miraculously finds BD thread and start sharing news. When I first joined the forum I didn't even knew there was a BD thread. That's why I stopped posting there, even reputed members are also posting less. There is no education discussion happening, no ideas are being shared, no questions are made, just news news all days long. Some members are still trying to be creativity though.Another thing I noticed if you look at the usernames and post style, you'll find many similarities. My guess is one or two or a group of people are managing these accounts. Although I can't connect them as alt accounts but you'll know when you see them. Even there was a username called DTmember, don't you think that's odd? How would one know DT is a thing in bitcointalk? I'm not saying having alt is a crime but what I'm seeing these days in my thread is disappointing. It's not ideal for newbies to post only news. He is new, he should behave like one. He should be making questions, making threads not posting news. What's your say on that?My comment might be irrelevant to this thread and board, but I though it might be worth sharing",

But you could raise this issue in your local section. Besides the fact that your newcomers publish posts according to rule number one: low quality, providing copies and pastes with a link, this topic could even be located in the Bangladesh section.

Therefore, I believe that the countries of Southeast Asia are the least affected by what is happening in the global economies and the economic damage to them is less, in addition to the countries of South America, which do not have a large exposure to debt.

I'd import Xijingping into my country and let him do all the stuff and his fellow men over here and citizen can mind their own business while the government build all the things they can do without opposition to stop them.
