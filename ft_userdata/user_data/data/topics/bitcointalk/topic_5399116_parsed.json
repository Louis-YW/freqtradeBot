  "content": "Never had any problems with my Ledger Nano S and been using it for 3 years, when today suddenly when I logged in my balance is double of what it last was. And this while there is no extra transaction visible.I sent some funds away and the amount was deducted correctly, so not a double deduction now. Meaning right now my balance is even more than double of what it should be.What is going on? Anyone ever had this problem? I suppose I don't actually have double of what I thought?",

So, unfortunately, don't get too happy.There was not long ago another user telling about a transaction getting doubled, see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5398019.0As said, clearing cache fixes this.I will add 2 more things:1. Consider using a more reliable wallet, like Electrum. It works very good with Ledger (I use that combination). You get Electrum from Electrum.org, you verify it, you run it with your Ledger (when you create the wallet you don't generate new seed nor enter your seed, instead you select \"Standard wallet\" then \"Use hardware device\"2. This topic is hardware wallets related, please move it to Hardware Wallets section https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=261.0The link on bottom-left of the page should help",

Regardless of whether I use Ledger in combination with Electrum when it comes to BTC transactions, I always make sure that I don't have outdated firmware and that all coin apps are up to date - and that can't be done any other way than with Ledger Live.As for the problem with the balance, there are several examples on the forum that have encountered this problem, and the only positive thing is that the balance is always positively larger, which is far better than seeing at any time that you are missing 50% of what you have you had in your wallet.",

I remember the problems we had in the past with the firmware update on the Nano S, today it is fortunately a very quick and painless process. During one such update, the electricity went out, and the home internet went out with the electricity - of course the process was interrupted, but luckily the laptop has a built-in battery and I quickly connected to the mobile internet and finished the process.Quote from: Pmalek on July 26, 2022, 10:58:13 AMHow about seeing a 0 balance all of a sudden? ;That's what I was most afraid of when I was using a desktop wallet, that some malware would empty my wallet - luckily I was as careful then as I am now - but I guess that's a dark thought that haunts anyone who has a significant amount of funds in any crypto wallet.",

Am I too paranoid?The limit (and even whether you measure it in BTC or USD) above which you want to store coins in cold storage is different for everyone; their level of 'paranoia' and 'general security' setup.]For instance, if you store your hardware wallet in a nuclear-weapon-safe bank vault under the concrete basement of your house in a quiet city downtown, risk of hardware attacks on it are much lower than if you live in Brazilian favelas with extremely bad 'physical building-layer security', where it's entirely possible someone enters your home through your wooden door while you're at work and steal the wallet to perform hardware attacks on it.So in short, I have to give you the 'stupid but true' reply: 'it depends'.. (I would argue though, that if you have extreme levels of physical security around a hardware wallet, it becomes less usable, hence there might be no reason for having it anyway; no real advantage over just securing a paper seed phrase in a similar fashion.)",

Because for desktop there's this page: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/lld-signaturesI must say I was puzzled that on the download page for Ledger Live I couldn't find a link to the checksums page. Maybe I was blind but usually I'm able to spot such obvious things pretty easy. Why on earth do I have to use the search on Ledger's website to find proper checksums. That's ridiculous. (Don't worry, I don't have a Ledger Nono...)I guess they invest quite some money in marketing and a slick'n'shiny website and not in software and hardware quality. Well, I know what I won't buy for sure. The issues with Ledger Live are a bad joke.Sorry for my rant but it kind of bugs me that quite often Ledger is used nearly as a synonym for hardware wallets.
