      "body": "I will help you conclude some points based on CMC analytics. But, others may see things from a different perspective.- About 25% of coin distribution slowly concentrated on whales. With the current low prices it is possible for whales to buy as much as possible. If this is true, then it can be said that they are also bullish in the next bull session. However;- A large number of detected addresses put activity into \"hold\" mode and are growing over time since early 2023 (currently around 13m out of 16m addresses). Don't know how long they will hold, if it gradually changes activity to recoup losses at every level of price increase, then it may refuse ALGO to at least reach the highest price level last time even though the bull session has peaked.",

Algorand is a 2019 bull run kid. So it doesn't have a very long history of trading. -94% is a decent dump, but its not something crypto can't recover from. ETH dumped 93% in 2018 just to pump 40x right after, but... you have to be sure its a good project that will survive. because most projects are stars of one bull market. The bull market passes, 2-3 years pass, new projects are created, better products are created, and someone solves the same problem in a different way. Hype goes away and the project dies. An example of this could be EOS, NEM, NEO, very popular projects during the 2017 bubble that was meant to be an ETH killers. They never recovered because during the next bull run, we had BSC and others.Algorand is not bad, but i'm not sure if it will be a star of next bull run or not. I don't think that anyone is able to judge. DCA is a good idea but only if you combine it with good diversification. Because lauding all bags with 1 altcoin is never a good idea.",

      "body": "Bro, anything that you think is a good crypto that must be added to your portfolio you just have to buy it. If you think that Algo is such a good investment, you don't need other people's confirmation and validation for it because we've got each our own biases. I may say that it's not the best time to buy and it's not a good altcoin to buy and then I'll tell you to buy the one that I prefer. That just sound so good at all, you say that it's a good one so it means that based on your own preference, research and understanding, if it's a good one then there's no need to debate whether you should DCA or not.",

Algorand has been losing all of its demand. It seems like that all of people who frequently used algorand is now moved to the new blockchain that looks like more promising at this moment. Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 26, 2023, 09:07:45 AMI am debating if I should DCA at these levels or not  You should not. Algorand will be going down even deeper. The volume is very small atm. Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 26, 2023, 09:07:45 AMI still feel it is a good investment but am not sure why it has fallen so much. Why keep calling a project that has a few users as a good investment? you have bunch of coins in the market that have more demand than it. Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 26, 2023, 09:07:45 AMAnyone still bullish on Algorand for next bull run? Only if bitcoin will be bullish first. I expect algorand to be pumped caused by that but when can we expect it to happen? No ETA.",
