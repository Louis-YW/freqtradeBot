Well, I never see any alert and I done even try to check on face book if I go see person when done drop similar claim but I never see am.Let's assume that this is true, My few questions regarding this are,1.  What criteria was used to selecting the household that the said 25k would be given to and when was the selection done?2. If a government is giving it citizen a renewed hope, is it through a policy like this or won't it be better you use this money to train people to becoming skilled at something so they can be of help to themselves. Mind you, that 25k isn't even enough to take care of an adult for two weeks in this current economy.3.  Where is my own share of the money?   thus is the most important question they have to answer because that 25k go really help my life this morning.",

Even though this is not sustainable,  it will go a long way in supporting people at least for the mean time while they think of other ways of making a living. This intervention will really caution the effect of our sad economic reality. The only problem is that the number of people that will benefit from this will be so insignificant compared to our population.  I don't know if there was announcement during the application period but I was never aware of it. This is how information fly and one will only know when it's late. Abeg if the application is still open, tell us because plenty people need this money.",

Sending 25k to households for three months in my wisdom will not eradicate poverty or better the living standard of the people. How many households will receive this money? How many square meals will it provide for families? Is this a definition of renewed hope? If senators or other government functionaries are giving such money will they applaud the government? The way to bring hope is by creating employment and that will automatically bring hope to the populace.",

So I know know if you self way dey read this post wether you done recive your own. Although I never know if na true or not because I no received anything. But for me I no see any need of becoming happy about that because that one na another strategy to make Nigeriana silent over some certain things. We get more problem to tarcle dan shearing money. Our country don owe plenty Dept and we dey even think when we go pay this dept finish now we come hear say Dem dey shear money, so where de money dey come from?I think no be every thing person sopos to dey happy for. Because for me I see am as a way to silent the youth over their agetation on bad governance. One problem our leaders dey get na lack of planning. There are things them need settle before them go wan leave the live like oyibo;1) them sopos settled Dept wey we dry owe all over the world2) settle lecturers make them get moral to teach effectively, without depending on student for survival due to sorting. And e go reduce the rate of strike in our universities.3) civil servant wey dey complain say government no dey gree pay Dem as e sopos be. 4)use those money create production rather consumption.If you check out you go see say the problem we dey face na lack of production dey worry us. Nigeria get large portion of land wey sopo make we dey produce agricultural product but we leave am dey go inport rice they make life more difficult for human being.Wetting me I fit talk be say that money no frick me, because the money go still finish and we go still remain were we dey. It's better make person invest for my future, Dan giving me what will not add value to my life.",
