It is true Bitcoin is the only trusted crypto coin, but we can not deny the fact that some Altcoins have really proven themselves to be worth investing in, take for example, the likes of Ethereum, Binance coin, Cardano and the rest, all this are good alts to diversify on, you cant put everything on Bitcoin, and I don't advice anybody to put all their 100% investment on Bitcoin since we cant tell which coin will give us that X1000 we are hungry for in the shortest time period.",

However, there are also people who invest in them both, because they know that meme coins are good for short term profits while bitcoin destined for long term. But of course, investing in meme coins needs a lot of caution. That way, there will be no future regrets as you have not missed any chances or opportunities. But if you want to focus more on bitcoin, for me that creates a more profitable mindset, as bitcoin will always be the best crypto asset and buying right now makes the perfect timing to earn more bitcoin.",

Well, shitcoins were never a loss for some as they do it with the right timing. But for those who only invest randomly, and end up investing without timing, losses are surely inevitable for them. It's more on shitcoins were their eye opener before they start seeing the real worth of bitcoin. And i think that's normal for every investor. What matters is that they never miss the opportunity to invest in bitcoin while the market value is highly discounted.",

I also don't blame them sometimes because I was in one live stream on Tiktok and this guy probably gave many of his followers instruction to buy some shitcoins which didn't go as planned and was assuring them that bull run happens like crest wave yearly, i.e it will collapse a year and rise the second year, he was giving them words of confident that it will rise back next year and I was just shaking my head and smile. It is not as if they don't want to buy bitcoin, it is just that they receive wrong orientation from the beginning.",

Well I prefer to put some on my other baskets. I knew bitcoin is great but we cant deny that if you want to earn much bigger in terms of gain is you need to check marketcap and choosing a good altcoin is a really a game changer when it comes to profits.Like for example in current btc price, how much multiplier can it still do? 3x to 5x from here, right. But when you pick altcoins let say on the top 20, with its marketcap it can do more than 10x, 20x ot even more.",

Diversify with different assets outside of crypto.

Yes, but does their value increase when Bitcoin is falling? Do they move independently from Bitcoin or do they rise when Bitcoin rises and fall when Bitcoin falls? In the months following the ATH of $69k when Bitcoin fell to below $20k, how did those alts perform? Has their value increased or did they crash alongside of Bitcoin? That's all you need to know about diversification. Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on July 16, 2022, 03:16:45 AMLike for example in current btc price, how much multiplier can it still do? 3x to 5x from here, right. But when you pick altcoins let say on the top 20, with its marketcap it can do more than 10x, 20x ot even more. Don't forget about the Luna and Terra UST scenario. So yes, your alt can go x100 or x0.",

For some people, Bitcoin is simply a bad option for a number of reasons, not least because of the risk that comes from its volatility.Not everyone is capable of being their own bank, regardless of which crypto wallet they use, sooner or later they will make a mistake and lose everything.People who do not know the dangers of the Internet are in even greater danger, scams are everywhere, with a special emphasis on social networks.Despite the fact that the majority has a positive opinion about Bitcoin (if we take the forum as an example), past results are not a guarantee of future success - so let's not pretend to know what the future holds.As strange as it may sound to some, profit is not the most important thing when it comes to Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin would be here until there isn't a cryptocurrency market to invest in anymore but majority of the altcoins won't exist in coming years. Just as the metaverse coins dominated the industry last year and this year, we'll have other alternative sectors dominating for coming years there by making the so called top coins today irrelevant or have very small share of the altcoins volume in tomorrow market which will result in making them not as popular as they were in the last bull run. Investing in alts should never be done when Bitcoin is bleeding, because the market for alts follows the movement of Bitcoin with more effect. Best you wait until we have gotten a confirmation of a continuous upward movement for Bitcoin before you could pick some of your favorite alts that are showing signs of reviving with the market as Investing now could get you dumped on and the project could easily die with the bear market.",

Why we should buy shitcoins if there are a lot of top coins at cheap prices? I don't say no shitcoins are worthy, but top coins deserve to be our priority this time. I sometimes buy altcoins with low market caps, but I never did it during the bearish season. I will focus to buy more Bitcoin with 70% of my funds, and 30% for top altcoins. I agree that diversification is needed, but don't diversify funds to shitcoins. IMO, DWYOR",
