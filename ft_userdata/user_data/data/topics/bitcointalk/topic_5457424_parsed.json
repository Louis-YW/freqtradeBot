  "content": "Bitcoins has created its own history over the years even till now. Bitcoins has become famous across the world however, there several areas that need to be touched as to have a wider acceptance of bitcoins across Nigeria. The economy situation in Nigeria has force every Nigerian youth to discovering the impact of bitcoins. The religious leaders have also impacted the growth of bitcoins in Nigeria, as some believed bitcoins is demonic , not good for religious people, describing it as betting or Ponzi scheme. The fight of the government against bitcoins in most cases is due to proper comprehension of the mechanism of the system. It become difficult for them to accept. Until this gap is covered by crypto learned people in the government house and religious places , it may continue to post some kind of threat. I remember a member of house of senate fighting for bitcoins restoration in Nigeria and his description was about his son owning 2 bitcoins that worth 40million naira. I believe what he look after is the profit not the technology.  We can see that this gaps is a major threat to the bitcoins in many countries today. Many person have argued that, in Nigeria we have no problem with government barning Cryptocurrency. They forgot that government can also go a long way to stop  exchanges from allowing Nigerians trade. I know the current administration has not said anything about bitcoins . Only letting everyone know the gap that need to be covered.If there is no voice in the council of decision making , we can expect anything. Bitcoins army in Nigeria, let's rise to our feet",

Wow! I think this is my first time hearing that some religious leaders actually did talked about Bitcoin been demonic and not good for religious people, as never did i saw any pastor or a Muslim Imam making a news headline about such statement. But moreover, i'm not doubting the fact that some might not have said such privately in their various churches or mosque due to lack of knowledge about what is Bitcoin & how Bitcoin work, and might have mistook it for a Ponzi scheme or gambling, which in most case, it's okay base on their level of understanding. But as an educated person, what you do next matters the most, as it's not everything they tell you you ought to just accept it just like that without making the necessary research and findings, which I think is the mistake most people make.QuoteMany person have argued that, in Nigeria we have no problem with government barning Cryptocurrency. They forgot that government can also go a long way to stop  exchanges from allowing Nigerians trade. Yes, it's true that government can go a long way to stopping exchange from operating in Nigeria, and likewise stopping crypto traders from doing their businesses which is mostly exchange centered base, but that doesn't mean that they can stop people from owing Bitcoin (i.e Buying & Selling) in Nigeria, because with the help of p2p market place, all those can be done conveniently, and likewise with the help of V.P.N which we were able to use to bypass the Twitter ban last time.",

If government are not accepting the technology that doesn't mean Bitcoin will not be use in the world. Religious leaders see Bitcoin as bad thing not because it is a coin but it is because of what happened before before Bitcoin invention. MMM can to deceive the world and other Ponzi schemes so when Bitcoin came religious leaders see it as one of them. If the government stop exchange what about p2p. We will use p2p. I will send Bitcoin to you and in return you send me naira.  We are not Bitcoin army Bitcoin is decentralized and nobody can do it anything.",

I have heard about that in the past in many documentaries on different religious leaders view on the use of bitcoin. But what I saw from all that is that, there’s no exact rule guiding it as long as it can be owned, and use to trade in a transaction, then it could be treated as a currency used for buying and selling. Where some religious leaders have a negative notion towards it is being used for gambling purposes and fiat can also be used for that too.QuoteI know the current administration has not said anything about bitcoins .

Before their elections during campaign, they made mention of putting the youths through blockchain technology, if that is actualized, bitcoin will gain more grounds in Nigeria and also Africa at large.",

So with people like bishop Sam zuga the CEO of Zuga coin who's cryptocurrency project gained popularity along side the cryptocurrencies market in Nigeria, I have not hard in any church where Bitcoin or any coin is call Dominic and I believe this statement is born out of your own assumptions.",

I never see or hear of any religious leader wey talk sae bitcoin na demonic give their congregation. Any pastor or imam wey go yarn like that, no d enlightened for this 21st century. He is way backward from the digital world wey we d so.Nevertheless, Wetin I don hear some talk be sae, make them d careful when they wan invest in bitcoin because bitcoin to them d like Ponzi scheme wey dem go invest their money go disappear.In the real sense, em no bam for any religious leader to begin give any investment advice to em congregation whether bitcoin na evil or a Ponzi scheme. People no come church or mosque for that kind gbedu. Wetin people come do na for them to hear the word of God and its salvation. So if they needed investment advice of bitcoin, they know where them go get am. These our religious leaders needs to understand something, sae no be because them be religious leader, they go expect their gullible members to believe and accept everything wey d yarn. The world is advancing and the people in it are also doing the same. Perdon no need to d always follow the words of every religious leader because it can be deceptive at times.

Bitcoin is completely transparent, but Ponzi scheme is not. But you are not completely right about religious leaders, because people are not thinking the same.

One thing is for certain, Bitcoin price is affected by investor sentiment so I think they are free to harbor whatever impression they have of it. One funny question to be answered is if Bitcoin is regarded as demonic, how about the shameless ways pastor's ask for money, quoting only the part of the scriptures that support their words, deceiving the gullible congregation, but not minding this as long as they get to live lavish lifestyles. Is that not to be considered demonic?",

The fact that I believe nothing bad in bitcoin transactions, investments or let me say everything wey concern bitcoin sha, so how person go con sit down tell us bitcoin is not good both Christian and Muslim, I don't know wetin they see sha, but I dis agree with that.

Although I don't know, and the only thing I heard about these current administration about bitcoin is that Mr president said the youth should wait for a news concerning bitcoin which means we haven't yet know the outcome that he will come with it. But I know bitcoin is ban by CBN that's the only thing I know, so for the past administration I thought they stated that they can not ban bitcoin or stop people from using it, but if anything happen  to people funds that is in btc account they don't have anything to do with that, so na only us fit control our funds there, na we go take care of it not the banks.",
