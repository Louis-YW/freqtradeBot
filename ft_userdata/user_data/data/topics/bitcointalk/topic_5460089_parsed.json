      "body": "As you can see Op, bitcointalkers are not really fund of new exchanges so don't expect everyone to welcome you warmly to the forum. But if you really want to develop your exchange then you are sure going to receive lots of suggestions that will help you alot, but if your plan is to gain a little trust and then run away with users funds be rest assured that forum users will snuff it out before you even realize it.First of I'll start with the user interface, it's not really newbie friendly, and it also looks like those unknown exchanges that are been used by some shit coins. So you should try to improve it and make it more newbie friendly.And concerning the user verification, since it's still a pretty new sites I couldn't risk involving my funds in it, (registering an account with one of my emails is risk enough for me) I don't know if it's compulsory to undergo KYC before you can withdraw or partake in P2P trading. I don't know how this sounds but you should try to give new users a little less restrictions like allow them to trade at most $50 without having to complete verification, with that they can test the site. Alot of people prefer non-kyc site to KYCed sites.As you already know, you're in a very competitive industry and not just that, running an exchange requires that you gain the trust of your users since it involves them using their money and no one wants to give their money to an exchange that they know nothing about, so do well to promote it more and also interact with those that engage in your thread.",

      "body": "Is this the right place to announce about your exchange?Why don't you buy a copper member, create ann thread display your images since many people especially someone like me do find it difficult to click on a new site due to security reasons. So having image displayed on your post would also attributes in catching people's attention towards this post as I believe some reputable users may find it irrelevant.Then secondly, we believe the bull run is on its way whereby lot of people or do I say scammers do come to launch a fake project or exchange in other to get people invested in their project and trade in their exchange after the popularity has been gained they zoom off, causing heart attack to people who invested in such project.Lastly, I don't see anything convincing in your statement, there's nothing to assure traders funds are safe and secured.",

I don't think there should be any need for people to start using that exchange as compared to their withdrawal fee to be 0.01BTC is this a joke or what, do we say is an error from their ends as I believe no exchange in this crypto space would change such huge amount for just withdrawing from their exchange.",

How can they say a low fee and be charging 0.01 btc that's an exorbitant fee from a self-claimed exchange and not to talk of the lie they have made public with respect to their location and registration. Were they trying to divert the attention of the public from their origin or what?They started on the wrong note and if at all they have good intentions, they already shot themselves in the foot because of the silly mistakes they have committed.",
