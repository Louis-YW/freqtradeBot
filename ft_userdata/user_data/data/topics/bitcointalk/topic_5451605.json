(also what is \"within 10% range from price\" term)its about SUGGESTING* how much USD is being put on orders to buy and how much sellers want USDmeaning when there is more USD on the buy side can be a sign of higher demand (possible price increase)meaning when there is more USD on the sell side can be a sign of higher supply (possible price decrease)bid is the buyersask is the sellershowever its historic data delayed by 10 minutes. so by the time your reading it. traders have already reacted to it*its not really useful because most of the numbers are ghost orders that cancel if the price swings too much, so its not really a sign of real demand/supply of people actually wanting to trade at their temporary order amounts",

      "body": "Quote from: cafter on May 06, 2023, 04:29:39 AMwhat can we analyze with bid/ask sum chart.It's simple, Bid and Ask are used to offer prices to the Buyers and Sellers of Bitcoin, they mean Buying (We are buying at) and Selling (We are selling at). This is as it is in traditional banks for foreign exchange.Quote from: cafter on May 06, 2023, 04:29:39 AMi am not able to understand that what can we do with data. (also what is \"within 10% range from price\" term)The percentage price range is considered when you use the full price of Bitcoin to calculate the price at which it has moved for a certain period of time.For example, if the price of Bitcoin is at $30,000, and after a while, it moves lower to $27,000. Meaning it shed $3000. One could now say that Bitcoin dropped 10% of its price. You may then use this basis to calculate the market impact/range on any chart or market pricing board, including the one you seek.Does the explanation help enough?",
