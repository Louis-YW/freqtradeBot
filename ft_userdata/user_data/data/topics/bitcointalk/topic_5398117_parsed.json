  "content": "Genius is a new Store of Value token that is designed to be scarce, valuable, and to appreciate in value.  It addresses the Store of Value industry (Gold, Bitcoin, Banking CDs / Time-Lock Deposits, etc.), which is worth over $25 Trillion.  It is a system that creates value for people who hold (stake) the Genius token.“Genius is a hyper-yield Certificate of Deposit, secured by the blockchain and driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Genius’s AI incentivizes user behavior to produce upward market trends that benefit all holders of Genius.”Official DeploymentDeployed to: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche.Token Contract Address: 0x444444444444C1a66F394025Ac839A535246FCc8Official DAPP: https://start.geni.appGleipnir Security Audit: https://geni.to/gleipnirCertiK Security Audit: https://geni.to/certikNEWS UPDATE – Dec 31, 2022:Genius is being prepared for Etherscan verification.Genius was launched earlier this month.Genius NFTs (GENFTs) are trending!NEWS UPDATE – June 10, 2022:Over $51 million (by exchange value) was transacted in the Genius Sacrifice event!Genius is the largest sacrifice outside of a RH project.A full, third-party data and accounting audit on the sacrifice event can be found here: https://geni.to/sacauditNEWS UPDATE – May 16, 2022:Estimated Release Date: Summer 2022Legacy GENI makes another All-Time High price of $1.60.Market Cap is over $50 million.Over $1.1 million in liquidity (Uniswap v2 and v3, GENI/USDC)Average 24hr Volume: >$160k.Over $82 million has been sacrificed for the Sacrifice Event (Initial Token Distribution).Since the White Paper was released ~6 weeks ago, the price of Legacy GENI is up 100x.For market information on the placeholder token, visit: https://nomics.com/assets/geni-genitrustInitial DistributionYou can guarantee your spot with the initial token distribution either by holding the Legacy GENI “placeholder” token and/or by participating in the Sacrifice Event.The “placeholder” token was released in March 2021.  It is an ERC20 with no special functionality; however, the official Genius will have the Store of Value AI and Staking functionality.To distribute the initial tokens fairly, a crypto “Sacrifice Event” is happening now and ending on June 1st, 2022.The initial supply of 240 Billion tokens will be distributed to participants in the sacrifice events according to the sacrifice rules.  More information here: https://geni.to/sacnow A maximum of another 20 Billion Genius can be minted from holders of the Legacy GENI contract token.  This is due to the remaining supply of the Legacy GENI token in circulation today (May 10th, 2022).  The Legacy contract’s Ethereum / PulseChain address is:  0xaac1abdb4fb7a91a0e2e036dfacc45f708ed6a39Genius vs. Bitcoin - BasicsAnnual inflation: ~4.2% is paid to Genius miners (stakers). (Bitcoin is ~1.7%)Every day, Genius miners receive inflation rewards based on the amount of Genius and how long (in days) miners will lock up their Genius. (Bitcoin miners must buy expensive equipment and use lots of electricity.)Genius miners receive extra rewards from Genius mining stakes that liquidated, ended mining early, or ended mining late. (Bitcoin miners receive extra rewards from transaction fees.)Genius vs. HEX - BasicsThere are too many to list here!Genius has lower end-stake fees (up to 99.9% less gas fees)Genius has a collateral pool (\"Stability Pool\") that incentivizes traders to pump the open-market price of GENI.Simulated \"Compounding Interest\" without the need of an OA holding a majority of the supply, like with HEX.All HEX stakes can lose principal.  Genius \"Basic Miners\" can only lose interest when terminating early.Genius \"Advanced Miners\" earn more relative to HEX stakes.Genius users are continuously incentivized to Early-End their Stake to train the \"AI\" on scaling Early-End penalties, similar to Bitcoin's \"difficulty increases\" and unlike with HEX.Genius stakes can be always be auctioned and transferred to the community; HEX stakes cannot.  This means that HEX stakes which would lose all principal and interest end up (functionally) having zero utility to the end user.Genius's initial distribution will be fair, unlike HEX's distribution that benefitted mostly Bitcoin whales.Unlike with HEX, Genius's reward share rate *always* increases daily by a minimum amount, thus always increasing the value of stakes.HEX stakes are often on a revolving 7-day and 30-day stake length, thus constantly diluting long-term stakes and putting frequent selling pressure on the market price.  Genius does not allow this for the most rewarding stakes -- stakers must be vested long-term for the best rewards.Compared to Bitcoin and HEX, Genius solves many new problems introduced by both cryptocurrencies that are distasteful for investors, and Genius could be the best digital Store of Value yet.
