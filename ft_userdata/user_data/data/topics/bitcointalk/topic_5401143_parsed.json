Now most analysts have other questions, namely when will crypto winter end and how much more can prices fall? Bears have been reigning in the market for a month now, and it is felt in volatility, demand, and the number of new projects.",

We may have a good bounce back next year. in my opinion, it is hard to compare the market to a specific period in the past because what we have today is a lot different than in the previous years. but anyone can do their speculation here as we are free to do so. we can only give a good conclusion once a certain period is already over. and from that point, we can easily compare it with other years. but some people do want to know the pulse of the community, just to check what are the sentiments in this market.",

The fundamental of market is also following the fundamental of global. Everything gets even expensive. We should take the bearish market very positive. I mean if you have the last bear market, then you will know that a lot of solid projects goes down. Like Ethereum for example, went below $100 but in the bull run of 2021, it went as high as $4k. So the bear market is a perfect opportunity to all of us to fill our wallets.As for the cycle, so far, it holds true so nothing to complain about. As bitcoin halving happens every 4 year cycle, and as it is the catalyst for a a bull run, then for now we can conclude that after the halving in 2024, we might see another massive bull run. So this is the time to buy more and wait and hold.",

So, the risk is always there prepare, so self to manage it, if you were in the market/exchange, prepare to cut and stop lose also.",

Leverages as long and short and future markets are helpful to turn market around from bull to bear and bear to bull.Turning points appear and are confirmed if you see big moves and spikes in trading volume.Most likely, in the coming summer months, the bearish period in the cryptocurrency market will continue. In summer, we almost never see a good rise in prices. In addition, given that the bearish period began last year, it is very unlikely that prices will resume growth in the summer. Therefore, it is most likely not worth hoping for positive changes in this market until autumn. Lately, I'm not even in a hurry to look at price dynamics because of this. Of course, there are always exceptions. But the current unfavorable situation with the war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine and the subsequent tough sanctions that are only getting worse, the threat of starvation due to the blocking of grain in Ukrainian ports, all this does not contribute to the growth of the cryptocurrency market.",

It will happen again during the ups and downs of the market, and the only option we need to do with a bearish market is to buy and hold, but sometimes we also need to sell if the price is more than the ATH because dump will surely happen after the buy volume is much higher. We just need to learn from those past years and take advantage of the market.",

I can say that people have been prepared already, people had already learned about the past bear season, so I guess, they will respond to the situation differently and even more positive, unlike before were the majority are in the selling.Â  Even though the bear season will continue for quite longer, however, I'm not going to think about the worse impact on the market.",
