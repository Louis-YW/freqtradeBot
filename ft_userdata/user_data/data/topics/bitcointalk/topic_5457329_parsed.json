Here we do not have those, all lotteries as privately held and it would take a change in the government so the people could trust more public money on the administration. In the end, dreaming is free but playing the lottery is not.",

I’ve always said that lotteries are taxes on people who are bad at math, but more honestly they’re for people who have no hope of getting rich through investment knowledge or by building companies, this is their long shot hope at a different life.",

There is something really worthwhile about this. In this idea. The illusion that one single (or subsequent. every time it seems so) bet will allow the player to radically change his life without any effort. I would call it the dream of an idiot and a lazy person, which organizers of lotteries use.National lotteries (like any other) are not a tax on \"ignorance of mathematics\", but a \"tax for fools\" (google the history of the origin of lotteries) - a way to collect additional taxes to replenish the treasury.Never in my life would I agree to pay even such a small sum as $1 for the right to dream of the dear life of every taxpayer, as you put it. I would rather invest this amount in bitcoin - it would be more useful.",

Of what purpose is an additional IGR for most government where instead of public expenditure for capital projects, some end up on recurrent expenditure, payment of salaries and personal pockets while facilities that majority will benefit are left in abeyance. National lotteries in the past I heard benefited some but I don't know of the time will live now, is more like wishful thinking, dreams of possibilities and winning potential in your slip but never in your account.",

You got it all wrong bud. It's not just because they wanted to live the dream of becoming rich that they spend money that when you compound reach stupendous amounts that leads them to buy tickets and play the lottery, cause for all I know a ticket doesn't cost that much in the first place. It's all about the lack of financial discipline. For one, lotteries are poverty bait. You'd see more lottery kiosks and Lotto outlets near poverty-stricken areas compared to more developed ones, because people in there aren't that aware of the fact that these establishments are not made to offer them a chance at a great life but are there to literally bait them out of their last dollar. It's also all about their awareness. Some are aware of how small the odds of winning are but they're willing to put it on the line cause in their eyes, 2 dollars ain't that much, or \"the prospect of a million dollars outshines the thousands of dollars they will spend in the lottery over their lifetime.\" Either way, you pay your taxes or not, this type of legalized exploitation will persist because there's people who submit to it. If proper financial education is taught amongst these people these tactics wouldn't be as ubiquitous and effective as it is right now.",
