  "content": "Hi all, Anyone know how to access an old ETH wallet with a phrase that contains words not in the BIP39 wordlist? I assume the wallet was made with MIST years ago. Unsure if it has anything in it but worth checking. I am unable to access it and get an invalid error when trying to access it with MEW. Any help much appreciated.Cheers",
