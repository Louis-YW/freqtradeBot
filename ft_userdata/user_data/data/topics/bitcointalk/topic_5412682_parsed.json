Editing your post after launching it then it's gonna be okay if you put an effort because we are not perfect sometimes we encounter some minor issues like we want to reply 2-3 topics but we only quote 1 author which needed to be edited to became a good reply not a spam one. But if a user post like this (.....)(reserved) or any useless things to complete a weekly quota for the campaign then edit later on which not good as a habit.",

Regardless if people share a true experience or not, I appreciate some user taking their time to write and relate to someone else's reply in a thread out of all those users that seemingly just reply to the OP's title or just the first line of OP's thread content.It kinda gave me the Discord conversation vibes, although I do not use Discord that much that's related to crypto for personal reasons.Quote from: UserU on September 07, 2022, 03:24:32 PM~Feels good that someone would take time to show appreciation to your post, so I feel ya there!",

Definitely not a minor thing, but it's unique as far as I know.  I've often wondered why other discussion forums don't adopt that model, even if it's just for traffic.OP, I don't know what you consider \"minor\" but I appreciate the fact that bitcointalk has basically kept the same format since its inception.  And that's not because I'm opposed to anything new, or that I'm somehow stuck on things from the past 13 years.  It's because it reflects the fact that this is how the forum was when bitcoin was created, and it's also consistent with the nature of bitcoin, i.e., that its code isn't going to get changed by its dev team to make it worse--and that's happened with altcoins many times.  Sure, there have been bitcoin forks but those aren't bitcoin and never will be.",

I have been on forums which tried to recreate the signature and avatar design on the forum to build traffic, but discussions cannot be built on that, rather there needs to be an existing discussion platform, before that traffic can be monetized in any way.Also, majority of forums out there do not actually care for preventing spam, many have even encouraged spam here; remember Yobit",

However, it also doesn't change, whereas plenty of other forums change their software every other week, which ends up breaking things you might've added. I don't actually participate in other forums, only for question usually, and then I leave. So, Bitcointalk just does it right. Plus, while our community can seem divided at times, we do sort of pull together for the big things, for example the Bitcointalk Discord (which I should probably poke my head into), and things like the 10th anniversary, while these events do bring drama obviously with a community this big, it was generally a good atmosphere around them. Also, this goes for the first point, but the lack of white space. Do you know how much I hate white space? Seriously, why has modern demands made it harder for me to find content, and instead spend my time scrolling a lot more. I generally use older laptops or computers which don't use much energy due to travelling a fair amount, and therefore I have smaller screens, and lower resolutions so some sites can be an absolute nightmare to actually browse. Finally, lack of Javascript requirement. Bloody hate when sites inject javascript when it's not needed. Usually, the fancy things up. Function over fashion is the way to go.",
