      "body": "Let me start with  I'm watching this for sure! I've got a few remarks after looking at the schematics. I presume you've got the bm1366's connections from tracing the signals on a hash board and not from an 'official' repair guide? There are a few things that stand out to me and might be worth looking in to;- the mode_0(in) and mode_1 signals are connected together.  &&- the decoupling caps c4 & c16 are connected to to these pins  To me it seems as both pins are actually ground (vss). You can check for connection of these pins with the big ground pad to see if that is correct.- the mode_0 pin is left floating for mode0  Antminer has previously defined mode0 as mode_0 pin connected to ground.Changing the description of these pins and of the mode does not change the functionality of anything but seems more correct to me (if the 2 connected pins are actually vss).Did you find a way to log the communication with the hash boards or are you going the software disassembly route first?",

It’s a daunting project for sure. Have you heard of d-central? They are a miner repair shop in Canada that has been a big supporter of the bitaxe. They are selling partially assembled kits that sound like what you are looking for. https://d-central.tech/product/bitaxe-diy-kit/Currently d-central just has the BM1397-based bitaxe, but that is a great place to get started, IMO. I haven’t ordered from d-central myself, but I know of several people who have, and no complaints!",

I watched the 3 hour livestream video on YT when they assemblied the v2.2 a few days ago! Would wait for Kit with the BM1366 chip instead of buying one of the S17 chip. But still curious if its possible to use boards with the possibility of using more chips.",

There are a couple designs in the works that I know about with both BM1397 and BM1366.

Those (like me) who are new to chip soldering will always have the basic version to get the hang of it and build their experience.Having an open source multi-chips board would be great, and I actively support this idea!",

It doesn't necessarily have to be a business and might be easier. Atleast for the individual and personal design. If you are satisfied with their prints you are good to go!

If you got some free time you can invest it in building it on ur own. Way more fun and you would save more than 100$.

If you want more than one, and you have the desire (motivation + skills ) and the time to build them yourself, it would probably be much more cost-effective to buy the tools needed to assemble your own ones than buying them like the link you shared.Buying equipment, if you don't already have it, would be expensive for a single Bitaxe, but that depends on who it's for.
