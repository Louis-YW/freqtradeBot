Before your account can be closed, you’ll need to withdraw your crypto funds to an external wallet and your cash funds to a bank account associated with your Coinbase account. If you are currently enrolled in USD Coin rewards, you may want to wait up to 40 days before withdrawing funds to ensure you have received all eligible reward payouts. You will not be able to access these funds after account closure. Please take precautions when transferring cryptocurrency to an external wallet as transfers outside of Coinbase are irreversible. Please also be sure to delete any external references to cryptocurrency addresses generated by Coinbase, as funds sent to those addresses will not be accessible once the account is closed. If you have any questions you may visit https://support.coinbase.com.No reason why, nothing. Is it common? Anyone here also dumped by Coinbase just like that?",

Move your funds to your self custody wallet and own your keys.",

To put it simply, Coinbase might consider OP accounts to have some risk if they continue to allow him to use their exchange, whatever that is. I'd not stress too much and simply move on if that were the case OP, try to find other exchanges or start using DEX to avoid being ditched by an exchange again. Do correct me if I'm wrong.",

I don't know anything about this crypto exchange, and i've never heard about them before now, i believe it is the same for many members here. Most centralized exchanges have very bad customer support, and i believe this exchange you are shilling is not different; but most importantly, the domino effect from centralized exchanges and services collapsing last year is still affecting the market and i don't think it is wise for people to even use exchanges that are not well known.",

Huh, that is weird, because he doesn't have any referral link or anything, and MEXC is (as far as I know) a legitimate exchange, not some fly-by-night thing.  They've been around for a while and I haven't seen many complaints about them on the forum.  Damn newbies, ya know?And I guess I missed this thread when it was started, but what I'll tell OP is that Coinbase did exactly what they did to him back in 2015/16 (can't remember exactly when).  It was because of a stupid error I made with a checking account I had linked that I closed but never unlinked from Coinbase.  They didn't contact me, didn't try to figure out a way to keep me as a customer, just closed my account.  I can't stand them, even if they are one of the most legitimate exchanges out there.",
