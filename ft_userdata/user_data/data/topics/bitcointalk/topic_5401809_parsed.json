From my analysis it really came down to two companies BitPay and CoinGate. Do any of you have any personal experience with either of them? Is there something that one should know before going into partnerships with any of these gateways?",

Is there something that one should know before going into partnerships with any of these gateways? These are the main things I can think of:- CoinGate accepts more cryptocurrencies (~80) compared to BitPay (~10).- BitPay is way more strict. Your customers might find themselves obliged to create an account with BitPay and verify their identity and for this reason, I wouldn't recommend using them. They don't offer anything that other competitors don't have.",

There are whole communities online dedicated to not using BitPay, such as https://debitpay.directory/anti-bitcoin/. I for one will flat out refuse to shop with any merchant or site which uses BitPay, and I'm not the only one - https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kxhxv7/warning_bitpay_is_now_forcing_every_user_to_both/.If CoinGate is an option for you, then use them over BitPay absolutely. I would echo what Pmalek has said above though, that a self hosted BTCPay server is safer and cheaper for you and more private for you and your customers. The downside is that it does not offer instant fiat conversion built in, if that is something you are interested in, although there are solutions currently in development (https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Transmuter/).",

So I wouldn't vouch for Bitpay. They aren't user-friendly really and quite strict with a high fee. Better go with Coingate if no more options. Also, Coinpayments looks not great to me due to country restrictions. Better avoid centralized wallet if possible. That would be great if you can go with BTCPayserver.",

Their payment solution couldn't be worse). Coinpayments webhook and API are robust, I remember using it on a website with 100+ concurrent users without facing any downtime or any kind of disruption from their side. If you are going to implement a withdrawal option too, then follow their mass withdrawal method. or else your customers will be paying huge fees on each BTC withdrawal. coinpayments is a perfect site for accepting crypto payments imo",
