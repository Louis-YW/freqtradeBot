Your channel looks quite empty at the moment and there's a lot of spam on telegram as it is.Quote from: BitMaxz on October 22, 2022, 11:58:09 PMIn the future, you will ask for money why?Obviously, why would you share a free signal? if you are an experienced trader why not make money with your skill? A lot of signallers offer free and paid versions of their service, it just seems to be a done thing (some.have more accuracy on their free ones and some have more accuracy on paid ones, the difference is normally the frequency. I may be guilty of using free (and some paid for) channels as a good way to track volatility and possible moves (similar to how I'd use an indicator like the rsi). Quote from: BitMaxz on October 22, 2022, 11:58:09 PMIf you are an experienced trader why not become a trade instructor/teacher and offer some courses on udemy?There's probably a lot of these channels even though a lot of information is freely available on the Internet.",

Have a few good small trades and then decide to pump some small cap alt coin. This will lead to some crazy 2x-10x moves but the ones to buy last will be the ones holding the bag.

If you are confident in your skills and ability to generate profits, why not focus on making money? With 40% profit per trade, I think every day you only need to make 1 or 2 trades and you have enough money to spend and get rich quick without any extra work. You don't have to roam the forum to entice other people to your group to collect monthly money.",

Even BTC price don't bother our signals much becouse we use our own capital to buy in large orders before long signal we always have large USD reserves ready and when we short then we always will have huge same coin reservers ready to make large sell orders. And we also do TA analysys and checking the charts to make sure we gona have best entry points to the trade.",

But the question is your signals are never enough for your team to earn money in trading that is why you are encouraging people to join your group and pay a few bucks in the future. Because if you believe in yourselves and really an experienced trader, I don't think you will do this. In fact, trading alone especially if you are truly a good trader will earn a lot of money but just a surprise that this happens to you. I just need some clarification. Yes you can trade alone sure but If signals are so good its also good to sell signals and help others to make money.If you feel guilty of getting Nice profits only for bucs a month you can donate back to us some money to keep us even more motivated  But now guys let's focus on trading and see some results payment part not so important now we can discuss later about payment for Vip members right now let me show you the results",

Well, I'm not saying this as a scam but usually many signal group ended up with the same faith. Trade at your own risk, and better not to rely on any signal group, that's too risky in long term because in trading you need to spend more time to analyze not to read any signal from unknown individual.",
