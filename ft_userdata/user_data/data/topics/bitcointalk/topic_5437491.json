Are there any reliable crypto wallet that supports the importation of 18 seed phrases? You can just insert those 18 words in https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ and it will generate all possible addresses for you.But be careful!!Download and run offline.There are many derivation paths where your coins might be.Someone may be watching your computer.Alternatively, you can follow this guide to try to import the master key into electrumQuoteCopy the Account Extended Private KeyGo to Electrum and then File -> New/Restore -> Standard wallet -> Use a master keyhttps://coinomi.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/29000009715-how-to-import-a-coinomi-seed-into-electrum-",

      "body": "The most widely used standard for seed phrases is BIP39, which defines 12 to 24 words.Some wallets may choose to use a smaller number of seed words for convenience or to simplify the backup process, while others may use a larger number for added security.If you have a wallet with 18 seed phrases, it may not be supported by some popular mobile wallets, but there are alternatives that support 18 words, such as Electrum or Mycelium also you can try Atomic Wallet or Ledger Live, which both support BIP44 standard",

      "body": "As suggested above you can use electrum for importing your 18 word seed phrase. But take note that electrum will work for you only if that seed phrase is BIP39. Even if that's a BIP39 seed phrase, you also need to know the derivation path unless your wallet has been generated on a common derivation path. Otherwise, electrum will generate different addresses. I wonder what wallet you are talking about.",

Are there any reliable crypto wallet that supports the importation of 18 seed phrases? First you need to know what was the wallet or website you used to create seed with 18 words, and format (BIP39 or electrum) you used to do it, and maybe even derivation path for addresses.If I remember correctly several hardware wallets are supporting 12, 18 and 24 seed words and Coinomi software wallet was also supporting 18 seed words.I would first try using iancoleman website but remember to do it only offline, not connected to internet.",

I think it is more likely that it is an old blockchain.info recovery phrase (which is not BIP-39, BTW).I don't know of any wallet app that creates an 18-word BIP-39 phrase, but there might be one. (If so, then why not just use the original wallet app?)",

Such a bad experience at the time, I knew I did something wrong on the website or probably through airdrops because that was why I created those wallet addresses.",
