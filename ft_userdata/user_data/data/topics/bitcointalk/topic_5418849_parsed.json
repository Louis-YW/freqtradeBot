The issue with paper wallets is they're no longer considered the best way to backup a wallet to paper - bip39 came out which now lets you represent multiple private keys with a phrase made up of 12 words which is much harder to deface and become unusable as there's a checksum included and if a letter in a word fails or is misprinted, you can likely still make out what the word is - and if you can't it doesn't take long to bruteforce it.There might still be people using them and places they can be created (like bitaddress.org).",

It's also available on GitHub: https://github.com/coinables/segwitaddressIf you want to create a customized Bitcoin address, you can also create a Vanity Address but it won't have any nice design like Bitaddress for example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25804.0 (Vanitygen) / https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5112311.0 (Vanitysearch)",

Lammasu kiosks had that at least a few years ago the same offer, just print it with no required address but I don't know if they still offer it, and you will still need KYC for any ATM for larger sums.As for direct buying a $ 50/100 fixed voucher with BTC from a shop I don't know if there is something like this still available anywhere, there was one such initiative in France where you could buy those vouchers at any tobacco shop but it went bust.",

Those were likely generated already with some btc on it and up for sale. Today, you're not going to see them usually because it can be done by anyone in private unlike before that only a few enthusiasts that you can see elsewhere.As said, it's available in some bitcoin ATMs but if you don't like that because they will charge you with fee which is the common thing about them.",
