If you want to make use of a centralised exchange like Binance, instead of using the direct card funding option that your bank is placing a limit on, you can use the P2P option, and you can buy with the amount that you need, transfer it to the merchant, and get your coin released back to you, which you can withdraw immediately after you finish your purchase back to your noncustodial wallet.",

There's also the possibility of using Paypal but there's scammers out there that would do some shady thing so it's not a good idea, maybe even as a last resort. Take your chances on a centralized exchange, they're reliable if decentralized exchange isn't an option for you, you don't store your bitcoins there anyway so it's a good place for you to do your P2P trade, I recommend Binance if you want to do it there, I trust them as an exchange as I've been doing some of my P2P trades there and so far, I haven't had any problems with them over those years that I'm using them even though they're banned in my country, I would still use them because they're just that good to me.",

Though I am not from UK, but I guess the method that I will say you works in almost all the nations. I am talking about using the P2P methods. Buy bitcoins through the P2P methods directly from the peers. In this manner no bank can trace about the crypto transactions. You can do P2P deals at Paxful. I have previously bought Bitcoins there, and it worked for me absolutely without any problem.",

If the government doesn't like bitcoin, no bank will dare to go against the government's will. Just like the country I live in, no banks accept bitcoin and if they find out we are using a bank account to make bitcoin-related purchases, they will freeze the account ours. But that won't stop us from getting into bitcoin, and there will always be a way for us to buy bitcoin with a bank account. I can't offer any ideas as I don't understand the actual problems the OP is facing nor the specific regulations of banks in the UK. But I believe there will always be a way for us to circumvent the law to buy bitcoin even though it will be a bit more complicated.",
