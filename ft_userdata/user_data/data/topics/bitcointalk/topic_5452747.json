Someone can visit periodically.Scarce.city and Plebian market https://plebeian.market/  are the only two I know of. Pleb market allows for selling your services as well. Just about anything for bitcoin really using lightning. It's a little glitchy at times but it will get better. The guys running it are awesome. Scarecity is cool too just a little different and more main stream right now. Pleb market is up and coming and getting better and better with time and development. But unless someone else can chime in. Those are the only two I'm aware of at the moment.",
