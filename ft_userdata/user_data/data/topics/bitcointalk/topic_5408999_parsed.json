  "content": "so recently I saw a news circling around the internet regarding someone from the US winning the lottery jackpot worth $1.28Billion, but then several days later, I saw this article. apparently the winner of the Lotto jackpot will only get $433.7M after the total amount of winnings is taxed. it's ridiculous how the government got more money from the lotto jackpot than the actual winner. I know that $433.7 million is still a lot of money but it is still disheartening how $800 million was taken away due to tax.https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2022/07/30/winning-128-billion-lottery-ticket--gets-4337-million-after-tax/?sh=5582ea32028d",

Lottery just don’t include the word tax free to make the jackpot prize huge but  this is the reality on the US. The winner still got the huge part and he will still pay that tax if the lottery company give the whole prize because IRS will surely questioned the sudden increase of that person money.",

It seems to me you just don’t know them.It is not surprising to lose most of your gambling profits especially when the amount is as high as a billion goddamn dollars. That’s treated as income and taxed like how they tax income. Since they tax the rich more and the poor less and a person that has a billion mother fucking dollars income is definitely rich, of course they will tax the shit out of him.Being rich aint easy.",

      "body": "Unfortunately, that's how taxation works on USA. Even with the massive amount that the person won on the lottery, he will never receive the full amount and most of it will be on state and federal taxes. Also, as much as I know the winner will have a choice whether to receive his winnings on one lump sum payment which will be much lower but he will receive it on one payment or it will be on a 15 year contract where he will receive a much higher winnings but it will be paid yearly.",

Thank you for additional information about the bracket system on tax.This is the consequence of getting the wealth in shortcut, The winner will charge huge tax in short cut, It looks like that he was being ripped off but this is what actually happening on rich people that paying tax for there huge income.",

      "body": "Nowadays you have to pay tax on gambling winnings everywhere. It is only calculated very crookedly, because it is per month I read somewhere. If you would win $10,000 in March then you would have to pay 28% tax and if you would lose $9,000 in April you would think you would have $1,000 net, But you can't report the losses to the government so keep the net you then 10,000 - 2800 - 9000=-1800A loss of 1800$ when you would actually be 1000$ in profit. There are also a lot of players who choose not to declare taxes, but then you have to be able to justify your money somewhere of course. This differs per country, however. Isn't there also a distinction between online gambling sites and a land-based casino?",

The system in America regarding tax and in fact many other aspects favours the less wealthy because they have a system that deduct more from the rich or money that is coming as income. I think that kind of taxing could be progressive taxing where tax is based on income. Well the winner still has something left, he should understand this before the winning.",
