You see, for only this you've created a ton of jobs, if 3000 people will be reading this, you would need at least 1000 pigeons, a ton of paper and ink, and then think of us replying! We would need millions of workers.Or a better idea, let's have all the oil in the world transported by camels. At 100 million barrels a day and considering a round trip of 30 days just imagine how many jobs would be created to take care of 3 billion camels, not even mentioning the wood and carpenters needed for another 1 million replicas of Noah's ark.We had 1 million telephone operators in the 50s in the US alone, think of all the lamplighters that had to quit their job, and the ridiculous examples can continue over and over. Europe currently needs millions of workers and not all of them are skilled, you still need tons of mechanics, construction workers, butchers,  retail personnel, cleaning, and so on and on.But more important, is that you again spy100?",

There's no denying that. I believe that jobs are lost because of technologies. However, on the other hand-- and this is basically to look at the larger picture-- jobs are also created because of technologies. Where there used to be manual laborers, there are now machine operators, technicians, engineers, IT staff, and others. And those machines that replaced human labor are also designed and manufactured partly by humans. Let us take, for example, a farm. Before, farmers manually tilled the land. With the invention of farming machines, operators take over. But those machines they operate like tractors, harvesters, and others are also produced partly by human labor, and they're moved from one country to another, which also requires human workers, and are then sold by machine stores which have staff and other human workers.",

      "body": "I have seen several materials and arguments surrounding this topic, enough to make up my mind about that. In short, there was a huge anti-automation movement since the beginning of industrialization, basically. People were also talking how jobs will disappear and people will be left with nothing. Some jobs did disappear, but you know what happened? Many new jobs appeared because of technological advancements, new demand was created basically out of thin air. Demand not only for programmers, but digital marketing workers, web designers, moderators, SMM workers, and then also content creators on many online platforms. So things do not change for worse with automatization overall. They can hit some more than others, which is why social care must be in place to help those that lose their jobs to adapt. But it can also help out many people to find new jobs that didn't exist before, and be passionate about something like this.Eventually, I think countries should move to universal basic income on the surplus that's created because maintaining machines is cheaper than paying people to do those jobs. And people should move to jobs which can't be done my machines in an undeniably better way.",
