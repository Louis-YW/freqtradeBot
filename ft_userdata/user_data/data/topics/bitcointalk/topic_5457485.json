Enter MicrovisionChain, a cutting-edge blockchain that has been designed to solve the “blockchain trilemma” by leveraging the bitcoin UTXO model. And with Metalet Wallet, the first wallet extension based on this new blockchain, users can experience the many benefits of this emerging technology.The UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model is an essential component of the Bitcoin blockchain technology. This system is designed to manage financial transactions more securely and efficiently than other traditional account-based approaches. The UTXO model works by maintaining a detailed record of all spent and unspent financial transactions on the blockchain network. Each individual transaction is recorded on a separate UTXO entry, enabling Bitcoin users to transact more flexibly, securely, and privately.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/0*BgmOhBiH2Y0dsKNgAdvantages of Metalet Wallethttps://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*IwIdcrm6mGDZZyF2AFys0g.pngUTXO Model Support:One of the major benefits of Metalet Wallet is its support for UTXO model wallets.

Meaning that you hold the private keys and all the funds, how do you lower the fee for bitcoin transactions? By offering a token instead of bitcoin like second layer/ LN?Security wise, I wouldn't touch a third party centralized wallet, after all we are supposed to be our own bank and manager, otherwise why even move our funds from the hands of governments to the hands of total strangers? At least with governments you are ensured they don't run with your money.!",

The UTXO model has become increasingly popular as it provides a robust and efficient way of handling transactions on the blockchain.Supporting of \"UTXO model\" is a weird selling point since for the wallet to be compatible with the Bitcoin protocol, it anyway should closely follow specifications describing blockchain data types. In other words, you can't create a client that changes rules imposed by the server.

This ensures that user data and digital assets are kept safe and secure.I don't quite understand: transactions created by your wallet cannot be both transparent and encrypted; protection of transactions doesn't make sense on the wallet's layer, it is the blockchain that usually ensures transactions are secure and immutable. And what user data are you talking about? What information do you collect besides that is needed for interactions with the blockchain?QuoteLow Transaction Fees and Speedy Zero ConfirmationsWhile low transaction fees and speedy zero confirmations are often attributed to the underlying blockchain technology, Metalet Wallet takes this further by offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows for seamless and hassle-free transactions. All transactions can be conducted quickly and with ease, ensuring that users can access their digital assets or complete transactions without delay.Accepting zero confirmation transactions may be dangerous, especially for highly centralized altcoin blockchains with low hashrate.   Hiding this fact behind user-friendly interfaces is a path toward disaster, hacks, and losses of funds.Quote from: digaran on June 25, 2023, 09:29:53 PMNot open source?
