  "content": "Hi community - Are we FOR modifying post quote authors to create false narratives?https://web.archive.org/web/20230925214823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5464289.msg62899059#msg62899059JollyGood modified Don Pedro Dinero's post quote to instead have me as the author...this would have been a seriously huge contradiction if I made this post, and not don.. Not the case though. Post below:Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on August 25, 2023, 02:38:21 PMWell, I was coming here to say that I also support cryptofrka's application, as I understand that he is a person who spends a lot of time in the gambling section and can help distribute merit to quality posts that often get buried between rubbish pages. But I'm also surprised that BenCodie is going as a moral defender here, I don't want to get too long with this because is kind of OT, but if you say this:Quote from: BenCodie on August 25, 2023, 01:17:46 PMAs for the question if gambling is unethical - it undoubtedly is. What you need to do is to stop wearing a gambling ad on your signature, especially because you get paid for it. I don't know where you learned ethics, but where I'm from someone who lets himself be bought to advertise something he thinks is wrong is not only behaving in a morally wrong way, he is also a hypocrite. JollyGood proceeded to modify Don Pedro Dinero's post, and make it as if I had said that:Quote from: JollyGood on September 25, 2023, 10:46:03 AMQuote from: BenCodie on August 25, 2023, 03:00:07 PMWhat you need to do is to stop wearing a gambling ad on your signature, especially because you get paid for it. I don't know where you learned ethics, but where I'm from someone who lets himself be bought to advertise something he thinks is wrong is not only behaving in a morally wrong way, he is also a hypocrite. Have you all read the same thing I did? What a stunning way for this deranged person to contradict himself.Quote from: BenCodie on August 25, 2023, 03:00:07 PMAll of you go back to the gambling board where you all came from and belong. If you can't read and understand a high IQ post, don't respond to it with bs personal attacks about my signature. I'm not a hypocrite for taking opportunity when it's available. And just because I wear a signature, thsn doesn't mean that should be a main focus to my valid opinion on a topic.All of you have a common theme - low IQ.There you have it ladies and gentlemen of this wonderful forum our ours. According to this member, we all have low IQ and as for him he does not mind outing himself as a hypocrite by applying to join signature campaigns (which he is convinced are promoting scams) just be because he does not want to miss the opportunity to earn some BTC. You can check the way back machine to see proof, and the thread (until JollyFraud edits or removes his post).Now I'll wait for complaints about another JG thread (aside from the fact it's valid) and that JollyGood apparently modified the quote author= code from Don Pedro Dinero to BenCodie by accident or to troll.",

And from what I've read about you, I'm inclined to think that you only act this way because you don't have the ability to use feedback as a tool for retaliation, which is why you're spamming this section.Which part of my thread is nonsense?Click the quote links, you can jump straight to where JollyGood has modified quotes. I think this is a serious issue. If I quote you like this: Quote from: twiki on September 26, 2023, 01:20:13 AMI am a serial murdererAnd then added commentary like...\"Oh no, everyone, twiki has admitted he is a serial murderer!\"And people believed it because of that quoteAnd I get away with it without any form of repercussionWould that not display a serious problem within the community and the forum?...and also, is that not god-like power? Why does JollyGood deserve that kind of power?I am sure if I or anyone dared to modify anyone else's quotes in the forum for malicious purposes like JG, AND dare to add slandering commentary, we'd be digitally slapped into the oblivion! For some reason, no slapping for JG though.Of course this is an extreme exaggeration to highlight the point.Am I sick of responding to the garbage thrown my way? Of course. Will I stop addressing and highlighting when it's actually a problem that could effect more people than just myself? No, I won't. If JollyGood makes a habit of modifying quotes in attempt to mislabel other members and get away with it, that is a big problem and could lead to completely inaccurate depictions of other members in the forum, and falsification of what they have never actually said.I find it interesting that no one of importance has chimed into such an obvious act of falsification that any other member would otherwise may have been banished or banned for....maybe because this is obviously untrustworthy behaviour, but everyone either loves JG, or, no one wants to feel his wraith if they try to put him in his place.Patiently waiting for opinions on what has happened here, or someone to tell this nutjob JG that he is clearly crossing lines now, after top toeing over them for so long with so many people.Otherwise, let's all just go around and start making posts with fake quotes if that is allowed, I'm sure the forum and its integrity will be just fine as a result!

Your response proves the bbcode error which is why it doesn't matter much. Formatting comes after quoting, if it's a long post. Errors like mine can only happen to formatted posts. Sometimes on mobile that process goes wrong. However, JollyGood did not misquote. He intentionally modified the quote author. As he responded as if I were the one who made Don Pedro Dinero's post. It's one thing misquoting due to broken code, it's another to modify its content. When you misquote due to broken code, you still reply to the same thing, a third party can make sense of the mistake. If this was not the case, FatFork could not have pointed out my broken quote as he had. This is not the case for JollyGood though. If you go through his post history, the unknowing eye would read the post normally and the content would seem untampered with as JollyGood is apparently trusted, and because it's a finely formatted post, the BBCode integrity is 99%, the 1% being the incorrect quote author, changed from Don Pedro Dinero to BenCodie in one instance only, What does this 1% do to post integrity if further content stems from that one modification? What do I mean by \"further content\"?QuoteHave you all read the same thing I did? What a stunning way for this deranged person to contradict himselfAround 5% of the entire post is now fictional. It is not just some harmless piece of fiction like \"the sky is red\", this fictional piece involves reputation of a community member. To the unknowing eye, it claims and proves (proves, if I actually made the post) that I am deranged, that I contradict myself, it tarnishes my reputation quite significantly as the post ages and as more people read and believe JollyGood's post...All achieved just by changing \"Don Pedro Dinero\" to \"BenCodie\", then replying as if BenCodie made \"Don Pedro Dinero\"'s post.An accident is not what JollyGood has done here. He has replied to another users post as if it were myself who made the post. This is not something that can be accidentally done with code. It can only be done intentionally. It is not possible for JG to have accidentally misformatted the post. If you read the archived post in full, you will see that JollyGood was not replying to Don Pedro Dinero and accidentally quot me. In fact, he quoted Don't Pedro Dinero, made me the author of Don Pedro Dinero's post, and replied to it as if I had made Don Pedro Dinero's post. This is proven by what he said right after the misquoted post:QuoteHave you all read the same thing I did? What a stunning way for this deranged person to contradict himselfIf I had made the post that Don Pedro Dinero had made, then indeed, I would be deranged and JollyGood would be right, what he quoted looks like I am deranged and that I've stunningly contradicted myself. He even almost convinced me, almost. For those who aren't me, they would have (and still) believe the post is 100% factual as JollyGood is a trusted figure and, unless someone points out an error, majority of his posts will come across as factual by default.I am surprised no one has gone and actually looked into the posts or understands the problem being highlighted. It is a serious one. If this kind of thing is allowed, this completely damages the integrity of the quote system. I hope that this explanation open some eyes.",

I have my belief based on JollyGood's pattern of conduct. You have yours based on your basis. Between us, let's leave it at that, shall we?

Another one I found today: in the quote, it looks like larry_vw_1955 is quoting me but the words are from naikturun.  Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on October 07, 2023, 04:10:07 AMQuote from: Don Pedro Dinero on October 07, 2023, 01:42:46 AMSo why is the dollar price against other currencies still said to be stable, even strengthening in several other currencies, for example in my country the USD has strengthened by almost 10% from the beginning of this year until now.Does this indicate that all countries are also doing the same thing as America is doing?Not necessarily. I think more likely what it might mean is that people trust the USA for some reason. No matter how misplaced that confidence and sense of trust might be. We're in a house of cards in reality which is likely to fall down at any time!Yet another mistake with no malicious intent.",
