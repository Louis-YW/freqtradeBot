  "content": "Ones mindset towards your goals may help to determine one's success. Someone with a growth mindset has a great potential to be successful in life. Has he/she will views intelligence, abilities, and talents as learnable and capable of improvement through effort while a fixed mindset views those same traits as inherently stable and unchangeable over time. The below picture will challenge your mindset and also help you determine which mindset you have.Those who adopt a growth mindset are more likely to:ðŸ‘‰Embrace lifelong learningðŸ‘‰Believe intelligence can be improvedðŸ‘‰Put in more effort to learnðŸ‘‰Believe effort leads to masteryðŸ‘‰Believe failures are just temporary setbacksðŸ‘‰View feedback as a source of informationðŸ‘‰Willingly embraces challengesðŸ‘‰View othersâ€™ success as a source of inspirationðŸ‘‰View feedback as an opportunity to learnWhile those who adopt a fixed mindset are more likely to:ðŸ‘‰Believe intelligence and talent are staticðŸ‘‰Avoid challenges to avoid failureðŸ‘‰Ignore feedback from othersðŸ‘‰Feel threatened by the success of othersðŸ‘‰Hide flaws so as not to be judged by othersðŸ‘‰Believe putting in effort is worthlessðŸ‘‰View feedback as personal criticismðŸ‘‰Give up easilyCan a personâ€™s mindset change?Just as someone can grow and develop their intellect, a person is also capable of changing brain functions and their thinking patterns. Therefore, one's mindset can be changed.How to develop a growth mindsetðŸ§ ðŸ§ Realize that, scientifically, you can improveOne of the most direct methods of fostering a growth mindset is by understanding our brains are built to grow and learn. By challenging yourself with new experiences, you can form or strengthen neural connections to â€˜rewireâ€™ your brain which, in turn, can make you smarter. ðŸ§ ðŸ§ Remove the â€˜fixed mindsetâ€™ inner voiceMany people have a negative inner voice that acts against a growth mindset. Try to flip thoughts such as â€˜I canâ€™t do thisâ€™, to â€˜I can do this if I keep practicingâ€™ to nurture a growth mindset.ðŸ§ ðŸ§ Reward the processAlthough society often rewards those who achieve excellent outcomes, this can work against a growth mindset. Instead, reward the process and the effort exerted.ðŸ§ ðŸ§ Get feedbackTry and seek feedback on your work. When students are provided with progressive feedback about what they did well and where they can improve, it creates motivation to keep going. Feedback is also associated with a pleasurable dopamine response and enhances a growth mindset.ðŸ§ ðŸ§ Get out of your comfort zoneBeing brave enough to leave your comfort zone can help foster a growth mindset. When faced with a challenge, try to choose the harder option that will allow you to grow.ðŸ§ ðŸ§ Accept failure as part of the processFailure, setbacks, and initial confusion are all part of the learning process! When trying something new,see occasional â€˜failuresâ€™ as positive learning opportunitiesâ€”try to enjoy the discovery process along the way. Reference: https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindsetCONCLUSIONSince, ones mindset can be changed, it's better for one to develop a growth mindset towards all one's activities in life to achieve a great result. Develop a growth mindset toward all your goals today to improve on your business, studies, etc.",

BUTBUT.. usually requires a trigger event to force the switchtwo examples1. many people get fixated on a particular career path, they go through the college/uni route to specialise in it and then prioritise only looking for a career in that subject or fall flat doing a min wage non skill job. they dont try to learn other talents whilst in the career/uni to offer them skilled opportunity in another subjects. instead they wait until they fall flat doing minimum wage job to trigger them to retrain2. many people do the path of number 1. but instead of losing their job they meet someone. get married and its the marriage and kids that trigger them to want to do night classes to enhance their qualification to get into managerial/senior positions in or outside their industryhardly any \"fixed mindset\" people below middle age or trigger events just wakes up someday and decides to better their life, whilst in their career they were working on for the last X yearsbut yes.. the OP advice is truethere is nothing physically/scientifically stopping you learning more then you already know. even google can supply you with free information. there are free courses and learning material, e-books.instead of defeating yourself saying \"i cant do this within X time\" remember you have many many many decades to live.. fit it in your schedule. time is not an excuse, there is plenty of iti see it on this forum. trolls that for years talk all the time on this forum about their version of events of bitcoin politics because they learned it from other trolls they befriended. and years later they have not learned the actual bitcoin data/code that backs up a true series of events. however they pretend they dont have time to learn the code or do research. they should realise if they have time to be on the forum for years. they have time to take a break away from the forum, learn real things about bitcoin and they can come back a better person for it.",

      "body": "Growth mindset is hard to achieve. Humans tend to look for comfort and stick with it until something happens. No one really wants to get out of their comfort zones until they are forced by an event or a difficult situation. Rarely have I ever encountered a person who wants to change something and actually do something about it, though it is still possible with the right approach and the right support.Franky1 mentioned career paths and it is one of the prime examples of this. We tend to specialize in something until it occurs to us that we no longer want it or there are other high-paying jobs that we 'might' get a liking to. Economic conditions force people to change jobs and grow, but if the economy is good and our salaries still fulfill our expenses, I guess no one will have to hop jobs and companies every now and then.",

Rarely have I ever encountered a person who wants to change something and actually do something about it, though it is still possible with the right approach and the right support.I do not think that it is that hard to achieve a growth mindset. Â Once the person is open-minded, it is easier for him to develop a growth mindset. Â I believe a growth mindset is a mindset that is focused on adaptation to the situation and adoption of new information and trends. Â If one knows how to adapt and adopt methods in every situation, this person can be said to have a growth mindset.It is established that people are willing to leave their comfort in exchange for high-paying services/jobs. Â This is the reason why there are lots of OFWs and new entrepreneurs out there. Â People just don't venture on the world that is unsure of the result. Â And those who are skipping opportunities because of the said comfort are just lazy people who don't want to work.",

There are some conditions that are not favorable to a particular goals or vision a person is trying to attain. It takes a person with a growth mindset in the other sense, a person whose mindset is somehow dynamic, to be able to accomplish that goal. Some persons may quit on the process, while some will tyr but wil not achieve it. However, growth mindset can be learnt or practiced. And the best way to learn a growth mindset is but reading intelligent books that points out real fact of life towards ones vision. There are many reputable AuthorsÂ  that their books could help you build a growth mindset. I could remember a book i read. It was written in the 80's.

The simplest question when I relate this to one of the paths to success is, how can someone be successful, while taking risks is not willing? for me it is something contradictory. Especially if someone who does not want to get out of their comfort zone and does not want to explore the vast outside world.

I think the common trait of people with growth mindsets is they always look for challenges and problems to solve.Usually people who are like that or mean those who have a stagnant mindset are trapped in a state or comfort zone where they are happy and calm with their circumstances that never change. I have one friend who we can make an object in this discussion, where his daily life is just playing games and lying down, no other activities and never asking or looking for a job that can provide himself with income, but because his parents are people who can be said to be quite capable of meeting the needs of the family, every day he only depends on his parents for his needs such as snacks or buying anything, even though on the other hand his age is no longer young, namely he has reached the age of 24, which should be for young people of that age they should be looking for a lot of insight and work to determine their future, and I say this is a person who is really stuck in a comfort zone.As you said that such people do not have an advanced or developed mindset, they only think and assume \"waiting for good fortune to come by itself without any effort\", yes it is true and it is people who are afraid to take risks and also do not want to try new things that basically have the possibility to change their life circumstances. Basically it is true that failure will always be a situation that everyone does not want, but what's wrong with trying? after all, many also succeed and get a better life with the success he achieved from the results of his hard work that never gave up. On the other hand, people will not care about your situation and that means only you can change your life. Motivation is just an encouragement and if there is no action at all then it is the same as nonsense, life is hard and bitter, so if you want to improve and adjust your standard of living to the situation then only you can do it, so change your mindset from now on before you are late and regret it.",

I've always believed that there's so much a person can do to improve that the genetic and/or early development side of things should be taken less seriously. Of course, there are mental disabilities which are uncurable, so some people are unable to catch up with peers in such cases, but that's a small minority.But I'm not sure about the overall setup. A person with a growth mindset can struggle with anxiety and this find it difficult to embrace challenges. A person with a fixed mindset can believe that their IQ is very high and they have innate talent, so they are bound to achieve things in life. In practice, it might give them a lot of confidence and motivation.",
