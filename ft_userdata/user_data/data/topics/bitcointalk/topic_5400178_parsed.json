You're not gonna get tagged for someone copying you POA. All of these connected accounts have other issues besides a copied POA. Wallets connected, usernames same on social medias when user applies with different accounts, as well as other things. Don't be greedy. Users get caught being greedy.",

Apart from just the posted POA, there are other patterns that are looked into by DT members. So you shouldn't worry about your account getting tagged because some bounty hunter mistakenly or maliciously copied your POA.Take an example of this case, there is a lot of compelling evidence showing that the person is cheating bounties using so many accounts",

This usually goes for the username, but I it may work with address(es), twitter name or such. This way you can find out very quick if others impersonate you (willingly or by mistake) and you can react in an appropriate manner, complaining ASAP about that, hence keeping your name clean.",

One member can give you negative trust for one reason or another, but if several members do this, you only have to prove the opposite of what they say, and if you succeed in proving this, you will get positive trust higher than the negative, which required to participate in signature campaigns.So you don't have to worry about such things, as long as you don't break the rules, follow the campaign terms, you won't have a problem.As for how to prove the opposite, it depends on the evidence presented against you. Mostly, copying what you do is not enough to link accounts unless it is supported by other evidence such as writing style, sending coins between addresses, using the same social media, publishing the same content using Several accounts and personal recognition.",

They could use a newbie account to post of POA with the same telegram address and username that I have used in other bounty campaigns.cases like this can be proven in another way, if a beginner does it.1. What if the rookie is already working on another bounty and he receives a token with the same address as Alt 1,2&3, a different campaign, before they are caught cheating in the same bounty, Whether such a case can be said Alt, or brother, falsified or indisputable.Quote from: DVlog on May 25, 2022, 05:25:32 PM2. They could have to take entry in the spreadsheet with that false information too.This is the same case as number one, the best solution you do.1.

This type of human error could be done.Regarding point 3. I advise you to read my messed up investigation on the past. Instead of copying the previous person POA right? and If it is done unconsciously then the valid account ownership will re-edit the POA proof before registering it in the spreadsheet table.And Also, usually valid Account ownership, they will reconfirm by providing more evidence to support the claim need to be underlined with a note there is no history connected to each other eg (proof of wallet transactions) A - B.",
