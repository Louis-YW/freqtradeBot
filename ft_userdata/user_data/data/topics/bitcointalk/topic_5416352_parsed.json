      "body": "There's more than one scenario of this happening though.If the US economy is still growing and they decide not to repay their debt then bitcoin will probably do nothing (the market in general might become a bit more volatile and us companies would have to hold bonds in other currencies with other governments in order to continue functioning but that might be it). If it triggers a run on all the government bond markets and everyone's forced to pay up, countries like the UK and the Netherlands might be seen as safe haven places as they are two good examples of countries that offer to buy back bonds very quickly when their economy becomes unstable or uncertain (I think most of the EU is capable of this too and the bloc might function as one big bond buyer of its own bonds - like a few countries have always wanted).If the US stagnated or started to decline and then defaulted on its debt this might crash bitcoin only if the effects were felt globally or the US had the most buying pressure on it.The more worrying part of the US defaulting on its debt is the fact that it'll damage the dollar either way. Printing trillions of dollars to repay debt might hurt it less than defaulting.There's the other option that the US might have indefinite bonds that means they might never default (as long as the interest is paid but it could be paid in new bonds as long as a buyer can be found).",

The US is considered the economic center of the world if they default, you should know that everything will fall apart and cryptocurrencies are only a small part of the world economy. It's still not something big enough to withstand any economic turmoil in the world.",

The US was in dept for decades and will be for more decades, nothing will change. They will never default.Other countries are different. I think there will be more QE in the European countries due to what is happening to these bond yields. And if this is happening frequently you will see the pairs such as BTC/GBP and BTC/EUR appreciate more in value and that means many are hedging their money in currencies like crypto and gold due to the QE that these central banks have no choice but to do.",

This does not seem very sustainable, especially if we take into account the deficit, and that the negative numbers keep growing.https://www.usdebtclock.orgSo far, things have been sustained by a forward flight, as the world's richest and most powerful nation and having the dollar as a reserve currency, but the debt cannot continue to increase ad infinitum.Regarding the possible scenarios, I think there are two, and a priori we cannot know which one would end up happening: that the Bitcoin would fall precipitously and deeply in price, or that in the face of the crisis the Bitcoin would become a refuge and rise in price. I think it would be a mixture of both: a first downturn to rise quickly, as happened from March 2020.",

The very day to day running of the country is absolutely dependent on us taking on more and more debt. We can endlessly devalue the dollar to pay that debt, sure, but there is always the debt ceiling to consider. The debt ceiling currently sits at $31 trillion, and we are rapidly approaching it again. Usually it is raised each time without issue, but occasionally one party likes to refuse to raise it in order to force through some legislation or gain concessions on some bill. If it cannot be raised to fund not only the ongoing functioning of the government, but also the payments on the already existing debt, then the government will shutdown.Usually such disagreements are resolved within a few weeks, but not without leaving hundreds of thousands of people without pay and costing the economy billions of dollars. Temporary measures can be put in place to free up some money to fund core departments and continue to pay the existing debt. A prolonged shutdown would exhaust these temporary measures, however, and would also lead to a default on the debt.As to the effect on bitcoin, who can say? We would be facing an enormous financial crisis, with enormous cuts across the board and millions of job losses.",

US default would be a global crisis and a broken dollar would be the death of the world economy. Before the USD was chosen as the world currency in the 20th century, many other countries used the gold standard as their primary unit of exchange. If that happens, I think gold will be the option at that point and a new currency will come along with it.

They did something like 4 trillion total within the span of a few years and we saw how horrible the inflation became and how much interest rate FED had to increase.This is why I believe that we shouldn't be really guessing that they will print it. However they are making enough money to pay it back when they have to, and just create a bigger debt for later on while keep growing, that’s not a bad strategy and I believe that it will definitely be something that would work out for them for many decades.",
