This is not good for you to use your money and make any decision for investment or trading.What will be your story, if you use $2000 on behalf of your father, to invest in Bitcoin in September 2023 and now Bitcoin is not about $60,000 but is around $15,000?Your story can be a coincidence with the market time that changes from bear to bull but if you have similar story in 2021 or 2022, your story ending one year after your entry can be different, loss not profit.",

      "body": "It's good that it worked out for you, but I agree with @BlackBoss_ here. Examples like these shouldn't encourage every newbie investor to take the same steps, selling a property or taking money from their parents and investing it in cryptocurrencies because the stories can't always be the same and the results can differ for different individuals based on multiple factors but mainly the price at which the assets were bought and to where the market heads after that. Your story would be different if Bitcoin had dipped instead of going up after your purchase.This is the reason why it is not recommended for anyone to invest money that isn't free of other obligations and isn't supposed to be used for anything else, which means that you shouldn't borrow money, take someone else's money, or sell some property to invest the money in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies thinking that it will generate profit and you will return the funds because even if it does, there is no guaranteed timeframe for that to happen.So, newbies need to be vigilant when making investments in cryptocurrencies.",

Your tradition is very different from ours. In my country, it is the husband-to-be family that spends for the marriage, You have to buy all the materials and the bride's price, and the bride's parents will not spend a penny. I also read recently that a bride can be intimidated or even attacked if her family doesn't pay a reasonable amount.",

In September 2023, the price of Bitcoin was massively down. Those who bought Bitcoin then have profited massively from Bitcoin in the current period. However, it is not possible to become a millionaire overnight in Bitcoin investment, but hearing the success story of your successful Bitcoin investment will make many people more interested in Bitcoin. But I like your story very much because in a family where there is no elder son, the father is really facing a lot of problems. It must be very happy for you to help your father as much as you can while marrying off his daughter. If we can invest patiently with a long-term plan in Bitcoin investment, we will surely get success through that investment.",

Quote from: B2Z on April 29, 2024, 06:55:22 PMInvesting in Bitcoin with the mindset that you will become an overnight millionaire from Bitcoin before investing in Bitcoin will do you more harm than good. Because we all invest in Bitcoin to make money but there is a right time to make money from investment. When you invest in Bitcoin you must not rush. You should always have a long term plan when investing in Bitcoin. If you want to invest with a small plan then see  You won't get paid because of hurry, so you always have to be patient and plan your investment when it comes to Bitcoin. Many times it is seen that we are in a hurry to invest in Bitcoin and we cannot make a home decision due to which we lose our investment attitude, so we always have to have a long term plan, we have to check the market, if we invest patiently, we will get success in the investment.",

Right here it is obvious that you could not afford to loose a whole $2,000 if anything gambling may had happened with your investment.How about if the date of the wedding has come and the Bitcoin market price went Dipper than the $30,000 during then you invested the fund?Anyways, you may have been lucky to be successful with the numerous risks involved here, I just hope you take note of it so that you don't advice others to take such step otherwise you would be a mislead somedays.I also hope you are furthering to your investment?
