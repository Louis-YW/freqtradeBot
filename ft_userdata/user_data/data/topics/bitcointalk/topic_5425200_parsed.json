Previously there was also a thread discussing fake CMC Beware of fake Coinmarketcap! . we can report it. and the ad will be removed by google. but it will still make the site's fake ads appear again and keep creating new ones.because this has happened before, I hope no more people get stuck with fake sites like this.",

The last time, the fake CMC websites used to pop up in the paid advertising section of Google. Is it a similar case with Coingecko? I can't recreate it, no matter how many times I try. Fortunately, it seems easy enough to spot: the domain is invalid, and there aren't many reasons why you would possibly want to connect your wallet to a website such as Coinmarketcap or Coingecko.",

Sad, but true. Thats called malvertising, well who knows its all done by a google employee itself?These scammers did this type of sponsored ad for a fake coinmarketcap site as well last month.

Ages ago I fell into the similar situation --namely, accidentally connecting a dApp to our TW or MM-- and I'm actually curious what'll the scammer do. Far as I know, TW --can't say for MM, hadn't use them for a while-- still needs us to approve transactions, so I don't think they can do anything even when they're connected to our wallet through walletconnect.Best I can think of is the user who fell into this situation --just like I did-- immediately realized their mistake and reached their TG for support. And we all know how many way-too-helpful hand will reach us back through PM once we asked for help there. So, maybe a little tip for anyone fell --or currently falling-- into this kind of scam, their \"official\" representative --because there's no official staff there, all who helped you there are the honest and kind community-- will not reach through PM. Even if you reached them first, they'll urge you to write on the channel so everyone can read and help and give insight. So, the basic rule of thumb applies: if anyone reached you through PM claiming they'll help with your issue, just ignore them.Another thing, just to be safe, is to revoke the connection, instruction here",

Hell, its pretty common to hear newbies even entering seed phrase in similar scam attempt. But in reality, even veteran crypto users can make a mistake, all that you need is not paying attention for a few seconds and that's it. I know a guy who lost ~100k by connecting Metamask to a phishing site, and this guy has been in crypto since like 2014, so he was far from a newbie. But, he was in a hurry and wanted to do something quick before going out and ended up losing big chunk of his portfolio.",
