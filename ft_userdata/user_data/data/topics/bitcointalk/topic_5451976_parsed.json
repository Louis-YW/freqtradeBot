However, it is possible to speculate that if aliens have a similar concept of currency and value exchange as humans, then it is conceivable that they could potentially accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.Regarding newborns, it is unlikely that they would be able to accept Bitcoin or engage in any financial transactions until they reach an age where they have the cognitive ability to understand the concept of money and the technological know-how to manage cryptocurrency wallets. In most jurisdictions, individuals need to be at least 18 years old to engage in financial transactions independently.",

Probably, if they are of higher intelligence than us man, they will be able to tell about all different types of currencies in the world.Quote from: hsdjkahskjdh on May 08, 2023, 04:53:28 PMWhat about newborns?And what do you mean by newborns. Let me ask you this question, did you have any self conciouness, of when you were born. What age were you when you started understanding signs from your parents.

And, the answer to this question is a big no. They will not accept Bitcoin or any other currency that's created and traded by humans. If aliens are as physical as humans then they might use some form of currency for exchange of goods but only if they have as many senses as we humans have. Otherwise, they might not be able to trade like humans.Other than that, it's still not proven by science and technology, that those beings really exist. They are mostly part of the fiction novels and entertainment serials, and other than that there isn't any good theory regarding their existence. Let's suppose if there are aliens and they are as physical as humans then why should they accept something that isn't useful for them? It's a fact that Bitcoin is very useful for humans but even in planet Earth no other species are interested in Bitcoin other than humans.Even if the aliens are present someone in the universe we still can't say that they are good at the technology that we humans have. No one can prove that aliens can be as intelligent as humans because the homo sapiens are the most advanced species currently present in the universe. In this date and time it is really hard to prove the existence of aliens even if they are shared in the form of recoded media such as pictures or videos. In this time the AI generators can generate any kind of Picture with simple prompts, and trust me it can generate very high quality photos of aliens. One of those AI based image generator is named as Midjourney that can create very realistic photos within seconds. You will be amazed with the quality of those generated photos. That's why it's very difficult to prove the existence of aliens in today's time.",

Matter of fact, who's to say that they are even using money from where they live? perhaps some advanced civilization from the outskirts of the deep space have figured out how to live harmoniously without killing your kin for resources or money. Perhaps they don't have the concept of money and are literally doing the barter method since time immemorial. Or perhaps, they have made a much better form of currency system that would span lightyears and lightyears away without compromise? These are little theoretical brain exercises but it begs the question of not whether these aliens are going to be accepting of bitcoin or money thereof, but of if they will be willing to conform to human values and ideas.",

Yes, I think Aliens would accept bitcoin because if they are more intelligent than humans, then it would take little to no time for them to understand the value of money that is secured by the laws of physics and not based on the whims of some sociopathic bankers and politicians. As far as newborns are concerned, they obviously can't accept it on their own but I do think that software like smart contracts, AI, and algorithms can create an address and receive it on behalf of a newborn. I know newborns who have some sats set aside by their parents but it's up to that particular human to actually accept and use them.",

(i hope you might understand). if they need a car why would they buy BTC well, if aliens are true then it's mean wormholes are true and pause of time is also true so, that's a good point for aliens they could buy 1 BTC from here and can go to another dimension where time goes slow and after 1 year they came back, and it's been 100 years on earth, they would definitely be rich by then and they can buy another shuttle (haha).Quote from: Casdinyard on May 08, 2023, 06:43:02 PMperhaps some advanced civilization from the outskirts of the deep space have figured out how to live harmoniously without killing your kin for resources or money.
