A simple proof that you are involved in gambling can be used against the court to backup their claim of disinheriting you.Probing that you are not chronic gambler while you are involved on gambling is very to do especially if you are just fighting for money that is not originally yours. The parents have the right to decide who will receive the money. But I doubt this regular scenario in real life since you will obviously temporarily stop gambling if your parents gives you an ultimatum about inheritance. I can wait long time if we are talking about big inheritance money here.",

But if a child is a gamble and has not been proven as addicted gambler such persons has all power or authority to claim their inheritance from their parents except has been known or haven a broken record where now sold their property for gambling at this point i won't support any inheritance should be given to him or her because giving to such person may leads to waste of resources.",

I can wait long time if we are talking about big inheritance money here. For someone's parent to go as far as disinheriting their child from their wealth citing that the said child is a chronic gambler, I think they have tried their best to make sure the child in question leaves gambling but couldn't succeed. A lot of chronic gamblers are very good in using whatever that's in their possession to gamble and knowing fully well that their child will definitely gamble with which part of the wealth that's willed to him, they'll rather chose to will them to their responsible children who would not use the wealth for something that's not useful.",

I've already seen cases where the person left all his patrimony to a dog or cat. However, it doesn't happen automatically. It happens only if the individual registers this petition towards the law of the country.That is really unusual, though, because it's natural that a father or mother wishes to leave everything they have for their families, in order to proportionate comfort and welfare for their future generations.",

      "body": "If a child has proven to be unstable or generally a danger to others, parents may chose to give their property to someone else when they pass. However, under many jurisdictions, this is considered illegal. Children should be included in a will and are entitled with first priority to the possessions of their legal parents. But in cases where a child is disgraced, has severed ties with his/her parents and/or are unstable, they often will not have the capacity or the funds to pursue such a case. It's usually the less fortunate that get the short end of the stick in these situations sadly.",

      "body": "If a child can prove he doesn't gamble too often and can still control himself well during gambling, he can likely still get his share of the inheritance. But everyone must be able to think clearly that nothing can guarantee that someone can maintain control over themselves in gambling because we probably already know that many people end up losing control of themselves in gambling. They are so distracted by the money they have in their hands that they will think they can still gamble responsibly and they will probably start betting more than usual.Parents must be able to look for evidence that their children do not gamble too often and do not overdo it. It would be even better if the parents could prove that their child does not gamble so that his inheritance will fall into hands that can control and use his inheritance well. Parents should be careful of their child, who can pretend to show that he is a responsible gambler but in the end, he will become a gambler who is addicted to gambling.I don't understand such laws. When there is an inheritance, the inheritance will be distributed directly to the children or as written in the inheritance letter. But some parents write certain messages like that.​",

Because all of this concerns our own good.And gambling can be a fun thing to enjoy and gambling can also be a very detrimental thing, when what we are after in gambling is profit.

In my opinion, because of how subjective this law you quoted is, it would take an actual trial for a jury to decide whether a person is a chronic gambler or not. It would require the son to provide data of his wager and gambling activity and getting it compared to his income and the inheritance he is trying to claim. In the end, such decision would depend on the personal and religious opinions of those who are member of the jury.Here in my country there are not laws which are as specific as those in your country.

You should not concern yourself with trying to forcefully claim an inheritance for yourself, it is not your property, and never was. I think it is an entitlement mentality to want to take your parent's will to court just so you can challenge their wishes and claim some inheritance for yourself. If your parents see it as good to leave some inheritance for you, that is okay, if they do not, then you should be able to accept the reality of things and struggle to get your own.",

You can engage in other activities that is completely not gambling but still deriving fun and entertainment from it if you're into gambling as a result of the entertainment.",
