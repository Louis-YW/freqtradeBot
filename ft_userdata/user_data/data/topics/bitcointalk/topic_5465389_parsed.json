Keep the spirit regardless of the amount invested because from the amount of 1 satoshi we can get 1 bitcoin if we are willing to do it regularly even though what is currently being done is only once every 2 months.Never feel pessimistic about the bitcoin investment that you are doing. Maybe for the next few days you can invest in large amounts of bitcoin and do it almost every month.Bitcoin is a good hedge against fiat currencies and you are already at a good stage. Just remember that 1BTC=1BTC.",

Do it regularly and you will get benefits in the future.everyone who is currently enjoying success from investing and trading Bitcoin is those who believe in Bitcoin.",

I don’t know that amount and I really don’t care about how much you use for your investment in bitcoin but as long as you’re consistent with it and you won’t be needing the money anytime soon I’m sure you’ll be able to accumulate a significant amount of money. They are those that heard about bitcoin in its early stage and paid a deaf ear to it and when it got to a higher price they regretted their decision and some also heard about it before it got to its ATH and took no action and still regretted it. While some heard about the profit some made during the ATH and they decided to delve into it and then the price crashed they also regretted it. What I’m trying to say is that no matter the amount you’re using don’t do it because you saw someone else made a good amount from it, invest of any kind requires your patience and also the ability to withstand the though times.QuoteIs there any hope for small Bitcoin buyers like myself? Can 1Sat ever be 1 Cent one day?  It might not get to that amount that you truly desire but I’m sure that it will get to an amount that will yield profit to you, and like I said before if you continue to accumulate more coin  no matter how little it might be you’ll surely  rip off your coin i.e if you’re a believer and not a get rich quick person.",

If you can go and check the present price of 1 bitcoin and pray for it to drop to the amount you are wishing bitcoin to be, then definitely you are trying to just own some high amount of bitcoin, and the present traders are going to lose a lot of money. Op investment in bitcoin is not something that has been forced on people because in bitcoin you only invest what you can afford to lose, so if you don’t have enough to invest, I will advise you to go and create savings or join hands with other successful companies in your location. After you have enough savings, you can remove what you have saved and what you know you can afford to lose and start treading, but don’t pray for the downfall of others so that you can prosper.",

While (sorry to say) you can't afford to lose the money you put in. Just spend your bitcoins as needed when you have to. I think bitcoin doesn't want to make someone's situation more difficult and bitcoin can't fix your situation, you have to do it yourself.What you need to know is that these two types of currencies fluctuate. I've answered \"yes\" with reasons on similar question before.

There is no need to be ashamed of anything, specially in the current economic situation in the world.Not to mention that purchasing bitcoin is not the only way to accumulate it. Based on the signature in your profile you have been part of a signature campaign, so you have indeed earned some additional money in form of tokens that you could have converted to bitcoin.You can still do more jobs like that to earn bitcoin directly instead of buying it too.",

It doesn't matter how often you can invest in bitcoin, once every 2 months or once every two days. Invest as much as you can afford. There are no restrictions or conditions for you here. Act according to your own abilities and don't chase after those who invest big money.

But as you said, you could do invest in Bitcoin every 2 months which is actually good because there's no late and you don't have to rush your money into investment since we all have priorities that we need to sustain like our essential needs.  No need to be ashamed if you're just starting in investment just take your time. Don't lose hope and I hope you're being positive with an action as well like having a budget plan, having a side hustle or job so you can have extra payment and by that you could invest more in BTC.",
