  "content": "Hello,What I'm reselling is a \"Second hand LIFETIME license\" for Gunbot. ['Grandfathered - Promoultimate'][Apologies in advanced if this whole post is a \"detailed mess\" but I thought I'd add all the details anyways, just in case there are new or semi-experienced users to Gunbot, who hasn't figured out all the annoying \"license tier' gimmicks and all that. It'd probably make it way easier for those who have some experience with Gunbot and wish to get the arbitrage and market making feature in Gunbot]Technically a Gunbot Ultimate License, with BitRage and Market Maker. Note I said \"technically\"It's not the kind of license where you \"fill it up with 24000 Gunthies\" [25000 now, they upped requirements] and WHAM, you're automatically on Ultimate, Bitrage (Arbitrage bot) and Market Maker by \"normal\" means.It's a certain \"grandfathered promo ultimate license\" that I paid around 1800 USD for individually, second hand. And had default access to a majority of  Gunbot Ultimate features, included with BR and MM. Normally \"normal\" licenses, would require to buy Gunthies seperately, which is a total pain. So I'm selling the license for approx 1300-1460 USD, though prices are negotiable. The price on my listing is in BTC, but I'll be dynamically adjusting it according to BTC/USD market price; well generally.(Also note, I know the whole fiasco with Centralized exchanges, due to all that FTX drama. I know the dev is working to make Gunbot work with DEX exchanges. DYDX being one of the main ones; so look forward to that. You'll always have access to trade on many of the popular CEX out there, but you know how it is with CEX)Also note this particular license DOES NOT have \"Gunbot Simulator\" which you can view general details of what it is here:wiki.gunthy.org/setup-and-general-settings/global-settings/simulatorAlso this bot license can only run with 11 exchanges at a time. Whereas Gunbot Ultimate can run on unlimited exchanges.If you're to be buying this license, it'll be done through Escrow with the resellers on Gunbot.shop. Ask me for more details if unsureOtherwise, to access the \"second hand license page\" leading to the Telegram channel where the listings are listed, you can view more details here:gunbot.shop/forum/topic/how-to-buy-sell-second-hand-gunbot-licenses/DM me, and I can show you which listing belongs to me [listings in this second hand shop, has an ID number]. I can always ask the resellers to adjust the listing price if you negotiate a price here with meBelieve me, for what I'm selling it for now, you're getting a really good deal.--------------Beyond this, I'm going to just type in all sorts of other details in case you're comparing licenses or \"which deal is better\" etc etc.It'll probably look like a disorganized ramble. Which it probably is. But at least it gives you ALL the info you need to know, if you're comparing. As long as I'm not missing any details.----------------------If you were to buy a Gunbot Standard license, fresh. It'd come with 500 Gunthy Tokens.Buying outright would cost 0.014 BTC at this time (approx 231 USD as of now)Gunbot Pro comes with 750 tokens. Buying outright would cost 0.025 BTC at this time   ( approx 412 as of now)Gunbot Ultimate comes with 2500 tokens. Buying outright would cost 0.04 BTC at this time   (approx 650 USD as of now).I know if you're using Gunbot Starter, or Standard. You could upgrade to Pro and Ultimate by having the required licenses. All I know is that you need 2500 Gunthy tokens to be at Ultimate.[TLDR: it's a massive pain, to start off with Gunbot Standard to Ultimate, and then need like 22500 more Gunthy tokens TO use BitRage and Market Maker. By having to run around aimlessly in Gunbot Telegram channels or certain niches places on the internet, JUST to get 22500 Gunthy Tokens. TXbit's orderbook is HORRIBLE, and as of this time, they don't have enough Gunthy tokens to stack to 22500. Heard withdrawl fees are RIDICULOUS too. 2000 Gunthy? probably 40 bucks for a withdrawal. What a pain. That COULD change though. Orderbook spread on TXBit is nasty too. It was at 0.022 to 0.032 USD average with an OK orderbook spread. Now the spread is 0.16 USD to....1.97? Yeah, really messed up orderbook. As of now as I type this, Market Buying Gunthy tokens is just instant \"self-destruct,\" unless the orderbook stabilizes again. However, the current spread doesn't look so good at all.I can't answer of the actual Gunbot Gunthy exchange has enough Gunthies or not. Seems like you can only view the orderbook etc if you have an actual account there, which I don't have. Who knows, maybe they got the BEST prices in USD out there. Something you'll have to confirm yourselfJust do the math. I mean if it IS possible to buy an estimated 22500 GUNTHY tokens from an exchange for 0.022 to 0.032 USD per GUNTHY, great. But as of now...I really don't know about that....There were times a while back, when GUNTHY tokens were going from 0.1 to 0.25 USD average. Imagine paying up an extra 2250 USD to 5.5K USD just to get 22500 GUNTHY tokens just to access Bitrage and Market Maker? Outright HORRIBLE. Price is never consistentBluntly put: Just seems like a better deal and less of a headache and hassle to just buy my license off me    ]---------------To access Bitrage, you need 12000 Gunthy tokens in your wallet.To access Market Maker, you need 25000. It use to be 24000, but this number changes. So imagine yourself, being at 24000 Gunthy tokens in your wallet, but all of a sudden, number incraeses to 25000, then 26000? And all of a sudden, your MM stops working because of not having the required GUNTHY tokens in your wallet. Quite a pain, isn't it?At the same time, imagine yourself reselling your Gunthy tokens by normal means. Not everyone might buy them at the price you're selling it for. Again, the orderbooks on the exchanges are HORRIBLE. You might be running around in Telegram channels or elsewhere, looking for people to sell them to. Hit and miss. Gunthy is a niche token after all. As long as you have this license [Grandfathered - Promoultimate] that I'm selling you, you never need to worry about the amount of Gunthy tokens required to have access to BitRage and Market Maker. I was given 1500 Gunthy tokens off the bat, yet have access to Gunbot Ultimate (without the Gunbot Simulator. And only working with trading on 11 exchanges simultaneously, instead of unlimited exchanges; and can use Market Maker and BitRage. It doesn't matter what the devs do to the Gunthy requirements, to have access to BR and MM. You'll ALWAYS have access to BR and MM.Anyhow, to those who are interested but unsure, or are researching; I give you all these details so that you don't need to over-research it. But again, still, do your research before committing. Again, you're getting a great deal off of me",
