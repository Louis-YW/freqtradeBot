Being prepared for investment is not about saving money in the bank to accumulate whatsoever but is about putting yourself and financial needs inorder. when you have a good cash flow you can separate them according to how pressing your needs are hence not to suffer for the cost of investment.When you talk about saving to buy Bitcoin or any other investment in your bank account in my honest opinion, it is not a good idea because fiats depreciates as time goes on because they are printing more money every day that's the truth so the most advise I give people is do whatever that is necessary when you have it don't wait for time to come make your time come.",

The halving next year is no longer a new topic and it has passed the moment of just preparing to invest in bitcoin. Actionable activities is  demanded from anyone who intends to benefit from it. Remember, early to bed, early to rise. The price of bitcoin is increasing considerably now, and whoever has invested before now has started seeing his/her gains. Delay is definitely dangerous, l advise you don't wait to accumulate heavy  sums before investing. It can be done on a slow and steady basis. To be a good investor, consistency is key and remember, little drops of water makes a mighty ocean. Every Investor needs to act fast and start now if you've been preparing all along.",

For me I think who ever is not prepared to invest , shouldn't go into the market if they are not prepared,  like having much money which they can use in investing . Investing all the money one has in bitcoin can end up to be a distraction which the person will be hoping to make quick money from the investment.",

Procrastination is very dangerous in one life because something you can do at the moment, many people have the money to buy but they were afraid to buy while some wanted to invest but there was no money for them to invest. But I still believe it is not too late, because the price will still go up well well so if anyone want to buy and hodle, let them do now so that when the price goes up to the ATH then you sell it off and take your profit.",

In achieving this dream, this kid has to go to school, read books, get acquainted with the medical profession and environment then, he's prepared to serve! Note that firstly, the kid gets to prepare. Every reasonable and sane adult should see preparation for any task he or she needs to accomplish as top priority because, in course of preparation one is able to identify weaknesses, threats, opportunities and strengths in whatever business he/she has to deal with in due time. Preparedness has never left a single space for failure rather it is a pavement for success and security. Prediction on the other hand looks more like procrastination and that doesn’t help anyone.when you keep on predicting what will be when you don’t have a prepared backup plan to fall back to should in case a problem arises is really messy. It always leaves a space for devastation and hopelessness. In order to succeed, there is a great earning that comes with preparedness other than predicting.",

For the fact that Bitcoin hasn't attain it's ATH is enough to make us to understand that it is never to late to accumulate Bitcoin now because there will absolutely be an explosion (rapid boom) in Bitcoin after the halving in the bull market.",

We can say predict and prepare at the same time even when your predictions do not happen accordingly but your preparation is already there to tackle in what ever way it might happen. In Bitcoin, one should be able to analyze the market and get prepared, is it waiting for DIP, knowing fully well that after some years circle before the halving the price of Bitcoin will drop so the earlier you begin to save up for the DIP the larger the amount you will invest and greater the profit after the halving.",

It is preferable for us to do well in the upcoming bull run. We must not let our dread of the future drive us to perform acts of selflessness that will jeopardize our chances of success. We can simply sit down and be predicting the future without investing a single bitcoin. Let us know allowed the negative to hinder our progress we should stay in positive and not miss out on an opportunity that will alter our life. Because investing is not only about growing wealth, it's also about avoiding the regret of missing out on a chance shall pass by our side.",
