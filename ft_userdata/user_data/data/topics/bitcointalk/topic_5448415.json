Some people invested their time learning and these people are interested about what are cryptos are.Quote from: halim50_ on April 11, 2023, 03:36:12 PMIs there any way to solve this problem? I don't think there is a problem there. It's just better if these coins get their attention and try to study this type of coin.",

This is the main reason that why Bitcoins aren’t taught correctly to the people. We can’t blame the government also, as government likes to control and regulate all the assets, but Bitcoin’s decentralised nature prevents Bitcoins to be controlled. A person if wants to learn about Bitcoin, then he can do it through any source. So yes we don’t have proper education on cryptocurrencies, but we can learn if we make our willpower strong.",

Having misconceptions about Bitcoin is something that you'll find everywhere since in most country we don't have dedicated systems or subject that teaches about Bitcoin so we all try to learn about Bitcoin ourselves and during that process, we came across some information that wasn't correct, and that information was spread to several other people who as well continue the spread. I'm also guilty of being fed a lot of misconceptions and lies about Bitcoin before entering this forum. QuoteIs there any way to solve this problem?As long we still have false information continuously being spread across several platforms on the internet and also physically it will be sloe to impossible to eliminate bitcoins misconceptions. But with constant awareness creation and more people trying to correct those misconceptions we might be able to see a positive effect. But note that as long as we have anti-bitcoiners on the internet misconceptions will continue to be developed.",

If that happened they will have their own research about it, if they have a bad perception of Bitcoin it might change in the long run if they started using Bitcoin.",

After reading the topic, I can say OP does not have a good understanding of bitcoin, bitcoin isn’t a platform for people to invest. I think bitcoin is popular in developing countries because of the poor economy, the people there are more open to new alternatives that can help them stay ahead of the inflation rates. The stats from chainalysis.com show that there is an increasingly high bitcoin adoption in Nigeria, Venezuela, Ghana, Kenya, Vietnam, and other developing countries. https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/",

Since you mention third-world countries, does Bitcoin comprehension are better than basic subjects like, reading, writing, and arithmetic? Specifically to those who have misconceptions, someone better to let them know, and fight it if it goes into FUD, like those who advocate Bitcoin switching to PoS. Also, still in the context of third-world countries, don't you think the ones who misconception are also lacking a good education? My point is, essential education subjects are still lacking in many parts of the world, go around looking at PISA or OECD, so Bitcoin is out of the option when we talk about education urgencies.",

Bitcoin.org: The official website of Bitcoin, containing the white paper, documentation, and other resources for understanding Bitcoin.2. The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous: A popular book that explores the economic principles behind Bitcoin and its potential as a currency.3. The Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos: A collection of talks by Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos that explores the potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.4. Bitcoin Wiki: A comprehensive resource for understanding the technical details of Bitcoin and its underlying technology, blockchain.5. The Bitcoin Podcast: A weekly podcast that covers news, developments, and discussions related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Hope it's good enough for you.",

Nigeria for example. In fact, there is still a relatively small number of Bitcoin supporters, the most common reason is state regulations that make it difficult or impossible to implement and use cryptocurrencies.In 3rd countries, the reason for this is that with the use of cryptocurrencies, people would have a greater degree of financial freedom, and this would complicate the management of the state.",

I guess one of the greatest reasons why people aren't familiar with Bitcoin is because they aren't familiar with technology and no one is having misconceptions here.At some point, you have to understand that Bitcoin serves different purposes and most persons have their purpose for owning Bitcoin which might be totally different from that of the other person that doesn't mean because he isn't doing what the next person is doing with his coin, his then having a misconceptions.Another chance Bitcoin is facing is it's ban in most countries because I know that at some points, if Bitcoin is accepted in a country, it also increases its chances of getting widely accepted in such a country.",

Exactly like you said there's nowhere in the world including the early industrialized world that understood what bitcoin is and what it's trying to solve, but it's simple to explain.  In the richer world \"Europe/North America/Australia\" there is no need to look for other financial methods because people are all right.  While unfortunately in very poor countries there is a low illiteracy rate, therefore they do not have enough possibilities to understand.  Those countries remain where there is oppression given by the government or by dictatorships and those countries will be the first to silently adopt bitcoin.  You see the problem resolves itself when the need arises.",
