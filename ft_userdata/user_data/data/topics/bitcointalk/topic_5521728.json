As a Bitcoin holder, I believe that a new rally is coming, and I anticipate that the price of Bitcoin will surpass $150,000 before the end of 2024.In his interview after a video when he used bitcoin to buy something, he told that he was taught about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies by his children (or grandchildren too maybe). This means there are people in Trump family actually invested money in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies.Does Trump invest his money in Bitcoin, I don't know, no information about it. But at least he revealed that his family have members who are Bitcoin investors, and cryptocurrency investors.The $100,000 psychological barrier was broken, and it's time for celebration. Coinmarketcap deployed a small avatar for Bitcoin $100,000 hours ago.",

But I later think bitcoin may not get more than $149000. I still think bitcoin will be between $149000 and $170000 before the next bear market will begin.Quote from: TheUltraElite on December 05, 2024, 01:54:38 PMOnly time can tell us if their support at the current stage is genuine or part of their plan to get rich.

Another news that can move the price in this fashion is when he announces the move to make Bitcoin a reserve currency. That singular news will move the price to another ATH.

Bitcoin hitting $100k in December took most of us by surprise as very few people thought it would happen. But we only have 1 month left of the year, is it too greedy to expect bitcoin to increase by 50%? I doubt this target.Quote from: pakhitheboss on December 05, 2024, 01:20:53 PM The counting of votes is still going on in several states but the majority that he got suggests he is the new President of the USA. I am considering Trump as the new President of the US, who has the power to promote Bitcoin and make it a new option to USD. Is the vote counting still going on? Because as far as I know, the Biden administration has invited Trump to the White House and both sides have planned for a peaceful transfer of power. Trump is definitely the 47th president of the United States, IMO.By the way, bitcoin will be a new option to gold, not USD.",

You have sparked a lot of important discussion. The continuous price increase that politicians have gone through for their comments and power seems like a scheme to get very rich. I think you should immerse yourself in continuous buying and DCA method to keep yourself hydrated with this price increase. Single buy and bullish time as an investor continue to buy on speculation and look for potential bears. In fact if you set a road map of $220k price prediction in 2025 then now is the right time to increase stashing and invest aggressively. Still waiting for the bull run which has already started.If this is part of getting rich then an investor should go with it.",

We've all finally seen the $100K that we've been anticipating for, so the next question is, what's next?. Your anticipation of $150K is quite massive, but doesn't sound impossible, considering the fact that all the ATH that we've witnessed in the past one months where also impossible at some point until we crossed it.I have been enjoying the different price discovery lately, but I can't anticipate for anything above $120K till this year runs out. We know how though it was to see Bitcoin surpass the $100K price even though it was very close at some point. I will just stick with the $120K.",

This is just one president effects, imagine what is going to happened when other countries do the same, the market will be above any other asset.So far so good, we have seen $100k and that's a good start, the next phycological price is definitely $1M and it's just a matter of time, it will get there provided that they don't screw us again. Right now, I'm not even sure if other countries will be seeing the bad side of Bitcoin like they used to raid miners back in the days, US backing Bitcoin simply means one thing, forward forever even if the market correct later in the future.",
