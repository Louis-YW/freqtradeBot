The two chambers are not taking crypto bills lightly, in 2 months they should pass a bill, they are coming up with ideas upon ideas but in any way should the ideas be anti-people, the US will resist it. Rep. Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee confidently gave a yes reply when asked if the US president would sign the bill within a year.The confidence surprised me, but the more fear is futuristic in that any careless bill passed by the House and Senate could be an excuse for other countries and might be reducing the independence of cryptocurrency more than how it is.Bitcoin decentralization system may blind them but can not be transacted only by self-custody wallets that can help that, the centralized system will keep it better lively as it is and will be infringed upon by the US legislature decision.They claim it will target Security concern and Cybercrime, I don't have problem with that. I know when they get away with this, it will not end there, they will pass another stiffer bills in the future and will gradually be weakening cryptocurrency status.",

It will probably cause a major run up in crypto price.There are a lot of people who will not invest now because of the wide open nature of crypto and they are a bit risk adverse. Give them some stability and they will buy.There are a lot of institutions that want to invest but their risk management department will not let them. Give them more rules and guides and they will invest.And so on.The people who want their privacy will either adapt or leave. But, more then likely for every 1 person that leaves 10 will come in. And that is a conservative number from what opinion polls and research have been saying. -Dave",

I believe it has reached to a point to exist forever and it won't be eliminated by any bill, dozen of bills, a single country or many countries.Bills are not bad and some bills might have positive contribution for cryptocurrency ecosystem.

We are definitely not having sound minded peeps in the SEC as well. I don’t understand how they could not decide a binary question-answer of yes or no with ease? What is wrong with the system is they do not want overshadow of bitcoin thus crumbling the governments all around the world due to decentralisation. There are many middle points through which bills can be passed where both parties would be ok to accept the terms. However, government understand they will lose half of the controlling power in the process. I don’t know, but there seems even larger support to government from billionaires as well. Everything is conspired about the Bitcoin since it got bigger and bigger.",

If want the government to somehow support cryptocurrency then regulation is something we must welcome and it's not that their regulation plan will regulate crypto per se what they want to regulate is Centralized platform that's dealing with crypto-related business.

I know when they get away with this, it will not end there, they will pass another stiffer bills in the future and will gradually be weakening cryptocurrency status.If we're talking about decentralized crypto the government can not weaken it and they already have enough problems than focusing on weakening the crypto market. They are just addicted to power to control people or settings and the worse thing they will do with their regulation is restrict, limit, and possibly huge tax on crypto.",

That is what is not so clear, if you have to report even buying a cup of coffee to the taxman then people will simply stop using bitcoin for such small purchases and will instead hold their coins, and if it comes a time in which governments lose control of their economies then the desire to follow those misguided regulations will go down even further.",

If you look at this situation, people want their government to accept the crypto market. And this move is actually trying to accept crypto particularly BTC in their financial system. So for me, it is not killing crypto but trying to regulate the usage of btc, hence, the adoption. These people for sure will do their due diligence before implementing something, they won't implement without studying the given market.They will know the sentiments of people because in today's generation, they can basically read such sentiments over social media channels.",
