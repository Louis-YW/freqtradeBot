  "content": "I know that celebrating my birthday here in Bitcointalk forum is off-topic to start with. So, to make this thread belong in Beginners & Help. I decided to give or reward smerit (I won't tell the total of smerits I currently have) to Newbies up to Member rank. This thread is kinda a remembrance of some sort that I reach Hero Member rank and It's almost 1 year since I became a Hero Member (I celebrate ranking up to Hero Member on November 14, 2021 and I am also celebrating my birthday). Since there is an occasion, I would like to reward merit to those who deserves it. To receive or earn a merit from me is very simple and easy, all you have to do is follow the rules and format when you submit your entry. I will check post history of each participant.Rules:• Accounts that are created after this thread is posted are not eligible to join.• Entry submitted that didn't use the format I provided won't earn a single merit.• Only Newbies, Jr. Members and Members, Full Members and Sr. Members are eligible to join/participate.• Only one entry can be submitted per week. (Depends if I still have smerit left next week)• I have the rights to change/add new rules.Format:Code:Username: Nakamura12Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1726595Rank: Hero MemberUPDATE: 6 SMERITS LEFTThis thread will be Self-moderated.

I'm glad about your progress here on the forum. I don't want to ruin your business here, but...You should know, everyone can check your profile on BPIP https://bpip.org/Profile?id=1726595 and determine that you have earned a total of 582 merits so far while you sent 267. with simple math, you had a total (582/2) 291 sMerit to spend. when we subtract those you have already spent (291-267) we arrive at the result that you have about 24 sMerit remainings. maybe even less if your profile is not completely updated yet.maybe we'll agree that it's not too much of an amount to start this kind of initiative, there are already several similar threads but started by members who are merit sources and who constantly have a significantly larger amount of sMerit.For example, [Merit] Help newbies and those who have a little left to the next rankbtw. happy birthday to you and be well.",

Unless you are expecting merit sources to bail you out. That not withstanding. I wish you all the best. Happy one year birthday.Yes I do only have 24 smerits left. I did not create this thread just to send 24 smerits per week but to find a forum user who post high quality that did not get merited so, this is why I said that it may take longer before all of my smerits are sent. If you didn't get my point, let's say that last week I only found 5 worthy forum users to send merit then that means I still have more smerits left to reward this week. That's what I mean.Quote from: examplens on October 26, 2022, 05:47:07 PMmaybe we'll agree that it's not too much of an amount to start this kind of initiative, there are already several similar threads but started by members who are merit sources and who constantly have a significantly larger amount of sMerit.For example, [Merit] Help newbies and those who have a little left to the next rankbtw. happy birthday to you and be well.  Thank you very much. Anyway, I do have 24 smerits left and I agree with you that the amount of smerits I have is not too much for this thread but as you have known, there's no point in keeping smerits to myself. I haven't earned much merits myself that's why I decided to do this even though I didn't have much smerits to reward. Let's just say, congratulations to lucky 24.",

That's what I mean.Seriously? 5 worthy members of the forum ? You highly appreciate your merits. I'll tell you a little secret, and advise you to keep it simple. Why hoard? I doubt that all this time when you accumulated your merit, you did not come across good posts. In addition, you yourself rarely receive merit, and this also says something. This whole circus would be suitable for someone who regularly receives merit and scatters merit after him. Go to people with an open heart, don't be greedy, and it will come back to you a hundredfold.PS, You found 5, but gave one.",

Like you are going to review all their post or simply reward anyone who reply here?With the limited amount of smerits you have at this time you can simply dedicate them to some useful post on the forum as you will find lot of them here in this B&H board only instead of this thread and doing all the efforts as it will help you lot and no worries of hoarding the smerits with you.With these unclear sets of rule you will see lot of newbies just spamming up the thread in hope of one merit only to rank upto junior rank member only so I think you should find the other approach in my opinion.",

I love your inspiration to assist newbies to members rank on the forum today by giving out merits to them as your birthday gift. Birthday gift should be enough to meet up with the number of applications or let me say guests.24 smerits is a small number for all three ranks in the forum, if all the mentioned rank applied don't you think that you will have more than 24 good post that is worth meriting. Maybe you didn't prepare for this act ever since,it just thought of it not quite long if not you would have kept more smerits to be more generous",

      "body": "It is a small number and you guys are right but it's all I have so that's why I will distribute what I have left. Actually, they can just participate anytime they want as long as the rank is within rhe required rank. I checked their post history and that's the time I will decide if I give or not. So far, there are few months old account with less post and the others are more on bounty reports. As what lovesmayfamilis said, I did encounter some forum users with good posts but I keep all smerits that I have for this celebration purpose. Honestly, I would like to give them merits but I decided to give lower rank a chance to earn merit. I don't get why it is unclear when the rules is you can only submit once to give others a chance to earn instead of sending to the same person.Once again, 24 smerits is not making three ranks to rank up but a range which I will  accept or to give merit. In short, newbies, jr. members and member ranks have a chance to receive a merit from me if I think they deserve it.Let me just say that this thread is a bit like or a bit the same as Report Unmerited Good post to merit sources but only newbies, jr. member and member ranks are eligible to join. Due to limited smerits, only giving 1 per user and those who already received can submit again next week for others to have a chance getting merit. Hope you guys get what I am trying to do.

Happy 1 year birthday.You clearly miss my point here buddy.  It's already friday in forum's time zone which means next week is coming and those who I already merited can submit an entry again. I didn't say that I will give merit every week because I am not a merit source. I am only planning to send all smerits I have until all are sent. Also, it's not that I am celebrating being a hero member for almost 1 year but you can say that too but for this time it's the day I was born.
