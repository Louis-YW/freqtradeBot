But you cant be 100% accurate. What I do most time is buy and sell at different prices with a bot like feature. Although, I found this on MEXC Global and its called spot grid feature. It allows me to set price to sell and buy back while im not online. So, seems this one of the ways you can use to take advantage of BTC price to make litte profits for a particular period of time.",

I am not really worried about this dump. Because if we will hold the $20,000 level, I believe it will become a strong support until next bull market cycle.The reason also could be the issue of Kraken shutting down their crypto staking to their exchange due to The Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) charges settlement.

I think many people are waiting for the $21k price right now because it's their discount time that they can't miss. I still think correction time is still in the market and this week may still meet with some more corrections. And hopefully the price doesn't go down.The important thing is not to panic if the situation goes down again so that you can use the moment of decline to buy more instead of selling in a panic.",

Yeah, we all have seen the correction in the last couple of days, when we all thought that we are somewhat in a bullish momentum, the price suddenly decline.It just shows how volatile the market is, even in bear or bullish sentiments.What's important is that you have the mental resiliency to stay in the market and then take opportunities to buy when the price goes on a decline.",

But no wonder bitcoin is down at this point, I was expecting bitcoin to hit $25k and then correct because no market can go up forever, and we are still in bear season.

Bitcoin is up over 40% in January, so this correction is inevitable, take every opportunity instead of panicking. I'm happy to see bitcoin recover and hit a higher price but I wouldn't mind if bitcoin falls below $19k or even $15k again.",

There is nothing to panic because the Bitcoin market always fluctuates like this so it is natural to be patient.Bitcoin truly decreased, but not seriously. Bitcoin decreased from $24300 or so to $21800 now, there can still be a further drop in price. But you can not compare how bitcoin has decreased to many altcoins, like APT known as Aptos that increased to $20 and now at $13.2. that is the type of fall that are serious. Yes the best thing to do is to just continue to hold bitcoin, a time is coming that bitcoin will make people happy again.",
