Society is changing and we can't compare the present time with the old days were the level of communal living was high and families mostly lived together compared to now where there is a gap in the line between families and at that sometimes you may not even know your next door neighbour.",

Can we go back to those days, and how possible is it ?That was when raising a child was community effort and not solely a parent thing but those days are gone and I'm not sure they will come back because they have been taken over by different events. For example the family has move from being an extended family/compound to a nuclear home. Privacy is now the other of the day, back then you can tell what a family is known for, where the father works or retirees as you said and the mother is predominantly a house wife, you can see that has changed long time ago.Again about privacy, nobody wants you to have a clue on what he is doing, earning etc. The digital space have created opportunity for people to build their finance without support from family members and that makes individualism to increase and secluded lifestyle because you don't owe allegence anymore to those \"big uncles \". However the government has to do more these days to fight insecurity which is the effect of urbanization.",

So the boy and girl child grow up to adopt some attitude that ordinarily at their age the are suppose not to attain.Morals are not taught by parents to children anymore, and everybody focus on orientating their children alone which they think is the best way of developing a child to a better standard of good morals.",

As I was reading your post I smiled because I could remember that then,everyone is watching you closely to correct you on any mistake that you do,especially when you are mannerless,they will help put some manners into you.Presently,the evil in the world has stolen that unity and love for each other in the society. You will see people with high fences round their houses because they don't want anybody to intrude into their privacy or come home and notice that a stranger beat up their children. It is impossible to go back to such lives because those elderly ones who were more devoted to see that children have good morals and behaves well might have pass on to the other world. Technology has changed so many things and has increased the level of immorality in the world.",

Those were the times if you wanted to watch a movie or play a videogame, you were supposed to go to the only renting place in town and get a VHS for that night. Those were very good times, that is true, but our own opinions are biased because we all had our positive experiences. I have  listened a LGBT person talking about those times as well, and how homophobia was blatant, which was true. We could argue that old times were always better but we need to also remember our experience was not the same for all people living through those years. It is very possible those times won't ever come back, but rather than living in the past, we must build an even better future.",

While this was going on in some parts of the world, other parts were in war, were killing babies through abortion by the millions, were defrauding each other in big ways and small, etc.  But even if none of this bad stuff had been happening, people were still dying of old age.So, what's the purpose of the whole thing of life? We come to life, we live anywhere from only zero to (in a very few cases) 120, and then we die. We take our ideals along with us in death. But even if we pass them on to our children, even the children and their children all die.What's it all about? What's it all for? The big WHY?",

Presently you have no right to scold a child who is not your child, there is even a level to which you can scold your child. The world was not also as terrible as it is today, so then people did not care much about the information that their neighbors had about them and were happy living together communally. The world has changed and there is lesser trust for other people nowadays, communal living is no longer a system and people are encouraged to keep their business to themselves. People no longer even have that time.",

Life was truly simpler before and it was the best feeling, it makes me cry when I remember those days especially kid's days where I don't have to think of responsibilities and bills. Everything is just there and you just have to live and survive and have something to eat, that's it. But today, with the golden age of the digital era, things have been set as a standard like you have to be successful and be an achiever.

Today's society is changing, people's creativity is increasing and people are tolerant and ready to increase efficiency. Remembering my own childhood brings me to tears. In the past there were many single families but in the present time it is not noticed so you must change your goal.

Indeed times have changed and society has evolved and we have to change along with the circumstances irrespective of what it feels oritst divergence from the old ways and practices. Also with the coming of the internet, the world has become a global village with a lot of activities that can help improve the knowledge of our kids even at an early stage,  so nowadays,  children don't go to the playground anymore,  but rather they can spend that time in learning new things online from the comfort of their home and parents this day spend more time with their kids more than those in the olden days",

In life, the country I live in also has to go through many wars to be able to maintain peace. And the generation of people who have sacrificed their lives to preserve our country always remembers that gratitude, which is not only expressed through thoughts but also actions by living responsibly for this life.
