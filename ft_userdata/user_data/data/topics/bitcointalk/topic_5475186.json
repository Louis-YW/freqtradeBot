  "content": "Hello everyone, I finally decided to use again the beloved bitcoin core wallet after several years.These last events regarding CEX, regulations and ETF approvals, let me think that is not safe anymore, if ever, to keep my bitcoin on Binance.I downloaded the last bitcoin core version, synced with the blockchain, and I wanted to import some wallet addresses I used back in the day and, I wanted to get the private keys of some new addresses just created, but in both cases I got this error: \"Only legacy wallets are supported by this command (code -4)\".I don't get how to use private keys with this bitcoin core version, in my opinion being able to fully control private keys is the most important part of safety using bitcoin, so I'm uncomfortable to withdraw my funds without being sure of being in total control of my private keys.These are the command I'm using on the wallet console:Code:importprivkey \"MY KEY\"Code:dumpprivkey \"ADDRESS\"This is the error:Code:Only legacy wallets are supported by this command (code -4)Thanks in advance!",

      "body": "Back in January 2023 I created a Private/Public keys paper wallet with an Wallet Generator website that has been copied to a local folder on an offline laptop (security oblige). Lately (Jan 2024) I used this Paper Wallet to purchase a little bit of Bitcoin from a vendor machine. I was eager to import the private key into an updated Bitcoin Core V25, as I’ve done this many times in the past for others, and myself. The import procedure went smoothly.Code:Importprivkey “My1KeyWithLots494Of Upper5CaseAndNumbersAndLowerCase” “” falseLater, I encountered some issues with my Linux PC HDD and decided to scrap the whole installation and re-installed Bitcoin Core (this time Version 26) with a freshly downloaded complete blockchain .I was surprised to find out that I could no longer import my private key, as I was getting the exact same error as digital_mine, OP.Suffice to say, after reading this whole subject, I was quite surprised because just about 1 month ago, I was successfully importing my private key without any issues, with Version 25.After encountering this problem and read this whole post, I figured, “let just install a previous version of Bitcoin Core, say V23” just to load my private key, as I just did a month ago with V25. Nope! Didn’t work! Same error message.The Questions: Why did it work fine, last month ?What was done such that I was able to load my private key ?Is it possible that the original version of Bitcoin Core was V22 (being prior to V23) and compatible with importing private key, is the cause of the possible import?  I mean, the import in January 2024 was done with an upgraded version 25 from V22. V22 perhaps left some indications toward compatibility with the importprivkey and upgrading it to V25 didn't implement the restriction?  Following a complete HDD rebuild with a brand new V26 installation, got rit of the V22 possible import ?",

I need to clearly understand this.Yesterday I did an experiment. I installed Bitcoin Core V22 fully synced. I was able to importprivkey and succesfully run rescanblockchain.I could see my Sats. Then I updated to V26, just by updating the bin folder. I relaunched Bitcoin Core. The wallet oppened and the amount of Sats were OK.So, here is my comprehension, pls correct me if needed:* Starting at V23, creating a wallet would not allow the importprivkey command.* If a blank wallet is created with V22 and importprivkey, this wallet can, subsequently be opened with V23 and up.* It is not the Bitcoin Core version that prevent importprivkey, but the type of wallet created from the appropriate version.So then, if \"it's in the wallet\" Does that mean that if a wallet is importprivkey compatible, then a user could importprivkey in V26. In other words: Is importprivkey functionality stricktly dependent on the kind of wallet and not the Bicoin Core version ?Thanks",
