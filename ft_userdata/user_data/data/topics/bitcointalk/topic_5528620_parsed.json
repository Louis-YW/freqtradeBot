Therefore, it is possible that the tariff war is the cause of the drop in price. Trump has made some favorable promises to the crypto industry, and he has fulfilled some like the release Ross Ulbricht. He has also set up cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing new digital asset regulations and exploring the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile. It is important to note that Bitcoin doesn't depend on any politician to achieve its objectives. We are in the bull run; hence the price could get to any level. Don't depend on politicians to make your investment decisions because they cannot be trusted.",

The saying goes like this and we are witnessing how it works in the market.Expectation on Trump effects shown months ago on the market, fear about his tariff and trade wars with many nations appeared months ago but now it is coming back. Positive expectation did not come back recently but fear did come back and triggered the market crash.Bitcoin will recover, and it will continue its bullish growth in adoption and price. Trump will only be one piece in Bitcoin history, don't mind about him if you invest in bitcoin very long term.You need to know and focus on this HODL map than on Trump.https://hodl.camp/",

Don't confuse tariffs with his crypto policies, and the entire stock market is reacting negatively to it anyways so there isn't much value in correlating them.",

This seems to be a bit under-appreciated -- e.g., banks no longer need to consider bitcoin a liability or a \"pariah\" holding, but are free to create crypto products on par with mainstream securities.Unfortunately, all that was so 3 days ago. Short-term markets have a short attention span and forget easily. Tariffs are the new bugbear. Ergo, the weekend dump we've been enjoying. But the long term is the long term.",

We have seen so many such declines earlier as well so I am not worried about it. But if you ask if Trump is a positive influence or not, I think it's too early to come to a conclusion. There's a lot that needs to be done about cryptos in US. Unless the crypto companies can do their businesses without fearing the regulatory authorities, nothing will change! So trump has a lot to deliver. I came to know that one country in Latin America, El-Salvador has announced that Bitcoin is not anymore a legal tender there. It seems they need a loan of 1.4 Billion USD from IMF and IMF told them to reduce their crypto related activities to be able to get the loan. US is the largest financial contributor to IMF. So it's contradictory and confusing. I think we will have to see for some more time.",

We must make a back up plan to face any scenario that can happen.We need to realize that what he can do is create a friendly environment for bitcoin and the crypto industry to grow, not bring about a bull market because he doesn't have the power or ability to do that. The bull market is driven by many factors, Trump is not the only one and just because Trump is bullish on Bitcoin does not mean the price will always rise. Bitcoin is part of the economy and it will be affected by the economy more than any other factor. So expecting Trump to boost bitcoin prices is just a delusion of Trump fans.",

But it doesn't mean that the price will go up all throughout the year. Regardless if he is elected or not, Bitcoin's price will go up because we are in a cycle, unless that cycle has been broken already. However, that is not the case, so even if we see the price going below 6 digits again, you shouldn't doubt that the market will recover and bounce back and we might hit what all the predictions in this bull run, which is around $150,000-$180,000 top price.",

From what I know, his stance and support for Bitcoin before and during the election triggered the whole $100K thing, which is clearly how the market works, News and rumors.But, I'm not really sure of what actually caused the recent dip. If it was actually caused by the \"Trump signed executive order that imposes 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% from China\" as you've stated, then I don't think it was intentionally imposed to make Bitcoin dip. Just like ranochigo had, \"Trumps policies are for Americans,  not for Bitcoin\". Whatever orders Trump imposes is only meant to favor the people of America, and it doesn't matter if it affects others or not. It's quite unfortunate that Bitcoin and the crypto market is on the receiving end of his policies this time. I think those who had less expectations from him won't be surprise at all.",

Please understand the nature of Bitcoin it will help you not to follow all the news online that can mislead you into selling off your Bitcoin. Trump has kept his promises since he entered seat. Those that are needed to be enacted immediately has started. With time Bitcoin will reach the level we want just hold and stay patient.
