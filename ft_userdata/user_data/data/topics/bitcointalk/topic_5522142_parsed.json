  "content": "I came across this news and thought I’d share it here...Apparently, Amazon, with a massive market cap of $2.387 trillion, is reportedly considering investing in Bitcoin, similar to what MicroStrategy has done, as a hedge against inflation. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/09/amazon-shareholders-push-for-minimum-5-bitcoin-allocationQuoteThe proposal submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research calls for the company to add BTC to its treasury to beat inflationWhat to know:Amazon has a fiduciary responsibility to diversify into assets like BTC that outperform bonds, the shareholder proposal submitted by National Center for Public Policy Research said.The company's present asset mix of cash, cash equivalents and bonds isn't adequately protecting the shareholder value, the proposal added.Amazon's (AMZN) shareholders are urging the company to take a page from MicroStrategy's (MSTR) playbook by diversifying its reserves into bitcoin (BTC) to beat inflation and boost shareholder value.\"Though bitcoin is currently a volatile asset – as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history – corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term. Diversifying the balance sheet by including some bitcoin solves this problem without taking on too much volatility,\" according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR).Given the size of the company..  this could mean a significant inflow of capital into flooding the market.If this becomes a reality, it would undoubtedly trigger another bullish run for the market. How big might be the impact of this?",

Over the past five years, the price of Bitcoin increased by 1,246%, outperforming corporate bonds by 1,242% on average.\"And also said about MicroStrategy success in their Bitcoin treasury strategy.Definitely this is very welcoming news and could be after factor that could boost the price to where we expected it to be in this bull run, around $150k-$180k at least.",

      "body": "It's astonishing seeing companies being interested in entering the Bitcoin scene without caring if Bitcoin is currently at its top. Although it may seem reckless to some, this suggests that large corporations are afraid of missing out and are anticipating further growth in the next few years. Amazon has $585 billion in total assets; 5% of that is approximately $30 billion worth of Bitcoin. It's an insane amount. I'm not sure how that would significantly affect Bitcoin's price, as its market cap is almost $2 trillion, but the publicity  would have a positive impact by itself.",

We’re talking about one of the top 5 biggest companies in the USA essentially signaling that they don’t fully trust the USD due to potential inflation risks. By allocating a percentage to Bitcoin, they’re looking to minimize those risks. see that?This is really happening. As more institutional investors join in  (especially for long-term holdings) Bitcoin will become even more stable. It will further solidify its position as the safest bet to combat inflation, no matter what country you’re in.The fact that USD is one of the strongest currencies, yet a massive big company like Amazon still considers Bitcoin to hedge inflation of USD, that's really a very positive signal to all.",

Now it's come to be seen more as digital capital, which I would say is even better, it serves as a hedge against inflation but it's the best financial asset as well. Gold has traditionally been known as a hedge against inflation because it is decoupled from the price of housing or the stock market and keeps the value that inflation takes away from fiat currency but it is not a good investment in terms of returns in general. As bitcoin is now considered as digital capital it becomes like the new Apple or Amazon or Google of money, something to which analog capital will be transferred and therefore apart from hedge against inflation very profitable as well.",

They already know what Bitcoin is and its potential, but they were just waiting for the right timing, especially when regulations were in place. With the SEC approving ETFs, the risk has become minimal.So, as big companies start buying Bitcoin, the price will become unstoppable. It’s basic supply and demand - when demand is high, the price rises. And why will demand increase? Because these are massive companies. Even if they plan to invest just 5% of their market cap, we’re talking about billions of dollars flooding into Bitcoin.",
