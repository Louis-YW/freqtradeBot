  "content": "good evening everyone. Today I ran into a problem that made me ashamed of such a well-known casino as Steak.I bet on table tennis, at the moment the score became 10-9 in favor of the one I bet on. I immediately understood that if the score becomes 10-10, then I will redeem the bet (with a score of 10-9, bets are closed in this casino)the score became 10-10 and I immediately clicked on the redemption.as a result, the site thought for 7 seconds, and while these 7 seconds went by, the score became already 10-11 and I was not allowed to redeem the bet. just because their website is lagging. support did not help me, they just unsubscribed\" I am sorry but there is nothing that we can do in these situations, when our odds provider rejects cashout attempt all bets are being settled per the final result as stated in the sportsbook rules.\"I just want people to know that there may be bugs like this on this site and support won't support you.",

Yes, I can and will refuse, because the situation is absurd. I have been playing in this casino for several years, I bet small amounts, but quite often, during this time I have filled myself with VIP, and in such a situation the casino simply refused to compensate for its lags. especially since I asked to just cancel the bet as it would have been logical, but in the end they just ignored it.I just want people to know that such situations can happen and that such a notorious casino will not be on your side.",

      "body": "It's normal that there are delays in cashing out or accepting new live bets. Most bookies I have tested in the past, have delays from 6-8 seconds in Europe. Asian bookies are apparently 2-4 seconds but I have never played on such sites. This can sometimes increase even up to 10 seconds. 7 seconds is within the normal timeframe. There is a delay between the events at the venue and the picture you see on TV or live stream. That's why bookies have these in-built delays to prevent people from sitting at the venue and making bets as soon as an event happened. It's normal.",

That's what I want to convey to people.Well, you must understand that anything built by humans Is not perfect, like you said that this is something you've been doing before with out any problem, I still believe there was no lag, in my personal understand of how stake's cashout bet operates, the 7 seconds is a Mandatory time the gambler must wait for the casino game provider to process the cashout, and this comes with some level of risk as you would have to make sure that in those 7 seconds, nothing changes in scores, else the cashout will be declined.The reason you experienced this today might be because you weren't lucky enough today, probably the game score changed before the 7 seconds timer elapsed, this is also a possible reason, and not necessarily because the casino lag.Do not think I am siding stake please, I am just trying to look at all the angles to how your issue could be possible and not necessarily stakes fault, I stand to be corrected in any part I made a mistake or misunderstood anything.",

      "body": "I'm afraid it's not a bug. I suppose the delay is intentional. I mean, it is there by design. I have used sports betting sites besides Stake and there is also that delay. You will also notice that the feature that allows bettors to redeem their bets is not always available. It's normally available when the team or player you are betting on is much ahead in score, but if the score is a tie or your team is far behind, that feature might not be made available. Your team is probably losing; why would the platform allow you to get back a portion of your bet when they could get everything?So if you really want to make a cash out, do it ahead, when your player has the upper hand and the game is far from over. But that would sound crazy knowing that you could win bigger. However, bookies would also not allow you to cash out when the probability of you losing is high. In other words, both of you are after the money. Don't think betting platforms would allow you to have the advantage.",

I haven't encountered this kind of problem while spending on sports bets. Similar scenario have happened with crash games and I've tried other platforms and it is common.I click cashout at some point, but it happens later and the bet used to be a loss. Similar is the situation with Op. As most said we've agreed to certain terms and conditions and got into gambling. Possibly the support team will try to make Op understand what had happened.",

I also experience the same whenever the match is in play but there's no point in going through support since it's out of their control. Eventually, it made me adapt to the situation and now I usually place my live bet during timeouts or do it a few seconds early to avoid bet rejections.",

Yep, Cashing out during live games is very laggy especially if the sports that he made bets is fast phased game. Tennis match score can update with just a 7 seconds window time and I think betting on live with a purpose of cash-out mid game is not advisable. I play on Duelbits most of the time and cash out feature sometimes disable on some games even though the score is on favor to my bet. It’s very hard to justify on Stake an issue like this since his cashout time will not be recorded the moment he click the button since the odds and cashout amount varies every seconds that cause the lags.Just let it go. You don’t have any proof for this case of yours even if you are telling the truth.",
