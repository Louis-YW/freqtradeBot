      "body": "This is a frustrating situation. Winning $4000 from $300 doesn't happen every day. That's frustrating when you win it, and the casino doesn't want to pay your winnings. This is the most common practice for shady casinos. If you lose that amount on their casino, they wouldn't ask you for a kYC. However, I won't blame them for asking for KYC. But, I am curious what makes them wait for 20 days and then say they could not verify your identity. Did they explain what the reason was? What was the mismatch? Did you use a VPN while you used their website? Moreover, why did you choose a casino with no name in the casino industry? I don't think I have ever seen their name before today. The first deposit or new bonuses attract players to join new casinos. But you could lose your deposits there if you choose the wrong platform. There are a bunch of reputable casinos in the forum. You can select one of them to play. If you don't violate any rules, they will pay your winnings.",

A link was provided to the Isle of Man Gambling Services Commission which was completed by the player. I can confirm that they reached out to us to understand the situation, and we trust that they communicated back to the playerWe are at the forefront of keeping the gambling industry crime free, protect the young, those at risk and ensure that the services we offer are fair.

Is it true that after 20 days of pending evaluation, the video verification came as rejected? Can you please describe the reason behind this? Does OP provide fake documents? Or does the picture doesn't match the user on the video call?It'll be nice if you can also tell us why can't you reply on Casino Guru.",

I see and can --try-- to understand that you can't share the breach here due to legal reason, but I am certain you'll be more confident to share it with CG as CG's representative will filter out the evidences, locked private matters, and only shares relevant evidences that's permissible to be public comsumption.I understand correctly by your last sentence that you've been trying to reach CG as per today when you've been made aware of this case and the complaint on CG? If you haven't already or you reached to different contact, I am advising you to resend the email to the contact listed on the case, to \"tomas\" as the said contact is the one assigned to overseeing the dispute.I am hoping both of you to be cooperative with dispute resolution by CG.",
