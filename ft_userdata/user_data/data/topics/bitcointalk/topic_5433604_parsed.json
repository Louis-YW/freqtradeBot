  "content": "Hi all,I started investing in LCX 2 months ago and this week it has seen a 72% pump which is good too see, I do expect it to come back down however.I have seen a lot of people compare LCX to how BNB was a few years ago. I have only been in crypto 12 months so do not know too much about BNB but can see their all time high was in May 2021 when it was priced at £492.00 which at the time gave it a £80b market cap. LCX currently has a market cap of £33m - if it was to one day reach a market cap of £80b this would give it a price of £103.00. I am not expecting this anytime soon , would be happy with a £1b market cap next bull run, but is £80b possible one day? Also, looking at the BNB chart I see it did a 25x from December 2020 - May 2021 which took it to its all time high, what caused this?",

Those who bought or caused the pump may be the same people trying to recover their losses from the FTX collapse. The comparison with Binance is one good indication of hype since it's the top CEX right now.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on January 09, 2023, 11:06:11 AM...Also, looking at the BNB chart I see it did a 25x from December 2020 - May 2021 which took it to its all time high, what caused this? Overall positive mood in crypto and Binance's consistent marketing backed by delivering crypto products to the public. The quarterly burning also contributed to the price increase.",

You need to be very careful whenever you hear those kind of comparisons, and this is because the circumstances are never the same, how many coins have claimed they were better than bitcoin and that you should expect similar or even bigger growth than what we experimented with bitcoin? And how many accomplished their goal? Then when developers realized they could no longer use this as a marketing scheme as no one believe them anymore they used ethereum and not it seems it is the turn of BNB.",

This was caused by the bull market and the growth of liquidity in the BNB blockchain. In December 2020, the cryptocurrency megapump started. The demand for this blockchain increased dramatically, hence the price of the token also began to rise. It is also worth considering that Binance accounts for the bulk of spot trading in altcoins and this also has an impact on the price of BNB. If a new bullish trend starts now, BNB could also grow in price quite nicely.",

BNB got so popular because it's a token of a popular exchange binance and also probably because of the launch of the Binance smart chainI also Believe BNB is a highly manipulated token. I think Binance and CZ try as hard as possible to keep BNB a float, and we will know about these manipulations when it's too late.",
