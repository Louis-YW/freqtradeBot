  "content": "Two days ago I received a $50 payment from @icopress, my first ever online payment. I have get this 50 dollars from (Blackjack.Fun Liverpool - Wolverhampton) winner.I was really happy to receive this payment. And as I received the first online payment of my life from @icopress, I respect and respect @icopress from my heart and I will be grateful to him for the rest of my life. Thanks bro. I didn't want to waste the first payment of my life, I wanted to put it to good use, so I withdrew half of the money, and from this money I spent $10 to buy food for ten poor people, and the remaining $12 I enjoyed with my family having some good food. .And the other half of my payment I have invested in Bitcoin, I will hold it in Bitcoin, although I regularly invest and hold in Bitcoin using the DCA method on a weekly basis. But I have kept this money completely aside. Because this is my first online payment money so I will keep it separate. I have about $23 in bitcoin right now from my payment.After receiving my first payment I was so happy, at one point I almost had tears in my eyes. How did you feel after receiving your first payment? How excited were you at that time? And what did you do with the payment? I would be very happy if you let me know.",

      "body": "I am glad you received your first payment and had some fun with it. Though there are some paramount things you should know.Never ever think of gambling as a sound way to make money, always have predefined limits and strictly adhere to them. Don't let it interfere with your normal life. It should just be treated as entertainment, not doing so will engulf you into a delusional view of the world, which can lead to a lot of harm. Not following this advice consistently can insidiously lead you to addiction without you even knowing it. My intention is not spoil your fun, but money can be tantalizing, if you feel the urge to make some more - gambling your winnings may be the thing that comes to your mind, given that's it so convenient, is the only way you are aware of and you may not have other skills that can be used online. And given that your first online payment is from gambling - it could create a bias for gambling in your mind, a method that really can't be consistently used to make money, let alone be extremely dangerous if one doesn't understand that. So don't fall into this line of thinking if it does appear in your mind and store your bitcoins for long term!You have to be diligent to protect your bitcoin, which means never giving your seed phrase to anyone, not storing it by dubious means (a text file etc) and using trusted software. I also don't think you should disclose the amount of bitcoin you have on the internet. When you get to anything significant, disclosing the amount and details can focus you in the view of malicious parties.Good luck!",

Moreover, it’s good to hear that you feed the needy with a small amount of money. Now, talking about my first Bitcoin payment, as far as I remember, it was won in gambling. I used to play at PrimeDice and Bitsler in the earlier days; at that time, I won around 11 dollars, and I cashed it out instantly. I went to a restaurant and just ordered food with the money and spent money in this manner. If I had held that amount of money at that time, then definitely it would have been 500 dollars worth of bitcoins by now.",

Op I think it would have been nicer for you to have given images of possible , as I believe some forum members would love to see you helping a few persons. anyways it isn't much of a big deal . Seeing this post reminds me that it's been quite I while I went out to spread love to the homeless and needy since I have been very busy off forum too. I think will be doing something similar soon though I may not even post pictures of it.  As for the investment part you made mention of,  investing in Bitcoin is something you can do for funds you are will to risk and possibly ready to hodl for a longer term as short term hodling isn't that much profitable compared to long term hodling over the years. Hope you are not hodling on an exchange?Don't forget to keep your keys safe",

You are really a generous person, who used this money to feed 10 poor I never thought of this, you are a real inspiration. Although I am confused a bit, you said you do regularly invest in BTC via DCA on weekly basis. I mean, you must have another source of income then, so you might be testing online work or trying your luck on this forum right? Are you from Nigeria? I asked because they refer to each other so. Overall, if you are earning money in fiat and then investing in BTC that's a good thing I am glad for you, because investing from own pocket and making money online is definitely two different things.",

Of course, this is why we are in a bitcoin community to encourage people buy bitcoin because it is a means of freedom for us from fiat currency depreciation. I celebrate with you on your first bitcoin purchase and I do have joy to see new beginners investing in bitcoin.Make sure that you continue with your DCA regularly so that you can add more bitcoin to your portfolio, and don't stress yourself that much to invest aggressively, so that you don't over do it, but invest with what you can afford to lose. You have a kind heart to share part of your win with the poor. Rmem3not to leave your coins in an exchange and use a self custody wallet to keep your coins. Congratulations.",

You are very lucky mate as I too ha e tried a lot of predictions on the forum but with no avail though I keep trying my luck out. It's nice to see that you are  split the money and was even able to save, help others out with the little you have. You made the right choice, buying Bitcoins with the remaining funds. As for me, my first payment here on the forum came as a shock as I never believed I would really get paid such huge amount of money from an online platform. I actually won an art contest back then coming out first place. The excitement was endless and I was filled with great joy.",

It's visible in your post how excited you are and glad that you chose the right path to spend the money wisely by investing in bitcoin.I hope you have knowledge about wallet and how to securely protect your funds? I doubt thou because you keep the coin in an exchange wallet known as custodial wallet, you don't have the private key to the wallet and if anything should happen to that exchange now like bankrupt or cyber attack, your coins are gone. It's not advisable to keep coins on such wallet especially if you plan to hold for a long time. Read [General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?  to know more about the wallet.",

I think you did well by investing some of the money in bitcoin. At least you didn’t spend the money anyhow, even if the money might be small, you still decided to invest some little amount. But it’s better if you don’t just disclose the amount you invest in public, you shouldn’t show everyone the amount you have invested, you can just tell people that you invested in bitcoin, and it’s left for anyone to believe you or not.  You did what I like, I don’t know if what you said is true, you said you spent 10 dollars on 10 poor people.

I came out second in the art contest, and I was awarded about $500, which is the first time I have ever won anything from this forum, if I could remember correctly. But before then, I had already started earning from the signature campaign. For me to reserve that memory, I spent half of that money on personal stuff and lent out about 0.00876 BTC, which as of then was worth about $250, which I later received back on a different wallet that I tagged Roobet reward. As of the last time I checked, the price of it was about $500+, close to $600, and I don't even have the intention of selling it off for now.  It's really good to save up not only for the BTC accumulation shake but for the shake of history too for those that value it.",
