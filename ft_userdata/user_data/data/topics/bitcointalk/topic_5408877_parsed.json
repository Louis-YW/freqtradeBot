  "content": "With all the ruckus surrounding America right now; their part in the Taiwan issue and also their less than secret partnership with the Ukrainians, I think it's safe to say that Biden has a lot on his plate. But how about we add more?? We've had the issue of the Russians retaliating against all the sanctions imposed on them by threatening- if I can be allowed to use that word- to cut off supply of crude to the EU and the body deciding to reduce it's use and dependence on their oil. This sounds achievable, right? Fine..  Over the years, the US have been known to have amassed a lot of crude oil and gas to last generations!  US oil purchase history  And Russia has earned almost a $100bn just from sales to the EU. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's from such means they are being able to foster the war, so if the US can block this means and become the only supplier to the EU, it could cause a big deal between the US and Russia. But the question there will be; can they risk it?",

European tariffs and taxes on american commodities are very high. Enough to make importation of american oil an unprofitable business via default.A shift in oil supply cannot occur without significant taxation & law adjustments in the EU hierarchy. Then there are other impediments to this happening in the united states. Permits to drill for oil in the USA are not being given a green light. Oil pipelines are not running and have been shut down. There's a long list of things that would need to happen for the US to import oil into the EU. Most believe they're better off not knowing what any of those things are. Which makes it even harder to resolve the problems we face.",

For too long, the countries of Europe have tolerated energy dependence on Russia, which has constantly used it as a means of pressure on them to solve its economic and political problems. Now Russia is directly using them as weapons. With this in mind, the EU decided once and for all to abandon such dependence, even if at first they will suffer some material losses. Therefore, now there is a global reorientation of oil and gas suppliers to Europe. Europe is doing this, and doing it quite successfully. Yes, Russia will be able to supply its oil and gas to China, India and Asian countries. But the needs there are not very large, and it will need to reconfigure transport routes in the same way as Europe. But for Russia, this will mean the loss of the European market FOREVER.",

But the US has some allies that will probably come together to support EU's demand if asked to. After all, it's not only Russia that is rich in oil. But, in truth, I doubt if EU will totally cut off Russia's oil supply in the region. Not only is its effect more or less impossible to bear, some EU countries will probably not agree.",

In that sense, increasing energy production from renewables is fine, but it does not solve our problems. We will have to increase nuclear capacity for sure.",

This standing as the Russians defence mechanism against the sanctions since they have other supply channels.I think it will take a long while to build a channel from Europe to the US or any other alternate source and definitely depreciate the EURO.

It means that any oil or gas that is coming from America has to be shipped via boat and it can only hold a fraction of the capacity. It seems like taking oil and gas from Africa via pipelines, or even trying to figure out a pipeline through to producers in the middle east would be the next best option. For now it seems like Europe has to settle on a lot more shipping and it seems best to try to convert everything over to renewable energy as quick as possible.",

      "body": "The situation with oil in the world is quite interesting, I will try to formulate my understanding, trying not to go far beyond the boundaries of my own competence.1. There is quite a lot of oil in the world, but it becomes more and more difficult to extract it over time. The debit of operating wells is decreasing, the percentage of water cut of produced oil is increasing, it is difficult, long and expensive to explore new fields and drill new wells. The cost of produced oil is gradually increasing - and this is a global trend.2. Oil is different. The Brent and Ural oil grades are widely heard, but I think few people know that the Ural oil grade is not produced in the Urals (although this would be quite logical), but is obtained by mixing in a certain proportion light low-sulfur West Siberian oil and heavy high-sulfur oil from Volga region. Different refineries in the world are designed for different grades of oil and you can't just change them to another grade of oil without a dramatic loss in productivity. Moreover, from a mixture of different grades of oil, different refineries make different end products - such as gasoline, aviation kerosene, ship fuel for tankers and bulk carriers, diesel fuel, plastics, etc. And for this reason, for example, the United States, which produces the most oil in the world, still cannot refuse oil supplies from Russia, because for some types of end products it is necessary to add a certain amount of heavy oil to the input of oil refineries, which even in the current situation is easier buy everything from Russia (and this is the reason why Biden recently had to conduct humiliating negotiations for the United States in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia).In short, it is incorrect to talk about oil in terms of the number of barrels only.",
