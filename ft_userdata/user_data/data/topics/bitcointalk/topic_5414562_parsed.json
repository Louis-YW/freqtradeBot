However not the same can be said for other countries, for example in Qatar they force migrant workers to work without pay for months. It is so sad to hear true stories about how companies lack to provide any food or water to the migrant workers. The stadium that will host the World Cup in Qatar that was built by forced labor should be boycott. And as a result, I will not be watching the World Cup this year due to the human rights issues.",

And I believe that everyone should adhere to this rule.Agreed, it is a very vague question.As Laurendaldin said, gender, race, etc should not matter and in that respect I feel all humans are 'equal'. However as far as what abilities a person has and what they can do -- that is a whole `nother story: Can anyone be a top-of-their-field sports star? No. Can anyone be a concert pianist? No. Can anyone be a competent Engineer? No. etc etc. Yes, most people can learn/be taught to do almost anything. Perhaps with practice and experience they can even become reasonably good but - can *anyone* learn/practice enough to excel at it? No.To be very good much less excel at something requires a person to have what is often called a 'Knack for it'. That Knack is something you are born with, end of story. Everyone has different innate strengths and weaknesses and therefor in those respects are *not* equal to everyone else.",
