From a limited viewpoint, it seems the other two has indeed unfairly sidestepped Freeman. Not only was he not included in Stake, which was not just an idea he originally proposed but something he helped design himself, he was also kicked out from Primedice. But, for what? Well, we'll see how this case unfolds. In the meantime, I'd rather be cautious in dealing with the two platforms as their operations might be affected in one way or another as they get embroiled in the case.",

Yet it feels bad to watch his friends move ahead with a project he designed without proper settlement or information. Not really weird. I've seen similar cases like this before. This happens because one is greedy and wants more share than the others but you are right that this can be avoided if only they came up with a proper agreement or contract.It feels really bad to see your friend took most of the benefits (if not all) and that is why he came up with this because he can not take it anymore. His friend deserves this if I were to ask but I think freeman do also has his own fault on why he fully trusted his friend. Maybe some will distance their self on stake now after this issue sprung up, not only to support freeman but also because the said act is also shady. What if they are also manipulating the results? Because they are too greedy.",

If there's a court case, then the court will decide who will they favor and who is on the right side, it's good that he file a complaint instead of disseminating news that will harm the casino, it could go either way, the court could favor Chris Freeman or Ed Craven and Bijan Tehrani because Craven and Tehrani also insisted that Freeman's information false, and misleading.This is their statement on the article Quote“The complaint filed by Chris Freeman contains allegations that are internally inconsistent, intentionally misleading, and provably false.”, Let's see who's telling the truth based on the documents they provided.",

This is not the first time we have seen such ownership dispute in crypto world but the amount this time is insane. So just to make your funds safe, move to a different casino for the time being. Clearly the guy wants a settlement lower that amount because Stake will never pay him that huge amount just for the punitive damage. This lawsuit will cause a lot on both party and I’m sure that Stake know how to damage control on this kind of situation especially using there company bylaws to save them from this kind of charges.I understand that Stake might be a high risk as this moment but the money he is asking is too good to be true. I think a settlement for a lower amount is appropriate on this kind of lawsuit that clearly just want to share a piece of cake on Stake success.",

It's gonna be interesting how things will turn out in this case. It seems that is is like \"he said, she said\" paradigm. Only the court and the evidences will tell who is lying and how is not and who is liable. But I doubt that the court is going to grant that $400 million. It might be even lower if he accuser will win this case.How are you concern? if you are a investors, maybe, but for a player? as long as they can pay everything up front and for sure they have huge bankroll that can cover their players whether whales or small one.",

The firm even suggested that the lawsuit was desperate to spread incorrect information. The statement further read,“The complaint filed by Chris Freeman contains allegations that are internally inconsistent, intentionally misleading, and provably false.”The firm affirmed that it would stand its ground and not give in to Freeman’s demands. The founders of the Bitcoin casino were quite confident about the court dismissing Freeman’s claims shortly.",

I would have supported the idea of moving your funds if the suit was against government. Stake has released a statement and with the statement we don't need to panic. Even if $400m suit is made, it doesn't mean stake will pay $400 is too high. It's likely they will resolve the issue out of court.",

By the time Eddie and Tehrani have got 40% each. The agreement might've been made wrongly or else Chris Freeman might have waited for the right opportunity. As Stake evolved as the top cryptocurrency accepted casino of the world, he went for lawsuit. If not why should he wait for such a long time period.

Maybe he just read the article and sees that this is an empty lawsuit, just like the rape allegations from 20 years ago (meetoo movement)? I read the article and did not see any specifics (accusations) there, except that something was allegedly promised to him, etc. many years ago. If he had clear contracts or some kind of documents, he would have presented them, right?

We all can learn from here everything should have a contract even if you are dealing with your best friend, do not rely on a verbal contract, everything should be on paper and transparent, and it should be notarized because something like this could arise, Stake is considered one of the top three casinos in the industry and players will have a doubt and might transfer to other exchange, this is very interesting and we'll wait for more updates because this involves a very huge amount.",
