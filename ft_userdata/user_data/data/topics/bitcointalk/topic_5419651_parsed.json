  "content": "Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. Recently I donated blood to an uncle. And it was my first time. It was for an emergency operation and i was the only one who matched the same blood group at that time. The nurse at first took half of a little syringe blood to test if i was clean. As you know there are eligibility requirements. To be eligible to donate blood you must be:1.In good health.2.At least 17 or 18 years old, depending on the law in your country.3.At least 50 kilograms.Then after the results came good they laid me down and put the necessary equipments and syringe in my left hand. People might say that the needle hurts etc. But It's nothing more than an ant bite. So the blood was flowing and the bag was filling up. I could feel the blood flowing there. After the bag was full the i was given a bandage and was told to lay down for 10-20 minutes. So everything was okay until i mistakenly didn't eat enough after the donation which made me feel dizzy and weak. Eventually i recovered.   I always wanted to help others and this made me happy and proud. It was a good experience for me. People should donate blood if they can. It costs nothing to save someones life. In fact you might need someone else's blood (of same group) in case of emergency and blood isn't always available in blood banks.Should people come forward to donate blood? Tell me what you think! Have you ever donated blood? Tell me your story!",

Tell me your story!I haven't donated blood before and I'm not sure if I'd be able to donate blood in my current state but I do have a friend who has donated his blood a couple of times.   I do Believe that if there's a way you could help anyone then you should take that chance, and I've seen so many campaign been held for blood donations which is a good initiative. That your blood might one-day end up saving someones life.",

Tell me your story!If what it requires to save human life is donating blood voluntarily, why not.I however would first of all suggest to anyone who needs my blood to avoid consuming things that suck life out of the blood, and replace them with things that give it life... like the Word of GOD and good foods/drinks/meds. They will refresh anyone with lowlife blood. I think the problem is blood with low life/oxygen not really inadequate blood.",

Anyone that has passed/cleared to donate blood should do it.Knowing that I gave my blood to someone in need is humane and a feel good feeling.  Blood cannot be duplicated, so donating can save a lot of lives I wish more people would do it.",
