That's why I believe open-source apps are highly supported and advisable for users to use.I haven't really tested any of those because I still don't have a need for them right now, but if I do use them in any of my exchanges, I will really not consider using Google Authenticator again.

Even though our interface only mentions Google Authenticator, the majority of 2FA applications that utilize 6-digit TOTP (time-based one-time passwords) will work in Google Authenticator's place. The application must also use an initial 16-digit key to bind accounts (which is standard for most 2FA applications). In this case, you will still need to select 'Google Authenticator' as your chosen 2FA method when given the option. Although we recommend Google Authenticator (if possible), here are some popular alternatives that also support 6-digit TOTP codes:     Authy (iOS & Android)    Okta Verify (iOS & Android)    2FA Authenticator App (2FAS) (iOS only)    Microsoft Authenticator (iOS & Android)    Duo (iOS & Android)    LastPass (iOS & Android)    Most other authentication applications that support 6-digit TOTP codesIn each of these cases, the instructions in the above guide should also apply or be suitable for these apps. If you find that the instructions above do not apply, we recommend consulting your authentication app's help guide, or, confirming that the app in question supports 6-digit TOTP codes.",
