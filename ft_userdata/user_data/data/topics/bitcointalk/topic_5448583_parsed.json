Or the other way around, if the big countries are going to use this CBDC, as the news says it is used for cross-border payments, I don't know why they are going to need a CBDC for each one.",

The technology is already working and it makes no sense to fight it, so you need to lead the process.There may be other reasons to get a budget for such a project, but it is very small for such people.",

It would be as if for years, apart from the Euro, the Dollar, the pound sterling and other currencies, the IMF had its own currency that was accepted as legal tender in these countries (eurozone, USA, UK etc). I do not know if this CBDC is one more step in taking away the hegemony of the dollar and Biden, with his cognitive decline, does not know about it so will not do anything to prevent it.",

How will the US go against its interests?They want to become a global intermediary of payments between countries, but this is a primitive analysis. Their plans are made for several decades. One organization will control payments between countries. WHO will control all health care in the world, the UN will control a single army. Why does the world need so many states? I think you get my point.",

US nuclear power depends on Russian supplies of fuel for nuclear reactors, but Russia also depends on the US, so they will always agree. A single government is a dream when there are 8 billion people on the planet, but they are struggling with it.",

A single government is a dream when there are 8 billion people on the planet, but they are struggling with it.The USA produces a lot of oil, but three years ago it produced enough to not have to depend on imports. With the change in government and fossil fuels policy, production has been reduced and the USA now produces less than it consumes, so it has to import. There are no shortage problems but part of the price increase has to do with the reduction in production, apart from the war in Ukraine. Returning to the subject, I see the CBDC of the IMF as unnecessary if the others are to be launched, and vice versa. If a digital dollar, a digital euro, etc. is going to be launched, why the CBDC of the IMF? If we were to move towards a world government, which I doubt very much, the IMF CBDC would be enough, and there would be no need to waste money and effort creating and maintaining the others.",

And why should they produce a lot of oil at home when they can buy oil very cheaply in those countries where they finance wars?https://dcma.io/universal-monetary-unit.htmlThe Universal Monetary Unit has an interesting concept, it is both a commodity and a currency at the same time. It is still very difficult for me to say how this idea will develop further and how the sanctions will affect the development of the project.",
