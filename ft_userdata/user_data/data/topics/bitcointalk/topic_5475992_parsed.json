  "content": "Fom the way all the boards in the forum is structured, i understand that each of them Is designed to serve a particular purpose and that some of the board in the forum is for administrator and some, for  particular ranked users. It's easy to know that as a beginner, one should look out for threads in the beginners and help board because it will obviously give the user the necessary knowledge and guidance on how to scale through the forum and on how to deal with general bitcoin issues. Other boards like the economy, general discussion, gambling, altcoin etc is well spelt out and one can easily know why it is necessary to participate and identify in these boards discussions but my question is with regard to the local board.1. Is it necessary for everyone to identify with their local boards and participate in the board discussions?2. I would love to get a detailed aim For each of the local board and also know the kind of thread that's best to be created in the local board.3. If it's necessary to participate in the activity of the local board, what happens to the people whose local board is not in the forum.",

      "body": "The local board is just a sub board with different language used to the Main board, just to make the forum more easy or accommodating to members who aren’t familiar with the main board’s language (English) or aren’t fluent with it and nothing more. It is not necessary to be identified in your local board if you feel you have everything that you need in the main board. But basically it is good to engage in your local board because you might actually be helping others with the bitcoin knowledge they seek and that is the sole purpose of the forum. Also engaging in your local board exposes you to information regarding that local board’s country. Local board isn’t necessarily about each country but about language so when you have a local board that used the language of your country then it becomes your local board. If there is none then you and other members of same language can request for local board ( although it is not easily accepted)",

It's not all discussions that are suitable for the international boards as some of such discussion are relevant to bitcoin (or altcoins) but only important for very specific regions. Now, such discussions are better made in a local board. It makes it easier to onboard new people. According to research, people communicate better in their natural language and when in a community of people who have similar cultures as themselves — hence why most people just prefer to remain active in their local community vs the wider bitcointalk community",

In my opinion, there's no strict obligation to be active there, but getting involved can be beneficial. You'll have the chance to meet local acquaintances and converse in your native language. As for your second question, the answer will likely become clear once you engage in the local board. You'll see how it's organized and what discussions are happening. Even if your local board isn't on the forum, you can still contribute to the global discussions. You might also consider suggesting the idea of a local board to the admins.

If it's necessary to participate in the activity of the local board, what happens to the people whose local board is not in the forum.1. It is not a necessity on the forum that you must participate in your local board because it is just another board or sub-board in the forum like any other. But it is of great impact to anyone who participate in the local board. Not only is it impactful, it is also interesting and fun as you will be in pace with the current situations and realities that are peculiar to your language and country. The advantage of this goes beyond just learning but also gives you the oppotunity and platform to teach others in the community and keep youtself enlightened about bitcoin and other related and non-related topics within your location.2. I dont think there’s any spelt out aims to engage in your local boards. However, the broader objectives of participating in your local board is not far fetched from the reasons I mentioned above. Which is invariably to solve problems peculiar to your location, bring up brainstorming ideas and join other life related conversations.3. This question has been answered here by a member above so I don’t need to answer it again.As a newbie it is good to ask questions like this so you can help inform other newbies eager to know why the loca boards exist.Well done!",

There are a million and one people here that have been here for years and are not posting on their local board but they have been making ways for themselves all these while. Some people I guess do not want to identify with their local board as a result of being anonymous and wanting to maintain their privacy here as a result of the mode of work here.However, as it is not compulsory that one must identify with their local board, there are some possible other engagements one could be able to benefit from and they have been mentioned already by other members here. Brainstorming of ideas, helping each other to solving problems, talking of their country's involvement in bitcoin and lots more. I think these can be a way forward for the local boards.I think one of the major reasons why local board was created was for language barrier in communication. People or countries who can not speak or write English since it is the universal language here can easily get involved in bitcoin discussion conversations among themselves with those who knows English to educate and enlighten them more about bitcoin within their local board in their own local language for them to understand properly.",

It helps others to know that a particular country has active bitcoiners in their region though the main aim is educate themselves about bitcoin just as in the main board and other things going on in their country. The English used on the main board is just one of many languages spoken around the world; since English is not a universal language, not everyone will be able to understand it. For this reason, the forum has made the local boards available to help everyone along the way so that we can all participate in the forum and exchange knowledge. It is vital for non-native English speakers to identify their local board in order to participate in discussions if they find it difficult to understand the Main boards language although it is not mandated for them to do so. It's okay if you feel comfortable participating on the main board, but it's also cool if you want to join the local board. Just keep in mind that joining your local board is advantageous for you as well as no knowledge is wasted because sharing your skills and knowledge with others will help the board and, regardless of your level of understanding, you might learn something new.

I believe there are some people who participate in discussions on another local board because they understand the language spoken there, but doing so requires you to follow the local board's regulations.

However, if they are, they are welcome to join in and share their expertise with others there.",

I would love to get a detailed aim For each of the local board and also know the kind of thread that's best to be created in the local board. Yes it is necessary being in an identified (yours) local board because with one major reason that discussions are opened to be communicated using its local languages meanwhile the use of English language is not exceptional.Moreso, the essential reasons for the local boards is that communications are easy to be passed and understood considering the nature of your you are natively brought up as a matter of culturals and believes that is pointed at oneness in individual possessions.In the local boards, local threads can be compatibly discussed amongst the local members without disturbing other members of different identities in our differences of senses oh humors.The local board is best suit for the lazy more of the cultural adaptors and the local beginners at where they feels relaxed with their local communication languages.Other necessity of the local boards is that beginners or participants contributions are likely tolerating because it feels a brotherhood though all rights are limited.There are some of the Local Boards with sub boards where topics are discussed according to the differences of the sub boards in the same local board. This is to limit flooding the entire local board with unrelated topics that members are not interested about.This has made some local boards that doesn't have the childs sub boards to make request if they can be provided with it.Example is my local board which is \"Naija\" local board where we are in request if the authorities could grant us the request of having the above mentioned child's board in other for members to be specific of what topics are discussed or brought about in each boards instead of the randoms. These are >>>* Naija politics and societies* Economy* Off topics.This is so we can achieve the purpose of being in this forum as a prior to Bitcoin discussions because it was being overwhelming where non Bitcoin related discussions is being more than that the priority of the boards.Interested one could read further through the link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php? topic=5472580.msg63093506#msg63093506 .It was made an English discussion which everyone may be comfortable to flow along Quote from: Dailyscript on November 29, 2023, 10:42:53 PM3.
