Slave trade was a very bad business but when you look am for some angles e also get benefits for the after year in our present day life. Life itself is designed to be having two side which is bad and good so just as the slaves trade business dey bad that time e also help many things because this missionaries nai come open we Africans eyes on the natural resources that you are now exploiting and i think the adoption of their religion is not also a bad thing and if you feel say u wan go bad go worship the idols dem, everyone dey free to do am after all the chioce na u go make am. In summary i just believe that the whole thing was an evolution process for the African continent.",

They stole from us to better themselves, but that didn't stop us from living. Furthermore, some of the past customs and traditions practiced by Africans may be detrimental to modern life. What happened has happened, but it cannot be forgotten because it will live on in our minds forever. Let us keep living as we are now in order for peace and unity to reign everywhere.",

As you don know now shey you go go back to your roots that is the African Traditional Religion? The Church was involved in slave, there were africans that became wealthy off of slave trade, nobody is spotless. But that one na the past we move on to things that will make our lives better and ensure that our kids do not become slaves. Because like it or not, some forms of slave trade is going on in around the world.",

In the Blood of a Stranger, the white even say our gold were bad stones so they are her in the African scene to remove and take them to the sea and throw them aware. But some the African leaders resisted them and 99% were killed because of the resistance. OP whether you tok am out or u no tok am out di same thing still dey happen in di kwantri Nigeria. Di raw materials day we have, we are dey? Is it that we can't produce di finished product? Who teach di Naija Delta boys to cook fuel? Di modern slave is even stronger than di ancient slavery. We are to bed before eating. Luk at dis forum. Abeg make I no tok 2 much",

I don't know how you think that going back to our roots and accepting long forgotten customs and traditions of idol worship is a good idea. No matter what, religion is a per choice. Even with those still under parents care, a time just comes when what you believe in is tested. It is then a choice is made. Even if we make a noise about it, it won't hold water.Let's just know this and know peace.",
