After all, now is a period when they are following Bitcoin. Have you made a mistake? Think about this moment. I recommend watching the investment portfolios of other forum participants so that you have a certain picture of investing in crypto assets.        You can later regret for a long time that you did this. Don't radicalize your processes like that. Even shields shoot in such a market. At the moment, Bitcoin is preparing for a strong rise.",

But if you are a day trader or short term trader and have much trading knowledge then I will suggest you to trade with 50% of your portfolio and rest of them hold for long term. If you can hold it for long term then Bitcoin investment is a best decision for your future.Most of the time altcoins depend on Bitcoin movement and we all know about LUNA token how it crashed. So why we will not choose the most popular, decentralized and potential cryptocurrency which is Bitcoin.Quote from: Out of mind on July 05, 2023, 05:31:10 AMThe trust wallet I put my invested bitcoins in, is the trust wallet safe for my bitcoins?Trust Wallet is safer than any Centralized or Custodial Wallet. But as it's an close source wallet so it may not be fully secured as we don't know how the seeds are generated. That's why you should choose non custodial open source wallets like Electrum, Mycelium, Bitpay, Blue Wallet and  Alpha Wallet. My suggestion is to use Electrum wallet which have exciting features too. Visit their official website to download wallet or to learn more https://electrum.org/ Its available for Android, Windows, Mac OS , Linux and Python.Hope you got your answer.",

BTC on the other hand has been making money for everyone since its inception. That's why it is the safest coin out there.

Trustwallet is pretty good too. but I've read some things that make me doubt about Trustwallet if it's for long term storage. I only use Trustwallet for activities that involve a lot of transfer activity every day. sometimes I also use safepal.And I think your choice is quite right by choosing to invest in Bitcoin by selling the Altcoins that you have. But remember this is not a quick trip. but it is a journey that requires patience. because investing in Bitcoin is not going to go up as fast as it does in altcoins. but of course also with the risk of decreasing which is also not too sharp. In contrast to Altcoins where almost every day there are always altcoin projects that end up being scams and become worthless in a short time. so if it's for the long term then Bitcoin is indeed the most appropriate from my point of view. but I don't know your point of view and others. everyone has their own thoughts and plans. so DYOR.",

Don't put all your eggs in one basket.Trading altcoins requires specialized skills. Lacking these basic skills might lead to huge losses. Secondly, these altcoins might give high profit but the risk is also high. Many people have profited from the pump and others have lost so much money from the dumps and rug pullings. Everything depends on the willingness to take risks. Bitcoin is a reliable basket for all my crypto funds. One can hardly be wrong with bitcoin because it has never failed like others. In terms of diversification, I will prefer to diversify my income to other sectors apart from the crypto industry. There are other sectors that a viable which can give profit. But when it comes to cryptocurrency investment, my only option from now is bitcoin, until I have developed the guts to bear the risk of altcoins.",

Investing in bitcoin or altcoins is a personal decision. Wallet for storage: it is best to stay away from that trust wallet and use Electrum for bitcoin and metamask for altcoins.

Although altcoin pumps more during military periods and offers good profits, there are risks involved. I previously got good profit investing in altcoin but lost money investing in FTX and Luna. So i think altcoin is not worth investing for long time it can be scam any time. But investing in Bitcoin can be profitable if you hold it for a long time without the risk of losing money.

If you want you can use many software wallet like Electrum, Mycelium etc. These will be powerful to keep your Bitcoin safe.",

If you decided to invest in bitcoin then it should be that having a long term goal will be more aprreciated because short term can never give you the results you required, so I suggest 1 year to 5 years investment plan would really help to maximized your profitability in bitcoin.Quote from: Out of mind on July 05, 2023, 05:31:10 AMThe trust wallet I put my invested bitcoins in, is the trust wallet safe for my bitcoins?[/size]During my time I also used trust wallet but as time goes I have to change to Electrum wallet since most majority of people suggested is more cool than trustwallet.

This mean when Bitcoin price is decline, the altcoins price will decline too and vice versa.
