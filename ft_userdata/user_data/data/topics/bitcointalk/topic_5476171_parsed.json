Do not expect all-time-high this year as we said since the beginning in January, but we expected the price of bitcoin to increase and it did. The day to all-time-high is getting closer. Let us see what will happen after United States SEC approve bitcoin ETF and also some months after halving. Be expecting all-time-high by next year, but the price may increase more in 2025 which might be all-time-high.",

I am still waiting for all other altcoins that are close to bitcoin to react on the marketcap to find out how big the cryptocurrency will become this time around. It is impossible to control this market, and people should stop looking at the news, especially as the halving approach, as the bull will undoubtedly come regardless of the news and banter.",

With the way things are going, who knows what surprises the rest of the year might bring?Breaking the all-time high would be a significant milestone, could be before this year ends or maybe next year?

The next Halving will take place in 2024 and as many have expected, that could lead to a bull market. Even after the bull market, BTC will struggle to reach a new ATH. It will go up for sure but to make a new ATH will be a long road. It will reach new ATH no doubt. But it will take time. The journey is not going to be smooth. But the destination is already predicted. So I don't think we will see a massive change in the market at the end of this year.",

Let’s see how 2024 goes, I predict it’s going to be a very bullish year.Right, lowest low for this cycle is around $15,500, when the news about the FTX collapse, and with that we are like 120%++ growth already and it's continuing as of this year as we still have one full month before the end of the year. And there are predictions that we will hit at least $45k, but remains to be seen.But I think the title is somewhat misleading, maybe the better term is the highest for this year.As usually all time high is reserved during the bull run wherein we reach a new milestone price as compare to the previous bull run of $69k.",

Just some months ago, we were debating if bitcoin was going to hit a new all-time-high this year and here we are seeing it happen. It doesn't stop yet. In January, permit to say the price is going to explode(although this may be wrong), but our predictions in the community is that it will grow stronger in the first to third quarter of the year. This is what we are sure of. And nothing excites me more than this that it literally gives me goose bumps. HOLD strong folks.",

Bitcoin closed November at a price of $37,712 and the next expectation prices above $38k could last up to 31 Dec 2023 so that in 2024 the percentage could increase even greater.This year it still cannot be determined as a surprising thing will happen but it is not wrong to expect to reach above $40K if the market does not experience events or incidents that make prices fall again.Before the market experienced a large increase, trying to have Bitcoin there was still an opportunity.",

Does this year has more surprises for us and we can break all time high of bitcoin ? Well, as far as I can see, in January, there will be the beginning of the rise of cryptocurrencies, apart from Bitcoin, which is sure to lead the market. This December seems to be just right, in my opinion, based on my testimony in my few years in this industry.So what some of our colleagues here in the forum said is correct: we should not expect a high ATH before the end of this year, 2023. After all, our real battle is waiting for the day of bitcoin halving and bull run, to be honest, and it may actually start next year.",

Currently according to the developments so far it was a roller coaster journey of 2023, but 2024 is gonna bring something called wooop wooop.All-Time High is not a piece of cake here, we had just a few more weeks in this year left behind, and even if the SEC approves a couple of ETF's it will be hard for market to pump to the level of ATH.",

Does this year has more surprises for us and we can break all time high of bitcoin ? The all-time high will not be broken this year for Bitcoin, because the price of Bitcoin today is still below $40K even though it has increased by 2.87%. So you can expect a more logical price than the all-time high price, for example, like expecting a price of $40K in this year even though it is the highest price in this year, but if you expect an all-time high price, that means you have to be ready to wait for Bitcoin to increase up to $70K and that will certainly be quite difficult to happen this year with its already very short duration.",
