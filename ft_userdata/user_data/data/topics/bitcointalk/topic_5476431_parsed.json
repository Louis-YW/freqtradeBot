  "content": "It's the first time that the price of Bitcoin has been that high since April 2022, right before the broader cryptocurrency market plunged. Bitcoin's near 20-month peak represents a 15% climb over the past 30 days, with the price of the coin more than doubling since this time last year.The rising price appears to reflect continued optimism and excitement over the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. source We can expect Bitcoin price to reach $45,000 by the year 2022.",

      "body": "It is very difficult to predict where Bitcoin's momentum will stop. However, I think there is a strong potential for Bitcoin between $45k and $50k. Many do different types of analysis but Bitcoin is difficult to predict as it is influenced by many factors. It seems that the market is creating two environments, Big Pump or Dump. I am making an assumption based on my own opinion from Candlestick pattern that dump will actually come massive dump but this may not be correct logic. Another thing is candlestick chart patterns Market a bullish flag has been created. Currently, if you do this type of pump, it will not give you the opportunity to buy, it can go to $45k-$50k at once. However, no matter what we say, things will not be like thatÂ  In today's market, everyone should take action wisely.",

The recent meetings by the regulatory body with some of the ETF applicants is seen by many actors as the green light that it will be approved. Within a few weeks, the SEC has met with almost eight of these applicants but there are no official statements that all modalities have been put in place for the final approval. But the market is responding positively to these happenings. There are many chances that Bitcoin will get to $50,000 this year but as we know nobody of sure of the price the next minute so we just keep on predicting.",

Because current market sentiment continues to strengthen because many expect that interest rates will soon be lowered. And currently more and more instutition applying for Spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Not long ago, I created a thread discussing when we're likely to reach the $50,000 mark, and I also mentioned that Bitcoin is unlikely to surpass $40,000 within 2023. It wasn't a great year after all, and I didn't expect any pleasant surprises in the two-to-three months that were left. I was wrong, though, and woke up today to find that it has reached $41,000 and may climb even further. Its price is already increasing as I'm typing this post. It's quite possible to surpass $50,000 by March or April, which, from the lowest price in 2023, is up to a 3x yield in a smaller than 2-year period. Quite astonishing, if you ask me.I'm not quite sure when we'll have another ATH, certainly between 2024 and 2025, but it doesn't look that far from where we currently are.",

Â  Well, over $100k is easily coming this market cycle even without an ETF. It would be extremely bizarre if Bitcoin didn't easily surpass $100k in the 2024/25 bull run, like something truly terrible would have to happen to cause that.The last market cycle peak was $69k. Bitcoin goes much higher each cycle. It doesn't go back to the same peak as the last cycle. Bitcoin grows over time. The past few peaks have been $1150, $20k, $69k. Notice how it goes up a lot each time. You're confusing effects of an ETF with just the natural growth of Bitcoin. An ETF will have a big impact on Bitcoin's price, but that has nothing to do with why Bitcoin will go a lot higher than $69k.Also not sure why you think there was a perfect storm that sent Bitcoin to over $60k in 2021. That was actually a pretty bad bull run and lots of stuff went wrong. It was sorta the opposite of a perfect storm haha. Even 2017 which 20x'd that year and 100x'd from the bottom of that market cycle wasn't a perfect storm as there was the whole segwit/forking/bch drama in the middle of the bull run.In 2021 the market crashed in the middle of the bull run and then it took all the remaining momentum of the bull market the rest of the year to stop the crash and bring it all the way back up and a bit higher. Without the issues that happened in 2021 Bitcoin likely would have passed $100k back then. Now Bitcoin is much bigger (as is the case every succeeding market cycle) so $69k is not impressive this time around, just as $20k was not impressive in 2021, and $1150 was not impressive in 2017.Without an ETF we are probably looking at $130k-$150k or thereabouts (assuming there aren't any big issues like we had in 2021). Biggest chance of big issues this cycle is probably from governments like if the SEC tries to make a bunch of trouble to disrupt the bull run. But with an ETF I think that probably gives Bitcoin a good chance to hit a $150k-$170k peak this time around. I am not at all convinced an ETF is coming anytime in the next few years, so I'm thinking more along the lines of Bitcoin doubling to around $140k give or take $10k or so. Personally I'm playing it conservative and assuming it'll only go to like $130k.You should learn more about Bitcoin, learn about its history, its growth, how the market cycles work, and so on. Your statements suggest that you don't understand that Bitcoin is growing massively every four years. Just think about this - at this point in the market cycle last time bitcoin was somewhere around $7k-$10k, now its at $40k. That fact alone should make clear to you why everyone expects prices much much higher than $69k in 2025, and it has nothing to do with an ETF.But yes we should guard against overoptimism. For example some people last cycle expected Bitcoin to go to $300k in 2021. They just assumed Bitcoin would keep growing at the same pace and they forgot about diminishing returns as anything grows larger. This time I'm sure there are people who think it'll go to $300k in 2025 and again that is hopelessly overly optimistic. $300k would be a great target for the 2029 bull run (perhaps even a bit lower like $250k), not the 2025 bull run. But the opposite of over-optismism would be your statement of not understanding why the price would be larger than four years ago after four years of growth for Bitcoin.",
