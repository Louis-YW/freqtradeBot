      "body": "Yes, compromised.The best scenario for these, It's always you connected to some random website or you just interaction with a random unknown (Token/NFT). One thing you should learn, is never to interact with your wallet to some random website or token/NFTs you don't know.If you want to use a wallet for interaction with the website. My advice try to created multipler wallet:- Main Wallet (Stored Your Fund) but never connected to some website- Your Alt Wallet (You can use these for interaction some token/NFTs or website).In-case you got compromised. Your main wallet is not getting effected.",

      "body": "You should be the one in that position to answer that question and of course your coin got stolen and nobody knows what happened so it's only that can flashed back to know where exactly you got your wallet compromised. As first poster already outlined you need to be very mindful and watchful especially in airdrops participation this is what mostly gets people wallet compromised, then another is storing your private keys in a place accessible by another user which I think is very risky because even though you make another new wallet today and still save it there same person would still have access to that wallet. So you must keep it off from friends and families to enable you have full control over your wallet.",
