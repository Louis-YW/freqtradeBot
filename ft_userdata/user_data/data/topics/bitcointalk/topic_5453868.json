Then in the exchange even if you put bitcoin there, you can still transfer it to another non-custodial wallet.Unless it's an unknown exchange here, it can be said that you're giving your neck to the executioner, but if it's like Binance, I can also say that I'm a little complacent and at ease.",

Some people see open source wallets as the best, but we have to wait months for a developer to make a new update before we can download, just to be sure, especially for non developers. Hardware wallets also pose some vulnerabilities, the chips they use in building them can be compromised by hackers or even when a person gains access to the hardware they can take your funds. These are vulnerabilities in the cryptocurrency niche, but in all means keeping our keys is a good practice but avoiding exchanges as a way of keeping bitcoin doesn't absent us entirely from risks of losing money.",

It's the same as giving your neck to the executioner. Better to give your wealth to social institutions, war victims, and people who are undernourished than give your wealth to rich people who own the cloud and exchange.I agree with you that the bitcoins you put on exchanges is indeed not yours in the scenarios when an exchange goes offline or ran away with the bitcoins or stops withdrawals without any notice. Other than those reasons the bitcoins that you hold on an exchange is as much yours as the ones you keep in a wallet. For example: The money that you keep in a bank is also yours as long as the bank is not bankrupted, or hasn't flew away with the money. The scenario is same with the exchanges, as long as they are working normally your coins are totally yours.It's always better choice to keep your bitcoins in your personal cold wallets rather than relying on those exchanges. But, if someone is into trading then the only option for the person is to let the money on exchanges. We have no other option than trusting those exchanges because that's the only possible way to trade your coins and earn from trading activity. For a investor the scenario is quite different, the best option for an investor is to create their own cold software wallets and keep their bitcoins on those cold wallets. It basically depends on the needs of the users, and I must say that the exchanges are doing a great job to help their users even though people still prefer cold software wallets for the security purposes. I have kept my coins on Bitfinex for more than 3 years and let them on that exchange without any precautions, and when I needed to withdraw the coins it took me less than 5 minutes and the coins were in my own wallet. It's indeed a reality that few well-known exchanges are doing a great job for the customers, but still I would prefer to go with cold software wallets for security purposes because an exchange can flew away with your money without any prior notices. It's better to use the exchanges for trading purpose because they are most suited for that thing, and it's always a better choice to keep your coins in your possession for security and safety purposes.",

Storing funds on them should be avoided, because if actually you lose funds due to the service or platform been hacked then the chance of getting back this funds are slim(many exchanges that have been hacked are yet to return users funds). The ones that get back their funds are mostly platforms that are closing down and they inform their users to take off their funds.
