It's not wise for a campaign manager to keep the all fund that he received from the team and leaving the participants. You know what I mean. Even though we barely care about hunters, If you talk about justice, he should distribute what he got and of course keep something for his work too.",

Because transaction fee might cause a lot just to distribute this token with a mere 700$ value to over 1000+ address that will receiver their tokens. The token value assumption doesnâ€™t considered the price impact once this tokens sold since the trading volume for this token is just 1$ according to CMC market records.You will just receive a penny for a partial transaction while participants will still want to claim the remaining tokens soon. I believe all bounty hunters should have a both whether you re already happy on the current amount of tokens or not to your BM since the fee is really not cheap for Ethereum transactions.",

Youd think he'd want to clear the air publicly right? I didn't see him post anything in that old thread, and it's pretty shady that he deleted those questions on his Telegram group.Â  I dunno, the whole thing smells fishy to me.Â  Murat should speak up if he wants people to know his perspective andÂ  staying silent just makes him look guilty. This is some messy drama lol.Â  I wish theyd just put all the evidence out there and settle it already.Â  But from what I can see, Metropoly seems sus and Murat dodging questions doesn't help his case.Â  Just my two cents as an outsider looking in.",

Â [...]I take another look at this situation, I think the initial agreement was that Murat will be the one distributing the whole payment in batch, so they'll send him 250,000 and he'll split them in four installments. If Metropoly planned to send the payment to Murat in batches, I think they'll say something along the line, \"this batch payment has been sent to your BM\". Instead, their TG admin said they've paid him in full, and then refused on providing the TXID, arguing that it's a... private matter.edit: I dig further, apparently, the discussion about this payment continued on their telegram channel after that thread I mentioned earlier concluded. I think it's a classic case of a project being cheap and breaking their own commitment. Murat finally posted his deal with them around one month after last post on that accusation thread, and I don't know how any of you read it, but I think the initial agreement can be read that they will pay 250,000 token, worth [hopefully, if pre-sale succeeded] 100,000 USD, which they later revise that the allocated token is something worth 100,000 USD. So, the way I see it, the contract will either be 250,000 token, or 100,000 USD-worth of token. There is no info about how much does it worth during pre-sale as their tg group for discussion is not available anymore, so I can't track past discussion for their price, but if I may infer from what Murat say above, and what's shown on their website for their token sale, it was around 0.1 USD. So, if they claimed they've pay Murat in full, according to the token allocation they set by themselves, it should be either 250,000 token, or... 100,000 USD worth of token rated at 0.1, thus 1,000,000 token.As for why he didn't send the 62,500 token to the participants, it was also covered on their bounty group,",
