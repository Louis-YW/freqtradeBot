  "content": "I went to ICG this morning to pick up some orders, and was informed of a new decision:If a coin is \"loaded\" or has keys associated with it, there needs to be a way for ICG to verify this or they will not grade it.I use the \"Geek Bitcoin 5mbtc\" coin as the example that they did not grade.I personally talked to the grader and he stated that going forward, ICG does not want to take the risk of slabbing a coin without being able to check the public address....which is understandable even though they provide a disclaimer on the back of their slabs \"Value is NOT guaranteed by ICG\"There was also some hologram degradation, which was indicated as \"not sealed\" on the coin-flip and ultimately marked as \"No Decision\"UPDATE Dec 01, 2022:So I received a phone call from ICG this morning.....Apparently the information given to me by the grader was not authorized by the powers-that-be at ICG.They have told me that they WILL grade this coin and others like the Lealana XMR coins Owlcatz, you should be good to go for submitting them!I apologize for any confusion/mix-up that has come about because of this.",

Like for example the series one mybits coin does not have a firsts bits or a serial on the coin or holo but comes with a coa. If provided would that be acceptable? Possibly... I have submitted some of the MyBits coins previously and they have been graded.... but maybe moving forward they will not. ? In thought, there is technically no way to associate a COA with a coin if it does not have a way of identifying it to that COA....Quote from: Est2013 on December 01, 2022, 01:08:59 AMQuote from: Hox on December 01, 2022, 12:43:39 AMInteresting.

Can't really think of anything else they can do except give that thing a grade and slab it accordingly.   Sorry I meant more like a list of things I want/don't want...1. which way do I want the coin slabbed? You can get it front slabbed, or back-slabbed (?)2. Labels - You can request the Non-Casascius Labels if you want - Personally, it looks dumb to have a Cas label if it's not a Cas, but that's just me.3. Documentation about the coins I submitted - sites to check addressses, variations and links etc etc... I've been through enough mistakes with them to know you have to make sure you tell them exactly what you want, and I'm tired of some old-man named \"Skip\" calling me up asking about this or that error and why it's an error and such.... Anyhow, Maybe I'll just wait until PCGS catches up... I've been meaning to submit them for a year now anyhow. Also, just leaving the coins unslabbed for 2 years before submitting for grading can definitely affect the grades - all mine are in shrink wrapped air-tight containers for now.",

The thing with Lealanas though is ALL of them are buyer funded whether marked or not. None are funded by smoothie.And with all collectibles, there is never any way to verify the funds are actually loaded to the key under the holo unless you peel it and verify.",
