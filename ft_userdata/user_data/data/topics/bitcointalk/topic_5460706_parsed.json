  "content": "Hello, I met someone on internet who suggested that I invest in a crypto trading platform that I didn't know about. I did it step by step and made sure that it was possible to transfer the funds back to binance at any time. So I increased the volume and today customer service is asking me to pay 10% of my capital as a fee. What's more, they've told me that I can't pay this fee with the funds available on the platform, but that I have to pay it with funds from another portfolio. If I don't do this, I won't be able to recover my funds on this platform. The name of the platform is Hitcoin. Here is the message sent by customer service:Hello, after the Global Banking Regulatory Commission audits your HITCOIN account, according to the standards of the Turkish Tax Authority, investors need to pay 10% tax to the market exchange and the Global Banking Regulatory Commission. Calculate the tax you need to pay based on your profit in the HITCOIN market, -----*10%=---- The tax you need to pay is $----Pursuant to Rule 21(2) of the Treaty Rules of the Global Banking Regulatory Commission. For tax purposes, all secondary market investors must deposit taxable funds in the secondary market through an external wallet. Taxes cannot be deducted from the account, and you can withdraw all funds in the account after completing the tax paymentDo you think this is a scam or can I pay safely?Thank you in advance for your help.",

They considering your funds in their platform as their own now which is why they are asking you to deposit more. 100% scam move here by fake services.This topic is appropriate on scam accusation/service discussion rather than Bitcoin discussion.

Two things are involved here – 1. It's either the OP just made up the story to court sympathy or 2, they're ashamed to post from their main account.I mean, for crying out loud, how do you invest in something a random person online introduced to you without doing due diligence on it? With a simple click on search engine should give you an idea what that site is all about. Well, I know I sound harsh on this and that's because we've hammered severally on something like this here. Verify first before investing, always.",

As the Hitcoin has some huge volume across big exchanges, which their name could be used to scam some newbies on the crypto industry.To answer your question: as others have said above this is a pure scam scheme, they have achieved your first deposit now they need more money from you to sponsor their luxury life which is why they will definitely give you a huge profit so that your 10% tax they demand will be high enough and not something cheap. I doubt you will have any profit less down $10,000 as 10% of $10k is $1k which is enough to pay them for their drama. Just give up the chase and forget the money as they will never be pull out of that site.",

There are lots more you will encounter soon especially if you make it public to the social media that you are a crypto investor. Scammers are tireless and they will keep sending you messages.It's easier to separate your social media personal account from your social media throw-away account. Beware all the time of the scam.",

So, try to contact other team members on there social media handles. Try to tell the whole story in one message. And, ask on there social networks to give back your money. i wasn't able to find the exact link of the platform, if you could then i might look into it (i am not a professional) but i might give you some suggestions. (But you have to DYOR too). If they still do not give you money back then report their all accounts as scammers. so at least other will save themselves from such scammers.",

It's best to accept the loss and avoid falling into this new scam. Legitimate platforms typically deduct taxes directly from your account, not ask for external payments. Never trust random individuals online. If you plan to send funds to any platform, engage with the community first to share thoughts and gather insights.

If you are pay any tax to the Turkish government, Hitcoin company has to pay it on behalf of you and not you paying directly to the government. State Governments can't tax individuals on cryptocurrency because of it decentralization but they are taxing the individual through the trading platforms and centralized exchange platforms. So as this Hitcoin trading platform is telling you to pay the 10% from another source meaning you have already lost your funds in their platform already now they are planning to scam you from another ways. So the earlier you realize that you have been scammed and you better quit from any dealing with them before they take big amount of money from you.",
