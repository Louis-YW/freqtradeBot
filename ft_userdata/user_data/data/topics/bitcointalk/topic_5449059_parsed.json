Surprisingly Binance became stagnant while OKX and Bitfinex slowly closed the gap in terms of the exchange assets. We might see a change in ranking in future if the Binance issue escalates more. Note: Clean Assets excludes all the tokens issued by the exchange such as BNB, BUSD and etc..***I will update this on weekly basis to get data analysis for the changes in exchange status. Coinglass has limited info available so I will need to establish more data to give a better analysis. In the meantime, you can use the table as a basis to picture out what exchange is being trusted the most by the crypto user to deposit their assets. Thanks @DaveF for the constructive feedback.I'm planning to add ranking, rank changes, specific coins stated on exchange PoR and asset changes for future updates.***Source: https://www.coinglass.com/Transparency",

The 1mo nth inflow indicates how much money added or subtracted for a period of 1 month. All this data is gathered by coinglass from the wallets of each exchange. I will try to edit this and give more detailed analysis. Thank you for the feedback.

Then it's....not great.there's no way to determine this since the exchange itself doesn't provide a transparent PoR in real-time. I will try to update this table about this improvement once there are available data from CEX. In the mean time, The table will just serve as a measurement for the inflow of assets on an exchange regardless of the specification of the tokens coincides. You can use the data to determine if the exchange is already crumbling which is an indication that they might exit the market like what happened to FTX and probably on crypto.com & coinbase",

I’m confident that they giving a data based on their exchange data analysis software. I will make a thorough research on the company method for transparency.Quote from: Husires on April 28, 2023, 12:31:29 AMQuote from: Wapfika on April 25, 2023, 02:44:18 PM*Among all the exchange listed.

Seychelles is the home of this kind of rouge exchange that doesn’t have license to operate in other country. They probably good on hiding their tracks same with CZ.",
