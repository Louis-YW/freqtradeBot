There are many ways to get the data using API calls to services. That one time you need something that is not on your node for some reason the entire process comes crashing down.

It is not what it is really designed to do anyways.I'm currently running a pruned wallet on one of my PCs and I've never opened the other wallets for a few months and they seem to be synchronized just fine. I'm inclined to think that they are actually initialized at the start of the synchronize and they synchronize in tandem so it isn't really an issue if you don't open any of the wallets for a long time. I could be wrong, but I know that at least the wallets are checked at start up.",

It is not what it is really designed to do anyways.I didn't put some things into consideration. At first, I thought that if the OP could view the transaction history of his addresses before pruning, he might be able to trace the first transaction of his address to the specific block where those files are saved on the local drive, and then calculate the total amount of space from that block to the current block and prune the rest of the file. For example:If OP had its first transaction in block K and was able to determine the overall size of blocks from K to the present one, he may simply prune=N where N is the total amount he wishes to keep (MB) on his computer. I'm not sure the strategy would work.The best option is to restart a full blockchain download, or never prune your node in the first place.",

If you want to create something like e-commerce, creating different deposit address for each of your customers can be done in any wallet.And if the number of customers (and transactions) is not too big, even a SPV wallet can handle. But if it's something more serious, the wallet software will have to be Bitcoin Core, not a SPV wallet.But: for this you need only one wallet, you don't need to create different wallet per customer, it's enough to create new address per customer, all in the same wallet.However, you better confirm your actual use case....",

Do you think it can be possible to set my server as a client to generate multiple wallets ? SPV wallets would probably not be very good for any service in general, simply because they are very sensitive on both the security and the privacy aspect. I would probably recommend you to get a stronger server instead, because if you can't hold the entire blockchain with your storage, then your server has a good chance of not being strong enough.Using multiple wallets won't be viable for use-case with loads of individual wallets because that would result in a huge delay when synchronizing and loading up the various wallets while offering little to no benefits in terms of segregation. Having a database with the different addresses tagged to each user would be a far better option both in terms of organization and efficiency.",

The problem that you highlighted isn't really a concern if you know how to properly code and maintain your database. Using a wallet system to segregate your funds isn't a solution because you are operating an exchange, not a wallet. There are tons of transfers within the users themselves either through buying or selling other coins. If you were to initiate a transfer everytime the user makes a transaction, then things can get very messy quite quickly.I would encourage you to explore the possibility of building and managing your own backend which would greatly simplify your workflow.

You cannot do this without running an instance of Bitcoin Core or another full node/client. The solution that you've proposed can work, but you have to be careful to audit and understand the code when you're using it and not just ripping the code off somewhere else. Bitcoin Core is still a better solution, because you have the entire RPC API for you to utilize and all of the functions being built into it. The threshold for Bitcoin Core to slow down is quite high, and you shouldn't really face a problem with it unless you're having an extremely big operation, for which you should invest in a better server.Again, you don't have to manage thousands of wallets. You can easily just create a single wallet with all of the addresses and tag each unique address to each user. Best practice is to generate a new address for the user after a single transaction.",
