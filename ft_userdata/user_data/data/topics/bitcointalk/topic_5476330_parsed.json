Even for this forum, if you check well you go notice say almost 70% of the threads we de get for the board when relate with our country, e de mostly be regarding things when we no de do well and most times, e de blind us to the so many areas when we de do well for both the local and global stage.I know say na as a result of wetin most Nigerian de go through na him de make us para whenever we are giving the platform to air our view about the country but make we no forget say Nigerian de do extremely well in so many areas like;1. We de do very well for the Technology space 2. We de get one of the best brains for most professional areas outside we country like medicine and engineering3. Our entertainment industry na one of the best for the world. Nollywood and our music industry de deliver us wetin no nice4. Even for this forum, nija follow for one of the most active boards when de get quality conversation going on.5. Religion nko? You self you know the matter na.6. Our culture go well wetin no nice and if no be say we done de trowe some of them eh, Nija get amazing cultural lifestyle on a normal.So many areas de when we de do very well and I just want talk say make we try de talk good about our country sometimes. If others reject and speak evil of our mother land, we go follow then deny nija? Make we try de show the world say we be nija and say we no de ever carry last.",

It is Nigerians who are trying and not the country not minding the fact that you cannot talk about a country without it's people since it is the people who make the country. But then, when you assess a country you look at different areas like health, security, education, employment etc. These sectors have suffered and it is appalling. In the area of entertainment, Nigeria is in the limelight because it is individuals who run the sector. I put it to you that any day the government decides to control the entertainment sector, the sector will suffer because the concern will no longer be on bringing growth but on how to accumulate wealth.In the area of excellent performance of Nigerians in medicine and engineering, I think on the one hand, credit should be given to the countries that create the enabling learning environment for Nigerians studying outside to excel but the implication is that these countries retain them and Nigeria don't get to benefit from the knowledge.In the area of culture, it will be difficult for our culture to erode completely because the locals still cherish their heritage.In the area of technology, Nigeria has done nothing. Even the locally-produced cars by Innoson Company, the government still doesn't patronize the company. Innoson should have been used as government official car but it is not because we don't even trust our own so I disagree with you in the area of technology",

      "body": "Wetting you talk really sweet my Belle. At least i don see who don talk good about our country 9ja this year. Our country 9ja no dey carry last true true, but na just our leaders come make am be like say naso the country bad reach. One funny thing be  say the more the economy they bad, the more our youths dey discover there tarlent. If you check every thing we happen for we country Naija na Cruse, wetting no make sense Dem must turn am to joke by content creation or comedians go use am crack jokes even the thing go come sweet you. Just like wetting happen recently for kizz Daniel bouncer when them go show wey him push person down, and also carry him boss from who wan take pix with am. Now kizz Daniel bouncer dey trend and with that singular act, him don blow and many upcoming content creator don use that thing come to land light.Then for music in African, Nigeria na top for music we get swag. Before foregn musicians them been no dey like future Nigerian musicians, but check now Naija music dey trend for any music station be it mtv base or for some gotv channels even DStv etc. Everywhere Dem dey most African countries dey come Lagos now sothat Dem fit future Davido, Wizkid, burna boy and the rest of them make them blow. If you check the last show wey Asake do for O2 arena for London you go confirm wetting I dey talk. London girls no dey even mind say na pidgin language again self, e dey even sweet them. Bado wey be Asake oga self never even go show for O2 arena but him boy Asake don go dere. That is say the youth dey push Sha.Even for Nollywood wet you dey talk too. Dem Don dey try expecialy for Netflix. If you watch the standard of films dem dey promote there you go confirm say we dey try. E no be like all those nomarl once we dey regularly watch.Then for Doctor and engineering Nigerians all over the world dey try. For some countries Nigerians wey be engineer or doctor, them no dey gree make we come back again because of our hard work and smartness.Just take a look at wetting happen to Nigerians for South African zenophobia attack on Nigeria At 2021. From a report from a southern African lady that year show say Nija dey try. Wetting she talk wey cause that attack dey as follows:1) Nigerian Sabi dressing 2)Dem dey caring for women and romatic3) Dem dey hard working, Dem fit dey do 4works at a time4) Dem Sabi satisfy woman for bed, and them get big gbola5) Almost all the business wey dey south African na Naija people get am.So all this things come make south African women come dey choose Nigerian guys over there own men. Because there men dey lazy and depends on there women for survive where as ba vise versa for were 9ja man dey.As I also dey navigate through this forum I see say 9ja dey dey active pass so many local board. And we dey grow.for Some country local board no body dey give merits. Activities go reach 2000 Merit na 5 but for Naija activities go dey 500 merit don reach 700. Naija no dey carry last.",

No doubt if you check a common Nigerian dem deytry very well and we can see that in our music industry and our film acting, in academics abroad and so many things. But if we say make we look how the government don performance for this country,  nothing come out oo, for the government side e come be like say naija dey they go backward, where they government don take us reach the truth be say some years back was better than our present right now.",
