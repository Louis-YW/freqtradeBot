  "content": "I enjoyed the matches of today as well as yesterday, especially that of Liverpool versus Newcastle united earlier today. Am not sure am one to always dwell on the subject of football/soccer, but having to watch a team that has been handed a red card, struggle from a goal down to win or draw a match is one huge turn on for me. I just loved the spirit of the Liverpool team as the game heated up nearing the final minutes, the pressure, the focus, the discipline of each team mate at that moment was extra, because they all put in 120% more effort to cover the lapse of a man down. One phenomenal manager of all time I can remember that was a master of always being in charge of a 10man or most times 9man team is, Jose Mourinho. At the time he was at Chelsea FC, he was one who made me believe that even after placing a bet on a team and they befall such red card scenario, they could fight, equalize, and even win the match with a bigger than expected goal margin. So am asking, what's your all time favorite comeback for a team with a player or two sent off? Also, could you share some tips on how you managed to maintain composure or stay calm, when you placed a bet on a team with a sudden red card or a player or two sent off?Let's discuss!",

But two red cards has been mostly of expected outcome in a way the team given the red cards might likely lose. If Virgil Van Dijk and any other Liverpool's payer got red card today, Liverpool might have lost.

If you stake Liverpool to win, as Newcastle scored at 25th minutes, the money to cashout will reduce significantly. At the 28th minute, Liverpool players was given a red card, the money to cashout will reduce the more. Which means it is not good to cash out, better to accept what would be the outcome of a match.",

Also, could you share some tips on how you managed to maintain composure or stay calm, when you placed a bet on a team with a sudden red card or a player or two sent off?I've watched hundreds and hundreds of soccer games, and to be honest, I can't remember a specific situation like thisI've seen many teams manage to hold on to the result with one or even more red carded player, in decisive and exciting matches where the team achieved a historic feat of managing not to lose the gameWhat Liverpool did was very difficult, maybe it won't become historic because it wasn't a final or a decisive game, but it was a huge achievementPlaying with one player less after just 28 minutes, playing away from home, losing 1x0, and then winning with two goals from a player coming off the bench    If you add up all these variables, you'll see that the achievement was extremely difficultA lot of people must have lost bets on that game because of how unlikely it was",

      "body": "Liverpool's comebacks in yesterday's game is what I remember the most because it was very recent, and I'm sure no one thought the final score was for Liverpool not only because they were already behind but also because they faced Newcastle which was quite a good performance and also Liverpool's red card happened in the early rounds where the match will still have a lot of time left, but this is really a surprise and a lot of fun.I don't have bets on this match, but I'm also not someone who is used to cash out. I will only see that the opportunity to win looks closed, I would still prefer to let it go until the match is over and whatever the result, it doesn't matter anymore because when we bet, it's already should be prepared with all the results of losing or winning.",
