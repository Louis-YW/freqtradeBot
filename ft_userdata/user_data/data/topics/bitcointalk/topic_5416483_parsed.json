  "content": "Apparently according to the news :  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/07/binance-crypto-hack-suspended-operations Binance was hacked and it temporarily suspended the transactions from all sides as well, the issue was extremely bad since they nearly lost 500 million !! Please keep in mind that the revenue of Binance is 20 billion to just keep all the things in perspective. The hack was ofcourse resolved on time and the people whose funds were on there are safe now but let us examine what we can do to keep our funds safe. Some of my friends who are new in crypto were storing everything on Binance, sort of didn't look at the previous hacks as well, So what do you think is the solution? - Hardware wallets ? - Paper wallets? In cases we would be considering long term investment and trading would definitely become difficult, the time it would take for your coins to go to the exchange 💱 the price will get back up or down. Are mobile wallets the solution? Definately it's something to think about and I would love to know everyone's opinion on it, I do think personal internet safety comes first, from going on sites for free video surfing to downloading viruses off the internet without knowing. What's your solution?",

      "body": "The solution is to use a wallet which gives you full control over your keys. You should use a open-source wallet, so you can be sure that you are the only one who has access to the keys, In this way, you don't rely on any third party. If you want 100 security and protect yourself from being hacked completely, the other requirement is that your keys should never touch the internet. For this purpose, a solution is to use a secure wallet like electrum on air-gapped device or use a safe hardware wallet. Quote from: fiulpro on October 09, 2022, 11:10:31 AMAre mobile wallets the solution? There's always the possibility of being hacked if your wallet is online, whether it's a desktop wallet or a mobile wallet. Don't keep more than you can afford to lose in a mobile wallet. By the way, binance exchange wasn't hacked. It was their centralized smart contract that was hacked.(I'm not saying binance exchange can't be hacked. There's always the chance of that.)",

      "body": "If I remember correctly the hack happens on the BSC bridge, so the exchange itself is 'safe'. Holding your assets on HW or other wallets won't protect you from stuff like this since the attack is not targeted at your wallet. What can you do is probably be careful when doing cross-chain bridge and pray that when you do it, the network won't fuck you up. In other words, don't use the network/buy an asset on a weak blockchain if you don't want any risk. IMO, this is more suitable on the altcoin board since we're discussing altcoin vulnerability instead of the exchange.",

A hardware wallet is most secure but even a paper wallet is more secure than storing your coins on an exchange wallet. Buy your coins P2P and you do not need to even go near an exchange (unless you are a daytrader, but in that case I would still recommend keeping your coins off exchanges, if not in Bitcoin because the withdrawal fees are too high then at least in the form of a cheap withdrawal alternative like XRP). But thats really all you need to do to keep your funds safe...Be your own bank.",

They have suspended withdrawals of my full-KYC account with 2.3 BTC in it after performing usual (for my account) conversion operations by depositing ETH and withdrawing BTC in chunks, since I never keep such amounts on exchanges long-term.Having this account with them since 2021 with a weekly trading volume being around 15 BTC and never experienced such a problem. A few days after their bridge hack they have suddenly locked withdrawals for me after performing some withdrawals totalling 5 BTC stating \"Your account may be at risk. Please contact Customer Support for further assistance.\". All this considering that my account and login session data (IP, client and such) have never changed for almost a year, thus there is definitely no security risk. I've heard from others about their support being useless and just confirmed it myself. 24 hours later no resolution, no reason provided and only promises to resolve this issue within next 24 hours (again).  I suppose they are planning to steal this amount from me, since they keep total silence about this and refuse to disclose any information regarding this \"account safety concern\". https://oshi.at/oPKE.png (client withdrawal suspended)https://oshi.at/nkmj.png (API withdrawal suspended)Definitely would recommend to withdraw everything now and stay away from this exchange.",

I already said above, you have to own keys for your own coins, and use some form of p2p trading if you want to avoid risk of hacking and freezing your coins.If you want to trust random Chinese guy like CZ than go for it, but complain later when something like this happens again.Never forget how documents of million people leaked online, and how they received bunch of calls from scammers.Quote from: DaveF on October 09, 2022, 12:03:53 PMAs others have mentioned it was not a hack of the exchange but rather the cross-chain bridge.This stupid ''bridges'' are even worse, and Binance openly promoted them, they even forced people to convert many stable coins to their BUSD crap.They are also promoting withdrawal of Bitcoin on their centralized blockchain, so they shouldn't be trusted at all.Let's not forget their ''blockchain'' literally stopped working when this happened  Meanwhile - Bitcoin is up 99.98% of time, with 3,492 days since last downtime.",

For the average Joe I recommend hardware wallets, if he can afford it.If one does just a bit of research, he has a good chance to buy a good enough HW. And unless he does something extremely stupid, he'll be safe.Paper wallets are obviously cheaper, and I recommend them to tech savvy people who know how to generate them safely, offline, in a live system (with no storage).But they are somewhat static, if one wants to spend it's not straightforward to do the safety measures again and do all the handling like with cold storage.One handy solution - rather cheap imho - would be SeedSigner, which is not really a HW, but not far from that. Bitcoin only though.Quote from: fiulpro on October 09, 2022, 11:10:31 AMAre mobile wallets the solution?

I have a hardware wallet and of course, safe backup on paper.

But if you are a day trader, it's not going to be easy. In the first place, can you avoid centralized exchanges? You're probably looking for the right volume, pairs, fees, features, and so on. Big centralized exchanges like Binance is indeed a good option. But would you trust Binance with your money when it doesn't have a spotless track record?",
