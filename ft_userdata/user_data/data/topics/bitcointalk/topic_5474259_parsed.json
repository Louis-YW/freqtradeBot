  "content": "I like ones having cheap gas fees and optimism has been by far the best. On most transactions I see 0.00 on metamask, so you see how cheap it is. Since coinbase's base is also based on op stack it's also cheap. Arbitrum is somewhat expensive, I made two transactions yesterday on camelot dex, it took 14c for approval transaction and 33c for swap transaction, so about half a dollar to complete swap. Zksync era is also similar to arbitrum. I make 1 daily transaction on robots.farm game, it costs 30c+. Bsc, transactions under 20c mostly. Metis, I'd rate it lowest. Used it around year ago to use finance platform that's now dead, it was expensive that's all I remember. Celer, couple cents worth transactions. Cheap. Boba network, 20c fees. I dunno why I used this chain. Avax, 10-20c. Polygon it's good as long as matic price is within $1, otherwise transactions cost around 10 cents. Same scenario with other chains, cheap as long as ethereum is relatively cheap or their native token. Which I think there needs to be work around for. Chain gets more use, token becomes expensive, transactions expensive as well, back where we started. Comment if you got something relevant.",

Chain gets more use, token becomes expensive, transactions expensive as well, back where we started. So far, the Polygon network has proven to be very cheap and still comfortable to use. But sometimes that's the case when it's overloaded. The denser the network (nodes) the more expensive the price, like a group of media journalists validating proof of game work in the field. I think we should make it a point to understand the characteristics of the assets you trade that also offer the lowest transaction costs.",

I'm used to paying couple cents, and this is expensive compared to that.",
