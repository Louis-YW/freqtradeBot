Will you ask people in a Brick n Mortar casino this question, if you are standing face to face with them? I definitely agree with this. Even though I will show the biggest amount I won and biggest amount I lose is that I also won't show the total amount wagered. If someone ask me that question face to face then I would only say that I lose and won but never tell the exact amount as you might become a target a thief if you told them about it. I think it wouldn't be much different even if it is online.",
