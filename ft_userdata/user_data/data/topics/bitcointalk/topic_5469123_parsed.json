      "body": "First advice about using any wallet is that you should use a non-custodian, open source and airgapped wallet. The reason why the airgapped system is mostly advice is because even if you have a non-custodian and open source wallet once you expose it to the internet the risk of you losing your funds still remains, although this wouldn’t be from a developers perspective now but your own use case. Quote from: Not your key not your BTC on October 04, 2023, 12:23:34 AMYou are right If you come here, because here, we have a lot of community that can help you if have a problem with your Bitcoin wallet.

Because this forum create 2009 and trusted, and On that Child Boards you can find wallet where listed from 2012, which means, that wallet is old and many people use that and trusted. Not all, some of them on that child board are mostly too old and not much of an upgrade has taken place and that gives one a little problem. There are many wallets that have proven themselves worthy of use this days and they do not have a child board their example is the BlueWallet, Unstoppable wallet and Also passport (a hardware wallet). Many forum user have recommended them but they aren’t there just yet on the board that doesn’t mean they are good wallets.  QuoteJust install wallet in what you need, If you have bitcoin, just install a wallet only Bitcoin aplication, don't install wallet with many coins inside like trust wallet, don't do that!. that is suck. just waste you time and memory. there's no point in keeping shit coins on your wallet, instead, it will make your life unlucky, believe me, altcoins make your life unhappy.I would say it is matter of choice, bitcoin is the absolute coin but if you have your funds to gamble on Alticoins it is upto you. But when making your decision for wallet do not store bitcoin on all this multi coin wallet’s because most of them do not support features like bumping of fees, coin control or have the ability of switching addresses (HD wallets). This features are essentially part of a good bitcoin wallet. So stick to a bitcoin only wallet for bitcoin and use the multi coin wallet for alticoin except maybe it is an hardware wallet that supports all and you’re ready to have two of it",

It all just depends on the user's habits in operating the wallet. if it is a transaction that is quite frequent, many people will choose the one that is most comfortable to operate.but I don't really agree with your statement regarding altcoins. I love Bitcoin and it is good advice for beginners starting all their activities. Whether it's trading or investing, Bitcoin will always be recommended. but not all Altcoins are bad and don't make you happy. It all depends on our ability to manage and minimize risks.",

I dont think so, well at least on my case and some other who can balance being a bitcoin and altcoin enthusiast person. Maybe you are right on some tokens but not all, as you can see we have some great history or proven profits with altcoins that cant match by bitcoin holdings so you cant simply judge it just like that only my opinion.",

If a newbie simply wants to test the blockchain with 20$ or so, then a sw wallet should be more than enough (even an App wallet, and even (don't blame at me) a custodial wallet, for educational purpose only). But as his portfolio grows m, the newbie should move asap to non-custodial and, when he accumulates more than 5x the price of a hw, invest in one.About the altcoins, I agree that BTC is the best crypto to start with, but there are good alts too to discover as uou navigate the crypto space (obviously starting with, but not limited to, ETH).",

You can go for hardware wallet or lightweight wallet like Electrum but don't settle for trust wallets because it's everything that's wrong with an ideal  bitcoin wallets. Let's ignore the fact that it has multiple coins storage capacity as that's not the problem but the problem is that,  It claims to be a non custodial wallet but you don't have full control, nothing associated with Binance gives you full control. it's a closed source wallet  Doesn't support multi/change of address Those are some of the reason why you shouldn't use trust wallet and not because it has multiple coins options.Quote from: Darker45 on October 04, 2023, 01:55:15 AMAnd what do you mean \"don't install wallet with many coins\"?

But another fact is, that that section is comprised of almost every wallet but what I am trying to say is not everything on the forum is 100% safe. Instead, we should follow an educated approach to selecting a wallet. This means, that we are looking for a BTC or ALT wallet, custodial or non-custodial, Hot or Cold, Software based or hardware-based. Then look for the best options like which are open source and close source. And then study further. But a fact is, we can see all of this information in that section you aforementioned. You took the example of a Trust wallet, and which is a close source and not good for holding purposes. I forgot to mention that we should keep in mind for what purpose we are going to use a wallet, either it is for holding or trading purposes.",

Even if the forum was created long ago and those wallets were the best to be installed and used by users, time has pass and new technologies are been improved and upgrade than the previous ones. If no upgrades have been made on those wallets on the Child Boards, I will say it makes it seem not a more preferred option to go for now.

If you want to save only bitcoin, a wallet only bitcoin is the best for you not to get carried away or attracted to some altcoins when they’re been hyped or doing well in the market at that moment.

An experienced person who has spent much time in the cryptocurrency ecosystem knows how to counter its security but sometimes a mistake happens from them and they lose their bitcoins as bitcoin does not allow any single mistake. When a newbie comes to crypto he may not have any bitcoins because they don't know what is bitcoin and how it works a very rearly case happens when they know about bitcoin and I think they do not need any wallet at that time as they have no bitcoins but after some time in their early stage if they have to get bitcoins then I recommend them the electrum wallet which is more secure and simple one which would be easily for them to use and i don't suggest any high wallets which are more complex and that's for the more experienced persons.",
