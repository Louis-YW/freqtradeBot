If you mean decentralized betting, you can already see it on various mainstream crypto casino sites on this forum, such as Rollbit, Stake, Duelbits and Roobet. Every bet you place, you will get your bet data and also people can see your bet data and the results that came out on the bet.",

What I am thinking of is like using the network like eth and basically, you can connect your metamask or any decentralized wallet and there's no need to sign up to play poker. From what I observed here, people still prefer to use sites that do require sign-ups and using coins such as btc and other alts.

Because if it were centralized, some parts would probably be done manually with approval, even I think decentralized poker would be fairer.How about applications with the concept of dapps? I think they are inspired by blockchain projects which are almost all decentralized. With this, they combine the application with the blockchain into one, but cannot claim that they are just stealing the concept of cryptocurrency, because they are also helping the development of cryptocurrencies in their applications.",
