I mean it's obvious, when there is a bear market the price will surely decline. So it doesn't matter if it goes to $10k or further down, although they will call it the death of bitcoin but we know otherwise. For me, it's better to shut yourself out and then focus on how to increase your bitcoin holding in this bear market.",

The analysts can only predict the market situation based on the history of the price and some possibilities but these are never exact.

It was unpredictable, so when it was bearish, the price definitely drop gradually. From that point of view we thought its position would be between $32-$40k and from there it would go back to the bull market. But recently there has been a big price drop for few scandals. Experts are hoping that the bearish market will be a little longer. I think this bearish market is worthy to buy more and it would be the golden opportunity. In the meantime, whale Investors already bought and continuing to do it. Keep in mind that every market get bearish before the bull runs. Maybe it is indicating that situation.",

I believe we have to wait and see if this price call happens though.",

When someone is saying the price will rise or drop - it's a speculation and nothing else. Unless someone can see the future, we never know what's coming to us. So I will suggest to keep calm and wait for the right time to book your profit.If you believe that bitcoin will go higher in the future, buy now and forget it for next couple of years. Let the bitcoin go down to 14k which will give you another chance to scre more bitcoins at a lower price. This is an opportunity period.",

Let's say that we reach to 14k, not like we can never reach that it is a possibility for sure. But that doesn't change the fact that there will be some people who will say we will go down even further if we reach 14k, some people will come out and say there is a possibility of 10k, and if we reach that then 7k if we reach that then 4k.As long as this stays a market and not a stablecoin, there will always be people who say that bitcoin will go down and there will be some that will say that bitcoin will go up.

Otherwise whether price drops below $17.5K and a considerable miner capitulation occurs. Currently average mining cost and price are balanced, but if more miners switch off, we could see increased selling pressure from miners liquidating holdings in order to cover various loans for mining equipment, services, etc. There is otherwise a big volume gap betwen $17.5K and $12K, so if price falls further, I'd be expecting the worst personally.",
