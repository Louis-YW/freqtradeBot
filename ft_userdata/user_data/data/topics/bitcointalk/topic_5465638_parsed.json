I am sure every exchange holds Bitcoin on their balance sheet however maybe Bitfinex is holding more? I would love to see if we can get a clear amount of what exactly they hold.Well 8 or 9 months ago Bitfinex hold around $3.5 Billion dollars. According to th following news. https://www.google.com/amp/s/cryptoslate.com/bitfinex-closes-week-leading-bitcoin-reserves-according-to-glassnode/Â  Well, the timespan is 9 months almost and BTC really had provided a lot of opportunities to buyer and without proper or official news nothing could be for sure but few days ago someone made a topic here about 3 most BTC holding exchanges and Robin exchange was at 3rd positions but in those 3 exchanges list Bitfinex was not included. So it indicates that Bitfinex is not the only exchange who is reinvesting in BTC after making profits out of BTC. But still, I am open to all ideas. If I have to guess then I will say they might have around $4 billion in BTC. I know guessing is not going to help you.",

As after reading some of the articles both brother and sister firms are accused and blamed by many news medias that they are sharing funds to back each other up. To be honest, these holdings of exchanges in BTC are not that much in compare to the total market cap of the BTC so I do not really think these volumes could really have enough potential to create manipulation but of course there are many other factors also included that plays important role in manipulation of market and these 3 exchanges could play an important role there specially Binance.",

Alameda research and FTX is a good example of it. If somehow tether go down in the future bitfinex will try to save it in any mean or their financial connection can cash destruction for both company. What I am concerned about is tether's market cap. When every other stablecoin's market cap is going down tether is going up. There is something that is not right about tether. Also, it's based in Singapore, and the SEC already mentioned that a foreign entity can not issue USD-pegged stablecoin. So they will have a hard time operating in the USA.",

Or are you referring to the privacy risk associated with it? If you're just a regular trader I don't think you need to worry that much. Most of these addresses are trackable and it doesn't take a lot of time to consolidate which address is owned by whom as long as you have enough data. Most of them are exchanges or organizations that can be tracked easily imo. If you never use centralized exchange or if you mix your coins/use coinjoin then it should add another layer of privacy to protect your identity. But then again it doesn't matter if you willingly give your details to somebody else including which addresses you own, etc.",

Even though many people are worried that Binance might collapse like FTX or other exchanges, I think that CZ will not let that happen because Binance's collapse might shake up the crypto world globally and many people don't want that either.",

Binance is the one that went first with credits but so far, no big change in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.We have to wait for more regulations on centralized exchanges to have that.
