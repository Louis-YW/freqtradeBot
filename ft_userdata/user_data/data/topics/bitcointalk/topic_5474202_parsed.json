  "content": "If yes, then why is it that in terms of trust, they appear to be so different?I will give you guys two examples.My first example is 1xbet.com   Over here in my country, we have a local domain for this casino which is known as either ng.1xbet.com or 1xbet.ng, I want to believe that the global domain is 1xbet.com.Now, here is the thing, here in my country, we trust 1xbet to be one of the most reputable gambling and betting platform, Infact, there are hundreds of thousands of betting agents scattered all over the states in the country that are directly affiliated with this casino, and millions of gamblers all over the country patronize them.But coming back to the online version of 1xbet, we learn that the same company that founded 1xbit-(a casino proven to be operated by scammers), is the same company that founded 1xbet, and for this reason (I suppose) 1xbet can't be trusted, and many online gamblers advice other gamblers online to stay away from 1xbet, meanwhile, offline, this casino is highly trusted.My second example is Betking.io    Betking.io is another highly trusted betting and gambling casino in their offline version, over here in Nigeria, this casino is known as one of the most big and successful betting company all over the country, just as I commented here, they have alot of betting agents all over the country with millions of customers, Infact, in my street alone, we have 4 or 5 betting agents who are affiliate of betking.io.This is another highly trusted betting and gambling casino in their offline version,But coming back to their online version, they have the worst reputation in terms of trust, Infact, on this forum, Betking representative have alot of negative tags from highly reputable members of this forum, and we all are warned to stay away from playing on this casino.What exactly, or why is offline and online version of the same casino sometimes different in terms of reputation/trust?- Is possible that online and offline version are owned, and managed by two different persons?- or is it that some casinos do not know how to manage their online version well to build trust?Lets discuss this please.",

They are different casino.Regarding 1xbet and the one in your local, I’m not sure the background but some local version of the same brand sometimes have different owner/management. This is the reason why the experience seems different while they have similar brand.",

Or do the odds on sports betting and the frequency of winnings in slots differ?Of course, there is more trust in an offline office, because it is more difficult for them to refuse paymentWell, I am talking or discussing about their difference in reputation in particular, I've sometime played on 1xbet online, but have never played offline through their betting agents, so I honestly do not have any idea if online and offline odds of this casinos are different, I am particularly an online gambler, which is to say that, all my gambling activities have always been online even though we have alot of local betting agents here representing different casinos with physical offices and shops, I've never tried any of them.So I am particularly concerned about that difference in their reputation, not odds or frequency of winnings in slot or their casino games, I wouldnt know if there is a difference in odds if I never did try the both versions.So, yeah, it's all about their reputation that seems to counter each other that I am particularly interested in.Quote from: Eternad on November 15, 2023, 04:01:46 PMI believe you are pertaining to Betking.com which is the one popular on Nigeria while the Betking.io is already closed online casino that is once popular in the popular but shutdown due to failure on managing bankroll from their investors. I confirm that betking.com is online and is the legitimate one I am talking about, but betking.io is also still online, but doesnt look like a full-fledged casino, since the only the game find their is the Hi-Lo game.Thank you for pointing this out to me.",

Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 15, 2023, 03:56:03 PM- or is it that some casinos do not know how to manage their online version well to build trust?Another angle to it is that some of these offline casino's are not meant to run online arms because they are not prepared for it or do not have the resources for it, but they go ahead to ignore these all, and start the online side, as a result they fail. Not all casinos are meant to be online.",

Sometimes I noticed that this sites are dependants of the representative or customer care services how active they are to resolve issues and if they are that active and smart believe no one will file a case against them or even raise a topic for them, look very well you will see is either kyc problem or withdrawal issues and when a bettor starts passing through all these things they are easily led to create scam against them since they can't handle the situation.Note I am not in any way supporting any of these sites",

From this thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5267172.msg59824374#msg598243741xbet and 1xbet are owned by the same individuals or organization. This is because both websites use the same IP addresses and they both use the same wallet. There is no information to determine if these casinos are managed by different people but that might be the case.It might also be true that 1xbet was mismanaged which led to the decline of its reputation. It is easier to scam people in online casinos than in its offline version. Government regulations and policies and the casino's physical presence will make offline casinos up and running. They will do everything possible to make the business work because some person can be held responsible for their failure.",

I'm not sure if betking.io used betking.com's reputation. betking.com might be an established casino in nigeria but as it goes with many such businesses, they've optimized their services to this country's audience mostly. I browse online casinos daily and never happened to come across betking.com. Most probably that's because it's a casino specific to Nigeria. For casinos that seek out national licenses it's almost a must to actually optimize their services to the country they're holding the license at, so it doesn't surprise me.",

      "body": "I was thinking about it to be a casino owned by two different people but possibly they must have registered and paid to have the name in their favor as it is a popular casino that is well known in the gambling industry. The casino might likely varies in terms of administration and management activities because the both team experience in managing both  casinos also varies in different perspective as they are coming form both dimension and engagement. Looking at the both services, the online casino might have lapses with some aspect of the casino which would warrant uproars and definitely affect the casino as it is a virtual or digitally managed while the offline casino is more of the physical bet office very close to the people and are swift to responding to the complaint of their clients which is very much complex with the online casino. I think these few points are valid to go with.",

Therefore, the proximity is there and he could probably be lynched by aggrieved addict  . So they always would keep their game on top notch unlike online casino that remedy at worst scenario would be a court adjudication.",

Many of my friends bet in their physical shop, and even on the 1xBet online betting sites, they have been winning and losing just as they experience in other casinos, and there has not been any issue of withdrawal problems or account closure issues. This experience has been brought here to the forum before, and someone confirmed that they were close to someone who won close to $40k in local currency and were able to withdraw it. What I just believe is that most of these casinos have different representatives in different countries, and different licencing licences are being governed by them. Maybe the person in charge of the one in our locality still wants to maintain a good reputation, and it could also be possible that the casino active here can just be a partnership where someone else is completely in control of it and the main team might have nothing to do with it.",
