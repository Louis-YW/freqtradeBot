  "content": "Prior to February 25th general elections and with the new financial policies that has befell the nation, USSD code for bank transfer, which can be done on any phone, be it an Android, an apple or just a regular small phone without internet access seem to be having issues. It however seem more efficient than most bank apps these days.The whole financial system is being shaken and some still don't know how to use this USSD or even remember the codes from their various banks. I took the liberty of compiling the ones I could find, so as to ease the stress of using solely mobile bank apps that rely on data and 4g or 3g network coverage. Here is a list of banks and their USSD codes:*Access- *901*911#*Zenith- *966*911#*GTB- *737*51*74#*WEMA- *945*911#*FirstBank- *894*911#*Keystone- *7111*911#*UBA- *919*911#*FCMB- *329*911#*Sterling Bank- *822*911#¬†For those still having issues here, I heard OPAY is the new boss in town, they are winning grounds when it comes to money transfers and other financial transactions. What's your experience using the bank USSD and the OPAY for those who already use it? What other financial systems has been efficient in transactions that concern transfers and bill payments, besides the ones talked about here?How have you been managing this cashless economy mostly as includes daily transactions and commerce? *How has Bitcoin assisted in easing the financial stress, this period?",

      "body": "Thanks for sharing all these bank codes, there are still many of them, and even the Opay has its own USSD code that you did not capture here. That said, for quicker access, it's good to just google the code with the banks needed, and it will be easily displayed.Besides, Opay is doing well right now, another one is Palmpay, they both are doing really well and seem to have dispaced Kuda from its relevance.For the record, Kuda is losing yearly, I hope they will survive this. But must be with a better offer than what Opay and Palmpay have to offer Nigerians.",

Na so I hear oh, I dun download the app myself and wan open account with them ASAP. Before I think say na Kuda go strong for this period but e belike their high number of customers dey worry dem because their transaction come dey hang anyhow. Today self dem be get small network issues as their network been dey hang. All the bot I dun enter in the last 1 week dey always recommend OPay and na dem dey use this services pass so I no doubt their judgement. As for the USSD code, you do well to highlight dem all but we dey the internet age wey be say anything wey you need dey one click away. With Google person fit get any USSD code him dey find but nevertheless, I appreciate your good thought towards the members of this community, keep it up. As for Bitcoin easing the cashless policy stress discussion, I doubt anybody dun benefit since e no dey very common to use Bitcoin directly for the country. Mainly men need trade am to Naira first before dem fit spend.",

      "body": "Looking at what is currently happening in how commercial banks, wondering why such big banks are having network problems, especially banks like First and Zenith Banks, I wonder why everything is happening at this particular time, is it due to the new policies almost all the banks are having poor networks. This opay guys has one of the best networks currently with zero charges for transfer, so I recommend we all use opay before your money hangs, especially while doing p2p.",
