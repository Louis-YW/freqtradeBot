Maybe that could've got more attention of people and Nigerian government might've decided to make it the financial hub for cryptocurrency related activities among the African nations.Binance to launch Africa crypto awareness tour as adoption ramps up",

If the government can make it reality to partner with binance in the country, I think it will really help the Nigerian government to reduce unemployment and improve their economy that is nearly to collapse in the country.  It will also improve the crypto users in the country because many people are looking for this opportunity to come so that they will have fully access to crypto investment and to use it to improve their businesses in the communities.",

However, let us hope at the end of the day, this will bring positive news for Cryptocurrency adoption in the country. The Nigerian government seems very confused. The CBN seems to be standing its ground on the ban but the Security and Exchange Commission is beginning to be dynamic and flexible towards cryptocurrencies. The government is beginning to see how much it can gain from the crypto space. The Nigerian economy currently is in a big mess. The majority of its income from the sale of crude currently goes into debt servicing and the government must borrow to fund recurrent expenditure and petrol subsidy. The government is in dire need of any form of investment that would attract revenue. The CBN governor seems to be an archaic economist that is still tied to the apron of some Western and Chinese banks. Sometimes I don't blame Nigerian officials for their anti-Bitcoin policies because most countries that give them loans are against Bitcoin.  Quote from: romero121 on September 05, 2022, 11:29:51 AMWe don't know what is hidden behind the partnering by the federal government. Nigeria is a big market and has got the highest level of adoption and usage amidst the restrictions from the government. The government is found much interested in promoting the country's own CBDC eNaira. There is no form of publicity or promotion of the eNaira that would make it gain general acceptance or adoption. It is pegged to the naira and this currency has lost almost 35% to 50% of its value in recent times, and it is on record that unlike Bitcoin the naira never recovers its lost ground. Nigerians are smart people; hence they prefer to use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.  The hidden agenda might be that the Nigerian government wants to attract investors which would increase their tax revenue.

Another reason I think this is to regain the political trust of the government after oppressing their citizens.The election is next year and the ruling party is really desperate to retain power. These few months they would do everything possible to gain the trust and confidence of the people of Nigeria. They might be looking for some political and economic points to score. They know that the youths are now the highest eligible voters, hence they might be targeting to make policies to please the young population.",

They actually thought people will move there, but can just compete with a thing of the future (cryptocurrency). Also this partnership with Binance seems just like they want to win the heart of the youths to there side. Although it's a good thing I just hope they don't go back after Election is over",

We just hope that after the election, they do not impose additional restrictions or increase the ban. And, if the Nigerian government does enter into such a partnership with Binance, it will be a very good idea because Binance is the world's leading exchange, and Nigerians use it.",

I have mixed feelings about this development and I’m led to believe other people would feel same way. For a government that placed a ban and sanction on anyone trading crypto to now turn around to partner with binance after their initial vehement disagreement? It’s truly questionable. We can only hope it’s going to be a positive move and for the greater good of the citizens.",

Election in Nigeria is coming up and political campaigns have started I believe the current administration led by the All Progressive Party (APC) and president Mohammed Buhari want to deceive the youths who are clamoring for a better government with this update so that they can repeat the mistake of supporting their candidate in the forthcoming election once they achieve their aim, they will not only frustrate her citizens but crypto believers will be attacked and their accounts will be freezed.

I say so because it seems Nigeria likes to be tagged the \"first-in-this\" which in itself isn't bad but in some cases, makes no sense to me just like the Enaira. According to the news, NEPZA managing director Adesoji Adesugba said the proposed zone will be a first in West Africa and act similar to Dubai’s virtual zones, which are designed to provide crypto-friendly laws, regulations and tax incentives for crypto businesses. That's how they jumped in with eNaira to be the first African nation with a CBDC which in my opinion is not a successful project due to a lack of planning. Now they have come up with one. Well, in the next couple of days, I await to see what the Apex bank and Parliament will say about this.",
