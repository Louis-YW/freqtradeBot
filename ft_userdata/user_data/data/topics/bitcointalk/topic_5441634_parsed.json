Googling didn't bring up the results I was expecting.https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2022/05/where-is-binance-located/Quote“Wherever I sit, is going to be the Binance office. Wherever I need somebody, is going to be the Binance office.”Shin pressed the issue further, leading Zhao to say that he was not trying to “obfuscate” or “hide,” the company’s location, and that Binance was “in the open.”There are some addresses pointing towards Malta or Cayman Islands, however no clear public info about their official headquaters to be found.Checking wikipedia, some pages say they are not registered/unknow, some say \"Society of Delaware\".  How does a company like Binance pay taxes (if at all?) and under which law are they to respond to any disbutes?",

I thought their head office was in Singapore and that they were a Singaporean country but I could be wrong on that one.They have a lot of addresses (they probably share them with other companies too and just accept correspondence there).Their ceo can say what they want about not trying to hide the company's head office, it's still pretty well hidden if no one knows where it is. There's a chance the company itself is decentralised but then I don't know how you'd trust your board so much in that situation.",

It's definitely impossible if a company doesn't have a head office, just take a look with offline businesses e.g. KFC, Subway, McDonald where all of them can be easily find where the head office. I think due to lack of strict regulations that makes Binance can be operated illegally using a virtual office. Since there's no head office and no transparent financial report, I would assume Binance didn't pay any tax or they're trying to reduce the tax as much as possible. CZ can just claim if their head office in a tax haven country.Binance.us is really small compared to official Binance site.",

If people let Binance and CZ hold your keys, you don't have your bitcoins.I agree that centralized exchanges are risky as we have learnt many times in the past. But if I had to choose which exchange to trust, Binance would still be on the list of favored exchanges. CZ is present everywhere, he doesn't hide, he can visit any country as he is not legally prosecuted anywhere. I also never had the feeling that he is the same type of person as the FTX guy. It can always be a facade of course, but he has met his obligations for his customers at any time as far as I know. That might not matter to everyone, but CZ is 46 years of age. You are more grown up at that age. That still doesn't mean automatically that you can handle billions responsibly, but Sam Bankman-Fried became a billionaire within a year or so in his mid twenties. I think that's a bit more complicated. There is no time for your personality to really adjust to the new circumstances. Zuckerberg was young when he turned a billionaire, but he was running facebook for over three years by then, had a network of investors who could influence him and there are more limitations to using your own assets / shares for a gamble.",
