  "content": "Kumita ng kahit asa Bahay lang, mamuhunan at kumita gamit ang dropshipping platform na Seataoo.all you need is to be a Seller and start selling Seataoo products, and take your profit 3 days after your client received their order.Malamang napanuod or narinig nyo nato sa tiktok or Facebook nyo.SCAM NGA BA SI SEATAOO?First, let’s discuss what is Seataoo?Seataoo is an online cross-border e-commerce platform, Seataoo Philippines was established on October 2022. As a rookie cross-border e-commerce platform, Seataoo has been favored by users since its establishment. Currently, they got over 300,000 users as of June 2023 and serve 25 countries, yes! Seataoo not only sells or provides services within the Philippines but Globally.Seataoo also owns e-commerce websites like Shopee and Lazada. They also got an app in Android and IOS, achieving this platform as a rookie who just established last 2022 is already amazing. Although, I notice there a still some improvements needed to make their website, and app more user and customer friendly.You can also find them in their office on the 12th Floor, Co­co­l­ight Build­ing, 39th Street cor­ner 11th Av­enue, Boni­fa­cio Global City, Taguig City, Metro Manila, or contact them on their telephone number (02) 8712-7516 or reach them thru email at admin@seataoo.com. They also got a warehouse here in the Philippines but the address is not mentioned, so I’ll mention it here once I got the details.Next, Let’s discuss the Seataoo Business Model.Seataoo pro­vides a com­pre­hen­sive set of tools and re­sources to help busi­ness own­ers build and run their on­line stores ef­fec­tively. This in­cludes tem­plates for the store de­sign, ac­cess to a pow­er­ful sports prod­uct ware­house, pay­ment pro­cess­ing tools, and var­i­ous mar­ket­ing tools to pro­mote their busi­ness and at­tract cus­tomers. By pro­vid­ing all these es­sen­tial foun­da­tions, Seataoo aims to sim­plify the process of run­ning an on­line busi­ness and en­able busi­ness own­ers to fo­cus on their core com­pe­ten­cies and grow their busi­ness.They pro­vides free ad­ver­tis­ing and on­line traf­fic to help each store achieve sales, which is a sig­nif­i­cant ad­van­tage for in­de­pen­dent busi­ness own­ers who may strug­gle to at­tract cus­tomers on their own. By choos­ing Seataoo’s plat­form and ser­vices, these busi­ness own­ers can gain greater vis­i­bil­ity and gen­er­ate more rev­enue.They care­fully se­lect part­ners for sup­pli­ers, ware­houses, lo­gis­tics, and pay­ment providers to help busi­ness own­ers by pro­vid­ing them with cost-ef­fec­tive and se­cure so­lu­tions. By sourc­ing prod­ucts di­rectly from fac­to­ries and us­ing cheap and safe lo­gis­tics meth­ods, They can of­fer af­ford­able prices and fast de­liv­ery to cus­tomers. And by part­ner­ing with trusted pay­ment providers, Seataoo en­sures pay­ment se­cu­rity for both buy­ers and sell­ers.All of these ser­vices help busi­ness own­ers fo­cus on run­ning their stores and sell­ing their prod­ucts with­out wor­ry­ing about lo­gis­tics and pay­ment is­sues. Seataoo has its own cus­tomer ser­vice team trained to han­dle all kinds of af­ter-sales ser­vices to en­sure cus­tomer sat­is­fac­tion. This in­cludes ad­dress­ing any is­sues with prod­uct qual­ity, ship­ping, and re­turns. By hav­ing a ded­i­cated team to han­dle these tasks, busi­ness own­ers can fo­cus on other as­pects of their busi­ness and not have to worry about cus­tomer ser­vice.Now let’s Google the meaning of E-Commerce and Dropshipping so you understand more.What is “E-Com­merce”?E- com­merce is the buy­ing and sell­ing of goods and ser­vices on­line. It in­volves the use of the in­ter­net and dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies to con­duct trans­ac­tions be­tween busi­nesses, in­di­vid­u­als, and/​or gov­ern­ments. E-com­merce has rev­o­lu­tion­ized the way peo­ple shop and do busi­ness, mak­ing it more con­ve­nient and ac­ces­si­ble to a wider au­di­ence. It in­cludes var­i­ous types of trans­ac­tions, such as busi­ness-to-busi­ness (B2B), busi­ness-to-con­sumer (B2C), and con­sumer-to-con­sumer (C2C) trans­ac­tions like Lazada, Amazaon and Shoppee.What is “Dropship­ping”?​In Drop ship­ping, the seller does not have to hold in­ven­tory or worry about man­ag­ing a ware­house. In­stead, they rely on the third-party sup­plier to ful­fill the or­ders di­rectly to the cus­tomers. This al­lows the seller to fo­cus on mar­ket­ing, cus­tomer ser­vice, and grow­ing their busi­ness with­out the added costs and time as­so­ci­ated with man­ag­ing in­ven­tory and ship­ping lo­gis­tics.How Seataoo earn from this kind of Business model?Drop­ship­ping busi­ness re­lies on find­ing the best prod­ucts to mar­ket to their cus­tomers and typ­i­cally do not need to worry about sourc­ing, stor­ing, or ship­ping the prod­ucts them­selves. Seataoo’s pro­fes­sional ware­house di­rectly pur­chases prod­ucts from fac­to­ries with­out go­ing through dis­trib­u­tors, al­low­ing sell­ers to max­i­mize their prof­its by of­fer­ing com­pet­i­tively priced prod­ucts to their cus­tomers. Seataoo does not charge any com­mis­sions or in­ter­me­di­ary fees, only earn­ing a slight price dif­fer­ence when sup­ply­ing goods.Seller Obligation and RequirementsWhat is a Seller?The seller is the one going to choose which product going to sell on the Seataoo e-commerce seller website and the one who going to fund the initial worth of each product they sold.What is the requirement to be a Seller?Patience, ROI (return of investment) can’t happen in just a few days, it may take time depending on your seller site’s performance and the products you are selling. If you don’t have this then this is not for you.the initial investment to fund your Seataoo wallet (you only need to fund your wallet when you got orders) You can start with any amount but I think the ideal is 5,000 PHP ~ 30,000 PHP as initial capital or “puhunan”. Once you’re familiar with the process, you can now go for a bigger capital.You must be 18 yrs old and aboveYou need a valid ID like National ID, Passport, Driver’s License, etc for verification.You need a cellphone or laptop and internetYou need a PH bank account to withdraw your profit and cash in.Gcash, optional only for easier cash-in processYou need to a referral code: 81355897ll (for faster approval of your seller account) or you can register here with a referral-ready link.Once your seller account was approved, wait for the account specialist to contact you before publishing a product, He/She may contact you from your mobile, or email so don’t forget to add it to your profile setting.Tips: as a beginner, I suggest choosing a product that cost less than 200 PHP, so you’re not overwhelmed with bulk orders. Imagine you choose 500 PHP worth of products and you got 20 orders worth 500 PHP that’s 10,000 PHP initial capital needed.Note: Everyone can be a seller as long you got those requirements above even if you’re not based in the Philippines.Potential Income in SeataooIncome in Seataoo depends on the value of the sold products, on each product you can earn from 3% to 7% of its value. For example, If you set a 7% markup on all your products, you can earn 7,000 PHP on every 100,000 PHP you sold Maybe you worrying about how you can sell 100,000 worth of products in Seataoo then worry no more Seataoo is Global it serves 25 countries and that billion potential customers and all of its sellers mostly received bulk orders every day. based on other sellers' experience 100,000 PHP of sales can be reached in less than a month and if you put bigger capital and place higher price products in your store 100,000 PHP can easily reach in just a week or two.Sellers do not need to worry to market their shops as Seataoo will do all the marketing (Google ads. Facebook ads, Tiktok ads, etc). Mostly they just need to worry to fund the initial worth of their products from day 1 to the 25th until their frozen funds are moved to their wallet balance then all you need is to reinvest your current profit to get more profit or withdraw it.Based on my observation of how everyone gets a pie, here's an example, we a sold product with an original worth 1,000 PHP from the factory and we sold it for 1200 PHP in our shop, so 200 PHP is our net profit. This is 200 PHP net, 100 I think will go to Seataoo and 30 is for the shipping fee, and the last 70 will be our profit with this Seataoo and Seller both get profit in the end and our customer will get a free shipping promo. it's a win-win for everyone.Advantage of being a Seller early in SeataooRemember all products in Seataoo can be sold by its seller and as of now you can't add your own personal products (maybe in future updates) means everyone is selling the same item. For example, if you search for an item costing 200 PHP and below, you will see more than 30x search results for one item because every seller now selling it means it's too saturated. So being an early seller is a benefit since your shop can have more reviews and sales than the new seller who just joined recently, reviews will attract more buyers, and it's a sign of trust. Another benefit of being early you can advertise Seataoo and earn a 3% sales commission from new members you ask to join.Many people advertising Seataoo and asking for putting their referral IDOne reason is that your referrer will gain a 3% commission on every sale you got. This 3% will be deducted from the commission Seataoo earns from your sales, not from your commission. Also not from the amount of money you invested as capital. Seataoo is an e-commerce + dropshipping business, not an investment platform or networking business.Putting a referral ID is a must, for your seller account so it will be approved ASAP.as Referrers their responsibility (not mandatory) is to guide their subordinate, on how to operate their shop teaching them how to cash in, how to add products, what are the best products for starters, how to pick up orders, and how to withdraw their earnings. so if you're planning to be a seller in Seataoo, do not just add their referral ID, look for someone who offers to give their guidance and is willing to support you for your Seataoo journey.If you got any more questions feel free to contact me at https://www.facebook.com/seataoodubaiphQuestionable facts about SeataooWhy do you need to publish 10 products or more to get orders? if you published just 9 products you can’t receive any orders even if your store is still visible on the website or app, same as you got 10 items or above, so what is the difference even if you got both exposure. From my own perspective, all orders are possibly made by bots, since there certain conditions need to be met. If orders are really made by bots means where the orders really came from and the profits? Also, why did they force people to publish 10 products or more and fulfill all the orders else they will close your store? One possible reason is Seataoo force you to deposit more capital and discourages you to withdraw it all because if everyone does this no one can withdraw since the fund used for that also came from someone’s depositor. you are force to reinvest it until the right time comes (it’s up to you to think about what is that). Seataoo can’t provide any proof how the bunch of orders came from or where your deposit really goes to. if you know the answer feel free to comment below.Conclusion:Technically Seataoo took every work you may need to do if you set up an e-commerce + dropshipping website, in terms of site maintenance, programming, inventory, warehouse, payment process, and delivery. All you need to do is to set up your seller account, put some funds on it to pay the initial worth of the product you sold, and then take the profit after the customer received the products which take 15-20 days timeframe.Since Seataoo earns a small percentage on every product you sold as a seller, Why does Seataoo need to SCAM other people? It’s a win-win scenario since Seataoo and Seller both earn something on every product they sold on their website.But if everything from questionable facts about Seataoo (mention above) is true then this can be a SCAM in the future.Still DYOR (do your own research), it’s your money so you’re the one responsible for it, and in case you invested make sure it’s only your extra money.Disclaimer: The author is not related to Seataoo or part of them, I’m also a Seller and investor like you, here is my Seller website https://seataoo.com/shop/Sab-and-Migs-Enterprise-46420Sa may mga dagdag na tanongJoin our FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/seataoodubaiphJoin our FB Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/seataoodubaiphsource: https://eighteenus.com/2023/06/03/seataoo-scam-beware-of-this-site/",

Parang bagong concept sa akin ito kasi kung puwede naman magbenta mismo direkta sa shopee at lazada na ang babayaran lang ata doon ay commission mo bawat sale, cmiiw. Parang kanina ko lang din ata ito nakita sa isang group na may nag post pero pag-aaralan ko pa rin yung mismong platform at business model.",
