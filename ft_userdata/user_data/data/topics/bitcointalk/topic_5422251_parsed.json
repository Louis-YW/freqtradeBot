  "content": "NFL Week 11      Eagles @ Colts –  The Eagles may be the best team in the NFC although they did get their first loss last week vs. Washington. Last week was Jeff Saturday’s first head coaching game in NFL. Saturday gave Matt Ryan his job back and the Colts beat the Raiders 25-20. There was a spark created by the new coach and Ryan having his job back. Jonathan Taylor is healthy and the Colts will make this a competitive game.Colts +7Lions @ Giants –  The Giants are 7-2 with +14 net points while the Lions are 3-6 with -45 net points. This is an awful matchup for the Lions and I could see the Giants in a blowout. The Lions can’t stop the run and the Giants can run.  Barkley looks to have a huge day. It looks like it’ll be windy in NY and running will be at a premium. This is what the Giants want.Giants -3Jets @ Patriots – Now that the Buffalo Bills have dropped two games in a row the AFC East is up for grabs. The Jets are 6-3 while the Pats are 5-4. This will be another game in which the weather will come into play. It will be windy in Foxboro. The Pats allow 18.4 pts/game while the Jets allow 19.6 pts/game, 17.7 in the last three games. This will be a low scoring game.Under 38.5NFL top 3 games*Those signing up through Crypto Gaming Revu will always get help if issues arise.",
