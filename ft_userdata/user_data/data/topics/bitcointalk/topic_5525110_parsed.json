      "body": "For the SHA family, its intention is to replace the existing MD5 which was already broken. It's pretty trivial to make standards like SHA public because its meant to be implemented widely and keeping them proprietary and secret does nothing to help that. In addition, it costs nothing to the government and they had patented it. On a similar vein, GPS was made publicly accessible because it provides more benefits for the world rather than for the military only. To shutdown your conspiracy theory, SHA is widely audited and there is nothing obscure about this.",

What motives? Important question for Bitcoin The Bitcoin algorithm was made public to create a decentralized digital currency system that doesn't rely on traditional financial institutions. The motives behind this were to ensure transparency, security, and accessibility in financial transactions. <snip>This topic has to do with the SHA-256 algo (and its 512 and 1024 variants) - not BTC per-se. While the Bitcoin code uses it for encryption of keys that is not what this is about.The NSA released it to ensure that the world's financial systems and other parties needing very strong encryption ALL have access to it and for utmost confidence in it, full access to the code used. Having everyone and their brother coming up with their own closed-source encryption raises too many questions over just how secure it would be.FYI, now NIST is the organization that deals with encryption standards and they have already released 3 algos to handle the post Quantum Computing (PQC) world. https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards As the quote from Satoshi said, when needed, a PQC algo can be plugged in to replace the current SHA-256 one.",

SHA256 is not an encryption algorithm, and the speedup for it when using QC is not as significant as asymmetric algorithms.  SHA256 will not be weakened significantly to require a change in algorithm anytime soon, but ECDSA would be entirely different when QC is viable.One more thing, VPN are not using SHA256 for encryption of data. For the majority of them, they are using AES or similar asymmetric algorithms. SHA256 is a hashing algorithm, in VPN's context, possibly as a checksum to guarantee correctedness of certificate.",

I think the answer to this question must be something THEY benefit from, contrary to what some suggested above that they’re doing this for being good benevolent people.Compromising SHA256 doesn’t have sufficient impact on Bitcoin. A few ways for which it can impact Bitcoin is by:SHA256 computation speedup - Yielding nothing significant other than increasing the difficulty a little.Finding second preimage - Your resultant hash has to be valid with the valid block header hash, which is also quite difficult.Collision - Somewhat similar to the difficulty above.Generating hash collisions of Bitcoin Core files - Probably not the target in mind for NSA.Cryptographers and mathematicians have reviewed SHA and the other algorithms released as standard by NIST for years which has concluded that they’re secure enough. The US government uses it, and practically every company that guards their state secrets uses it. It doesn’t take much to figure out any weaknesses when the entirety of the algorithm is public and available.I understand how people might think of it as that way, but SHA family is pretty much a well known and audited algorithm. It would be far more suspicious if NSA or the government releases a closed-source and obfuscated exe and tells us to use it to replace the existing standards.Other than SHA1 of course, which has been insecure for the longest time.",

      "body": "QuoteCompromising SHA256 doesn’t have sufficient impact on Bitcoin.Only as long, as it is not about full preimage attack (which we still don't have even for MD5 or SHA-1). Because SHA-256 is used to calculate the hash of the message, which is signed. Which means, that if you can set a valid ECDSA signature, with a random z-value, then if SHA-256 is fully broken, you can produce a message, which will hash exactly to this random value, and then move those coins anywhere. Which means, that fully breaking SHA-256 is more dangerous, than fully breaking ECDSA, because then, you can hit two birds with one stone (SHA-256 is used inside ECDSA signatures, but ECDSA is not used inside SHA-256).QuoteSHA256 computation speedup - Yielding nothing significant other than increasing the difficulty a little.As long as chainwork is below 2^128, we are safe. But if it will ever reach those levels, then it will be the first warning, to start changing things.QuoteFinding second preimage - Your resultant hash has to be valid with the valid block header hash, which is also quite difficult.Not only block headers are hashed. You also have transactions, merkle trees, and many other things. If you have a second preimage for some transaction data, then you can present two different transaction versions, for two different nodes. And then, one node can think, that you did \"Alice -> Bob\" transaction, while another node will receive \"Alice -> Charlie\" transaction, with the same hash.Also, in case of transaction hashes, you have many ways, to put consensus-neutral data. Just using \"<520-byte-push> OP_DROP\" inside any input, is what would allow you to control more than eight message chunks, which should be more than enough for any attacks (in case of SHA-1 collision, it took five 64-byte blocks, where three of them were needed only because of PDF format, and the whole attacking bits were only in two of them).QuoteCollision - Somewhat similar to the difficulty above.What about colliding transactions or colliding merkle root branches?",
