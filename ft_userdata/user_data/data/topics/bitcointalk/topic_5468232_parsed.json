You are right in nano, the transfer fee is free. But don't forget that there were some significant changes to its ticker.Quote from: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nano/Nano has rebranded to a new ticker XNO and symbol Ó¾.For Tron, there is still a fee but that fee is very minimal so, it's not really hurting at all. Quote from: Joeyp on September 26, 2023, 11:03:50 PMPlus TRON blockchain is used in Tether USDT transfers. So NANO and TRON value can go up with time. It's true that TRC20 for USDT is being used by many and that's why it's kicking and alive but, just like the other networks when you're sending USDT, there's always the fee.",

I agree that TRX may have a limited potential for a 5x return from its current value, while ETH and BTC have a much higher likelihood of achieving that. Why don't you consider this option?",

That happened only because previously it was the only way of sending stablecoins with a low transaction fee. Now we got lots of decent blockchains where we can use USDT along with many other coins and send them into some DeFi protocols. Therefore, even the USDT allocation on TRX is declining and the coin is loosing its main benefit.",

      "body": "I continue to have faith in various cryptocurrencies such as BTC, Ethereum, XRP, Matic, and Quant. It's not necessary to base your coin purchases solely on transaction fees; there are several other factors to consider when buying. If I need to make instant transfers with low fees, I would prioritize TRON because, to the best of my knowledge, it is widely used. Many individuals opt for TRON to economize on transaction costs but I don't think it will give us more profit as compared to holding BTC and Ethereum.",

TRON payments are very fast, first confirmation ~ in 2 minutes and without any fee up to ~3 each day. So 0 fee. Yes, the USDT allocation on TRX can decline, but shortly this crypto coin is very good. Other USDT coins have transfer fees.",

To be honest this coin TRX never lived up to its potential and lost its objectives and rather ended up as a mere transfer medium due to its very minimal transaction fee and fast transactions. It cannot forever survive just as a mode of transfer as dev team has already given up and has not worked towards any further development I don't think TRX has any future, as you mentioned with emergence of new coins allocation of USDT will be reduced to great extend.",

TRON crypto currently is in 10th place with total market value - 7.6$ billions - https://coinmarketcap.com/yea but there is no trustworthy stablecoin build on NANO, so to transfer value without fee I have to be exposed to currency risk on super volatile asset. So its not worth it.As for Tron, the transfer on it is free only if you keep a large amount of money blocked in your stake for a week, which exposes it to currency risk, which is, in my opinion, not worth several free transactions a day. Especially since bitcoin transfers currently cost less than $1. But despite this, I believe that TRX is one of maybe 10-20 projects worth spending some time to do detailed research. The remaining 19,980 projects listed on CMC are poor copies or attempts to extort money through hidden pyramid schemes",

Free transfers - ~3 daily are even if you have 0.1 TRON ( ~0.015$ ) in your wallet, you do not need to stake it. If you need much more transfers each day, then yes, you need to stake some TRON, but even then, if you stake 300 TRX ( ~25$ ), it is not a large amount of money.And average Bitcoin transfers currently do not cost less than 1$, but much more.",
