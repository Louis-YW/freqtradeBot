In the \"Amount transacted\" there is question marked with pop up description saying \"USD value at the time of transaction\".Edit: blockchair was mentioned too seconds after i posted lol.",

You can use https://www.blockchain.com/explorer?view=btc or https://blockchair.com/.If you use blockchain.com (the first link), the bitcoin sent or received or the block you are checking would be estimated in current BTC/USD pair price. As the bitcoin price is changing, so the value of the amount transacted will be changing based on the recent bitcoin price in USD.If you use Blockchair.com, the bitcoin transaction would be estimated in BTC/USD pair as at the time the transaction was made, the value will not change to the present bitcoin price in dollar.You can decide to use which one you think is better for you. Some people will prefer to use blockchain.com explorer just to know the present price of the bitcoin transacted at certain time in the past, while some people will just prefer blockchair.com because it would retain the old price when the transaction was made, just like when solving dispute and estimating bitcoin price in US dollars.",

I am thinking blockchair and other block explorers are basically used by mobile wallets.",
