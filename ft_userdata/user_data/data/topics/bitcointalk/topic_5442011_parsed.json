I actually did the investigation about Epnoc in \"installment\", little by little when I have free time and that address is one of the aspect I DDed on the earlier phase [ignore the other screenshots, they were materials for other investigation, LOL].So, continuing what aibon reminded me, I did a stroll on \"street view\" on my earlier investigation on Maps and with a little effort finally meet their \"neighbor\", F324, Sector 63, NoidaSo, their address, F325, would be one of the three in front of them, either the dead center, the one on the left, or the one on the right. Problem is... here's the three of them, which... doesn't evoke any confidence for the platform.",

Who are you referring to if you don't mind sharing? I guess it's better to come straight forward if you have any proof of what you are claiming. What you are claiming would be such a bad move from a reputed bounty manager. Running a known scam project is dishonesty. But running a know scam project from an alternative account is dishonesty and a big fraudulent. Expose him, please.",

If I know who is behind of this then I could reveal the identity and I could create a flag against that user. But it is common to find pout a campaign by this type of rank and reputation is quite impossible. And reputed users will think twice before taking on a project.",
