  "content": "Hi all, I just put online:https://www.bitcoinmonkey.org/It's a trending crypto news aggregator.I initially created it just for myself, to find interesting stuff to read, and with Bitcoin Monkey I gave it a decent looking web interface.It collects news from all major crypto news outlets, categorize them, assign a score, and calculate some stats, in order to surface the best trending news of the moment.Any feedback, suggestion, or critique will be appreciated!  It's still in its early days, so it's a bit rough on the edges, and I am still adjusting the algorithm that calculates the score for each news and categorize them.PS: you won't be tracked by Google Analytics  I self-host a basic privacy-respecting analytics platform to get just a few info about website usage.",

Anyway I am not planning of plastering the site with ad banners (especially not Google AdSense or the likes).IF I reach the point where I will be able to monetize the site, the aim is to sell ad spaces directly to relevant companies only, and just have 1 or 2 (unobtrusive) spots in the page.Another mid-to-long term plan is to create a daily or weekly curated newsletter.",

Do you have any example?As for rearranging and search for specific topic/keywords, that's something I was thinking about too. A way to set your preferred crypto and topics to have a customized homepage to your liking.And maybe even compose a \"watchlist\" of specific crypto to see in the sidebar.But that would require a considerable dev effort, so it's something that might be done in the mid-long term. Maybe in the 2nd or 3rd quarter of 2024. Unfortunately I have only limited time to dedicate to this project for now, but your feedback is really appreciated!",

Dark/black theme would be great addition.4.

There's no top/cover image for each news which usually useless since it's just stock image.Yeah, I decided to not display those because they don't add any value and consume bandwidth for nothing, slowing down the website.Considering also the fact that news comes in from a lot of different websites, it would just be a \"soup\" of different styles, stock images, illustrations, low quality mockups, and so on.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 14, 2023, 09:41:52 AM2. It's nice to see a line contain when the news posted along with it's source and the author.As soon as I fix a few things with Reddit API calls, they will also have a list of the top Reddit threads talking about the news (and also HackerNews threads, plus some others to come).I also want to make the \"archive\" page for each source and author a bit more interesting, with also more info and stats about them.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 14, 2023, 09:41:52 AM3.

There are a few news sources I am planning to remove.What surprises me in your comment is cointelegraph. I always considered it to be a decent source of crypto news... but I might be wrong.I am also planning to add more sources: generic news outlet (such as Financial Times et similia), blogs and YouTube channels. But, especially with the last two, I need to be really careful and do an in-depth review of the content they publish.",

Thanks again ETFbitcoin!I might not remove cointelegraph, but since there is also a bit of human curation under the hood, I will definitely keep in mind what you said!Quote from: Potato Chips on December 14, 2023, 11:00:27 PMAyyy nice to see another news aggregator.Does the newsfeed --all recent news-- update in real time? meaning I don't have to refresh in order to get new entries?Potato ChipsNo, it is currently static so you need to hit refresh.But that's a nice suggestion! It should not be too difficult to implement an AJAX call that adds new articles every minute or so, without the need to refresh the page.I'll add it to the backlog.Quote from: Potato Chips on December 14, 2023, 11:00:27 PMAlso appreciate that I can create a permalink for the filters I've used hence I can just bookmark the link to get the same setup in one click.But I'm curious how these sources are sorted as it does seem random to me.Perhaps we can do either alphabetically sorted or top choices first then the rest is alphabetically arranged as a QoL improvement. I would also be interested if there's an optional compact theme or something -- smaller font for news entries, smaller sidebars.Ah, you're right! They are currently sorted by \"sources with the most articles published in the last 30 days\", but I guess that alphabetical order makes more sense in this case.As for the compact theme, not planning to have one yet. I want to focus first on a dark theme.A more compact version might come in 2024 then",
