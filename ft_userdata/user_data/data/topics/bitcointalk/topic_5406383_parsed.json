That means that you can catch-up on past Activity on-the-fly now by simply posting, without having to wait for the current Activity 2 week windows to close. This is not easy to grasp, but you should be able to reach Jr. Member as soon as you make another 6 posts (ideally more substantial than to date).From there on you’ll rank-up at a slower pace, once you meet the requirements of both Merits and Activity shown in the links provided by @OmegaStarScream.",

If you prefer to rank up, you will need to have quality posts, by so doing, your post will be given merit, in every 2 merits you received, you will have 1 smerits which you will be able to send to any other person's post, but which should be of quality as well.",

The behavior has increased year by year and if you check their post history then I bet you will have a hard time finding quality posts.Those are some of the things that some spammers are starting to like for merit, but regarding rankings then I'm sure the average of them won't make it even after all these years. It all depends on the quality of each user's posts, and if they can meet those requirements then nothing will restrict them from ranking them unless they don't post much.",

Uh huh.  This looks like a few other threads I've seen about merit created by members who've been here long enough to know what the system is and how it works.  In fact, I remember posting something in the last of such threads that kind of applies to this one (except the post history check, which I haven't done in OP's case):Quote from: The Pharmacist on July 09, 2022, 05:52:52 PMI checked your post history and the only other post I could see besides the one you made here is when you voted in the community awards thread.  Plus your post count is very low in general for someone who registered in 2020.  I have no idea why you're just now asking about how to earn merits, but a general rule is that the more posts you make the better your odds are at earning merits.  Take note of my suggestion of increasing your post count, OP.  It's really hard to earn merits when you've only made 24 posts in 16 months.Quote from: The Pharmacist on July 09, 2022, 05:52:52 PMThat's assuming this is your only account, which I seriously doubt.Oh, then there's that.",

Usually, we see the opposite picture: newcomers are most aware of the merits and rules of the forum.Apparently and i fee as well that this thread is best suited for the beginners and help board so, I'll kindly suggest OP thus moves it there.With regards to what you've said at his thread being the direct opposite of what we see often on the forum, I think OP is just trolling and I have this to prove that.Quote from: AsongJosh on July 15, 2022, 09:58:44 AMThe #Merit topic is very interesting. When I was brand-new member, I scalled through other members and discovered they were either Jnr or Snr members, while others were Members and Legendary, some Hero, I felt like I was really brandnew and intimidated by such two stars, three and four to five stars members. You know what? I comforted myself! I thought that when I start posting and as my days on the platform increases, I will be a Jnr member one day. Never knew my post has to be quality to attract merit and that merit too could influence my rank, or possibly not.Till now, I am a Newbie with 22 posts and just 1 merit. Please how do I know that I am making a quality post because I need to start posting high quality posts, get merits and leave Newbie zone. The statement in board letters gives me the impression that, OP is very much aware of the Profile rank and Merit relationship as OP has titled this thread.Mean while, its always surprising to see users quickly adopt to instructions and follow up perfectly in the bounty section of the form but somehow, can understand the other aspects of the forum that is basically expression of thoughts. Anyway, its good your back to doing actual forum participation, avoid plagiarism and be you in all you do.",

I also have seen a user registered on the month of May, 2022 and the user now is a member.

I dont even know where is bounty in this forum. I tried to find it to check the activities that go on there but all efforts were null and void. Does it mean the Bounty articles does not reflect here? Because the OP registered since March, 2021 and if he was writing on Bounty site. The activities would have reflect. I dont know that is why I am confused.",
