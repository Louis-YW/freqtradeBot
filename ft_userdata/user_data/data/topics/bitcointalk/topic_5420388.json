It was always going to com out in the wash and now the DoJ/SEC on the case it looks like its gonna be [urhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45elFFLgnEY]scrubbing day[/url] pretty soon...So, will ~16 hold and become the new base for another speculative run up? I for one welcome regulation in the space. Yeah I know GUBBERNMENT BAD... but don't forget, the regulators are going after the scammy exchanges and ponzi schemes that are screwing retail investors - they don't care about you and your sovereign Bitcoin, you are not a criminal... right? Keep your corn off exchanges, use them to transact, respect bast practice for privacy and you get all the benefits of Bitcoin with assurances that nefarious actors can't screw you.",

And maybe one lesson we learn is that it's not over, it might be hard but if we think about it right now, we should have bought that time, at least in my case. But I didn't, but in this current year, I have been doing DCA for the last 4 months and I will do it until I have the money to buy. If I don't then I will simply hold what I have right now and wait for the next bull run.",

I've seen despite the unprecedented times we find ourselves in, a lot more faith in Bitcoin recovering than ever before. A few years ago, it was almost unbearable the amount of doom, and gloom surrounding the price, and those dips were less or at least there wasn't multiple factors effecting the price. Now, I'm seeing people refusing to take a loss even if it was a small one. It probably helps that we've been through multiple bubbles, and deaths before. Although, it's still nice to see. I'm sure a lot of people are being effected by this dip mentally though, and it couldn't come at a worst time than the Christmas period.",

It can quite easily slip down further. Although, if you mean as an investment for the long term i.e at least a couple of years, I'd agree with you. The halving in 2024 probably is going to prove beneficial at the very least to our recovery. I'll be honest, it'd be nice to have some positive news, since the last two years it just seems like its a constant barrage of negative news, both inside, and outside of Bitcoin. Although, I think you're probably being a little bit too optimistic for a bull run in a couple of months. That'll take us to around the Christmas period, and early next year. I can't see with the reduced buying power due to the time of the year, as well as all the other things going on currently, any sort of bull run. Maybe, a slight recovery at best.",

For those who were active even earlier, today's price and all these events do not have to be so stressful because we already have similar experiences, but I believe that for all those who have only been here for 2-3 years, this is not at all easy to experience.The Bitcoin community should learn something from all this and start thinking in a decentralized way, instead of being naive and allowing various arrogant incompetents to parasitize all of us.",

This is another classic example, FTX crashed, affected the altcoin and then spill over the panic to Bitcoin market.Yes, we should monitor the market, but I don't think we need to panic or what, or sell in a lost. We should have this ability to just relax, let everything simmer down a bit, the price is fluctuating meaning there is also a constant buying and selling. So 50/50, others panic, but there are smart investors taking advantage of the situation.",

This is something new people here does not consider. They'd be out here saying and pushing people to hold without considering what more with reality. Ofcourse what is ideal is to just hold but not everyone has the privilege to do so. Invest an amount you can afford long. Indeed. But who's not aiming for profit? Ofcourse people would like to but there are just things we are not ready for. Selling early or late for sure has reasons and any would be valid as long as the owner itself made the decision to his assets.Nobody really wants to lose.I was able to buy 1 Bitcoin before but have sold it early due to an emergency and somehow I am still in relief from doing so even if it destoyed the potential or tendency to earn bigger.",
