There’s an exception to this if you are curious on the topic and want to know more info by asking question on the thread. It’s not wrong to ask questions on the topic that you didn’t know. Just make sure that you read all the replies in case your question is raised already by other user.Quote from: Promocodeudo on June 10, 2023, 01:12:36 PMAnother thing I notice that contributes to achieving our goals easily here is by making a good sentence with punctuation marks where necessary and correct spellings because good sentence will make a reader to understand our point of view properly, observation plays a major role in achieving our goals here because when you observe some you feel thats not well explained you can ask question for more explanation or you may even quite the person on the contrary that's if you know it , seriousness is another way of making our goals to be fulfilled, I wish to be like other member who has achieve some goals in this forum.You can solved this issue by using auto correct apps like grammarly.

English is not the native Language of some people in this forum, so they may not be very good at it, but expressing yourself and making some sense when you write here is needed. Because this forum is not about English and not for only English speakers, if you express yourself properly even with a poorly punctuated write-up and somebody understands you, they will still contribute to your discussion because they understand what you're trying to say. What your goal should be is to make some sense whenever you write.",

In order to do that is to read what the topic is all about then you'll understand what it is and can join the discussion. There are other platforms where you can learn about Bitcoin but as you can see, this is one of the platforms that you can learn from.

It's better to lurk for months without contributing much than to shitpost messages of no interest.To help you with your researches if you ever feel like browsing the forum, I recommend the excellent ninjastic.space site; I don't know if you've heard of it, but it offers much better results than the forum's built-in search function.",

Taking the time to read and understand others' posts, and then contributing with well-structured sentences makes our communication clearer and more effective. It is like a universal rule for online communities.

To achieve success in this forum, you must be dedicated and willing to learn and enhance your knowledge about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. It may take time, but it all depends on how serious you are. We have seen people grow on the forum within a year and accomplish a lot in a short period of time.",

I see that many people starts to shortcut sentences and even words, thanks to what people see in social media. Honestly, the forum is much greater in terms of that and people in here write better related to the topics that have been made. It's sad to see that writing great isn't really a thing in the social media but that's it. Wherever you are going and writing, making sentences and correct punctuations are practiced here. But the thought of what has been said is the most important thing to make it understand the point of what you're saying. Anyway, enjoy your stay here promocodeudo.",

You might have missed a punctuation marks here and there or maybe the sentence construction is not correct, it's understandable though, majority of us here are not native speaker to begin with, so we are going to make mistakes.But the thing is that members here knows that, so most of the time they will try their best to understand what you are trying to point out, or if you have questions then they will give you a feedback that they know you can understand.Just continue to go around different boards and for sure you will learn a thing or two along the way.",

In this forum we also get useful information and also give useful information to others. Discussions should be avoided where there is no information about the subject. explaining to others in simple and easy words should be the first priority so that others can understand more easily. Some people are not able to organize their words, which makes it difficult to understand the next person. ever since I joined this platform I have learned a lot from this platform, but on any topic that I do not remember information about, where I think that I cannot give useful advice to anyone on that topic, then I avoid from discussing that topic.",
