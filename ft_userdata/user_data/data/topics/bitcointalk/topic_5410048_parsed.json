Then there was a problem with a hashrate drop and I used windows 10. But there were other problems with remote control.https://whattomine.com/gpus/73-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USDEthereum(ETH) and Conflux(CFX) are not for 4 GB graphics cards.Ravencoin(RVN) is a hot algorithm even for a regular video card, but it is the most profitable one.According to my memory, Windows 7 did not take more than 400 MB from the RAM of the video card, but it was a 10x0 series.In a normal PC, you can use 2 video cards. Install the main video card for example GT710 and Windows will use its resources, your 4 GB on the second video card will be free for mining. But in a laptop, I would use hive os.",
