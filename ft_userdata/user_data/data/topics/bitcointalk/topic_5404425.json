Next one may be confiscation.Quotehttps://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-02-28/card/putin-imposes-capital-controls-including-restrictions-on-external-debt-payments-Kedzfom80kQtl1B7xaRsQuoteRussian President Vladimir Putin banned residents from sending money to bank accounts abroad and blocked payments on external debt, aggressive controls on capital flow made in response to punishing Western sanctions....Investors on Monday sent yields on Russia's dollar-denominated bonds issued offshore soaring to over 24%. They were less than 3% to start the year.----Some of you know about the Argentinian corralito, by which Argentinians, from one day to the next, were not allowed to recover their USD that were converted into \"pesos\" at the \"official rate\". They were not able either to get much out the bank (was it 400 a month?).Well, the recent economic measures taken in Russian Federation by their local despot may end up in something similar. For now:https://sanctionsnews.bakermckenzie.com/russia-imposes-special-economic-measures-in-response-to-western-sanctions/QuoteRussian exporters starting from February 28, 2022 are obliged to sell 80 % of foreign currency received from foreign trade contracts and obliged to sell 80 % of foreign currency credited from January 1, 2022Russian residents are prohibited from lending to foreigners in foreign currencyRussian residents will not be able to put foreign currency on their accounts and deposits in foreign banksRussian residents will not be able to transfer funds to foreign banks without opening a bank account using electronic means of payment provided by foreign providers of payment servicesThe ban comes into force on March 1, 2022.A new \"package\" for locals may be about to come. Bitcoin may be the answer.",

She was declared default due to non-payment of a debt in the amount of one hundred million dollars, which is not a big problem for Russia, but due to the imposed sanctions, she actually cannot pay in dollars and tried to make payments in rubles. This has happened for the first time since 1918. Every day, problems in Russia due to sanctions will increase until it stops its war of conquest in Ukraine.",

Refusal to pay debt obligations in dollars already speaks volumes. Instead, the payment went in the national currency.",

I am aware, it is not recent news and it has been turned down. However it is a hint of what may happen if sanctions start biting.In so far as how the Russian Federation is doing, at the moment well enough to finance the war, due to the price of oil and the slow pace of the effects of sanctions however the living conditions of the ordinary people are affected (unemployment, low growth,...) and this has only started. You will not see any media providing local and accurate news, but it does not mean that \"nothing is happening\".One thing is clear, you do not need a 10% interest rate to sustain a currency that is \"doing well\".",

Indeed genius move...I wonder if your government would seize your Bitcoins, decide one is worth 10 000 dollars and convert 80% into some useless currency like a rupiah or a rial, would you still cheer this genius move that will help all their locals and their economy?It doesn't matter how strong the ruble is on paper, in reality, nobody gives a damn about that, look at car prices in Russia every single one of them is two to three times more expensive as everyone knows that's not the real rate, it's the artificial methods of keeping a currency afloat that has driven a lot of people to bitcoin and you're here preaching about capital control and assets seizures?

I do think that the locals might try and : Move to some other country since no one can live like that and at the same time be able to do everything normally since the foreign companies would also start to get out of Russia. Considering bitcoins, it is included into the sanctions as well therefore at the end of the day I do think that eventually it would be harder for people to buy properties in foreign countries through bitcoins as some Russians will doing it, this is going to cause a massive unrest in the public sector and the government as well.",
