Which means it helps you to know what is trading how how to trade as a beginner. But you will have to trade by yourself.It is not a bot that trade for you, it is not a signal group that will scam you. If you are ready to know how to trade, you can begin with the ChatGPT. I will like if the ChatGPT can indicate many ways newbie traders can be scammed too, but I do not know if it is among.It is used for other things too.",

Any one? Artificial intelligence is still in its beginning days even we did hear about it some 10 or 15 years back itself. So far those claimed as AI were just machine learning which means database driven as neural network is still in development stage for enabling chips to decide by themselves.AI based trading can be the next stage of bot trading but the efficacy cannot have any big differences as per my understanding.If I am able to code a bot based on AI then I will not open/sell it for public use until I become a multi-billionaire. So, if anything similar to use is available means they are using us as test rat to evaluate its efficiency; nothing else.",

I prefer to use just like $5 to $10 to start to trade than using demo. Some people may just prefer to get a tutor, but they must be careful of scammers.",
