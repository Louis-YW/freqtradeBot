  "content": "Gambling is for the strong and sturdy. I got this caption based on what happened when I visited an old friend of mine as it's been long since we saw, and so, after a little time out together with random discussions I discovered a sudden change in his mood while we're still chatting. With a steady look on his phone in his hands for about a minute or more as he scrolled up and down the phone screen repeatedly he shrouded his shoulders with a simultaneous regrettable look all over his face.I took the phone from him only to learn that my friend has been calculating the whole series of losses he has made from all the bets he has placed from one of the gambling site he patronize. He had made a multiples of losses in almost all the games he had placed bet on  right from the start of this year, even to the current bet of that very day. But then he asked me' bro assuming I had gathered all these money I have lost through gambling and channeled it into some sort of a little business or project, wouldn't it have been better!  At that moment I never knew the exact word to give to him as I never expected such deep a question, for the least I replied him was \"hmm I can't really say\".With this, I wondered if other person's here in the forum that are into gambling too has at any point in time thought or felt that way, particularly when the losses are becoming overwhelming. And in that case, should such person stop gambling and rather divert such monies into something else since he/she ain't making corresponding wins or more, checking his bet history, Or he should carry on with hopes that winnings will start creeping in someday gradually?",

If he is feeling tempted and not able to use small amount on gambling, he should leave gambling for many months without visiting any gambling site or place, he should focus on business.",

      "body": "It's a well known fact that if you gamble a lot, you will most likely be a loser at it. Gambling is not a job for most. Yes there are some profitable sports bettors, poker players, and in rare cases blackjack/slots players. Overall though, a very high % of gamblers are down lifetime. Casinos know that the longer they can keep someone gambling, the better chance the house edge catches up and the player loses. Only gamble what you can afford to lose and don't try to make it your job.",

He simply needs a help and willing to try the help but remember a gambler is always a gambler, he might still go back to it and this time with greater commitment with the brightest hope of winning big. However, if he will win big or not depends on his renewed strategy.Quote from: Lida93 on March 11, 2023, 02:32:34 PMWith this, I wondered if other person's here in the forum that are into gambling too has at any point in time thought or felt that way, particularly when the losses are becoming overwhelming.

Gambling is getting more popular and it is as old as humanity so you always have more numbers of newbies than the numbers of quitters and quitters later rejoins.",

Gambling is designed that house will always win no matter what kind of strategy player has because all the gambling games is based on luck. Even a strong mind or will find gambling a very difficult game if he is looking for a source of income rather than for entertainment only. Only Poker and Blackjack that card counting is applicable are can be categorized as source of good funds if you have skills on it.",

Either weak or strong, anyone can gamble so long as they have an interest in gambling. Your friend is regretting his losses, but he should have known better that gambling is not a consistent source of income. If he probably likes business, then he should invest in business and then use his profits for gambling (just a suggestion, not advice).There are people who find it difficult to handle losses in gambling, but when a person can't handle losses, the best option is to quit.",

I haven't had that feel, neither have I ever sat down to calculate all the money I have wasted in gambling thorough out the whole year and even if I did I'm sure I won't feel anything because of the amount I have used. After all gaming should be for entertainment not for a means to earn passive income. When we are asked to always allocate a certain amount for gambling, there's a reason for it. When you're able to control the amount of money that goes into gambling at the end of the day you won't have much regret, but if you're the addictive type that does not know how to control yourself I'm sure you'll end up in Op friend's shoe.",

Ops is in the worst situation and only total withdrawal from gambling will help him.",

Your friend have to know in gambling the more you gamble the more you loss, out of 100 games played by a gambler, it is only one to three is likely to be won. And the last statement of the last paragraph in your has completed your friend's mind. That is the only slogan for real gamblers, so even you advise him to stop gambling definitely he will come back again because it part of him now. So I will only tell you to advise him that he should reduce his betting rate so money can be diversify to do other things in his life.",

Moreover, can't really answer it for them but if you try to divert your attention to other stuff fully then you can possibly do it, with persistence and discipline.

Because gambling is for everyone and no one chooses it in my opinion. Especially with online gambling.     All money and possessions should not be consumed just for gambling, because all excesses and shortages do not help us. So we should only gamble with the extra money we have and not because we just thought. So we should only gamble responsibly without affecting the family we have.",
