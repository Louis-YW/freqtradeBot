Even as fiat is not stable, people still like the stability of fiat which we used people from El Salvador to know about. Bitcoin helps El Salvadorans in remittance but almost all the bitcoin are converted to USD. People prefer bitcoin as an investment. But in the process, it is possible for people to think to send bitcoin instead of fiat for international transactions which is faster and cheaper.People should not also be fooled that fiat is stable. Fiat is not stable but decreasing in value gradually. Bitcoin is a good alternative.",

      "body": "Let me be really straightforward about this question. I think that if people in general start using and accepting bitcoin a lot, it could eventually take the place of regular money we use every day. Right now, our banking system relies on regular money that governments control. But imagine a new system where the government doesn't control how you use money. Regular money tends to lose value over time, but bitcoin doesn't have that problem. Here's an example: If you work and save money for when you're older, the value of that money might go down over the years because things become more expensive. But if you had put your money into bitcoin instead, it might have actually grown in value. So, in simple words, learning about bitcoin could be really valuable and worth the effort.",

Payment or delivery with bitcoins around the world only takes a fraction of the time compared to official state-owned banks where it may take up to days.Another convenience for transactions with bitcoin, users can set their own amount of fees to make transactions fast.In many countries, maybe people use bitcoin as an investment asset rather than using bitcoin as a means of payment.",

Why did he make the supply to be reducing every 210000 blocks. Why did he make demand to make the price of bitcoin to increase? The purpose of bitcoin as an investment is in its design and that is the reason most people are using it that led to more bitcoin utility.",

As long as there is a government ruling a country, the banks must exist because the government is working hand in hand with the banks to make sure the there is enough fiat in circulation for daily transactions. This is one of the reason why government prints money to give to the banks for business. You need fiat to buy your daily needs especially tangible stuffs,and bitcoin and fiat works hand in hand for easy usage. What if because of the value of bitcoin and all bitcoin holders decides not to use them but keep them in their wallet how will you pay with botcoin for goods and services. Email took over post office because it is letters that we are sending but here we are talking about currency that is recognized and used world wide. Every country has their own currency which was created by the government but bitcoin is not a currency for only one nation but for all. Fiat will always be used,no matter how popular bitcoin adoption is.",

Since Bitcoin has gone global, the process of sending money across countries has become easier, bank customers will of course switch to Bitcoin every time they want to make a transaction because the process is very fast.

First of all, banks have existed for thousands of years and are powerful enough to defend themselves against any competition, especially from something like Bitcoin. The majority of people in the world do not understand or do not want Bitcoin, and they have shown this from 2009 until today, and I do not believe that this will change in the next 10 or 20 years (and probably more).People who think that Bitcoin is something that should or must change the world are living in the illusion, because it is only an alternative for those who want to try something new that did not exist before. For most people, financial sovereignty or independence from banks is not and will not be an option, because the average Joe will never see the advantage Bitcoin has over his plastic card and the PIN he uses it with.When you already mention post offices, in some countries it is possible to sell and buy BTC in such offices, so regardless of the fact that people no longer send postcards, post offices are adapting to new conditions, and there should be no doubt that banks do nothing when it comes to adjustments.",

The only thing I understand is that it has successfully changed the mindset of many on how to view the monetary system, how to be self-dependent, how to take control of one's finances, and all of that. The banking system can't be completely replaced, as we still need it to execute certain traditional transactions in our locality.",

Because the acceptance of Bitcoin into the payment system will divert more people's attention to using Bitcoin when they want to pay for something and will also encourage them to try investing in Bitcoin so that Bitcoin can be more widely known in this world.",

So the point to be considered here is decentralization and a system that runs based on the PoW concept along with all the transactions being public, irreversible, etc. It means you are going to act as your own bank which is completely different from the banking system.Bitcoin transactions aren't cheaper and faster either compared to existing payment processors...",

Same, Bitcoin users do need banks to withdraw their assets at least I have to. Because there is not such services like BTC ATM here in my country and I can't do p2p trade person to person (mean Face to face). So, we have to withdraw our funds in different finances apps but we do have the option of withdrawing or depositing without banks but I prefer banks because they charge me less.The point is, I do not think Banks will be eliminated for once at all instead chances are they will get fewer users than before and I think it's already happening.
