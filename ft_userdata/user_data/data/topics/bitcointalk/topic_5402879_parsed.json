  "content": "Today, I put up a post to celebrate my 365 days(1 year) of being registered on this forum but then I had to delete the contents, lock, and move it to archival because a user said it was merit fishing and other stuff. Truth be told I felt terrible because I know how much of a struggle it was to stay in the forum. I was offline from January 17, 2022, to April 5th. I won't go into details because it is personal.This incident got me thinking about the forum before the merit system was created. Aside from merit fishing, spam, low-value, and garbage posts, what other accusations were leveled against other members of this forum?How do you create topics that you feel matter to you without making it seem as if you are merit fishing?",

That smells like merit fishing!    jkQuote from: Davidvictorson on June 16, 2022, 06:10:06 PMAside from merit fishing, spam, low-value, and garbage posts, what other accusations were leveled against other members of this forum?Spam, low-value, garbage, what's the difference? They're all shitposts. To answer your question, plagiarism, merit cycling (there's a Fox something club too), scams, shilling altcoins, ban evasion, sockpuppeting. Once, one was even accused for pedophilia too. In a bitcoin forum.Quote from: Davidvictorson on June 16, 2022, 06:10:06 PMHow do you create topics that you feel matter to you without making it seem as if you are merit fishing?If I feel there's something essential to be said, I say it.

Rest of the things are as follow,As Merit system is to remove spams and Inactive Users i.e if i like some post i can definitely +merit him byt that +merit should not be Spamming like multi accounts no matter its Quality posts or not because sometimes i like something but otherone didn't.Merit Fishing is an Allegation because How can you judge a topic of celebration with merit fishing may / may not be he/she is excited for telling story that may inspire aomeone.Reat of the thing BTT is Freedom of speach by Taking care of Rules rest of things other knows better.",

I've seen users say it was better years ago, but really you'll find users complaining about it back then. Spam, and low quality is sort of part, and parcel of having a large forum, especially when you combine different people from all sorts of walks of life. I think we're in a pretty good place, could it be improved, maybe? However, I'm not sure how we would go about that, without restricting everyone, which obviously should be refrained from if possible.",

I recall some higher ranking members that made that kind of mistake before.For your second question, as long as you are genuine about your post, you shouldn't worry about it. You do you.One notable pattern I see from merit fishers is that they create threads without even bothering to lock their previous ones nor had any interest on replying to any of the replies in the thread.",

Do you know that I am even afraid to create thread in the forum? Because any thread that I struggle and some time with a sleepless nights to create and post, they must  accused me of merit phishing/fishing. For that reason my human right of freedom of speech as been trampled upon. So I can't freely express myself because I will be accused of merit phishing. I have never hide my identity, mostly my knowledge on bitcoin. I had a very poor knowledge on bitcoin until it was when I came to this forum that I am getting more knowledge on bitcoin and other crypto currencies. Therefore, I am allowed  to  made suggestions from the threads I have read. And if the suggestions are useless. It can be advised to delete or lock or tell me or direct me what to do, then I will follow up, but instead they would be accusing you of merit phishing. There was a time I wanted to give up from the forum because the accusations were much. But users encouraged me not to give up because learning bitcoin will be a good help in my Life has a youth. Just imagine someone is saying that the OP is merit phishing. When a vital question is been asked. Now any thread one create is for merit phishing.

A lot of people don't like the vaunted themes, so @BitcoinGirl.Club created one single theme, which I find very convenient. There are many successful people on the forum, and each success is not necessarily a legend rank. Just imagine how many topics we could see from those who became members and so on. Indeed, for many, it is a great joy. Therefore, it is better to be modest; it deserves respect.Was the topic you created, which received a large amount of merit, accused of merit hunting? Or did someone reproach you for this? This theme was great. Here is an example for you when no one will suspect you of anything.Otherwise, since many topics are discussed very often on the forum, the appearance of a new topic that does not contain anything unique in itself will be suspected of hunting.But by no means should you stop creating your topics. You just can do better, and you have proven it, so don't be discouraged and move on.",
