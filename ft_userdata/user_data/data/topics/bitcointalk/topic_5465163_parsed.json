I use Binance, but I prefer to use USDT as the main pair in spot market and for future trading that is not coin margin, and also I am not a fan of BUSD right from when it was created because I know that it is more centralized than USDT, USDC and Dai which are the three that I prefer. I also prefer USDP and TUSD but both including Dai are not main pairs like USDT and USDC.Although for more decentralized stable coin, Dai is the one that I know.I wish Binance to stop their manipulation, we can see it. Binance supposed to have USDC as the second main pair. Exchanges like OKX and Bybit have USDC as their second main pair after USDT. On Bybit, you can even use USDC to open long and short position in the derivative market.Thank you for the information once again.",

At some point they even had higher interest rate on BUSD compared to USDT. While the difference was slight, it still matters that it was there. I remember on Futures they had only USDT pars and added BUSD recently.By the way, why don't they have USD pars like Coinbase? I don't understand why should I pair my coins with stablecoins during trading when there is a high chance that that stablecoin will go down to zero. I don't trust USDT, I don't trust BUSD!",

Cryptocurrencies offer many advantages over fiat currencies as a form of payment and in other use cases, providing faster transactions and lower fees, in addition to being more secure and privacy-preserving. Stablecoins like FDUSD are digital native instruments that are designed to maintain a stable value, helping to bridge the traditional financial ecosystem and the cryptocurrency market. Stablecoins like FDUSD allow fiat currencies to be represented in the crypto world while being able to move more freely and efficiently.They literally ask \"Why is FDUSD Useful\"?It's not useful you bricks, it was literally just listed. As I said in my previous post, there are many other stablecoins that will be used more than some random USD coin.BTW am I the only one who disdains the idea of having a \"USD coin\" in the first place?You literally have all these stablecoins, which are backed by the dollar, which itself is backed by.... a money printer.

On Bybit, you can even use USDC to open long and short position in the derivative market.That's one thing about Binance: they love to promote themselves in any way that they can. When Busd was even recently launched, they even  compared it with USDT  by saying BUSD is backed up and audited every single month with other listed features, which they used to compare and make the Busd look better than USDT; they are both centralised and should be regarded that way. Their means of making BUSD more available on their exchange trading pairs are their means of promoting BUSD to the top in every way possible.But my question is, if the BUSD was being approved and licenced by NYDFS during the time of the approval, was it not noticed that it did not meet the registration requirements for a security token?",

Even though BUSD has been created by Paxos and not Binance themselves directly, I believe that it'll impact Binance and especially BNB, as everyone affiliated BUSD with the exchange. Personally, it was one of my first, if not the first, options when choosing a pair to stake stablecoins or any other coin because, at least to me, it seemed like a safer option than TUSD or USDT, but I might be wrong about that.Certainly, to begin with, there are already too many stablecoins in circulation, but it was a little different with BUSD due to its correlation with the Binance exchange; it just felt safer to me, as I found it unlikely for Binance to face any major difficulty that would disrupt its ecosystem. It seems that the SEC incident is starting to cost, while I also read a couple of days ago that Mastercard is stopping its affiliation with Binance for the issuance of new cards. I wouldn't be surprised if these incidents also affect BNB.",
