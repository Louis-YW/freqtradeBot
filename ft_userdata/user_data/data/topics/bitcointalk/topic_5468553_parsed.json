  "content": "Since two days ago, Microsoft Defender Antivirus has insisted on checking the scope_v2.json file located in the Trezor suite application. Folder /sentry. What is at stake here, should I be worried?I did not allow any checking, considering that I do not want any unsolicited checking by external services. But what baffles me is the persistence of Windows security to check it despite my refusal. It seems to me that this started happening after the last Suite update a few days agoIt's Trezor One, with 1.12.1 firmware and Suite version  23.9.3. Otherwise, everything works without problems, at least I didn't notice anything.",

      "body": "I believe that Microsoft Defender Antivirus, in an attempt to detect Spyware, monitors all data received and sent from your device and therefore may close any connections accordingly.Trezor Suite tries to track errors in the system, monitors the application and improves performance and may send error data to a third party for that reason. Microsoft Defender Antivirus considers such activities Spyware. I have no experience in using Antivirus (I don’t use it and find it gives a false sense of security), but there will be a reason to add the application to the white list. Search for it and the problem will go away.More information about what data may be collected here ----> https://docs.trezor.io/trezor-suite/analytics/index.htmlAnother solution is to disabled usage data tracking in the Trezor suite, but in any case you can consider it a false positive.",
