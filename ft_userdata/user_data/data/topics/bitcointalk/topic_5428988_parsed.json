And neither a lot of outputs were in the coinbase transaction nor the last transaction was with lots of outputs. So how does miner actually collects commission? Transaction fees aren't included in a transaction and rather calculated implicitly: essentially it is a surplus (or difference) of bitcoin between total sum of inputs and total sum of outputs. When miners calculates his reward, he adds up this surplus to block subsidy and collects block reward.You can read more here: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch10.asciidoc",

And neither a lot of outputs were in the coinbase transaction nor the last transaction was with lots of outputs. So how does miner actually collects commission? As Charles-Tim pointed out, it is part of the Coinbase transaction, the first transaction in a block.Block Reward = subsidy + feesYou can also read it in the whitepaper:QuoteBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin ownedby the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and providesa way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expendingresources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction isless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value ofthe block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have enteredcirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflationfree.https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf",

It means, the coinbase transaction is different, and you can read more in other BIPs, like BIP-141.

How to save two coinbase vouts into leveldb and how to spend one of them if they have the same txid?With BIP34, it's very very unlikely that two coinbase transactions have the same ID, but in theory it's still possible that two transactions have the same transaction ID. If a transaction has the same ID as an existing transaction, the second one would replace the first one and there wouldn't be any way to spend the fund received in the first one. See blocks number 91,722 and 91,880. The coinbase transactions in these two blocks have the same ID. The person who received the block reward on block number 91,722 can't spend it. The solution to this problem was BIP30. According to BIP30, a block can't include a transaction with the same ID as a not-fully-spent transaction.",

Right?I know the chance of that happening is almost zero. Yes.Your node only checks the UTXO database to see the transaction can be found among the unspent outputs not the whole blockchain. It would take a long time to search the entire blockchain that is not indexed anyways.I believe this is the line where it rejects such transactions if they exist among \"coins\": https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/968f03e65c98a9a36aea6c57a29306839b0ada57/src/validation.cpp#L2151",
