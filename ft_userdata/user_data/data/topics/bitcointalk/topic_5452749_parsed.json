  "content": "Imgur images are broken on the forum, so people are moving to other providers (such as TalkImg.com by @joker_josue). If you want to permanently fix your posts, you can use my script that goes through your post history and reuploads all images to TalkImg + edits your posts: [Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken imagesBut you can't expect everyone to do the same, so you will probably come across broken images from Imgur.This script temporarily fixes this by making your browser load Imgur.com images directly instead of using the forum's native image proxy (which doesn't work with imgur anymore).How to use it:1. Download the Tampermonkey or ViolentMonkey extension for PC, Kiwi Browser for Android.2. Install the script: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/466302-fix-bitcointalk-imgur-imagesSource codeImportant: If you can, you should still try my other script (Imgur to TalkImg) or update your images manually. Remember that, for everyone else, the images will still be broken (unless they also use this script). Ditch Imgur and move to another image hosting provider!BeforeAfterAfter installing the script, refresh this page. If you can see the image below, then it's working:",
