  "content": "This promises to be a great fight in the making as both fighters have gone through a lot and both are champions, this is a battle of tacticians, and expect a lot of jabs and movements in the ring but this is not going to be a boring fight as both fighters are capable of hurting his opponent.I have Usyk as the favorite here being an undisputed champion but I don't rule out Dubois coming up with a massive upset because he can do it.So who you got in this fightQuoteOleksandr Usyk will square off against Daniel Dubois on Saturday 26th August 2023 at Stadion Wroclaw in Wroclaw.The fight will take place over 12 rounds in the Heavyweight division, which means there is no weight limit.This contest is for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world, with the WBO, WBA, IBF & The Ring belts on the line.Pictures from: Box.liveUsyk - Dubois",

Dubois was lose against Joy Joyce, Joyce has a name in heavyweight boxing division, it's obvious Usyk is tougher than Joyce. Even though Usyk's last four fights aren't won via KO, I think this time he might win via KO.",

It's more possible to happen to me.19 fights and 18 by KO is a scary record for a heavyweight.  Usyk will not be surprised if he is gonna be knockout by Dubios, just look at how solid young man he is compared to the old Usyk.Strange choice of place, they could just agree on Wembley Stadium?

Usyk vs Fury is going to be a big fight, but Dubois can't be underestimated, even though he lost to Joe Joyce, as we never know his adjustments in this fight. There's no hype from the fans on this fight so far, but as soon as Usyk wins the fight, the hype will be high, and fans will be asking for Fury vs Usyk. So hopefully our expectation will happen.",

Dubois best chance is to go for a knockout in the earlier rounds or go for the upper hand in the earlier rounds because as the fight drags on it will be Usyk turn to impose his skill, Dubois cannot equal Usyk, Usyk is getting better in the latter rounds of the fight especially in the championship rounds.Its power and skill in this fight I have seen Dubois in his training and he really does pack power on both hands but the power will only matter if he can hit Usyk who has an impeccable defense, Dubois is considered as the next Tyson his built is very similar to Tyson but he lacks the confidence to go like Mike Tyson did.If Usyk wins here he should face Tyson next so the heavyweight belts should be consolidated so we'll have one undisputed champion.",

Heavyweight division is famous for lucky punches more than any other division. Don Charles trains Dubois, he is a coach of Dereck Chisora. Usyk fought Chisora and I would not say that that fight was easy for him. So they know what expect from Usyk. Which means there is bit more chances for Dubois to get victory.",

So it's more of a problem for Dubois on how to upset Usyk in this fight.The bookmakers have a huge preference for Usyk, but I wouldn't be so sure about that. Despite the fact that Usyk said in a recent interview: \"I'm 36 years old, but this is just the beginning.\" I fear most of all for his age, he is 11 years older than his opponent. At this age, it is quite dangerous to go against knockers, which is Daniel Dubois. They can go round after round for Usyk's leadership, but in seconds everything will change, e.g. explosive attack and pinching in the corner of ring and subsequent knockout.In any case, a very interesting fighting evening awaits us.",
