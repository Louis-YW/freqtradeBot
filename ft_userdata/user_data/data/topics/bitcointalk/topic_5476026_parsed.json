      "body": "Op I quite understand your assertions about passing Bitcoin awareness to our younger generation of which it is really a good idea but you see whatever that hasn't been fully adopted by the masses or the government shouldn't be what you will go publicly on creating the awareness. If you want to sensitize the younger ones about Bitcoin I think it first have to start from your homes, like we have younger ones in the family who are either our brothers or our relatives so one can actually pass this information to them by so doing they too can extend it to their friends and before you know it the sensitization have been created.It is really unfortunate that this awareness didn't come to us earlier because had it been it came early to us by now we would have had lots of crypto legends and crypto enthusiasts but however, it is rather late than never as since we are now aware of these life changing platforms we should endeavor to pass the knowledge to who ever that is interested to know about it.",

Aside all this as times goes by people will continue to know the truth, while meeting random people and discussing about bitcoin as not been really go well for our members Here rather those who we know or come to us may likely take our advise. Also you can introduce to BTT for there is much for them to learn here always.",

      "body": "Op I must say that your concern is very well noted. Honestly speaking bitcoin will survive long after we are gone. There is no Nigerian youth who has access to the internet that hasn't heard of bitcoin, the awareness is there already, just that people are being careful because nobody want to fall on the wrong side with the government or a target of kidnappers, that's why you are not seeing people talk more about their bitcoin holdings in their social media handles. For now all we have to do is keep trading bitcoin the way we are doing right now and also tell people who willingly comes to us to learn about bitcoin. Secondly what we can do as a young people of this country is to elect politicians who are bitcoin friendly. One of our challenges as the youth of this country is that we expect things to work for us but our actions speaks otherwise. We should get our voters card ready and come out to vote for a candidate who is bitcoin friendly and is willing to make it a legal tender in our country irrespective of our political affiliation. This is one way I know we can make our voice heard and assure that bitcoin traders will not be hunted by government agencies.",

      "body": "Well thought op about the preparation of the younger generation towards the adoption of the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin but there are determinants and elements we have to consider in flagging such awareness campaign especially in a country like Nigeria where the government has no support for bitcoin usage in public and private institutions, so anything you do it's at your own peril. If anyone is so keen about the adoption I strong believe it should just be within his close circle could be family, colleagues/friends and at most neighbors, so you don't shoot yourself on your own foot based on how the system of government in the country is currently with bitcoin.However, bear in mind that you must perceive an expression of independent interest by anyone you share the opportunity with and shouldn't be that it's out if coax or sweet-talk that they got the adoption interest. The reality is that you can't do much in a place where the authority is not on your side therefore, I  give credit and reckon the efforts of those of us that are in their little ways spreading the opportunity to whom it may concern.",

      "body": "What you said is the truth, but you can't just force education on people who don't actually need it. Some people have heard about Bitcoin but are not concerned about learning anything about it, while others who have interest will always find a way to learn, and by so doing, there's no way they can't learn. Nigeria might not be the top 1 country in Bitcoin adoption, but it's a leading country in Bitcoin adoption if you compare it to other countries that are still slow to adopt Bitcoin. With that being said, I believe there are a lot of people who are willing to pass on knowledge to newbies, but there is not much interest from those newbies to learn. I might be wrong, tho, but some people are not exposed to the technology because they are very skeptical, and you can't force them to believe in Bitcoin. If you pass on, there are still new people that will come up; that's the trend; the knowledge never dies out at once.",

Me self I dey always say educating children about bitcoin is right but reading about other peoples opinion in this forum I see say if the child is not willing and interested to learn then don't force the child.Age shouldn't be a problem as long as the child can read and write properly. Most times it is the little ones that learn faster than the older ones. Teaching the younger generation is good, and it will be better if the education starts at a very early age. Before they grow up entirely they will have enough knowledge on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. One thing i feel should be taught to the younger generation after the basic introduction of bitcoin to them, should be on how to secure a Bitcoin portfolio. If its not taught properly, they may be careless about securing a portfolio. For instance it it was an inheritance, they may lose all the father has worked for because of ignorance to the security teachings. Another should be about the value of Bitcoin. They should know that Bitcoin is a valuable asset and it should be giving the respect it deserve. It is only when a person values something they will know the important of that thing in their life. And that is how Bitcoin operates.",

Remember that sharing Bitcoin knowledge in public is not a good idea because if you are caught doing that, you might face jail terms for trying to pass the knowledge of Bitcoin that will give people full control over their money, and not depend on the government policies. This is the reason why Satoshi says that Bitcoin is for everyone but you can't force someone to adopt it. We can start by educating our children about Bitcoin and show them with Bitcoin, they can send money anywhere in the world with a lower transaction fee, so that as they grow up they will study further to get more knowledge about Bitcoin since will have laid the foundation when they were younger.",

Because even the scheme of work na from government e dey come from, na why for some school we dey hear government approved. So that kind of plan no go fit work for now until dem remove the restriction.

If by the time our children become adult and we still dey push for Bitcoin adopting for the country e mean say we never really achieve anything na because that one go be like 18+ years time assuming we born today. If in 18 year we still dey do wetin we dey do today then government dun already rule out the possibility of accepting Bitcoin be dat so make we just leave that talk and dey invest for the purposes of profits gaining and wealth security even though the utility no possible for the country. As we get wealth for Bitcoin, we go need pass am from our generation to that of our children and in that process we go teach them things dem go need know on how to secure the Bitcoin well and do other needful things them for the industry so that way we dey preserved the adoption of the currency. Bitcoin go take care of himself so make we no go dey stress ourselves much. Just as you carry sabi about Bitcoin na so other future generations go sabi about am too. We get people wey go pick interest for teaching about Bitcoin and just like the current educators wey we get so for like dem YouTube and other social media them wey dem dey monetize their channels to you educated people, na so the same hustle go continue and the gospel will continue been spread about Bitcoin.",

Nigeria is also exposed to fin-tech and this will give them a global lead to see and adopt the happenings around the world that will help the future of the country. Bitcoin is gaining adoption as years pass back, the country with the lowest number of bitcoin enthusiasts will also feel the adoption and in one point not have any choice than to follow others in adopting bitcoin. Most people that are aware of bitcoin today are youths, so they still have enough time to disseminate the news more before they finally pass it to the younger ones when they can’t again. The world is evolving and so is the fin-tech industry and the people in the world that are integrating into the new system also.",
