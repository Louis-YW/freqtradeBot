I was able to find out that those who invested 50$ to 100$ where able to make 8,000$ and they cashed out, very expected from a human, that's already a big gain, but some wallet addresses failed to take profit and now they are sitting on millions, who does that? With a meme coin.I believe that the Devs are the ones using small amount of money to buy the token themselves, those who are really from investors are wallet that took profits before the millions of dollars gain became a thing. Do not be fooled.Apart from this, PEPE has now opened a deceiving portal for investors, many will crave for a project like PEPE and the crypto space will witness a new numbers of King PEPE, PEPI INU, BSCPEP, PEPE Finance, something with PEPE name. What do you think about this project madness? Will you dare invest in a project like this?",

They are several things I have tried to avoid since I got involved in crypto and that is thinking about a missed opportunity. I only got to know about the so-called PEPE token only a few days ago and that's because I don't follow news about new altcoins being released into the market, but assuming I heard about it on time i still won't have been able to make good profit from it because I still won't have invested large amount in it since it's a meme coin and I don't like buying meme coins. This is not the first meme token we have seen that gave investors good profit and I'm sure it won't be the last.QuoteApart from this, PEPE has now opened a deceiving portal for investors, many will crave for a project like PEPE and the crypto space will witness a new numbers of King PEPE, PEPI INU, BSCPEP, PEPE Finance, something with PEPE name.It has already begun if you go to coinmarketcap > New, you will see so many tokens with the prefix or sufffix \"PEPE' and I'm sure they where created by some random dev hoping to make some money with the current \"PEPE' trend.",

I am relatively new in the cryptocurrency industry and I don't have much experience in trading other coins. I think the best option for me currently is to focus on Bitcoin and overlook other coins. The technicalities and intrigues of most of these coins are hard to grasp and I am not ready to engage in them. Congratulations to those that got some profit and sorry to those that lost but I would never have invested in the coin because it looks like a Ponzi scheme. Although Bitcoin looks like a slow means of getting a profit but it is better for me because it has been dependable and consistent. I will keep holding until the bull run.",

Not new thing happened on scam tokens sections since once there is a shitcoin became famous due to the hype it gets the other devs will create a same name with a twist just to get the attention of other investor. They also make believe that there's something cool stuff will happen to their token the same on what they are copying. To risky to invest on such things and much better not to think any of it to save up some cash.Quote from: FirmWars on April 21, 2023, 11:10:16 AMWhat do you think about this project madness? Will you dare invest in a project like this? Nope I won't, this is classic scamming by token creators and will not let myself fall into this shit trap.",

People will always put there money into get rich quick schemes, they have for eons not just with crypto but any kind of scam.  Even when they know it's a scam they still cross their fingers and throw it in the middle.  Simple word to describe this, greed.  So long as there is a story of one person hitting it big there will always be followers.  Sad because most will just lose their money.  It's a zero sum gain.  For one person to hit it big many have to fall victim.",

There are coins that have traded days or weeks before or if they are even listed in. Here's the link to one reddit thread and a screenshot, i would like you see your research as wellWould i invest this now? Hell no. Would i have invest this if i've seen it earlier? Well i literally invested to Pepe Solana before this so maybe if i would monitor eth token launches. But i wouldn't have holded to million.",

In the case you got lucky and the shitcoins you picked started to pump heavily, then it turns into a match of crash, where you need to decide when to crash out before the coin gets flat lined, sometimes it can be very unpredictable, since the developers could also decide when to pull the rug. Those projects are mostly scams and their own economy of the protocol can be in control of the own developers so they can manipulate the volume.
