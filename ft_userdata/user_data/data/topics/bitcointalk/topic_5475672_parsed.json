Can anyone tell me where l can post sport news to avoid post deleting?You have your answer above , there are sports that connected in gambling in which some are already having their own thread Like basketball,Boxing,cricket,Football and other sports but if you are going to post general news for all sports , then i think this is your section(OFF TOPIC) because the correlation must be with gambling and betting before being accounted in gambling section.",

Can anyone tell me where l can post sport news to avoid post deleting?The information related to a sport that has the potential to bet then it will fit into the gambling section but if you are just going to copy and paste the entire news along with the source no potential space to discuss anything further then you better post it in the off-topic section itself.",

Can anyone tell me where l can post sport news to avoid post deleting?you can now lock this thread as you have already posted the news you wanted to share and indeed that is a 3 posts about each sports gambling  news i thought you are going to create a single pack of news threads so there is no need to have that much?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5476938.msg63285790#msg63285790but you seems to be not updating your threads? not even commenting on those?",
