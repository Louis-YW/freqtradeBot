Bitcoin forever.I like your enthusiasm but bitcoin has not yet broken the financial system. I don't think the perception of capital has changed either. Basically the current financial system is based on debt. Fiat money is credit rather than money, it has a counterpart in debt. Whereas bitcoin is like digital gold, a bitcoin is a bitcoin without depending on any debt, in the same way that an ounce of gold has a value that does not depend on any debt.",

Bitcoin forever.It's great to have you on the forum. Confirming from a qualified professional like you give people like me confidence that we are on the right path. I hope you will use your wealth of experience in the traditional banking sector to give us more innovative insights into investments and other global financial matters. Bitcoin is striving to revolutionize the global financial system but there are some impediments. The traditional banking system backed by the government is resisting the penetration of bitcoin into the financial system because of the fear of losing control. To stop bitcoin adoption and influence they impose certain restrictions on its use within their territory. Bitcoin awareness is also slow in some areas due to certain challenges such as a lack of basic amenities, poor economic conditions, and illiteracy. But so far bitcoin is still trailblazing.",

Bitcoin forever.I remember the times that I made fiat transaction and it failed, going to bank several times before it was solved, this happens twice to me before.It is true that fiat is flawed, but we still so much depend on it because people like to support what the government support. We still use fiat for many reasons, some people that are into crypto and receiving salary or wage in bitcoin or other crypto still depending on fiat and they convert their salary or wage to fiat for spending.But fiat makes us lacks freedom from government, bitcoin gives the freedom. Fiat is also decreasing in value, unlike bitcoin which can be considered as a speculative asset and a  store of value.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on March 22, 2023, 03:10:22 AMI like your enthusiasm but bitcoin has not yet broken the financial system. Nothing can break the fiat financial system. Bitcoin was not created to breake the financial system. It is just an alternative and we have many types of money, bitcoin belongs to one type which are a valuing asset.Quote from: Despairo on March 22, 2023, 03:52:49 AMWe might see a big change when CBDC has been launched by the government, it's either they will ban Bitcoin or they still consider to accept it.CBDCs are not different from fiat, why would bitcoin be banned because of CBDC/fiat when the fiat are existing before bitcoin.",

I just can't use Bitcoin where I live, I can buy some things online, but I can't pay rent or buy groceries with it, and I don't think it will be possible any time soon.",

We can debate whether Bitcoin has succeeded or not, but we cannot talk about Bitcoin succeeding in any way as you say \"break the entire traditional system\" because the percentage of people involved in Bitcoin in any way is less than 5% of the total world population. Realistically, maybe 1-2% even understand or use Bitcoin the way it should be, while for the majority it is just an investment like any other. Human perception of capital and value has unfortunately not changed much since the existence of Bitcoin and the vast majority of people still keep their value in the bank, stocks, bonds or gold.Quote from: NotATether on March 22, 2023, 05:20:30 AMCRBCs are hot garbage.

In countries like China, it is already a done deal, and I doubt that it would be difficult to implement the same thing in countries like India or Russia.I am of the opinion that CBDC is still simpler than BTC, there is not much to understand except that you need an official government app and it all boils down to the send/receive button.",

He can be using fiat because it is what the government of his  economy permits and that does not mean that he trusts fiat. Even the government knows that the system of currency they operate has been flawed. What they do is fight tirelessly to make sure that the rising technology of Bitcoin and crypto graphy is being eliminated, but that is what they cannot achieve. It is clearly obvious that the world financial system is going to change in a few decades to come and we are lucky we have already taken the early spot in the market.",

People should have proper knowledge about how volatile bitcoin that it changes its value from time to time. However, it still deserve a praise as it gives a lot of opportunity to people which we can see here in forums. Also having bitcoin as your assets couldn't be a danger if you're not selling. Hodling can even cost more for your profit in a long period of time so I don't consider it dangerous I consider it as treasure that you are holding. Never be afraid to hold and buy and dump so once bitcoin pumped get your profit.",

Using CBDCs, privacy is gone but I think many people don't mind about privacy. They will have no issue to use CBDCs and some others will continue to use fiat currencies, Bitcoin & cryptocurrency and CBDCs for their lives.

The world leaders have their peculiar way of suffering their citizens so bitcoin was created to bridge that gap. Bitcoin has come to stay and other currencies (fiat) will bow to it.
