Users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications within our metaverse. Using RCM as the main utility token of the platform. RCM holders are able to participate in governance of the platform via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) , where they can exercise voting rights on key decisions of the Arcomia ecosystem. Arcomia aims to bring blockchain into mainstream virtual experiences, attracting both crypto and non-crypto game enthusiasts by offering the advantages of true ownership, digital scarcity, monetization capabilities, and blockchain interoperability to enable a wide range of blockchain-enabled products and services.To build Arcomia we’ve assembled a game studio (Arcomia Labs Ltd.) with experience across multiple fields. Visit our team page here: https://arcomia.io/about. At Arcomia Labs, we are dedicated to bringing blockchain technology to virtual reality and providing users with a seamless and immersive experience.Join us in our mission to revolutionize the virtual world and experience the future of entertainment at https://arcomia.io/How does Arcomia differentiate itself from its competitors?Arcomia stands out from other metaverses in the following ways:1. Prioritizing and keeping user-generated content (UGC) affordable, which rewards content creators instead of burdening them with high NFT costs, which is crucial for the growth of the metaverse.2. Allowing multiple experiences to be hosted or rented on a single piece of land, which eliminates UGC start-up costs and encourages content creators. There are no restrictions on the size or number of experiences.3. Offering a hybrid model for exploring the metaverse through an open world and instancing. Players have full autonomy in the open world, similar to GTA5, however, the experiences take place through teleportation (instancing). Meaning content creators can build endlessly behind instanced experiences, without limitations and without having to spend thousands of euros on NFTs, making it inclusive for everyone.Team behind ArcomiaArcomia Labs Ltd. is a game studio and international multi-blockchain company focused on connecting gamingwith blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs founded in 2022.
