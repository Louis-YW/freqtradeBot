This is not possible because bitcoin is not centralized or controlled by any central authorities. Bitcoin price is derived from demand and supply and nothing more than that. That is why no central authority have the power to control bitcoin price and the reason for its huge adoption as it is totally different from fiat.",

I will choose Trump and believe that if he is elected, the cryptocurrency market will still benefit more under President Biden.",

For sometime now I have been quite skeptical about how users will cope as Bitcoin adoption goes up and most especially when fees were on the high side from ;late last year (period of Ordinal crisis)  Earlier this year (still because of ordinal crisis of the previous year and also because of the anticipations before the last halving event)And the most of it all, the uneconomical fees caused by conjestions in the halving and a couple of other blocks that came after it.However currently fees are quite ok (  thank goodness)Secondly Bitcoin can only become an alternative of fiat and won't replace fiat because aside from it being created by Satoshi NAKAMOTO as an alternative, it is also a decentralized currency and therefore can't be controlled by a central body (the government and central bank), and for a currency to become fiat it has to be controlled by a central body which is mainly the government.",

The biggest liars of the century are from the politicians around the world , once they get elected they do something else. Will Bitcoin become better if any of these become possible? Trump and Kennedy if say they will make sure that CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) won't be a thing it does not mean they will back the US dollar by Bitcoin, what do you think, they wish to be out of elections, I mean most of the people are already against them, and once they made this statement that they will backup US dollar by Bitcoin, they will already lose the support they have now. So, technically and logically, it's possible, but it's not a reliable thing to do.As BTC is highly volatile, and if you are from a smart world, you don't reserve funds of your country in a highly volatile currency, instead, you choose a currency, or assets, that will gain value over time, but also not so volatile at the same point. However, they can choose a mixture of assets like BTC, Gold, and silver, etc. etc. to back up their currency. But still, I don't think these two entities are supporting BTC because they love it, its because they love votes, and people who love these, will give their vote to them and after that, they are gone with different accuses.",

Bitcoin has been getting better before it was even talked about and bitcoin has a different side without anyone controlling it. Digital currencies have securities and they are controlled so coordinated that there is no chance of achieving the freedom that bitcoin has. If asked what the advantages are then we can hardly find anything because every thing that is controlled has a much greater level of play.Politicians have a passion for lying and they deliberately create chaos to make people think otherwise. Remember how Covid-19 emerged and you should know why it happened and what aspects affect the world economy.",

It could become a possibility if the world experiences a nuke war and everything is destroyed. The reason is very simple - no country will want their money printing machinery to become dependent on something which they do not control. It's easy to print money on debt. But if the Fiat becomes dependent on Bitcoin, government cannot print money at their own will. So I don't see this as a possibility. Btw, do you still believe Trump?",

Well, most of these politicians just say things to get more supporters, they're aware that people are beginning to see Bitcoin as an asset class and are investing heavily in it, so they're trying to use that medium to gain the support of people who use an invest in Bitcoin, well I'm not really sure if they'll even keep to their promises but I don't think Bitcoin would improve the value of their currency immediately if backed by it due to it's volatility but if they're thinking of long-term asset to back up the US dollars then Bitcoin Bitcoin could be seen as the best option for that, we've seen it's improvement over the years since it's creation and it still got a lot of potential to improve more over time. And backing the US currency with Bitcoin could further attract lots of new investors making it to gain more in price.",

More importantly, there are two things to mention here. One is that Bitcoin is really volatile, and fiat currencies strive to be stable, so pegging to something volatile is problematic. Another point is that the USD is actually doing alright with current policies, so it doesn't need to be backed up by anything. As for whether it's technically possible, I think it is if the US government buys a lot of BTC and keeps it as its own reserves. But also, it's kind of not possible because the US economy is much-much bigger than BTC's total market capitalization, and even the USD circulation is twice as big as BTC's total market cap.",

Forget it, this is will not happen under the current circumstances, governments obtain too many benefits with fiat currencies that are not backed by anything, so backing their currencies is not a decision that politicians will take lightly and at best it will be their last resort, so they will only think about backing their currencies with gold, with bitcoin not being an option, when the economy was in such a bad shape and their fiat currency was no longer trusted that they had no other choice, but since we have not reached that point yet then this scenario wont happen.",

First, I do not think that US dollars will be backed by Bitcoin, there is no gain for the US government to implement such financial system.  Remember the government always wanted to have control over their jurisdiction and if possible even outside their territory.  So even the idea of using Bitcoin to back up their US dollar won't get into the government financial advisors mind.QuoteWhat is the advantages and the disadvantages you see here?

The biggest liars of the century are from the politicians around the world , once they get elected they do something else.If in case the US government implemented a US dollar backed by Bitcoin system, then I think the Bitcoin market will surge.  The disadvantage is that, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin might be affected since the future development may point forward to centralization influencing the developers or even taking over the Bitcoin development either by force or negotiation.Many politicians are known good talker but I do not think that all of them intend to lie, it is that the law is not established by one person alone but rather by the whole legislative system since there is also these judiciative and executive system in the government that influence each others decision.Quote from: Kalchef on May 29, 2024, 06:59:46 AMWill Bitcoin become better if any of these become possible?

The U.S dollar cannot be backed by BTC, it is important to start topics about things that are realistic, and even if not, it should be something that makes for a good discussion, and not this.Take note that even if cbdc's fail in the U.S, it still has nothing to do with BTC. The U.S house of reps recently passed a bill to stop the Fed reserves from issuing cbdc, because of its surveillance tendencies, we would have to wait and see how that one develops.

Bitcoin is doing well without the intervention of politicians and government bodies entirely so let no body be deceived to believe that Bitcoin can be used to replace fiat or think that the government will automatically see more reason to encourage Bitcoin believes because they can have the same benefits of regulating and monitoring the transaction of cryptocurrency traders the way they constantly control and monitor the fiat transactions especially in the banks.",
