Those wey been get only altcoins because no increase in the price without bitcoin increase, they move to bitcoin.Bitcoin dominance of cryptocurrency na around/above 51% while altcoins share the rest percentage, so imagine that.Bitcoin Maximum supply na 21 million and can't be manipulated.Bitcoin halving na bum as it reduces the reward for mining bitcoin every 4 years into half and that keeps demand high. The trust is high and it is decentralized, has larger community who hodls it more than altcoins.",

Does it mean that other altcoins cannot be dependent on their own? Bitcoin na their master, why many peoples dey Invest into those altcoins na because dem believe the altcoins go fit blow like Bitcoin or atleast increase small as BTC been do so when Bitcoin wey be the oga come dey correct, others go begin fear and dem go dey take profits from the altcoins so dey no go lose and that one also dey contributions to why altcoins dey fall. Also you need know say BTC pairs get most volume for the market as most altcoins are been traded against Bitcoin so as Bitcoin dey fall for price other altcoins go dey fall as well and this na why dem say make we no dey invest for altcoins with the mindset say we went diversify as e no go work because all the crypto makes dey go same direction majoring of the time. Bitcoin controls the market, the faith of the entire market is on Bitcoin so when Bitcoin dey do well every other coins go do well and the case na the same when Bitcoin no dey do well.Most altcoins na just copy of each other so dem no fit do well on their own, dey depend on the success of Bitcoin and the original project to survive. For your list so, BNB, SOL, ADA all dey do the same thing wey be smart contract parole and people just dey Invest inside them because dem expect dem to get the same success wey their oga ETH dun get so when BTC correct and e affect ETH, other smart contract go take a hit too and you fit talk the same thing about other altcoins like of Dogecoin market gets affect other memecoin also gets affected. Some altcoins though dey go the opposite when market dey crash but dem no plenty.",

Just as baba cryptopreneurBrainboss don talk, bitcoin naim be their master and anything wey master naim boy go do oo, if the boy go go pass em master e mean say em don dey grow wings and 70% of the time the boy no dey fly dey go anywhere. Likewise crypto we no go fit get two masters for one place, so one must lead and the other go follow if not na so so problem go dey until dem settle that matter.One of the greatest reason why altcoins price dey tend to follow Bitcoin price na because, most altcoins dem no go fit buy dem with fiat currency so before you go buy dem you gats first buy bitcoin den convert am to the altcoins and when you wan still sell am you go still convert am to bitcoin before you fit sell am, so e just be like say na Bitcoin dem dey take do every thing wey concern those altcoins, and for normal sense na Bitcoin price dem take dey measure the price of those altcoins no be even dollar.",

Although there are other coin that are majorly affected as you said they are solely dependant of each other to scale up especially the reason they are mostly affected is that they are being paired on each other's for trading and lot of exchange already listed them so, when a trader noticed a rejection or declined in market or do I say a price decrease between this coin they have no option than to easily sells of their holding to usdt or any other stable coin to maintain their trading capital precisely for traders while those who are hodl don't get panicked over the sudden market changes they often tend to increase their portfolio when they noticed such changes in the market.",

It is understood that bitcoin is like the superior to every other cryptocurrencies so I wonder why when it's price is dipping then some other coin starts gaining during that interval of time.",

No doubt say bitcoin market dominance dey above%51 and e hold more than half of market dominance and every othe market depends on am butI Been dey think say all altcoin dey under bitcoin blockchain naim make e dey affect the market just like for example: Etherium and BNB dey under bitcoin blockchainEtherium come get e own blockchain that is ERC, and e also get different coin under am likeTether (USDT)Wrapped bitcoin (Wbtc)Uniswap (uni)Polygon (matics) etcWhile BNB also get in blockchain with BEP, wey get coin wey dey under in blockchain like'Trust walletcoin (TWT)CakeBakeBUSDAnd others wey dey under bnb smart chain, and all these coin to me be like say them depends on each other.  I think if anything happens to bitcoin go affect etherium and BNB so automatically e don affect everybody for The blockchain. For me na the perfect explanation be this to me I no no wether wetting I dey think dey align with others because I wan get a fact.

Of course the growth of altcoins is dependent of the survival of Bitcoin and even the reason why most people go for some other altcoins investment is because they believe that so long as Bitcoin continues to progress there would be every chances of many other altcoins also increasing on there prices. That's why if you check very closely during the early time of this year Bitcoin price dip you will see that almost every other altcoins also follows Bitcoin dip and now as the price is peaking they are also coming up a bit by bit, so actually Bitcoin is the father of all cryotocurrency  and doesn't depend on other coin to grow.",

You can see that the price of BTC has dump back to $35k few hours ago, and other altcoins price too has dump to allow those that missed their opportunity to buy when the price was low to buy now because, the bear market is still on ground to buy and hold.You can see that after BTC, Ethereum is in the second position among other altcoins but if you want to add other altcoins to your investment try to add Ethereum and XRP because, the two altcoins are very good for investors to make a good profits.",

There use to be a time when altcoins will be pumping and bitcoin will be stable and even if there is decline in price, it's usually in small amount. This is when altcoins have a good moment, look at Solana and Avac for example had a good run of their money from few news they posted some days ago and year, profits were everywhere but observe very well when bitcoin was dump, they dumped heavily because lots of people are very cautious of their investment.",
