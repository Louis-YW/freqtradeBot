Nigerian they among countries wey they top bitcoin adoption for the world and this is to tell you that despite government restrictions, people use bitcoin daily without interfering with government, public or private entities.Government stan will remain the same, they will not legalized bitcoin because the government wey get now, the same people wey ban banks from facilitating bitcoin transactions, this is just another government in another uniform but they are still the same father and mother, no difference.I'm not sure about private organizations but adoption comes with use and use means you have to send and receive but private companies are not working in nigeria. The exchanges we have are all P2P and this is individual adoption from people who buy and sell bitcoin.",

Thanks boss, as you trow more light on the matter, I reason your perspective say na di private sector fit to increase the awareness and adoption of bitcoin for inside di country pass di public sector. You really make valid point in terms of say na di private sector de boost our lucrative entertainment sector, but di question be say wetin de stop dem to adopt am as an alternative means of payment for dem shows and endorsements?  Why dem never think go bitcoin side? Abi dem never here about cryptocurrency before or dem no want to get anything to do with decentralized currency? The truth be say me I believe say na because our government never fully endorse cryptocurrency matter for di country, so dem probably de wait wen e go de conducive for dem to fully accept bitcoin. And me I believe say na when di government through dem public sector start to endorse bitcoin, na den dem go begin follow follow join di bandwagon.Me I believe say di fear of government na di beginning of wisdom for our private sectors, because dem no want to offend di government. If no be so some of dem for don adopt bitcoin, as an alternative to naira. CBN restrictions and make government no de look into dem financial matter fit make dem de slack. Lastly i still believe say if di private sector first de accept bitcoin, dem go follow and e go became business as usual, all man do your pwn thing.",

I think na just lack of Crypto educational knowledges dey cus most of these private sectors setback not to fit welcome and accepts cryptos as means of payments due to legitimacies and Fraudulence believes and doubts.And they could also lack the  aids to stare at a staking of any BTC payment received could earn an interest or dividends on high rates. Though could require a lucky time or preferably patient commitments to a period of time after lockup your crypto in the blockchain while expecting a maturity of an increments with with the stamina encouragement that BTC is a decentralized crypto currency where you are subjected to behold the risk and securities of keeping your crypto to an exchangeFood for thoughts.

We the individuals and citizen nai dey actually promote spread and use of Bitcoin because of how beneficial e be to us and believe me if to the government actually allow the use of crypto everywhere e for good well and many Nigerians for explode with many business idea wey involves the use of crypto.",
