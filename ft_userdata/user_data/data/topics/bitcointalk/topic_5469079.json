But since it's presumably that you may have listened to this, and know how useful it is likely to be among Bitcoin community. Why not you go about to summarize how Interlay was able to utilize an already operational, decentralized bridge to connect Bitcoin with a lending protocol to enable Bitcoin holders to access basic financial services? As I'm sure this community will be very grateful to learn something new from a newbie today.",

Not to mention there are tons of alternatives for people who are looking for decentralized exchange, financing, and so on. If I'm not wrong, projects that focus on lending with BTC also exist without touching BTC at all. Maybe this is too early to judge, but I feel like this will just end up as one of those things that gets forgotten with time.",

It is hard and not beneficial to do 51% attacks on Bitcoin network. In contrast, it is unsafe to use cryptocurrency bridges.How many confirmations are equivalent* to 6 Bitcoin confirmations?How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?",

Bitcoin is already good with it's centralized scheme already, no middle man in between, you control the fees you wait and that's it.I don't think we need another later of like decentralized bridge as it makes bitcoin and blockchain more complicated to newbies.

I hope I'm wrong.I hope I don't understand wrongly about decentralized finance platforms (DeFi) but in my perspective, they are centralized platforms, not decentralized. Need an example, yes, let's see the Curve finance and Sushi projects had drama in the last bull run. With centralized power on their founders, co-founders, developer team, their projects are actually centralized and shit can happen anytime when those powerful people want to make scam exit, their devices, accounts are compromised.I hope I am wrong but I don't see how they can be decentralized like Bitcoin.Quote from: Dave1 on October 05, 2023, 10:28:00 AMI don't think we need another later of like decentralized bridge as it makes bitcoin and blockchain more complicated to newbies. And just remember that the design was to used it as a payment method in the first place.I remember the Ronin bridge was hacked because some of their co-signers' keys were breached. Is Ronin Bridge decentralized when they have only some people who are responsible for signing transactions?The Ronin Bridge hackQuoteHow the Hack UnfoldedAccording to a postmortem published by Ronin, the theft came as a result of an attacker hacking the “validator nodes”of the Ronin bridge. Funds can be moved out if five of the nine validators approve it. The attacker managed to get hold of the private cryptographic keys belonging to five of the validators, which was enough to steal the cryptoassets. The post mortem claims that “all evidence points to this attack being socially engineered, rather than a technical flaw”.",

All of these models are not decentralized networks. We can say that some of them are Distributed or does not guarantee a single point of failure, but it is not decentralized because a specific group can cancel, reverse, or even delete transactions if they want to, and they disable the blockchain if something goes wrong or return tokens when they are hacked.image sourceI do not think that Curve finance and Sushi are even distributed. The number of signatories is limited and may not exceed 20",

Because they are centralized in some hands and with DeFi exchanges, you need liquidity pools that can be rug pulled by developers anytime.Their blockchains can be halted like Binance Smart Chain, Harmony chain. Their blockchains can be rolled back if their founders and developers want to do that.Their tokens can be minted with mint function without limit like LUNA in May 2022 which killed many people wanted to catch the falling knife.",
