  "content": "Hi! On this forum there are dozens of topics with Freewallet victims stories. We also are sharing the petition, in which ask NFIB to investigate Freewallet scam. But as we see it's not enough to stop this project.So that, I have another idea and now ask you to help me.Let's send abuses to AppStore support, asking them to remove all Freewallet builds, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero wallet.Algorythm consist from only 3 steps:1. Write the text of the complaint indicating how Freewallet app deceives users. You can write your own story, or take our sample2. Add to your text links to all Freewallet app buildshttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/freewallet-multi-crypto-wallet/id1274003898https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tether-wallet-by-freewallet/id1394509043https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ethereum-wallet-freewallet/id1126843840https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/monero-wallet-by-freewallet/id1126426159https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/litecoin-wallet-best-price/id1282309533https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/simple-bitcoin-wallet-buy-btc/id11268443293. Send abuses to App Store emails reportphishing@apple.com and abuse@icloud.com (preferably sent to both addresses).EXAMPLE OF A COMPLAINTPlease remove Freewallet crypto wallet app builds from Apple store as those apps help steal clients’ digital assets.Please note that Freewallet “wallet” (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freewallet-multi-crypto-wallet/id1274003898) was created by scammers to steal user tokens and coins. There are hundreds of negative reviews and stories told by victims online.Here is a partial list of cases where customers were scammed and their assets stolen:https://realreviews.info/freewallet-the-scam-project-that-threatens-thousands-of-customers/https://realreviews.info/freewallet-app-reviews-is-it-safe-and-legit/https://realreviews.info/more-freewallet-scam-victim-stories/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5249178.0https://freewalletscam.boards.net/thread/7/freewallet-stole-cancer-patients-savingshttps://www.coincarp.com/wallet/streem/Project administration:Substitutes transactions by sending coins to third-party addresses.Blocks wallets under the guise of verification (KYC).Ignores the requests of the victims, demands new documents and refuses any assistance.The victims of the scam have already lost more than $8,000,000.Since there is information that the creators of the Freewallet project live in the United Kingdom, a few days ago was submitted an official request about the crime to the National Fraud Investigation Bureau (NFIB, https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/what-is-national-fraud- intelligence-bureau ). The request is registered under the number NFRC230806087223.In addition, there is an online petition calling on the NFIB to conduct a fair investigation: https://chng.it/wQSYzdv4K9Therefore, we ask you to help restore justice and protect crypto investors, traders, and ordinary users from fraud:Remove Freewallet app from the list of services.Add a note that this wallet is accused of fraud.Publish the news that the Freewallet administration has been accused of fraud..Thanks in advance for your cooperation and help!",

I have little doubt about this wallet because all users who reported here were totally newbie and also they didn't provided strong proof which prove 100% that wallet did any direct scam with them. Some users claimed that they lost more than 10k$ which is apparently not seems true. OP you have any strong proof that This wallet did any scam with you or your relatives?",

      "body": "Why are people using the kind of wallet that you will only register with email, phone number and password? That is the first thing that makes experienced bitcoin users to Freewallet. Another is that in the past, people complained about how their coins were seized. But because it is not a noncustodial wallet (which will generate your seed phrase and your keys), that makes it a wallet that should be avoided. If you want Freewallet to be removed from app stores, I think it can not be done, but try to always educate people that if it is not their keys, it is not their coins.",

Some scam accusations were solved after creating a topic here, but why you put yourself in a situation where you need to provide data to those who do not deserve it and you may lose your money, do not use them.freewallet was criticized by Elon Musk https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-crypto-wallet-was-criticized-by-elon-musk-but-turned-this-into-an-opportunityQuoteIt all began back in February 2021, when Elon Musk was continually tweeting about Dogecoin as it enjoyed the unlikeliest of surges from $0.005 to $0.74.Freewallet quote-tweeted Tesla's Technoking as he sang the words \"Who let the DOGE out\" — adding that \"DOGE doesn't stop.\"But he replied: \"Your app sucks.\"In an example of customer service done right, Freewallet's support team replied minutes later — and said they were on hand to help if he needed anything.\"Please unlock my account,\" Musk wrote.Freewallet did exactly that — springing to action in the blink of an eye — and it's clearly something he appreciated.\"Thanks for fixing,\" he later told them.",

Still, this won't be very effective, they trap many of the users who are not aware of it.I'm really curious when it comes to funds security for an experienced user, he always stays conscious about it even as a newbie who never trust every service frequently, TBH I had never used any of such wallet, nor I had heard of it except a couple of topics covering the same issue.Quote from: PX-Z on November 03, 2023, 01:28:31 PMAs of writing, the app store URL that works is the none below, the rest are just \"Connecting/Resource Not Found\" probably all of them are taken down already.Nope, there will be an issue on your side because the link is working on my side and landing on the Freewallet page.

From what I've read, Google seems to be slow in responding to reports that are not mass-reported, even for scams. Although it is related to ads, there might be some differences. Kinda hard to find out since there is a statement related to how fast they might respond, to begin with, both in Apple and Google stores. That being said, I guess requesting other people to report their case is eventually required regardless of how fast they respond to attract public interest. CMIIW.",

If someone writes and asks me for some advice or help, I am glad to answer. But If we talk about those people who left posts and acuusations several years ago, it's hard to find them now, and of course, many of them even forgot about lost money (if it wasnt a great amount) and probably are not interested in any investigations now because just dont want to spend time.",

Their application is not available on the Google Play Store. You can find their applications on Uptodown through this link: [HERE]. You can include this link in your topic above.It is worth noting that most of the ratings and reviews for Freewallet applications appear to be fake. Therefore, it may be a good idea to leave a one-star rating and provide a brief warning about these applications. Suppose the administrators and the stores' teams do not respond to the reports of the removal of these apps from their stores. In that case, low ratings and negative reviews will serve as a preventive measure for many people unaware of the true nature of this scam wallet, which has caused many users to lose their funds.",

But I was checking ssome ratings today and found that they add many fake positivve reviews. those reviews even look unnatural like \"Oh, it's such a great wallet' (I can't imagine someone wasting his time to write complimentary words just for usual crypto wallet). And those fake reviews help to improve rating.",
