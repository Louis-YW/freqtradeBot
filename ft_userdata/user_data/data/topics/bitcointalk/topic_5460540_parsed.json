Bestchange service works well, but it is still desirable to have completely uncensored feedback from users. It really should be the practice for all similar services.",

What I noticed though is that the available methods for fiat currencies are not in English, something I'm sure needs to be changed. Unless you only address a Russian-speaking audience.Also, I didn't see any other fiat currency/ payment method besides UAH-related. Are you planning to put more fiat currencies and methods of exchanging?",

      "body": "I suggest you take care of marketing your exchange platform. It is clear that it’s been around for almost a year, but what I see is that your communities lack interest and followers. Why don't you update your X account periodically with the latest exchange updates? It would also be good to contract with a designer to create your ANN topic professionally through the [Services] section + hire an experienced sig campaign manager to launch a campaign for your exchange to promote it in the forum and attract the attention of the crypto community. Check this [topic] to find your manager.I wish you all the best, and I hope that you gain more fame and always work on building a good reputation.",
