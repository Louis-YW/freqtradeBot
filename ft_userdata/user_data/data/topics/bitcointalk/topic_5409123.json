  "content": "I don't know what's going on with mods lately, and despite the fact that it's normal for everyone who works to make mistakes, it's hard for me to believe that some of my reports, which are without a doubt quite clear and meaningful, are marked as \"Bad\".It's not even a problem when the report is marked as \"Bad\" and appropriate action is taken, but if nothing is done and the report is marked as \"Bad\" does that mean that some mods don't understand that things that have nothing to do with Bitcoin do not belong in the Bitcoin discussion , as well as that those members who offer paid or free services should use the appropriate boards for that?Example 1Post SEC Charges 11 People in Alleged $300 Million Crypto Ponzi Scheme was originally posted in the Bitcoin discussion although it is quite evident that it has nothing to do with anything related to Bitcoin. I reported a post that was marked as \"Bad\" and the topic was left in the Bitcoin discussion until I decided to contact one of the global mods who moved it to the appropriate board.Example 2Post MY DAILY BITCOIN TRADING SIGNALS is posted inÂ  Economy > Economics > Speculation and I reported it with the indication that it should be moved to Trading, although it could also be suitable for the Service board. I don't understand why a mod thinks that providing any service is appropriate for the Speculation board, but my report is marked as \"Bad\".As someone who is trying to contribute to a better forum, things like this are quite demotivating for me. I repeat once again that I am already used to reports being marked \"Bad\", but it is not clear to me that nothing is done in such cases.",

Such an oversight could be the reason for the obvious wrong calls.The problem is not in \"Bad\" or \"Good\" in the sense of how the report is marked, but in the fact that no action was taken in cases that are more than obvious. Also, it's not just my view of the situation, but also how other members see it and whether it will serve as an example to them that they can do similar things.Quote from: Upgrade00 on August 08, 2022, 12:44:34 PMI can see from the screenshots that the two incidents span about a week; 2 wrong calls in 7 days isn't really a bad figure and while mods should be extra careful, errors happen.There is more, but I don't want to argue about what someone considers a \"low quality topic\" and what is not. Bitcoin discussion is a board in which there are many such topics, but if we were to adhere to high standards, at least 50% of the topics in that board should be deleted or moved.Quote from: mprep on August 08, 2022, 12:54:13 PMIIRC I handled both of these reports. While I do agree that it was an error on my part to mark the first report as bad (somehow I missed the thing being altcoin-related, maybe the images at the bottom didn't load for me; either way I'm sorry for marking it as bad), I still do believe the second report to be bad as the \"service\" is just a guy posting his Bitcoin price guesses (speculation) for free (which is pretty much what the speculation board is for)Thanks for the answer, I honestly did not expect that someone who handled reports would answer. And really, the problem is not that I have collected more bad reports, but that with a little more attention, things like this can be avoided.Regarding the second report, I would not agree that this topic belongs in Speculation, because such topics can mostly be seen in Trading or Service boards. Speculation is one thing, and that member states very clearly that he provides a free service, which for me personally are two different things.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on August 07, 2022, 05:45:28 PMThe time has finally come to fulfil my plan to give daily Bitcoin signals on the Bitcointalk forum. ---I hope my readers benefit from this free service!",
