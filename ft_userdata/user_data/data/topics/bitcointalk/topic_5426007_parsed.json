People convicted of extramarital sex could face as much as one year in prison.This law would also affect foreigners and tourists that came to visit the country. Some citizens of the country are protesting against this law. While others are seeing it as a welcome development.Business owners in the country are lamenting that this law can discourage tourists from visiting the country which would affect their businesses negatively. I am also perceiving that this policy might also scare investors from investing in Indonesia.

      "body": "If those of you who talk about this are Indonesians. So I think you will know that actually Indonesia has long banned adultery or having sex outside of marriage. even in the source you linked it was also explained that the law regarding sex outside of marriage had existed before but was not enforced. and the new law has only been slightly modified or clarified, namely to prohibit sex outside of marriage in its entirety.while the old law only prohibited sex outside of marriage with non-married couples themselves. like the prohibition of the husband having sex with women other than his wife.So this problem does not need to be exaggerated. because actually this thing has been around for a long time.And remember that in Indonesia only accept citizens who are religious. so that Atheists are not allowed in Indonesia based on the 1st PANCASILA, namely Belief in One Almighty God. So that Indonesian citizens are required to have a religion. while in all religions it is said that sex outside of marriage is prohibited. So the law prohibiting sex outside of marriage is actually in line with Pancasila No. 1. although humans have their own rights. But if he has Religion. then he is also obliged to comply with the rules of the religion he adheres to.And once again that this law is nothing new. because almost the same law has existed in Indonesia since the beginning of Indonesia's independence.And as we can see, Indonesia's Economic Sector will be fine.And because Indonesia's majority population is Muslim, this law will actually be welcomed by its citizens. and in fact many countries already have the same laws regarding the prohibition of sex outside of marriage as in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Philippines, Egypt, Malaysia. And many more and All is well. sourch : LinkAnd when talking about business. Maybe some businesses will be affected by this law. But only part of the business. And because this Law is not entirely new. so actually businesses in Indonesia are used to this. Actually, the punishment for sex outside of marriage in Indonesia is quite light when compared to Arab countries like Qatar, where the applicable sentence is 7 years in prison. Sourch : google",

In this case, they don't have much choice than to adapt to the new laws if the government is not ready to make any form of amendment.",

This will expose the largest profitable sector in the economy (tourism) to a decline to record levels. Of course, do not believe that this law will prevent people from having sex outside marriage, because this is human nature that cannot be restricted by customary provisions.The most logical explanation for issuing such a decision is that Indonesia will receive support from one of the major Islamic countries, such as Saudi Arabia or Qatar, and it needed to prove that it is a real Muslim country, since Indonesia is the country with the largest number of Muslims around the world.",

Since it is going to affect not only the citizens but also foreigners, I think it will have adverse economic effects because I am not sure foreigners would want to live in a country or even visit a country where they can be imprisoned for living together and having sex without marriage. Harsh legislation can also play a negative role when it comes to foreign investments, as it signifies an unstable political climate (if they can imprison people for sex, what's going to be banned next?). Outside Indonesia, though, I don't think we'll feel the economic impact of this decision.",

Most people know that when foreigners arrived in their country, it's more than the tourism that they need.And, when such laws have been passed it'll be a basis for tourists to avoid Indonesia because they don't want to get in jail or face some problems just because of it.That's why if there are businesses protesting on this law, it is because they know that they'll be affected by it.",

I think you are consuming too much news from one side and one source for referrals. FunnyIf you are Indonesian, you see that a strong country is a country that establishes its own rules, not subject to being dictated by western countries. After all, if you know Bali, then the rules for foreigners are relaxed as a form of respecting their customs. Don't pretend that one generalized rule is bad.In all beliefs sex outside marriage is not allowed Christianity, Buddhism, and Catholicism. Even if you read the Old Testament. Moreover, Indonesia is a majority Islamic country and that is their rule.",

Visiting Bali, all tourists are greeted with what they are accustomed to, but not in all parts of Indonesia.This is the difference that we need to appreciate, you might generalize that compatibility can only be felt and proven by having sex. Oh, is it that simple to get married? Marriage is not just to satisfy desire alone, marriage is much bigger in purpose. Perfecting each other, accepting born and inner all of each other's shortcomings. Talking about satisfaction? can be searched for and worked on together, that is the beauty of marriage, doesn't it mean that when you don't have sex with your wife, you have to have an affair?",
