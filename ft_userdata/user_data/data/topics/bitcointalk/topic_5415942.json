Electrum is an open-source wallet which gives you complete security if it's used properly. Electrum gives you numerous addresses all backed up by a seed phrase. Take note that if you want your wallet and your addresses to be 100% secure, you should install electrum on an air-gapped device. Warning:Download electrum only from its official website and do not forget to verify your download.",

Ensure you follow the process securely, to really keep the process safe, and back up your seedphrase properly.If you're looking for an address that would cut on fees, you should go for SegWit addresses (starting with a 'b'). It reduces the fee rate paid on transactions, as it (basically) reduces the size of the transaction.",

Since installing electrum is usually faster, electrum mostly wins against bitcoin core. Your address is only as strong as your weakest link in your home pc setup. If you have a compromised OS, it don't really matter which software you use because you will get hacked anyway.Linux, Electrum does it for me. I don't about the internet connection because I am behind a firewall and I don't install unpopular crap to my system.",

It's not that all bitcoin addresses are generated from a seed phrase. Your seed phrase generates your private keys and your private keys generate your addresses.For generating a bitcoin address, you can convert a random number to a private key and then derive a bitcoin address from that private key. In this way, the address has been generated from the private key directly and you don't have any seed phrase.Take note that there is no mention of \"Seed phrase\" in bitcoin whitepaper and bitcoin core doesn't give you any seed phrase at all.",

You won’t have to worry about being hit with malware etc.In principle, we can say that it is one of the safer ways to generate crypto wallets and perform transactions, but even hardware wallets have their weaknesses. Most of us know what happened with the massive data leak by Ledger and the compromising of the privacy of hundreds of thousands of their clients - which means that when buying such devices you should avoid exposing your data.And as far as malware is concerned, it is not true that users can relax completely because they are still susceptible to clipboard malware attacks, especially if they do not use their HW as they should, which means comparing the address on the HW and the UI they are using. Also, mishandling a backup can have disastrous consequences, because each of these devices can break down at any time, which some do not take into account at all.",

      "body": "Hi, it seems that you are new to all this. All of us were at one time or other. I suggest don't jump in to anything too much before you learn a bit about crypto. Like others said, electrum is really good. I don't suggest that you hold your coins long term on an exchange, they tend to get hacked once in a while. It's safer to hold them in a cold wallet (if you do it right). For larger amounts, many people like to use a trezor or ledger wallet, but that's probably overkill for most of us. There is no hurry, its not going anywhere. Take your time and learn a bit before jumping in. it's not a get rich quick scheme (although I think bitcoin will go up long term). Don't get caught by a scam. And NEVER give away your passphrase to anyone. The bitcoin isn't really stored on your computer. You might think it is but anyone with your pass phrase can take the bitcoin from any where in the world (probably even the space station if they have internet lol). Good luck!",
