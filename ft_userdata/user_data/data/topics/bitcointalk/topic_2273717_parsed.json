Wallets are available to download for all Operating Systems too, so those won't matter either. For security, you'll have to take care of it manually. Strong passwords, no public Internet usage, private systems for yourself to keep your funds etc. These all are measures to be taken by yourself and has nothing to do with what system or machine you use for the purpose.",

Make sure you have a credible antivirus, do not click on links you don't know the source to, do not log into public WiFi. To be honest as far as I'm concerned its safer to have a separate laptop for daily use and for bitcoin transactions.",

Doesn't matter if you go for a laptop or anything else as long as you disconnect it from the internet it is good for security. Well, depends on how much you know on protecting your bitcoins.Now for wallets, we really cannot say which is which because nothing stays the same in this world forever. So the only thing you can rely on for deciding is your own guts. Opinions are nice but still, what makes the decision is you. So gather as much knowledge as you can while you're here. Every piece of information is important. It is easier to do things yourself than to rely oj others(if you get my point).",

Every modern laptop/PC will we more than sufficient to run Bitcoin Core.There are no beter or worse pieces of hardware, just follow the general rule of picking hardware: more expensive = better performance, usually.Quote from: #BitcoinVegan on October 15, 2017, 05:11:28 PMWhat security services should I use?What do you mean security services? Just download a wallet, protect it with good passwords, preferably use some kind of password manager for that/And use digital hygiene is a must, install antivirus, anti-malware or even better create a paper wallet or offline wallet to keep the most of your Bitcoins there.",

I just want to be as close to correct as possible. Call 2X BTCCorp for all i care im not with corporate espionageI'm not the most security conscious or knowledgeable person & my opsec isn't great but I'll make an attempt to answer this.It could be best to avoid brands like Lenovo which are rebranded IBM bought out by china. The chinese have a history of \"accidentally\" installing backdoors on products like smart phones. Earlier this year there was a news story about as many as \"700 million\" android phones being infected by a chinese backdoor. I can't remember confirmed cases of them installing backdoors on laptops or desktops but better safe than sorry.Compatibility with core wallets isn't something I know much about. Sometimes standard PCs and laptops have better compatibility than macs. Other than that it doesn't matter. Security wise, if anti virus is constantly running in the background it has a tendency to destroy hard drives faster. Scanning periodically typically allows hardware to have a longer lifespan. Standard windows firewalls are heavily targeted. Some type of 3rd party software firewall, which is less targeted than standard windows fw is preferred. If security is a high priority a hardware firewall is also a good idea. Browser extensions like noscript which block unauthorized objects and scripts can be good for preventing browser based attacks. Also for security purposes, its good to disable windows 10 logging user data via default. Other good practices are to avoid porn sites, warez sites, streaming sites--virtually any website which hosts banner ads which can serve as known attack vectors.Sorry to say there is a very long and detailed check list truly security conscious people follow. Most of us probably don't have the time for it.",

But if you are getting a brand new laptop, look for latest hardware and with a good amount of HDD. Probably around 500 gig to 1 tera will be a safe bet if you are going to run full node and using bitcoin core wallet.As far as security, buy as well a good anti virus like Kaspersky because we all know that bitcoin and crypto has been the target for many hackers now. A good anti-virus will be a good start to prevent that kind on intrusion.",

Choose an antivirus that can protect you from ransom wares and spywares. Antivirus is definitely a crucial factor, no doubt about that, but it's important to understand that even the best antivirus software engines can't protect you in all cases. Very recently, the very popular cleaning software CCleaner was messed with, and none of the plenty antivirus software engines started alerting users that they installed malicious software. It was pointed at various multinationals (likely for espionage purposes), but it could be used to gain access to each and every computer it was installed on. It just shows that no matter how many precautions are taken, you will always be extremely vulnerable. I use it too, but I haven't updated to a newer version since 2015, which helped me in this case. And for whatever reason, it only affected 32bit systems.",
