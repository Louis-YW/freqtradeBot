So my fellow users, please help us clarify this doubt.",

Your wrongly sent funds can only be sent back if only you know the owner of the recipient address and he sends it back to you. Also any bitcoin sent to another address that is also not say a bitcoin address is also lost forever and cannot be reversed. Example is, an ethereum coin sent to a bitcoin address. Most wallets do warn for cases like this, others don’t.",

But there are some cases that you may be able to recover your coins after some research, but the chance is very negligible after such transfer are of huge amount of money. Better do not send coins to a wrong address because you may never get it back. The chance that you may never back is almost 100%.",

Because all the transactions that are made with Bitcoin are truly decentralized and are irreversible. There have been some cases where some set very high transaction fees that miners have returned, and even the same happened with many people who mistakenly sent higher amount in transaction to an address which were returned back to the original sender. In your case only the one who received the Bitcoin or any other irreversible crypto-curranty has the power to send you those coins again. Other than that there isn't a way to get those coins, and even if you know hacking, you still won't be able to get those coins back.There are some crypto-currencies that allow reversible transactions such as USDT, XRP, XLM, and some other crypto currencies also have some level of support to reverse a transaction. However, that's not an easy thing to do, and even if the transaction was made with any of those crypto-currencies, you would still won't be able to receive the money back because they don't have that much time to reverse simple and low amount transactions. In some of those coins the network of users collectively have to decide whether they want to freeze or reverse a transaction or not.",

Transaction that has been confirmed cannot be reversible,this is the reason why you will be advised to make sure that you are sending your coins to the right address. If you are lucky,you might get back your funds if the receiver is a good person. I have mistakenly done this before and I lost my coins finally. This is the reason when transferring,your coins you should be careful and don't do it in a rush.",

So my fellow users, please help us clarify this doubt.It is a clear question for anyone with knowledge about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general: it is not possible to reverse a transaction that is confirmed unless the recipient decides to send you back your funds. Due to the decentralized system of the Bitcoin blockchain that nobody has control over it. It is really clear that when you send Bitcoin to the wrongwallet address, due to it doesn't involve any third-party, and that means it is only person that get the wallet that has control over it wallet, you have nothing to do about the transaction that is confirmed because nobody have access to the recipient's wallet like bank, so this is the reason why someone always needs to check the wallet address before performing transactions.",
