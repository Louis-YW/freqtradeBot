  "content": "And email marketing firm recently, Klaviyo, (https://www.klaviyo.com/) has been hacked by cyber criminals and stole the mailing lists of their for 38 customers who are in the cryptocurrency industry. And they have taken. names, email addresses, phone numbers, and some account specific custom profile properties for profiles.Quotethe threat actor used the internal customer support tools to search for primarily crypto related accounts and viewed list and segment information for 44 Klaviyo accounts. For 38 of these accounts, the threat actor downloaded list or segment information. The information downloaded contained names, email addresses, phone numbers, and some account specific custom profile properties for profiles in those lists or segments. All of these accounts have been notified with the details of which profiles and profile fields were accessed or downloaded.As far as I know, those 38 customers doesn't mean 38 individual per se, it could be that one of this 38 could have thousands of crypto related mailing list already so this is big.So for those who may have received some emails, SMS, then be very careful as obviously, this is phishing.The security incident is in their website : https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/august-2022-security-incident, explaining how the hackers gained access on their system and tips on what to do.",

As soon as you hand any coin or any piece of information over to any third party, then that coin or piece of information is at risk of theft, regardless of how big or reputable you think that third party is.",

And personal data in this decade, in the age of information, this is jackpot for this criminals.And the wave still continues,  Hackers Behind Twilio Breach Also Targeted Cloudflare Employees.QuoteWeb infrastructure company Cloudflare on Tuesday disclosed at least 76 employees and their family members received text messages on their personal and work phones bearing similar characteristics as that of the sophisticated phishing attack against Twilio.The attack, which transpired around the same time Twilio was targeted, came from four phone numbers associated with T-Mobile-issued SIM cards and was ultimately unsuccessful.The text messages pointed to a seemingly legitimate domain containing the keywords \"Cloudflare\" and \"Okta\" in an attempt to deceive the employees into handing over their credentials.",

      "body": "Here’s one of the companies who was affected by the data theft: Swan Crypto. Swan Crypto has sent an email to the subscribers to its email list, informing on the events, and stating that the compromised information was first name, email, IP geolocation data is some cases, and how the person joined the email list. Nevertheless, an additional 0.3% of the dataset also contained historical USD deposit information as of before March 2022. This adds more insights into this leak, and though it is seemingly limited to marketing contact related information, campaigns are not only run based on names and emails, but rather certain campaigns are what are called segmented. A segmented campaign uses a field or a set of fields to send specific messages/offers to certain customers, which could vary, for example, based on their aggregate USD deposits as could be the case. The company, Swan Bitcoin, therefore likely loaded a custom field for some campaign onto Klaviyo in order to perform this segmentation for a given campaign. This implies that, aside from some standard fields that have already been mentioned, further information may have been leaked in some cases, as is the case here depicted.Interesting too:QuoteThe data leak at Klaviyo also comes hot on the heels of reports that another popular email marketing platform Mailchimp has been suspending the accounts of crypto-related content creators and media outlets.The affected businesses include the likes of self-custody crypto wallet Edge, crypto intelligence firm Messari, and Decrypt, as the developments once again highlighted the yet-to-be-resolved reliance of Web3 companies on legacy Web2 solutions.See: https://decrypt.co/107236/swan-bitcoin-discloses-data-leak-due-phishing-attack-newsletter-providerTrying to see if the second paragraph above is concerning MailChimp or Klaviyo, being the latter what I presume for now..Edit: It's the former (so Edge, Messari and Decrypt are not amongst those impacted by the Klaviyo inciden ):https://decrypt.co/107099/intuit-owned-mailchimp-is-banning-crypto-content-creators",

That's true. Most phones have that, mine included. But from the three options you mentioned, I doubt many people would use the first two as you are basically removing the function of a phone. Blocking unknown numbers could work sometimes, but it's impossible to have everyone you know in your address book. You can miss important appointments or even get yourself or others in trouble doing that. The 3rd option is the most logical one. But from personal experience, even that isn't always the best. Sometimes when I get a call from one of my colleagues, they come from hidden office numbers. I still need to get those.",

In fact, Twilio’s hack led to the hackers getting hold of data for around 130 corporations back then.I hadn’t heard anything else on the matter until today, when I read an article stating that crypto portfolio tracker CoinTraker, had been indirectly breached, leading to 1.557.153 emails and partial phone numbers being leaked. The DB is circulating around hacker forums, and is really originated in one of Cointracker’s service providers. The second referenced article below points to the service provider in question being Twilio, and more specifically one of their companies: SendGrid. I’ve read on Reddit about recent scam/phishing attempts being sent to emails belonging to Cointracker customers, which has led to Cointracker confirming the breach. From my perspective, it’s possible that Cointracker thought it was in the clear after Twilio’s breach las summer, and if they were forewarned by Twilio as a potential victim, they probably should have warned their customer base then, and not having waited for scam/phishing emails to start reaching their customer base in what could be an act of negligence.See:(GT) https://es-beincrypto-com.translate.goog/cointracker-sufre-brecha-datos-exponiendo-usuarios-ataques-phishing/?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapphttps://beincrypto.com/cointracker-crypto-portfolio-software-suffers-data-hack/https://www.databreaches.net/important-cointracker-security-update/",
