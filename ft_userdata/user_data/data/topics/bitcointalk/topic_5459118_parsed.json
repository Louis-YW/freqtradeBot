Over time, if you save more, you can buy more bitcoin little by little, following a strategy known as DCA.Always think before you invest to have 3 to 6 months of emergency expenses saved. Then you can invest. Otherwise you may be forced to unwind your investment (sell) if you need the money in the middle of a bear market at a loss.",

I still don't understand if my decision is right, please let me know your opinionGiven your situation, I would be more likely to diversify my portfolio into bitcoin, fiat, gold and bonds.Bitcoin might give better returns but depending on the availability in your country you may or may not be able to encash it at the right time.Gold might give decent returns and you will be able to encash it since it can be easily sold at shops and so it will help you in case of any emergency.You can hold some fiat cash with you so that you don't face any liquidity crisis and can plan things out accordingly.You can hold bonds in case the banks go bankrupt then bond holders will still be on the safer side.If I were you then I would divide my portfolio in below criteriaBitcoin - 30%Gold - 30%Bonds - 20%Fiat cash - 20%I am not counting real estate because I am assuming if you are having real estate then just keep as it is.This is just my idea of diversification and you can do your own research.",

Remember that there's ongoing crisis happening on your country so think more wisely and don't rush your decision making on investing. Maybe for now try to seek crypto job as sideline and try to grow your money earned there since this could be the safest option you have rather than trying to risk all because you think you can earn easily with this.",

Bitcoin has a future to increase more its value but it will depend on the market. Sometimes youll encounter its a very low price which will average your buying power and get a general weighted shares. But dont expect that it will be a win win solution. Right now, its on 30k level and we can see below that or burst to its ATH before who knows this is a speculative asset.",

I can say that early investors have made some money out of their Bitcoin investments, and even recent investors are hoping for the best. From the evidence gotten from the Bitcoin history of Bitcoin, I can easily say it is worth investing. From your story, you said that you have been involved in bitcoin for a long time now, and with that, I may believe you understand both the advantages and risks involved in bitcoin investment and the cryptocurrency industry. If you do not understand it properly, I will advise you to take your time and learn more, so that your knowledge can decide for you whether you should invest in Bitcoin or do another business with the money you been saving for over four years. I want you to know that nobody is sure of what will happen, but your knowledge is your hope.",

You will never regret such a decision and you will see exciting results in the future.If you had large amounts of money such as 10k or more, I would advise you to buy half of it in Bitcoin and the other half or less in gold and keep some fiat to buy the necessary needs, but since the amount you have is not large, it is better not to divide it and buy only Bitcoin.Inflation threatens all countries without exception, so everyone must withdraw their money from banks before they go bankrupt and transfer them to Bitcoin or gold.",

I'm not fond of banks either; your money is sitting there losing value while they're profiting from your deposits, and in return, you receive a mere interest rate that won't yield more than a few euros per year. On top of that, the government has full access to your spending and how much money you have. In the recent filing of taxes, there was a detailed list of how much money has been spent from each bank account I own. It's insane to think how much information they can see about us with zero privacy whatsoever.The issue, however, lies in the fact that we can't 100% depend on cryptocurrencies for our daily spending; it's not the most convenient thing unless we use a card such as Binance's or Crypto.com's or a few other cryptocurrency cards that are out there, but even then, banks can't be completely avoided.",

In all type of investment there is risk and you need to admit it. But yes you can make your investment more precise by calculating the risk involved in it. According to me investing all the savings in a particular sector is not good. You should always diversify your investment in various assets. But as you have mentioned about the economy of Bangladesh and it’s banking system, so yes investing in Bitcoins will be more profitable at current situation.",

I still don't understand if my decision is right, please let me know your opinionI appreciate your decisions and always remember bottom Holders win the race in crypto market. There is a little suggestion for you, if you can do so just invest particularly which means DCA( Dollar Cost Averaging). As we are now climbed up a little bit from the bear market so it's not the perfect period to invest entire funds at a same time. Predictions are prediction they can be real or can't and crypto market is totally uncertain but we believe in Bitcoin which can create another history.We all know that doing DCA will maximize your investment so try this for a better starting. Again after investment you have to keep your funds fully secured. As we know how much risky the custodial wallets are. So try non custodial open source wallets like Electrum, Mycelium, Blue Wallet etc. Another word I want to add as you are not a beginner at all so hope you have some knowledge about it's volatility and disadvantages. So be prepare to face good or bad days for Bitcoin and invest smartly with proper analysis and risk management.Wish you all the best for you investment.",

You should do it periodically assuming that there is no other investment that has caught your attention.",

Investing in bitcoin is a good investment, but investing all of our money in it is not a good idea as the future is unpredictable, so never put all your eggs in one basket. No matter how bad the crisis is, cash is always needed in all cases, so I advise you to have a reasonable allocation to avoid difficulties in life. You should only invest 50% of it in bitcoin, and the rest you should save in cash for everyday expenses and emergencies.One of the most important things, your country is still banning bitcoin, so be careful with your bitcoin investment if you don't want more trouble.",
