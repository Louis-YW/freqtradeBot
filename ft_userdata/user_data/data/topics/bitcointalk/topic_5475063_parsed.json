  "content": "Hello, sorry if there is another thread for this kind of post, but I couldn't find one.  I'm looking for the best and brightest IT pro in the bitcoin community to be the lead developer in a venture backed bitcoin startup company.  The ideal candidate would have at least several years of web application development experience, having built applications from the ground up.  A solid understanding of oop and software architecture is a must.  Experience in a start-up environment is a plus, or just being super hard working, self-motivated, and creative.Compensation can be in the form of equity or a salary, or somewhere in-between.1) What are your qualifications for this position?2) What interests you about bitcoin?From there, we can talk about things like compensation and references and I can answer your questions as well.  Thanks in advance to any interested parties.  If anyone knows another good place to recruit, I am all ears.",

Feel free to PM me though (I currently work as a CTO of a company part-time)",

Put the salary in an escrow (at least the first month) and write the requirements accurately, years of experience and previous projects, in addition to an explanation of the details. and move the topic to Services subboard.",

Because nobody is going to go for the equity deal of a start up. As another poster already mentioned above, most start-ups fail and leave the equity holders with nothing. That is not something that any reasonable person would want to invest their time into.I think many of us would want to know about this project. Surely you have a business plan or whitepaper or something that you can show us? Maybe introduce the team (Assuming you have a team)",

For me it sounds like an idea, not more. Ideas fail even more than start ups. And due to the reasons you mentioned.",

      "body": "First off good luck on your startup! And congrats!Your looking for multiple hats for one role?Sounds like you need a CTO, Scrum and fullstack dev just to get started. A lot of devs won't touch equity based stuff unless they believe in it or like you/your idea.Some might do it for a portfolio piece.So if your backed and offer a salary I'm interested in talking but I'd like to know more about your startupI'm currently a CTO for a corporation that deals in brokering it services and equipment as well as consulting.I've done a few Bitcoin projects out of love. I had hoped for the best but expected the worst and landed somewhere between in most.Blockchain in general changed my life and got me back into the security scene. I've been poking around for years and still haven't found any security flaws in my scope to exploit. The last year or so I've been doing ai work , even got a job offer at replika! It wasn't something I saw myself doing long term. Chatbots are boring.",

Getting an IT pro wouldn't be difficult in there.",
