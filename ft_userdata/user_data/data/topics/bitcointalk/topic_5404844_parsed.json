On Solcial each user has their own token, allowing you to invest directly in them. You get minted 1 millions coins when you signup, that supply is fixed and the same for everyone. To begin with every user will have their token price set to $1 with 10,000 of their tokens put in a liquidity pool. This helps insure that tokens are tradeable and users can compare token prices knowing they began at the same price. Otherwise, these coins are yours, you can keep them or sell them (or send them to friends).To follow people on Solcial, Solcial have 3 subscription levels: you can follow someone for free (Tier 1) to access their public content (similar to Twitter or Instagram), and to access their private content (what Solcial call Tier 2 and 3 subscriptions) you need to own their token, to be an investor in them. That’s what Solcial called the “invest-for-subscription” model.You can also display your NFTs on your user profile, either just to show-off, or to buy & sell your NFTs with your friends. All user content is stored on IPFS and accessed through a P2P layer that Solcial developed. Therefore Solcial doesn't rely on censorable servers or gateways. And the token related operations (minting, trading etc) are all on the Solana BlockchainUser tokenOn Solcial everyone has their own token, with their own price, and market cap. Every user begins with a token price of $1, but this changes as market demand either increases or reduces your price. You could see it as a \"social market cap\". Solcial also introduced the \"invest to subscribe\" model: when you buy the token of someone, you not only invest in them, but you also subscribe to their private posts, only visible to their token holders. These subscribers are tiered based on the amount of token you hold. For example for a user named Joe: - Tier 1: Anyone can follow Joe for free, and access his public content.- Tier 2: Anyone holding 5 JOE tokens can see the Tier 2 content of Joe. - Tier 3: Anyone holding 70 JOE tokens can see the Tier 3 content of Joe.These tiers and amounts are all customisable for every user.Permissionless- The other interesting feature of Solcial is that there is no central authority that decides what gets censored or permitted. It's the community that governs and operates the social network, through its DAO and foundation. Any holder of SLCL token can vote on-chain for the future decisions of the social network. - This doesn’t mean that all type of content is allowed, even if nudity is permitted, some type of content is not a question of freedom of speech and is simply illegal, everywhere (like child-porn, nazi posts, or terrorism) and will be moderated by the community.Mission and VisionOur primary goal is to create a more open, inclusive social network that promotes freedom of speech and helps citizens voice their opinions in a civil way, without government interference or fear of being banned or prosecuted. Our second main goal is to raise global economic prosperity, allowing anyone to unlock growth through the transformative potential of crypto. Permitting users to monetize their content, their value-add, irrespective of their talents by tokenizing their social capital. It's a new economic model that allows anyone to become a business.Get in TouchDiscord : https://discord.gg/solcialTelegram : https://t.me/solcialTwitter : https://twitter.com/solcialofficialBlog : https://blog.solcial.io/Website : https://solcial.io/Email : hello@solcial.ioLinktree : https://linktr.ee/solcial",
