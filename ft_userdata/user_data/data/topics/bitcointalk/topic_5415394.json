  "content": "Hi guys! I am planning to sell my most valuable collectible I've ever owned because I want bitcoin now. This is a near mint condition first edition, shadowless charizard pokemon trading card. This card is unique in that it is one of the rarest and most prized pokemon cards of all time. At 8 out of 10, the grade indicates that the card is almost flawless. There is only one other type of pokemon card in the entire world that is more valuable than this 1st edition charizard.This card is worth exactly what I'm trying to sell it for. I'm only selling it so that I can get bitcoin ASAP while the price is relatively low. I can only do an exchange in person, so whoever buys it from me must meet me somewhere publicly in person. Like bitcoin, collectibles like this are expected to appreciate in value over time.I'm asking 0.60 BTC for this collectible. I'm located in the southeastern USA and I will deliver the card to you in person if you decide to buy. I will not sell internationally nor outside the southeast because I do not want to risk shipping the item for fear of damage and/or fraud. If we meet to exchange for the card, I will require that we wait for 10 confirmations to my bitcoin wallet before I let you take the card. After that, it's yours!If you're concerned about whether it is a genuine card, you can always use the QR code on the slab case to look up the official grading results of the card on the CGC authentication website.https://imgur.com/a/lWQQRw9If you want to buy, please reach out! It's an awesome card and I believe that it will only get more valuable over the years.",
