  "content": "Seeing as BTC is fully decentralized and free of censorship, why do bitcoiners need to pay a little attention to it? Here's why.Since BTC is not private by default and as such every transaction conducted is recorded on the Blockchain and as such one has to provide personal information to exchanges like Binance, FTX and Coinbase when purchasing Bitcoin, it invariably means your real identity is revealed and leaves you open to issues like this;= Personal information on the exchange's centralized database is prone to data leakages and hack. Info can be shared with the government on request and this leaves you a vulnerable target for an  EO 6102 attack= These exchanges become a choke hold for enforcing regulatory actions like OFAC sanctions and they are left with no choice but to oblige. To cite an instance, is the Tornado Cash mixer issue on Aug 8th. 2022.= There's a loss of financial privacy as your transactions can be tracked without limit by the exchange even when the owner of the coins wants to make a withdrawal.    How then can one be free from these setbacks?- To stay anonymous, you run your own node, you conduct your transaction yourself and also verify it. How is this done? You first download a Bitcoin Core software and allow it copy the entire Blockchain from other nodes. Nodes validate and  broadcast transaction to network, and once the transaction is validated the nodes add the new block to the previous series of blocks.- You employ the coin join method A coin join helps for privacy as it achieved when two or more parties batch their transaction into one single transaction. This obscures who owns which coin and a coin join forward severs the historical links and data watchers can't be able to trace the origin.- To be safe from these regulatory bodies, buying coins from centralized exchanges should be discontinued. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/is-bitcoin-private-enough-for-freedom",

      "body": "Downloading the blockchain and running your own node helps privacy if using it with Tor.But you can be anonymous if you use Tor to connect with your SPV wallet. This way, you depend on central server which can link your wallet addresses together and also with the IP address that you are using with the wallet. But if you use Tor with it, the addresses can still be linked together, but no linked to the real owner of the addresses. Other privacy means like making use of coin control appropriately can help.You are right, but people have more followed centralized exchangee. There are decentralized ones like Bisq which is better, but people prefer going the other side. This makes me not to be surprised anymore when people are falling victims of scammers that want to pay 10x or more profit within just a month and they fall for it.",

      "body": "The fact that people think fiat is private, and just automatically assume that when we're living in a world where data sharing is a gold mine, quite frankly confuses me. I don't trust the banks that everyone uses, to not be forwarding our finances to other companies. Since, today everything is about marketing, and who knows your finances better than anyone else? It's your bank. I'll give an example, if the bank knows you're running low on money, they might offer you a loan via the post, or they might forward that to other companies which can offer you similar services, depending whether that bank actually offers loans or not. Although, even if they don't forward you to another company, and offer it themselves it proves that they either have a automatic system or have looked into it personally, and have identified you need a little help. Some people might think that's a benefit, but it also proves they can, and do look at your balances, and they try to push things onto you because of that. Bitcoin doesn't have that at least. Plus, you have the option of not associating your Bitcoin balance with you. Obviously, you're subject to websites that use tracking to link you with addresses, and that's probably something you should be aware of, and try avoiding. So, while Bitcoin might not be anonymous by default, I don't believe fiat is either. Unless, you're dealing with cash.",

But there are known exchange for bitcoin which you dont need to give up the KYC and you have an option to do a peer to peer transaction limiting the censorship and tracking of activity you are conducting and planning to do. Satoshi meant to be it like that, but the introduction of centralization such as exchanges make it convenient for everyone to convert it into fiat well a lot of people uses that more than the p2p and bitcoin market without KYC. But its always up to us to make a choice for this.",

It also allows users to trade XMR in the same manner. You do not have to pass KYC but it is slow and sometimes there are connection issues because it uses TOR network.

And for this there are plenty of solutions, all getting discussed here now and then.* use, where possible, non KYC exchanges and other P2P options when buying bitcoin (and of course, the fiat you pay with should also not be tied to your name)* you can go some steps forward by using Tor, and/or mixers, and even use (atomic swap?) of Monero, if you know what you're doing and also acknowledge the possible risks* make proper use of change addresses and the multiple addresses in your wallet (when you buy and when you spend too)* use your own node* use your own block explorer* don't brag about how much coins you haveOne arguably extra step could also be to pay your taxes and then you don't need that strict protection of your privacy.",

If you want to avoid your Bitcoin transaction getting traced to you, you can use bitcoin mixing services to always mix your coins to avoid traces but that also come with fees. Freedom through Bitcoin can be categorizeded into several categories but the obvious to is the freedom to remain private with your financial dealing through Bitcoin, and also Bitcoin gives its holders the ability to make profits on their bitcoin holdings which is one of the most celebrated characteristics of Bitcoin ability to transform the life of it holders are given them total financial freedom.",

I get the impression some here are suggesting peer to peer trades for that reason. Financial freedom doesn't mean breaking the law. It means you have the freedom to do whatever you want within reason, and you don't have to rely on a third party to confirm or reject your transaction.

It isn't a must to buy or sell Bitcoin on CEX, we can do it on DEX as well. DEX never asks for KYC, our private data isn't needed for them. So, you can't claim Bitcoin isn't private only on CEX side, it is only an alternative. We have DEX which keeps the privacy of the users' data.",

It's one thing if the Bitcoin is a part of what you have, and for example you have a paid house and a job that gives you a good fiat salary, and apart from that a large amount of Bitcoin privately.But if we are talking about Bitcoin alone, to be financially free in a rich country you will need at least $2M. This depends on age and other factors but I think it's a good benchmark.If the Bitcoin you have is \"private\", meaning the authorities don't know you have it, how do you expect to pay all your expenses?You can't buy a house. To pay rent you would have to find someone who will accept your Bitcoin and won't declare it, with the risks that this entails. To buy a car the same. Or get a lease.Buying at the supermarket or clothes you might find solutions, but spending 100% of your expenses in Bitcoin today I see it difficult.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on September 17, 2022, 02:20:47 AMIf you don't use illegal money to buy Bitcoin and use it for money laundering, you don't have to obsess too much about privacy.I agree.
