It can't be that you immediately know and believe in any young project. This can only be the case with publicized projects with already large capital.That's not entirely accurate, in my opinion! Speaking as someone who's been involved in a few startups, I've seen firsthand how young projects can turn into something pretty amazing. But, it all boils down to the vision and the creative thinking driving the project. It's not just about how much cash you kick things off with.Now, I'll be upfront – I haven't dug deep into your project, but based on what I've seen here on the forum, I didn't spot anything that would make me want to invest. If Cogitex has some promising ideas up its sleeve, it might be a good move to spill the beans with more specifics and real-world examples of how those ideas will actually play out and what benefits they bring.Investors usually look for projects that not only have cool ideas but also a clear roadmap for how they'll grow and a solid strategy. Being straight up about your team's skills and having a rock-solid marketing game plan can also help build investor trust.",

We plan to use CGTX tokens to support AI that serves you. Imagine having a smart AI assistant that helps you with daily tasks, provides advice, and optimizes your life. This is just one way Cogitex can make your life better.Android Robots:Androids are our big vision. We're gearing up to create android robots that will be part of the Cogitex ecosystem. They will perform various functions, starting as household helpers and extending to research roles. And, of course, they will work with our cryptocurrency CGTX, making it more valuable for all holders.Lunar Travel:What if traveling to the Moon became as accessible as going to a resort? That's our long-term goal. When Cogitex matures, we'll offer you the chance to journey to the Moon using CGTX.",

We're not saying we need a million dollars and then maybe we'll do something. Now we're going to put ourselves out there in advertising to get more people to know about the project. And can you explain what proof you need? Sorry, but to develop AI you need money, and you say that you need proof that the project is doing something to get money, but without money we can't make this proof. You see? It's a vicious circle.

Sometimes, you need time and resources to make things happen. That's why project teams sometimes make promises – it's a way to bring in the dough they need to eventually deliver them real results.Now, if the project already had a boatload of cash, sure, actions would be more important than promises. But when you're workin' with a tight budget upfront, promises can be a way to rustle up the greenbacks for future growth and real results.I agree with you that not all projects have a good budget and support from big companies or foundations. Making promises is not a bad thing, especially if these promises are correctly fulfilled afterwards. Initially, I did not pay attention to the promise or small budget, but to what you write about the fact that this project has proven itself. This is distorted information, because this project does not have any data that could be considered recommendable.",

Let's discuss what, in your opinion, might be missing from our coin to make it even better.The problem is that they proclaim themselves as a great and promising project but it has never been seen by the community. That means that this project is not important and has no role in the crypto space where investors are just ignoring it. Not a surprise either and if you are holding this project, never expect profit. The best thing you do is to sell them and move to other projects that are really well-established. Because it was too hard to think for a project to grow when not seeing that they were working on it to improve. Some projects are just good at the start but they are not good in the long run.",
