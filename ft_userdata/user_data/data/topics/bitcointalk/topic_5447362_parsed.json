Quote from: cafter on April 03, 2023, 08:33:00 AMI am thinking to invest in bitcoin for 6month or a year, is it good price to invest ? i will make profit from this point?Make it more than a year and you'll see greater price than the current because of the halving that will come next year. At this point, asking whether you'll get profit or not. Both are possible, to profit and to not and it all depends on how you foresee bitcoin. You can trade marginally and that's anytime you can profit there but greater risk.Quote from: cafter on April 03, 2023, 08:33:00 AMor is it possible for price to go low then this?Yes.Quote from: cafter on April 03, 2023, 08:33:00 AMand i DCA or just invest all at once and why?Either of the two, both of them are good strategies and it all depends how you like doing it. Majority will suggest you to just DCA but if you've got huge amount of money now and you want to invest around a year or two then just buy the whole thing and wait until those years has passed. If you don't need that money then just use it if you're decided to do it all at once.Quote from: cafter on April 03, 2023, 08:33:00 AMand please suggest some potential altcoins which have possibility to outperform this bull market please share your personnel though don't just share  some random shitcoinsand what is your experience in past halving ?is it beginning of bull market?Yes, based on the experience that we've been in. Every halving is like an indicator of the start of the bull run. But who knows if some cycles might be change for better or for worse but most likely, it's for the bull run.",

The market is unpredictable, and if you can't take the risk, don't invest. I would also add that asking a whole bunch of basic questions about investing in crypto on an internet forum is probably the worst way to approach getting started--especially the one about recommendations for altcoins.  As soon as you ask that here, usually people chime in with whatever crap they're holding, and any advice is going to be confusing at best.The only thing I can say about whether it's too late to buy into bitcoin, i.e., whether OP missed the bottom, is that nobody ever knows where the bottom is except in hindsight.  And even then it's very much possible that bitcoin could drop again and hit another low point.  Trying to time the market is an exercise in futility IMO.  If I were you, OP, I'd just stick with the DCA plan or buy some btc whenever you've got some spare cash.  It's a sanity saving option, because you'll drive yourself nuts if you keep thinking of all the profits you've missed.",

If you're asking these questions now, I suspect you were planning to wait for the bottom and make one trade, but you know it's like a lottery because no one can know where the bottom will be.I think that DCA is the best strategy because as it allows you to avoid unnecessary search for the bottom, you can start buying at any time convenient for you, of course, except for the time when we are approaching values close to ATH, it will be a lost best time to buy.Now no one will tell you whether the bull run has begun, or we will continue to fall, this is too complicated a question. There are many analysts who make predictions, but they are just predictions. The same goes for altcoins, if you are not confident in the project, then you definitely should not invest in any of the altcoins on someone's advice. Pay better attention to bitcoin, because in terms of risk, it will be the safest investment in the cryptocurrency market.",

For me, you are just a long-term trader and not an investor. Investors in the crypto industry must be willing to wait for more years because the bearish run can last for more than a year. If your investment plan is within one year, you might be forced to sell your coin lower than the price you bought. The price of bitcoin is unpredictable so nobody can claim to be a master of the market to predict accurately if the price will go up or down. That's why it will be better to invest what you can afford to lose.I have not had an interest in buying any other coin apart from bitcoin because some of them are not always what they claim to be. Bitcoin has been consistent and dependable for a long time and it my suits my investment plans.",

I think no, it's a big no. You never know what's happening next. Forecasting cryptocurrency or other commodity prices through the help of technical analysis is the worst idea. You need to check out the overall economy, in which direction it's going on, and how that direction may impact Bitcoin price. A few days ago, we have seen Federal Reserve add more than $300 billion in circulation, which alone pumped the price. You never know what major economic event going to happen next.I would recommend you follow the DCA method to minimize the risk as it has been a proven profitable investment mechanism over the last decade in crypto.",

But to me, it seems that if one looks at the price chart over the last year and at the total price chart, it looks like Bitcoin was in a pit for a while (from June till now, so it's been almost a year) and is now getting out of it. There will probably be ups and downs along the way, but it's hard to tell whether it will get back to $20k again. IMO waiting for a lower price might pay off but is also a greedy move, considering that Bitcoin is still 60% down from its ATH point at its current price. My point is, the price is still good, and maybe it will get lower, but there's a chance that it won't. Of course, everyone should make financial decisions based on personal judgements and research, though. If I wasn't sure I wanted to buy Bitcoin at a certain price rate, I wouldn't buy it.",

By shortly, I mean months, not days or hours. At the end of the day though, asking random strangers on the internet for trading advice is not always a good idea.

Now you have lots of questions TBH, but I'll try to answer it (take note that I'm not an expert, but just an Average user here trying to share his opinions ).Is it a good price to invest? Yes I think if you will hold it for 6 months to 1 year.You can make a profit? I guess so. I mean we don't have any crystal ball to say it accurately because even though we've seen a trend reversal on the price movement of Bitcoin, we might see it go down anytime.Quote from: cafter on April 03, 2023, 08:33:00 AMand i DCA or just invest all at once and why?I'd still prefer Dollar-Cost Average than going at once.What if you don't have enough money left, and all of the sudden the price of Bitcoin went down. What will you do? I already tried that days before WHO announced the pandemic last March 2020. We know what happened to Bitcoin at that time. It went from $8k to $4k in just a matter of days.
