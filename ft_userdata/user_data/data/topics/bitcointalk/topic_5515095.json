It is one of those ways of \"democracy\" that gives you the illusion that you have the right to vote, while at the same time that vote means absolutely nothing. However, when viewed individually, the largest shareholders are companies such as Vanguard Group and Blackrock, which together own about 16% of the shares.Maybe these companies will have a strong voice in the decision, and maybe even small shareholders will realize that Bitcoin can bring them profit. Should the decision be positive, it would definitely affect the price of BTC, because people would take it as a really big deal.",

Small share holders can raise their voices through votes that mean nothing to decide the company decision to invest in Bitcoin.If Microsoft or any Big Tech invests money in Bitcoin, it will be great news for Bitcoin community as it shows Bitcoin adoption again shifts upward more considerably. Nevertheless, they will consider it as a risky investment and will assign very small part of company treasury for this investment. I don't expect many companies from Big Tech will copy MicroStrategy to use company treasury for Bitcoin investment, raise fund for investment, and borrow money for investment in Bitcoin.If small shareholders are not happy with this vote result, they can sell their shares and use money to invest in Bitcoin individually.",

In bitcoin investment every positive decision one takes will benefit the person directly more than it will benefit others. Likewise every bad decision taken will affect you more as well. If MS decides to invest in bitcoin better for them, if they don't their loss. If they embrace bitcoin they will profit from it. If they don't they will watch other keep profiting from it.

That's because they worry too much about its nature of volatility which could be considered as a threat to their operational liquidity. So it's not surprising that the Microsoft boards are even convincing the shareholders to vote against bitcoin, which we can't guarantee also that all the shareholders will follow. Just like Michael Saylor from MicroStrategy, bitcoin is an asset that could hedge inflation, and I think that some of the Microsoft shareholders will definitely agree on it and see bitcoin as a worthy investment. So there's still chances for bitcoin to win in the voting soon.",

Without involvement of these big players bitcoin remains little more than play money or Monopoly money, a fringe asset.For bitcoin to be more useful and widely accepted the big players will have to get involved. And their involvement is inevitable, for better or worse. Bitcoin was made to be used by literally anyone, and that includes the corporates and institutions.  That is the reality.On the bright side, it seems to me at least when bitcoin becomes adopted by these major players then governments are probably much less likely to try to ban it or cripple it, or tax it out of existence.
