      "body": "getting rid of all utility of coal and oil is not a thing of realityits the reduction of the emissions of burning that stuff that they are tryingif they can stop importing Xmegatonne. and instead use domestic xmegatonneits not \"adding\" to the emissions and technically less transport via less imports can be less emissions. but even in 2100 people will still be using plastic products(oil still used)and coal is also used as an ingredient of the steal industryso forget any aspect of thinking its a 0% USE of fossil. and more like a net zero emissions from fossilyes there is a depleting finite supply of coal and oil. so yes they need to reduce waste and burning of it. and instead use the reserves purely for manufacturing and recycling otherwise there wont be any ingredients for consumer products in 100 years",

Government always prioritizes those policies and plans under its control, whereas any government or person cannot control bitcoin. Although on the other hand, the approval of the new coal mine is alarming as it violates its campaign against fossil fuels; I think the country's people should take up this matter.",

One has to be more careful when judging the reasons behind this type of decisions as sometimes there is more than meets they eye.",

The thing is, Europe also sanctioned itself in the process.Every country has pain and problems in some ways. Russia has expanded and grown into other parts of the world because of the sanctions. Sure, it was troublesome for them to do this in some ways. But the overall effect is that they are growing and expanding rather than declining. And when Europe finally has exhausted their supplies, they will go back to Russia.On the other hand, look at the problems Europe is having due to the sanctions. And inflation in the US threatens the very banking system that pushed the sanctions into place.",
