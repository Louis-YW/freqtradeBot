I don't know if that's exactly their business and how it goes. But this is another reminder to all of those investors that are thinking it's safe to put all of your assets into websites like this and the same with the exchanges. You'll never know what's happening behind their curtains.",

You can still get rekt if other whales manipulate the trend into opposite direction to your position. Until now, I never stop believing that sometimes Exchange is involved on market manipulation by shaking stop losses of whales position since they are the only one who has access on the stop losses price of whales position while they have sufficient liquidity to manipulate the market since they are not completely regulated.",

What could have gone wrong? I mean these people know exactly how to handle their money and yet, they fell to some kind of sales talk from the LUNC. Since they didn't really have some kind of plan when their market has fallen the first time, they shouldn't be trusted the second time because they don't really deserve it.",

So this possibility is also can, I wonder how the company can handle that kind of losses. I agree with you that when Luna started falling badly, the investment of many people sank, but there were very few who made a lot of money with future trading by opening short positions with high leverage. However, after the launch of LUNC. People did not trust it as much as before due to increasing in its supply and declining market cap, everyone thought that a short position should be opened on it so that it could make more profit or reduce its loss. Now here is a common-sense thing if everyone will make a profit then how will the market run But people, as usual, fell back into the whales' trap.",

Bots are not a sure fire to give you profits, and as much as you claim that it is very intelligent enough to predict and forecast the market? Still going to fail because of so many factors.2. Don't put your asset into one basket. If you have done this with Luna, obviously, by now you have lost your crypto investment.3. Just trust yourself, no need to used those so called services, because again, it's not a guarantee.",

I were scalping this token but since the chart didn't look healthy and i retire from trading this token. Once you think this coin will be going to short but it can be manipulated to be long. The market is unpredictable but i do believe if they have agreed with what happened with them. So that's their fault. I would not be surprised if there was also another company who has been facing the same problem,",

Shorting at bottom after panic ends is terrible as short squeeze will liquidate your position.For Luna Classic, I believe it will recover in future, slowly but it will and I am sure many people who short it will be liquidated.After relisted on Binance with BUSD, later it has another pair with USDT and later with leverage for trading. It is not coincidence to see its leverage trading back. It is for short liquidations. I hold Luna Classic and I believe in its slow recovery. In addition, I hope people will not be killed if they short Luna Classic.",

People did a huge leverage for shorting, but there were times when it did small upticks. It means that even though it went lower, the short positions were liquidated. I remember many times when it was under 1 dollar, getting to few cents and even lower, and it did like 1 cent higher price and liquidated all shorts and then kept going down even more.This caused not many people to make money like you assume. Sure those people made money with some of their bets, but they lost money on some of their trades as well. Hence, it wasn't a clear money making method, it was a bit of a risky move.",

I mean if you are looking for shorting, and you do that with big numbers, based entirely on the trajectory of something then you should be ready with a big stop loss when things go wrong. I personally believe that LUNC will crash for sure, there is no denying that but at the same time I wouldn't short it because with some good market movements upside, there could be a small time recovery.Just because it will crash to zero and not have any value, doesn't mean that it can't have some upsides here and there while going down neither. If you short right when it starts to go up, then you will lose all the money you invested, especially if you do not have a stop loss.",

I wonder why are you still analyzing this failed project, are you still planning to do short or you are trap on this project? Well, the volatility is very high and its risk, better to stay away from this project and go be active on a good one where you can have a good profit.",
