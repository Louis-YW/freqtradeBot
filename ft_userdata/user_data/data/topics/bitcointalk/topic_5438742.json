  "content": "Hello everyone I recently came across an old hdd that was having a few bitcoin in it from 2011. The issue is that the hard drive have been partially re-written with a new windows and other datas. I already carefully make a copy of the hard drive to .img file. I already tried the \"classical\" way of recover the file (recuva, R-studio) ... and they didn't find the wallet.dat (they find other .dat but some from windows). Even if i know that the chances are low that my wallet or at least the private key is still on this hdd i would like to be 100% there is nothing left. After having search i have seen that we can use pywallet --recov mode to do that and also an hex editor to search for the string but there is a few issue : -When I launch pywallet --recov he ask me for the passphrase of the wallet but i'm totally unsure about the passphrase, would it affect the recovery if I put a wrong passphrase ? -When i go for the search using an Hexeditor and searching for the sequences (as described there https://bitcointalk.org/index.phptopic=1983382.msg19785384#msg19785384) the hexEditor crashes probably because the .img file is around 300 Go any way to avoid that ? -Is there any other way to recover that i didn't thought of ? Thank you all in advance and have a great day.",
