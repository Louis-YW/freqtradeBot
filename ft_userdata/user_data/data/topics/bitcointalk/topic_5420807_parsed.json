      "body": "That's how gambling works. Your hard earned money from work, business or whatever the source is, majority of it will go to gambling if you are a gambler lol. Don't expect a dream of making thousands on gambling, autopilot doesn't mean always win, it's a dream of every gambler until they experience worst.Drake is a millionaire or even billionaire already earned from his work and business. Gambling is just a mere hobby and past time of him. Lossing millions is nothing to him, winning is a bonus.",

If this is your aim in working hard, all your effort and hard work will be for nothing if you just want to be a high roller someday, sipping champagne, sitting in VIP spots, and fucking hookers. It's good that you have the motivation to make your dream work, however, what you dream of right now might ruin your life in the future. Focus on what you have to do, and achieve your dream, and along your way you might find even more valuable dreams. I am rooting for you, and hope you can achieve what you aim for.

Overindulging in luxuries, especially from money earned in gambling can be quite bad imo since it isn't a \"constant\" source of profit but rather an \"immediate\" one. Drake himself has the money because of all the influence he has built up over the course of his career. It wasn't an \"immediate\" type of thing, it was a gradual one. We may see big amounts of sponsorships or amounts of money spent by him as irregular cause of of the amount (huge ones), but that's the price of his entire career and not an \"that moment only\" type.",
