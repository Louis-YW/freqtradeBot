And so it means it will be a go on September 19, to the mainnet as this is their target.So hopefully there wil be no hitch or something big that is going to break on September 19 roll out.This will be huge for Ethereum history as well, others noted that this is the biggest and most significance upgrade in any of the blockchain's history.",

Very happy to hear that the Ethereum merge is getting closer, yes and they are said to be doing it in september, of course this is great news for holders and the ethereum ecosystem is getting bigger, and we will see a lot of altcoin projects will be built again on Ethereum, just like in 2017 , because Gas will be very cheap!",

But that‚Äôs fine, because we are used to them postponing the date all the time, there isn't anything wrong with the current situation and we should be pretty pleased about it as well. I personally believe that the best thing to do right now would be making sure that ethereum doesn't fall if it doesn't happen on the right time, it could be another time.Let‚Äôs say they made it on 1st of December, but when the day came they said instead first of new year (January 1st) then our job is to make sure that it doesn't drop in price because of it, if we can arrange that then the rest will be handled.",

But no worries, you can still recover back. Just tell your sister to hold on that ETH and again see how the merger will affect the price because we are seeing it as having a positive impact in short term. And I guess there are also a lot of ETH holders anticipating this big event.",

All of GPU owned by miners will be moved to the ETC. We have some alternative POW coins that can be mined right now. You must not forget about that. ETC becomes the most potential candidate for the next migration from miners as ethereum will be moving to the POS. I know that miners were making GPU price become quite expensive.",

I doubt that even though staking feature on blockchain will be available because the amount of APY will determine if investors will purchase or not because Ethereum staking is already available on centralized exchange with low APY and if the blockchain staking will offer similar APY to the CEX then I doubt this will be a game changer for ETH. The reason why people is hype on this is because of the news and not the improvement. This a common pattern on crypto that the price keeps pumping when the mainnet is near to release then dump after. There‚Äôs already an ETH pump due to this merger news but the gains is already erased after whales take profit and leave retail traders that FOMO buy behind.I hate to break the party but don‚Äôt expect much on this merger or mainnet.",

Validators didn't need any mining operations anymore caused by it can be done through staking ethereum to validating any transaction. It has implemented with beacon chain. I think that you must understand that this is the thing that makes so many people feeling worried about that.
