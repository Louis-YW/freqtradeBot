Unfortunately, the government seems does not even care at all or if they care, they will just approve a little increase for minimum wages after a long wait but they can't control those goods and services from surging its prices.What we always ask from the government is to provide us long term jobs, not contractual ones. And most especially for those poor and illiterate ones, at least they should be given source of livelihood that will still provide them with decent amount of income.",

It's out of their control. I can see that these businessmen are greedy, I mean we all do, but in business making money is taking so much away from the buyers, consumers, and resellers. Not every businessmen have the Chinese mindset, they demand more cost when the product or services gives comfort or make you life easy.

Tell me, how do you see the implementation of state regulation of prices for rent, energy, and food?There are 2 options:1. Prohibition to raise prices higher than...2. CompensateI’ll answer right away how these moves end:1. The quality and quantity of offers of goods and services is falling. Why should I sell my products without covering my costs and without making a profit, if this is a business whose main goal is to make a profit.2. Where will the state get funding for compensation? And the budget! From the budget that provides social programs for the population. That is, to the detriment of the populationIn a word - government regulation is not the best option. This approach is applicable for critical situations in the country and economy, and only for critical products, but not for regular and widespread use.",

If there is an increase in the price of basic necessities, the government will usually stabilize prices by increasing supply by importing from other countries.Salaries in the countries you mentioned are very high but I'm sure the necessities of life in these countries are also expensive. In my country, the minimum wage a month is only $80 - $250, although it seems small but we can live on just $50 a month.

You have to let the market breath by itself sometimes, instead of killing it suffocated by prohibitive regulations which may make sense on your theory, but that in practice will be totally harmful to common citizens and merchants.If the prices are constantly rising out of control, it's exactly due to government's intervention, but in a wrong manner. So, you are asking for more government control as a potential solution, but you don't consider the more control government has, worse the economy of a country is getting.Countries where there is more economical freedom are more likely to thrive along the time. However, it shouldn't be misunderstood with anarchy or corruption practices...

It sounds like a simple cure when the government sets price caps on things like food, energy, and rent. But economics isn't really that simple. Price controls can lead to shortages; remember, businesses need to cover costs & make a profit. If they can't, why would they stay in business? We could find ourselves in a situation where there are few apartments and empty shelvesRegarding wages, we all desire to have more cash in our pockets. But what happens if costs are artificially kept down while incomes soar? Businesses may cut jobs or reduce hours to stay afloat. Although the goal is admirable, the execution is challenging. We require a well-rounded strategy, which might include raising the minimum wage, providing tax breaks for affordable housing, and providing targeted subsidies for necessities. The role of the government is vital, but it goes beyond simply officiating; it also involves creating a long-term strategy that will allow businesses and consumers to prosper",

This would likely push inflation higher again and many smaller business would struggle to even pay such kind of wages. In my opinion over regulation from the government in the labour market is not a good idea as it will limit business and reduce employment in the long term. The same goes for the regulating the whole economy, like rent, energy and food prices. Why would the government be able to set better prices than an open economcy that is based on supply and demand? A landlord that wants to rent out his aparment for a certain price, might think twice about doing any refurbishment or investment in the property if he can't get his desired rent income. Also there is no guarantee that the prices set by the government will actually be enforced. In high demand housing cities where there are almost no flats available, the tenants could try to pay a higher rent in cash than actually allowed, just to be able to live closer in the city center.",

So that the needs of the community and the money generated can remain in balance. However, the impact of an incident, conflict, natural disaster, pandemic are things that were not in their plans. Therefore, it always has a big impact on a country's economy. Inflation continues to rise and many other things are now starting to get out of control in several developing countries. But in developed countries I think they are still quite good at controlling the rate of inflation so that it doesn't rise any higher.However, it is the government's job to balance people's income with the rate of inflation so that people can still meet their daily needs and there is no recession. But there are governments that make efforts to avoid recession by printing more money. It's just that this could trigger inflation in the future. Well, this is a bit of a dilemma. Because I feel that the current government is also having difficulty dealing with the current economic crisis. They are trying to ease the ongoing economic crisis.
