I remember I piled up some and just lock them away, my expectation on this coin isn't big though, I was just learning then. Since binance delisted it in late 2018, it was pretty much over for this coin. With numerous controversies regarding unfair pre-mining, and the the developers going silent late 2019, the trading volume pretty much died as old investors left and new ones never really cared. In this type of rapidly evolving market, there is no mercy for the slow ones.. If you are investing, please stay updated about your investments by reading news/articles about them atleast once a month, dont let your money decay for nothing!Not every coin is Bitcoin",

Your investment is gone forever.True, and we all know that some reasons why coins are delisted are either (a) no volume at all - meaning traders are no longer interested on it for some reasons, (b) there are no development was so ever in the background, it could be the dev have abandoned the project itself, (c) it's a shitcoin and meme coin that failed the test of time.I guess everyone here has lost some coins in our wallet just like you, so treat it as a learning experience from you and others who might be reading it.And it's really hard to see which altcoin we should invest or hold for a long time, maybe just a few like ETH or BNB or ADA.",

Cheapest token doesn’t mean its a good one and because of many issues before, probably the developer slowly leaving the project and left it behind. A token that can’t compete against new projects usually ended up like this. If there’s no good update and progress, you can’t expect this token to stay longer, this is also a reminder not to hold too much small token, better to buy a project that has a solid development and good fundamentally.",

I remember I piled up some and just lock them away, my expectation on this coin isn't big though, I was just learning then. I still remember that Bytecoin was a very active project back in 2017 when i made my first steps into the crypto market. I do not own any Bytcoin myself and i never did, therefore i also did not really follow the development of that project that closely. It seems thought that it took the direction that a lot of the old projects are taking in the last 2 years or so. They slowly but surely lose relevance and after a certain time they die out almost completely. At the moment Bytecoin has a trading volume of less than 5000 $ which is nothing.So this proves again that you should never invest into cryptos and then just walk away for a few years because the crypto market is just to fast for that.",

They are dead already so better to move one because there’s a lot of reason why a token disappear after making a good hype at first, the best thing to do is to move on and learn from this experience. Lucky for LTC and Doge for being able here and stay with the competition, but then again if they remain stagnant and no more updates, for sure they will face problem as well and worst investors will leave them.",

People have been starting to realize that if they didn't need bunch if privacy coins. Bytecoin was one of privacy coin that has been exist in the market since long time ago and it's now abandoned caused by started from a few years ago people have been massively eyeing for the utilities from the token rather than privacy. They can use monero and that solve all of their problems. Why did we need lots of privacy coins if there have been some that capable enough to cover all of users? Bytecoin is nothing rather than an abandoned coin with no volume. The trend for utility on token has been eating so many privacy coins just like veil which was also popular enough a few years ago. The mindset of people change with the goes of time.",

Im not aware about Bytecoin but i have heard about this coin.In speaking about potential then there's no way that we could really say or tell about its potential because its neither up depending on the communitydemand in speaking of its value and also if there's community or investors who would really be supporting it then it would really be able to sustain out on longer runs.Doesnt matter if this one is an old coin in together with LTC and Doge which it cant really assure that it would really be crawling on the same path with its co-old coins.Everything will really be depending or basing up on community demands and recognition.",

Maybe that issue is the root cause for the collapse of this coin because you know, there are some people who don't like coins which has a premine on them because they think it will be easy for the team to manipulate it.I think eth do also have this issue if I recall but why did eth survive and became stronger? Oh well, I guess it's because it was the main altcoin and eth have some special use cases compared to those other coins which have a premine. Using this coin for gambling isn't a bad idea because you still have a good time playing with it and there is no need to regret because this coin didn't really became a success compared to it's batch mates namely dogecoin and monero.",
