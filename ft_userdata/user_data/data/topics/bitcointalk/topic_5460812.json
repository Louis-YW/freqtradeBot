Your username suggests youâ€™re a crypto trader and to be honest this community isnâ€™t fond of so called crypto experts luring newbies to make investments. It is too early to tag you a scammer, we will just have to wait and see your true intentions. Btw I think you should move this thread to games and rounds.",
