What advice is worth passing out to people who have lost their Bitcoin more than once and are on the hedge of giving up? I don't know how it feels to be hacked since I haven't actually experienced it before. but I did lose some money to scammers once. These situations aren't something we plan for or want. Sometimes, when we're too cautious, we can still fall for scams because we overlook ways to stay safe. If you've been hacked once, it can teach you how to protect your assets better. Don't give up on buying Bitcoin just because you had one bad experience. If it happens again, it means you need to be more careful. Keep trying, learn from your experiences, and find new ways to stay secure. Getting hacked is not good, but don't abandon your Bitcoin dreams just because you faced setbacks.",

Although bitcoin being hacked is largely the investor's fault as well as the guy in your story. I think he also knows that the reason he lost bitcoin many times was his fault, not bitcoin's fault. I would support him in giving up investing in bitcoin, simply because bitcoin is not right for him no matter how hard he tries. I will respect their decision rather than continue to give them advice because if they continue to get hacked then we are not responsible for them. They are insiders, they understand everything better than outsiders like us.",

Having a hardware wallet or offline wallet is far from hacking unless they made a mistake like I said they should avoid accessing phishing sites or any sites with full of popup ads.",

If we value Bitcoin a lot, even if we made a mistake the first time it was hacked, of course the next time we won't let it happen again. Now, how are we going to do this? Of course, we will find out what we should do to prevent our bitcoin from being hacked, and one good example for this matter is that we must save our private key or seed in a secure place. We will be more careful, and we will not repeat what we did when the bitcoin we had before was hacked. We must learn from our mistakes and take them as a lesson.",

Getting hacked is much easier nowadays if you are just an average Joe. If you visit a random website and click on random links that you never know if it contains trojan, getting hacked is easier for you. Sometimes, common sense helps as well. You have to use your brain to understand what are you trying to do and why are you doing it. People get hacked in multiple ways. Phishing is one of them, and I consider people the dumbest people who fall for phishing. Hackers offer some extra features or bonuses to use some specific wallet or software. People download them without verifying them and then they lose their money. If you like to hold your Bitcoins, why use a regular device to store it? Get an hardware wallet and never fall for phishing. Do not store your seed phrase online and you are good to go.",

It's not Bitcoin like ETH or any other altcoins since I am trying other things to invest like in the NFT, I've noticed I have an NFT which what we called \"airdrop\" and I thought it was free and I carelessly clicked it which caused to my funds get drained. So from that experienced, which I applied to my wallets that have Bitcoin. My tips is to never leave important information in your computer for the hackers to get accessed from it, they might explore it but they couldn't get anything from it since they don't have the key. Plus don't just connect to a free WIFI cause there's a case in the PH, where it contains virus.",

However, just the idea of losing hard-earned money that you are hoping to invest and make a profit from surely is a terrible circumstance that no one wants to be in. If I am put in such a situation and I know that Bitcoin investment will still give me a good channel to earn profit then I'd probably still buy Bitcoins, but I also need to ensure that I have learned from what had happened and secure my wallet more. For example, if I know that my wallet security isn't the best then I'll do proper research on how to secure it better, I will also ensure that I am not downloading anything that is giving me access to hackers to get my money. Essentially, the only advice to give from people who have experienced such a thing is to learn from their mistakes and do something about it.",

I lost my private key and pass phrase and that was the main reason for losing up my Bitcoin. After that loss I learned about Bitcoin deeply and now that I'm into it with 100% then there is no chance of giving up on it.Quote from: KiaKia on September 11, 2023, 11:44:38 AMCan you keep buying bitcoin if you have already get hacked like twice or more in the past? I will surely keep buying Bitcoin even if I get hacked twice or thrice due to my own carelessness, but I'm sure that I won't lose my Bitcoin because I will keep them in a cold wallet and that one will never be connected to internet for decades. Quote from: KiaKia on September 11, 2023, 11:44:38 AMLike a story about an American who lost his love for Bitcoin because of the hacks, I believe it's because of his own carelessness though, because you can't leave your wallet on a bench outside your home and not expect someone to steal it, and you come out and say your wallet was stolen by a thief, like what do expect? I don't really know much about that American who lost his love for Bitcoin because of his own carelessness. But, yes anyone who isn't aware of the security measures will always be hacked by malicious people. If someone leaves his/her wallet outside of his/her home then surely the thieves will steal that wallet with ease. It's always better to be careful when handling your Bitcoin because sometimes we don't give proper time to learning and invest into an asset only to earn profits. Quote from: KiaKia on September 11, 2023, 11:44:38 AMWhat advice is worth passing out to people who have lost their Bitcoin more than once and are on the hedge of giving up? The only advice that is worth passing out to those people who have lost their Bitcoin for many times is to learn about Bitcoin and its security. Learn about wallets in depth and never ever trust anyone else when it comes to your private keys and passphrases. Also never share your wallet address or details with others just for the sake of fame because sometimes you don't know who is your well wisher and who is your enemy.",

It definitely depends on the person, before ditching an advice on how one should safeguard there coins if they lost it you probably need to ask them how they first of all lost it, because some advice seems like you’re just wasting your precious time.Imagine someone losing funds repeatedly on non-custodian wallets or exchange simply because they can’t be there own back and trust others with there funds than keeping it themselves and when the keys were compromised they blame it on bitcoin and even if you tell them why it is bad they do that they tell they can hide the keys or seeds by them selves then you can’t simply help this kind of people. Another set of people who in my perspective can be taught how to safeguard there funds could be total newbies that probably lost it to hacks due to connecting there wallets online while participating in airdrops or ones that stores their coin on devices that are not airgapped. This set of individuals can be educated on how to protect their keys and why they need to stop connecting their wallets to online sites. Another set of people could be people that actually entice criminals or hackers towards themselves by flaunting their cryptocurrency assets online. This set of people could easily be targeted and could get their wallets hacked, so the advice to them is to remain anonymous as hard as possible. Lastly to everyone be wary of the kind of keyboard you use because one of the ways to get one’s wallet hacked which people don’t pay much attention to is through clipboard malware",

The funny thing is, I moved towards Bitcoin after getting hacked. I got hacked for $350+ in an altcoin staking platform. There were other incidents like wallet hacking too but the amount wasn't that big. So those are not important to me. But the thing that I was talking about. I moved towards Bitcoin after that hacking event. I read some posts on this forum regarding how to keep your assets safe and make good use of them. Now I can proudly say that I have never been hacked after that. So you are the one who keeps your privacy and assets safe. If you use the right tools and follow the strategy on how to keep your assets safe, you will never get hacked the way you got hacked before. But there will still be some probability. You can minimize those risks too. And to answer your question, invest what you can afford to lose. If those people have done just that, then sure, they will be able to invest again. Because losing those amounts shouldn't hurt their daily life right? They can just do it again. So yeah, they could, I could, and everyone who follows this strategy.",
