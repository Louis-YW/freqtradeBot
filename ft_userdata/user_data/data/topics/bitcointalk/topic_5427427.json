  "content": "\"Bitcoin is Islamic \"-Says Economist Bruce FentonHe recently said these things in a video message.  He also said that Bitcoin is starting to gain acceptance in the Middle East/Gulf region, not just adoption. He claims to see 9-digit BTC investments from the Middle East/Gulf region this year.He added that the growing skepticism surrounding fiat in the Gulf region is showing interest in investing in BTC and the number of investors is increasing day by day.  He mentioned several Islamic countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia as Bitcoin investment regions.Source:https://cryptonews.net/17381325/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=shared",

Did he talk with the King of Saudi Arabia or the Emir of Qatar?What's the point for some of the richest countries in the world to adopt Bitcoin/crypto? These countries aren't undeveloped and poor like El Salvador or the Central African Republic. They can have as many USD/Euro/British pounds as they want, because they have oil.This seems like another mindless bullish speculation, which isn't backed by any facts and logic. It's just wishful thinking and fantasies.",

If you give someone a loan using Bitcoin and you ask for interest, then you have committed riba according to Islamic laws. But if someone gives an interest-free loan in fiat, this is not against Islamic laws. There are some allegations that the Middle East is gradually becoming a cryptocurrency because many highly profiled citizens are under sanctions because of their connections to human rights violations or terrorist financing. Hence, to invade these sanctions, they are opening their economy to crypto. There are also speculations that the close relationship between Russia and some middle east nations is not just for political reasons but economical ones. It is assumed that cryptocurrency is one of the tools sanctioned Russians are using to dodge this punishment. And since Russia has been disconnected from SWIFT, Gulf nations are now middlemen or intermediaries for these cryptocurrency transactions.",

It's not the money that is prohibited, it's the way you use the money and how you have earned it. Islamic nations invest just like everyone else and they use fiat like all other people. What is not acceptable is to profit from interest. If you borrow 1 BTC from a Muslim who respects those principles, he isn't allowed to request that you pay him back 1.1 BTC. You give back what you borrowed with no interest. Quote from: Findingnemo on December 09, 2022, 08:41:31 AMWhile who really cares about religion when it comes to money, when you made billions you will be accepted no matter what religion you belong so as a commoner we need to realise the religions are created by us to progress humans not to keep them under control. Since when are religions guided by progress, development, freedom, or even peace? You do what you are told and what is written in the holy books with no complaints. Independent minds are neither desirable nor welcome in religious circles. They undermine their positions of power and control.  Ricky Gervais made a good tweet about religion a long time ago. He said: QuoteI see Atheists are fighting and killing each other again, over who doesn't believe in any God the most. Oh, no..wait.. that never happens.\"https://twitter.com/rickygervais/status/247246481185202177?lang=en",

I am happy that Muslims can use Bitcoin and that it doesn't go against their laws, but people of other faiths and atheists can use it just as well. In my personal view, trading Bitcoin is simply the buying and selling of a digital asset, which almost everyone in the world does. The difference is that people buy and hold Bitcoin while they wait for the price to increase by two or even three or four times the purchase price, which is just as normal as the profit or gain we experience when buying and selling other goods. Bitcoin is authorized and lawful.",

But they also said, when you can't fight back and have no choice but to use it, then the law becomes permissible.I don't know Islam very well....As far as I know, in the tradition of Islam it is forbidden to lend money.  From this point of view, it is likely that some of the popular financial instruments in the DeFi ecosystem do not follow the Islamic tradition.  However, Bitcoin is a deflationary virtual currency that does not contain algorithms built into the code that allow you to lend coins at interest.  From this point of view, Bitcoin can probably be approved by representatives of traditional Islam.  Large-scale investments in Bitcoin by oil sheiks can greatly increase the price of the first cryptocurrency.",

As such, specialized codes of banking have developed to cater to investors wishing to obey Qur'anic law. (See Islamic banking)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#IslamThe religion of islam contains teachings against usury. Which invokes trends against high interest rate banking, payment and merchant services.

Christianity also contains similar teachings although it could be fair to say most christians are unaware of them.",

The edge bitcoin has over banking sectors is its ability to be controlled by the owner whereas in banking some actions are taken with the owners knowledge.

Citizens blind by idolatry just accept it as the only true.Bitcoin isn't islamic, protestant, catholic, buddhist, atheist, conservative or liberal.
