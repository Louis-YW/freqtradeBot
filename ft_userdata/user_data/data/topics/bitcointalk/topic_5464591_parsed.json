But you know why many have chosen the opposite path of just being an investor and chose not to maximize the potential just as what you're saying? It's because that it's easier to lose from doing that potential you're saying than to be a passive one which is effortless and easier regardless of the market situation. You're saving a lot of time and you don't have to be aggressive in the market which is what you're thinking to do. And in no way I am going to watch the channel you're plugging that tells what to do if you can just summarize the contents of it.Quote from: Thehallows on August 25, 2023, 08:17:03 PMAnd in addition I think its right time that everyone that's interested in bitcoin should also start learning about trading since it gives a good opportunity for anyone to earn off bitcoin.

Even experts experience loss all the times that why for me I will advice to hodl.  It's less stressful to know that my Bitcoin is safe in my  wallet, rather than constantly worrying about the market going up and down daily and hourly if you're trading. I'm not saying trading is bad, but it's important to understand the risks and be ready to deal with them.  As always HODL",

But always know that there’s also bigger chances to lose from trading because there’s bigger risk on it, particularly for beginner traders who are still in the process of gaining first hand experience in trading. Not everyone is capable enough to make trading works, that’s why a lot would chose to settle on long term hodling because it’s less risky plus the chances to make you profitable is still high depending on how much coins you are able to hold at a longer period of time.",

What do y'all think bout this ?We do have all the choice and its up to ours on which method and thing we are really that sticking into. There are ones who cant really be able to afford on dealing up with markets volatilityand there are ones who are really that courageous on dealing up with the movement and snipping out some profits on the time that it moves. This is why we could really be able to generate holders from those active/daytraders which it is really that totally opposite on what they are really that been doing.Its not bad to hold and its not bad to be an active trader since this would really be in accordance with your own preference since not all would really be that risk takers. This is why its up to you whether you would really be holding up or would be trading according into your risk appetite.So dont stress yourself on how people would really be dealing up and making use of their coins whether they would really be going with the flow of the market or would really be standing stilland hold for long term. For me then my bag is really composed of two allocations which one is for holding and one is for active trades because it is really that too boring if i would really be just sittingstill and doing nothing. hehe",

What do y'all think bout this ?An active trader can earn $20 to $30 profits from trading Bitcoin only if he/she has a huge capital to trade Bitcoin. The ones who have at least one whole Bitcoin could earn such level of profits on daily basis and sometimes they also have to face some losses because the Bitcoin can dump anytime without notification and such traders might have to hold their trades for many days in such cases. I don't think that the ones who trade Bitcoin on daily basis are the ones making profit out of it because those people can sometimes face huge dips and they may have to sell their coins for a lower price in order to continue their daily trading. There are some traders that might earn some good profits by trading Bitcoin when it gets a dip but those traders are the most knowledgeable ones.I think the ones who know the art of hodling are the ones who make most profits from Bitcoin because those people accumulate when Bitcoin faces a huge dip and wait for a higher price value or you can say that they wait for the next bull market to sell their holdings for huge profits. There are also those holders that won't sell their Bitcoin for decades and they're the real geniuses who will earn most profit from Bitcoin holdings.",

That's his opinion and mostly based on his experience. But with all of the people here being aware of how profitable long-term holding is, it's already justified by most of us because it did happen to us. Remove the pressure on yourself when you're trading and transition into holding which is not going to require you a lot of work. Just as you've said, you can just likely forget that you're holding and return to the market when the bull run is in and you'll be surprised at how much your portfolio has grown for being patient. Both trading and holding requires patience but I'll choose to be more patient in holding without the need to check the sentiment of the market.",

Wrong in analyzing and implementing strategies with the main goal of getting profit, it can happen the opposite of the profit you want to get, namely losing some funds.Doing day trading is just a matter of courage in taking a stand.

I am not sure this is such a common confidence for everyone. I agree with that in theory, because it is hard to argue that short price fluctuations give more room to provide trading operations. But, practically speaking, trading is definitely more risky than holding and most people loose their deposits in the long term, comparing to simple holding. Higher opportunities you are referring to are only possible if a trader is quite successful, which happens rarely. In contrast, while holding, generally people have more chances to gain eventually, or at least not to lose.",
