This places them in different asset categories, where they do not necessarily need to compete as rivals. The CBDC dollar is likely to be rolled out for user by demographics with a current bank account. While one of bitcoin's largest user demographics is known to be an unbanked demographic which could comprise of billions of end users worldwide. The lack of overlap in design, mission statement and user base could allow a CBDC dollar and BTC to exist independently of each other. They don't need to compete for the same markets or the userbase.Thus far we haven't seen much fanfare for CBDCs. If their biggest advantage is mass adoption in terms of them being backed by traditional financial institutions. There hasn't been much effort made to rollout a marketing campaign in an effort to leverage that current mass adoption. In a sense, CBDCs are flying a little under the radar in terms of most consumers probably not having heard of them.",

Therefore, governments seek to issue digital currencies against cryptocurrencies because they are completely opposite to being centralized and completely under government control.Governments, especially the government of the United States, want to maintain central control over the global monetary system and impose bans on all financial transactions that they do not wish to occur, whether to individuals, organizations, or even countries hostile to the United States.A centralized digital dollar would enable the United States to do all of these things quite easily.",

So i personally see no way a digital dollar created by the federal government will ever be a threat to bitcoin's existence.",

They should be afraid and they ARE afraid. Digital money is the future, of course it is, but with a complete migration to digital FIAT, Bitcoin will take the role of cash as we know it now. Digital FIAT means total control: you won't be anonymous anymore. Every transaction could be tracked/reversed/stopped etc. Everything will stay the same: inflation, banks in full control, debt, government supervising the process etc.. additionally, most currencies are digital already - that's just a number in your bank account, not real money backed by something.",

What do they mean by \"cyberbullying\"?Supporting the effectiveness of embargoes? What does that even mean? Perhaps the countries, that are currently being blocked by embargoes would just dump the US dollar entirely and pick another currency for their transactions.

Setting what is meant, you can still hold back when a decline occurs and wait for the recovery process to make a profit, another advantage of bitcoin is that it can retain value that fiat does not have.That's why bitcoin is growing until now, bitcoin is also a speculative asset that has the potential to go up or down, this will play a role in the supply and demand system.",

I think it's precisely with the launch of the digital dollar that the government saw something that needed to be modernized, and bitcoin has had that for a long time, even more than a decade. And also the digital dollar is likely to emulate the workings of what bitcoin has been introduced since it was first introduced.There is no reason why bitcoin should be afraid of being threatened by the existence of digital dollars, digital dollars should find a way so that they can exist in the midst of bitcoin's existence.",
