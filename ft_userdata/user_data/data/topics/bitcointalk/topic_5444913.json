Thanks for sharing it by the way.This John Ryder slightly got a height & reach advantage over the undisputed champ but I doubt that it will be enough to defeat Canelo that is still on his prime. There might be chances of upset though but that is just slim even if this challenger got a consecutive wins recently as those wins are also not that impressive. Anyway, we never know, Ryder will be fighting Canelo that came from a surgery, that might be a factor on this one, we'll see.",

Ryder lost by a UD while the latter won via UD, so that makes some clarification about the disparity of their strengths. And I would like to add that Canelo is still at the height of his career and prime, so I'm thinking that Ryder will just be a mere tune-up fight in Cinco de Mayo.",

And so for Canelo to fill that stadium in Mexico is already huge and yes, it will show his drawing power as he wanted to stage his fight in Mexico for many years. We don't know if we are going to believed him, but he says that he opted to fight in Mexico for lesser money and against Ryder.For Ryder, he has been in a 3-4 fight winning streak and has been rated and has held the WBO interim super middleweight title in which Canelo is the regular champion. So we can justify that he indeed deserved a crack at Canelo. But definitely a huge underdog in this fight.",

But when it comes down to the IQ level and strengths, especially the KO ratio? Canelo is just on another level and I seriously don't think that he will slack on this one as he still wanted Bivol's head next.",

His management wouldn't want to end the career of their fighter for letting him fight in a bad condition. And I agree, Ryder could be more eager with this fight as it will give him a spotlight for future opportunities. I would still be betting with canelo this time simply because knowing him in the ring, he wouldn't allow things to just slip. John ryder is a good fighter as well especially with his previous fight but the stats itself could determine the winner of the fight even if anything could possibly happen in the ring. It is just experience to do its own thing with this one. Canelo is having an good run and that could be a drive for him to not let go of this.",

      "body": "Quote from: Hydrogen on March 16, 2023, 02:15:00 AMIs anyone surprised Canelo is still only 32 years old? For some reason I thought he was older, having had so many big high profile fights over so many years.It is interesting that Canelo vs Ryder is slated for mexico rather than las vegas, which has long been billed as the \"fight capital of the world\".Will this become a trend where many professional athletes will try to hold events outside of the united states, for whatever reason.Well, not really. It's just that we feel he's old enough because we keep on hearing his name and certainly that is also connected to a big fights in the past years and then that three fights against GGG really gave us an impression that their age is not that far but in reality, GGG was just way ahead compared Canelo. That said, Canelo still have at least 5-7 years of his prime to reign as a champion and be viewed as a dangerous boxer in the industry. So, I guess that also means that we will still see some more fights of Canelo in the coming years considering that there's many boxer that is calling him and that will grow in numbers as he gets older.",

I'm just glad that this fight is now a done deal because people are waiting for Canelo's return as he have a lot of boxer now queued to fight him afterwards, Canelo may put his belt on the line on this one but let's not forget that this is just a tune-up fight.Yeah, hehehe, we have been discussing his name on the other thread, it's just this makes it's official now that Canelo will have a 'tune-up' fight against Ryder. He needs to put his belt on the line here, and it's going to be a homecoming fight for Canelo in Mexico. For sure, the fans are still going to buy the tickets even if he is facing lesser known opposition.Good payday for Ryder though, for the face-off, here is the video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw9y1vI6zuIFighting on \"Cinco De Mayo\" has been a tradition now for Canelo Alvarez and with him coming from hand surgery (which i'm not aware of), i think this is just the way to go, a tune-up fight for him in front of his hometown fans. I'm not expecting an upset here since we all know that Canelo is very serious in his training camp whoever it is that he will be facing.I just hope that after this one, he will pursue his rematch with Bivol or a fight with Benavidez hehe.He is the new Oscar, as I have remembered the Dela Hoya used to own this dates because of his Mexican Heritage.But I can't remember if Oscar did fight in Mexico though, so this could be the difference and we are going to see how big Canelo is in his native country. I don't know how big Akron Stadium is, but for sure Canelo can fill that up.As for Ryder, well, we will see if he deserves this spot or just another tune up for Alvarez.Akron Stadium can hold almost thrice as much people compared to the MGM Grand Arena where its capacity is only below 20,000 while Akron can do 48,000.So seeing those figures, we can somehow say that it's indeed much bigger than any arena's in Las Vegas, Nevada like Allegiant or T-Mobile as it can cater more guests especially Canelo's own supporters and countrymen. And considering the population of boxing fans in Mexico, I think 48,000 seating capacity is just enough to be considered full because aside from Mexicans, there are other people as well across the globe who will be glad to watch Canelo live again.QuoteAs for Ryder, well, we will see if he deserves this spot or just another tune up for Alvarez.We'll see if Ryder deserves it but I strongly believes that it's the other way around because Canelo is not yet done.Nothing compared though when Julio Cezar Chavez fought at Estadio Azteca against Greg Haugen, a record 136,274 fans attended. And so for Canelo to fill that stadium in Mexico is already huge and yes, it will show his drawing power as he wanted to stage his fight in Mexico for many years. We don't know if we are going to believed him, but he says that he opted to fight in Mexico for lesser money and against Ryder.For Ryder, he has been in a 3-4 fight winning streak and has been rated and has held the WBO interim super middleweight title in which Canelo is the regular champion. So we can justify that he indeed deserved a crack at Canelo. But definitely a huge underdog in this fight.I don't think that is the case, they are just saying that because Canelo is now fighting an almost unknown name for which will give them less profits than what they are used to when Canelo is fighting in US soil and I haven't even knew that Ryder is the interim champ if I haven't searched his name and what are his recent fights. I don't know if this is the first but this is my first time seeing an interim champ being labeled as tune-up fight for the regular champion, that's just underestimating Ryder IMO.",
