  "content": "Today I noticed a large number of accounts doing some gaming project Neon Link spamming on the forum. I can't call it anything else, it's a real overpopulation of newbie spammers. I have collected a certain number of these accounts here.

That's more likely what I think of those accounts. I also think that  the accounts are own by the same person or managed by people of the same group looking for users to that project. All I can say to OP is to report the posts if it really is spamming or the posts are almost the same to the other posts of other accounts. I don't think those accounts will get banned for spamming unless they plagiarized something and those posts will only get deleted if the mods decided to take action.",

They don't care how it looks and what the forum or its members think of it. The goal is crystal clear. They want clients/users visiting and using whatever it is they are advertising. It's interesting that they didn't post any links to the website or service being advertised. They only mention the name. Some users I checked already had their posts deleted, but there are more.",

I had a look at that thread. Thread contains a list of ANN topics, which are engaged in spamming to promote their services or coins ( they order from someone or do it themselves).

Though this act is a bit different as these accounts are not bumping any ANN but they are more involved in shilling the project while reply to the pots in different threads.Yes, this is true. I have come into contact with such a project before, but that project has an ANN thread here on the forum. There was a project I was working on as part of their Telegram Moderators. One of their shilling tasks was for members to comment under their ANN thread, which was here on the forum. There were a lot of Spam posts under that thread; an account was being created just to serve that purpose, and it was really becoming spam. Last I checked the thread, a lot of the posts were already deleted by the moderator, I guess. But there is one thing most shillers don't know about this pattern of shilling, and that thing is that the way a project is promoted says a lot about the project. If they are spamming the project around social media, the project might be seen as a scam. Too much of something turns out to be a scam just by looking at it. They might end up getting a scam tag instead of the attention they are looking for, unless they are just seeking clicks.",

Don't be too sure that they won't achieve that; in every link dropped anywhere, provided that there are thousands of people going through that post, there will definitely be some people who will click on those links. This forum and its members are very careful when it comes to clicking on some untrusted links, but that's for those who are security conscious, and we can't say the same thing for the innocent newbies who are here; most of them want to click on every little link they come across looking for means and things that will give them fast money.",
