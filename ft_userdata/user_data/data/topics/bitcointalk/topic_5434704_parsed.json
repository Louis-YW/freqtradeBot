  "content": "HAPPY BIRTHDAY LIGHTNING NETWORKIt's been 7 years after Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja create an idea to fix Bitcoin scalability issue through second layer network e.g. lightning network. Although lightning network seems to be less discussed, but the fact is many wallets and exchanges already support lightning network. Also we can see on the graph where it show the sum of channel value and total of channel created is steady increasing with slight decrease during dump market.If you want to see list of open source wallet support lighting network Open-source Lightning walletsIf you want to see list of exchanges support lightning network https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LightningExchangesIf you want to get more knowledge and other things related with lightning network All Lightning Network Threads In One Placehttps://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdfhttps://txstats.com/dashboard/db/lightning-network?orgId=1&from=now-5y&to=now",

Its a great honor to Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja for making lighting network available in the community which many crypto and Bitcoin users has learned positive things from the lighting network.",

On which note:                   Public Notice:Due to the nature of this topic, it is likely to be targeted by the forum's most prolific disinformation agent, franky1.  They are wholly incapable of being reasonable when discussing any matters concerning the Lightning Network.  Check various sources before taking anything they say at face value.  Consider adding them to your ignore list.",

It's been a long enough time to look for some achievements, right?I remember a time when Bitcoin transactions were very expensive during several periods, so the Lightning Network was a very worthy, even if not user-friendly, consideration. But what about now, when Bitcoin transactions aren't always cheap but are usually not high enough to make a fuss out of it? Did the Lightning Network reach enough people, and is it still relevant, especially considering the trade-off of it being off-chain transactions?Is it possible to understand how many people use it? I see estimates that vary really wildly, from 100,000 to 80 million people, but all comes from websites I don't know and don't really trust. How big of a thing is it, and is it used primarily for Bitcoin nowadays?",

How big of a thing is it, and is it used primarily for Bitcoin nowadays?https://1ml.com/ tends to be accepted as a generally accurate view of nodes and amounts on it and such.As for the use question, it's hard to say since more or less due to the way it operates transactions are more or less anonymous.  So you can't tell if I sent 100 transactions or 100 people sent 1 transaction. Not to mention the custodial wallets that people may be using so you loose more data there since payments could be from several people all coming from 1 channel.And yes, the date of the 1st paper with a date works as the birthday.-Dave",

LN has not met its expectationstime to stop pounding the drums that LN will lead people to the promised land.. they had 7 years .. time to accept defeatimagine if bitcoin launched 2009 and by 2016 only had ~80k users holding only a total of 5,300 coins between them..would you say bitcoin is \"going to the moon\" or failed to launchthere are 60m users on coinbase, 25m users on binance. al waiting for the unmet-promises of something that can allow them to get off their custodian and store value independently. and for 7 years they have been told to wait for silly subnetworks to provide that solution, to avoid using bitcoin while they wait for the silly subnetwork .. .. times up!",

Just my opinion soo..\"wait another 3 years the developers will come through with their promises\".. you say..!LN has liquidity and capacity limits. its not designed to handle real bitcoin use cases. its not going to be able to handle everyones payments. just the small niche stuff of \"coffees\"here is a little example using LN stats of the LN suck rate.. oops success ratethe more users on it the more route lquidity/capacity is needed by their route peers to then provide route paths. meaning more liquidity needed (not for someones personal payments) but to be a provider of someone elses paththe options then become. people needing more channels to provide more paths which means again more liquidity per path. (not going to work)orend up centralising to hub services (custodian 2.0) of services with the hundreds/millions of channels where they control their outbound balance",
