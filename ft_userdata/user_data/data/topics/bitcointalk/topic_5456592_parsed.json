  "content": "Dear Community,I would like to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by our position (Brand New). On a positive note, I am thrilled to announce the launch of The Prototype Coin Project. This project has been a labor of love, and we are excited to share it with the world. We believe that our project has the potential to revolutionize the world of cryptocurrency, and we hope that you will join us on this journey.Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to your continued support.LITEPAPER - THE PROTOTYPE COIN PROJECTOverviewThe purpose of this LitePaper is not to raise money, but rather to inform the approach that The Prototype Project will take in achieving its goals. While fundraising may be a part of the project's future plans, the primary focus at this stage is on outlining and clarifying the project's ambitions and how they will be realized. Through this LitePaper, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of the project's vision and the steps that will be taken to bring it to fruition. By communicating our plans clearly and transparently, we hope to inspire greater support and collaboration from all those invested in the success of the project.Crypto projects can fail for a variety of reasons, but some common factors include poor planning, inadequate funding, lack of adoption or interest from users, regulatory hurdles, and security issues. Many projects also face intense competition from other cryptocurrencies and struggle to differentiate themselves. Additionally, the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market can make it difficult for projects to maintain financial stability and attract investment. Ultimately, successful crypto projects require a combination of strong leadership, solid technology, a clear and effective business plan, and support from both investors and users.The success of a project depends greatly on the level of hype it generates. A project with little hype may struggle to gain traction, while a project that generates a lot of hype can quickly gain momentum and support. The Prototype Coin ProjectThe Prototype Coin Project is a community-owned project built for crypto and NFT lovers. It aims to solve the lack of utilities in many crypto projects and create a financial tool to bring financial inclusion to the world. By being community-owned, the project empowers individuals to have a say in its development and direction. The goal is to create a more accessible and inclusive financial system for everyone, regardless of their background or location. The Prototype Coin Project is a promising initiative with the potential to make a significant impact in the crypto and financial world.$TYPEC is an innovative token that will add a multitude of utilities to tokens and NFTs. The possibilities are endless, but a few key use cases include blockchain gaming, lottery, DEX, lending, borrowing, stacking NFTs and more.In the realm of blockchain gaming, $TYPEC will create games that utilize tokens and NFTs in unique and exciting ways. For example, players may be able to earn tokens or NFTs by completing in-game challenges or achieving certain milestones. These tokens and NFTs could then be used to purchase in-game items or traded on various exchanges.Lottery is another area where $TYPEC will add value to tokens and NFTs. By integrating with various lottery systems, Typec will enable users to participate in lotteries using tokens or NFTs as their entry fee. This could potentially lead to a more fair and transparent lottery system.The DEX (decentralized exchange) capabilities of The Prototype Coin Project will allow for the trading of tokens and NFTs in a decentralized and secure manner. This will provide users with a more trustless and efficient way to trade their assets.Lending and borrowing is also an area where $TYPEC will prove useful. By allowing users to lend and borrow tokens, $Typec will create a new way for users to generate income or obtain assets they may not have been able to acquire otherwise.Stacking NFTs is another exciting possibility with The Prototype Coin Project. This would allow users to lock up their NFTs for a certain amount of time in exchange for rewards or benefits. This could potentially lead to a more valuable NFT ecosystem and incentivize users to hold onto their NFTs for longer periods of time.In conclusion, $Typec has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about tokens and NFTs. By adding various utilities to these assets, $TYPEC will create a more dynamic and valuable ecosystem for all users.$TYPEC is a cryptocurrency issued on the Ethereum network with a total supply of 100,000,000,000,000.Contract Address : 0x8585666A6795c3E37c0130397993D963b1495384We plan to allocate 45% of all $TYPEC to our community.30% for Marketing, Development and Strategic reserve, 30% to all holders of Genesis NFT collection, 16% for Initial Coin Offering, 15% to the community, 6% for linsting on DEX and 3% to team and advisors.The planThe project that we are working on has set a target of gaining 20,000 supporters across all of our social network communities before we can start taking action. We believe that this is an achievable goal and we are optimistic about reaching it. Once we have gained the necessary support, we will be able to move forward with the project and begin making a positive impact. We appreciate the support of everyone who has already joined us and we encourage others to join our cause and help us reach our target. Together, we can make a difference.The airdrop will be available for 10,000 people on a first-come, first-served basis. Act quickly to ensure you don't miss out on this opportunity.After the first airdrop, we plan to sell the Genesis NFT collection and distribute the proceeds accordingly. Specifically, 10000 lucky owners of this NFT collection will share 35% of the total supply of $Typec. This ensures that those who have invested in the collection are rewarded for their ownership, while also providing a benefit to the wider $TYPEC community. Overall, this approach aligns with our goal of creating a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.We have decided to conduct an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to make 16% of the total supply available for purchase by anyone interested. This means that individuals will have the opportunity to acquire a portion of the coins at an early stage. An ICO is a way for us to raise funds and also allows individuals to invest in the project. We believe that by making a portion of the total supply available, we can create more interest in the project and help it gain traction.After the initial coin offering (ICO), all of the $TYPEC tokens will be distributed. Once this is complete, we will create and lock the Liquidity Pool (LP) to Unicrypt. By doing so, we can ensure the safety and security of the LP, which will be used for trading $TYPEC tokens. This process helps to protect investors and ensure the long-term success of the $TYPEC project.Prototype LabsPrototype Labs is a team of professionals, which includes engineers, developers, designers, and dreamers, dedicated to constantly evolving the Prototype Coin project.
