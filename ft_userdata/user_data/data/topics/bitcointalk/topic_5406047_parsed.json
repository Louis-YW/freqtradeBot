Also, if you link your wallet to a malicious site, it could lead to a breach in your wallet security.",

The approve step is dangerous and hacker can use that access to steal your money. If you have an active wallet with history of transactions, you will see there are some hidden (in grey color) tokens that airdropped to your wallet. Their tokens are unverified and I can tell you most of unverified tokens by block explorers (Etherscan.io or bscscan.com) are scam tokens.You should revoke smart contract allowance to avoid unwanted access to your fund. If you ever click on unverified tokens, give them access, you should move your fund to a new wallet with new mnemonic seed as soon as possible.",

Hackers are very wise and tricky, in the process, it is possible that your seed phrase can be revealed and if your seed phrase is known, nothing else needed to compromise your wallet. But just that I do not know much about altcoins but I know we should avoid hackers, if you connect to their site, consider your coin gone.",

If you will use your Metamask on exchange --use a dummy Metamask account to connect to the exchange API and separate it into your main account which is where the big amount is stored. Yes --scammers can access your Metamask wallet if you will linked to them and have a transaction.I suggest keeping your seed and keys stored offline and never store in the device that you usually use.",

Thanks to that addition. This is now me getting more curious if OP is in a situation that has led him in asking this question and needs to take action quickly.But since he has said thanks to everyone, things are probably solved and clear to him now. This topic is actually good for those that don't practice disconnecting their metamask wallets on different websites that they connect it, especially into those dexes.",

If you're not using web MetaMask Extension versions 10.11.3 and above and you connected your wallet to a phishing website. According to the research done by Halborn. Yes, the coins in your metamask wallet can be accessible by a hacker because your wallet's secret recovery phrase can be extracted.Second. If you enter your wallet secret recovery phrase or private keys on the phishing website, you have automatically given them access to your metamask wallet.",

There is a great distinction between disconnecting some sites or revoking smart contract access.To put up simply for security concerns, if you are dealing with established platforms like Aave, Uniswap, PancackeSwap, etc, you shouldn't worry too much. But if you are dealing with shady and unknown platforms or token or smart contracts, well this part should be better to avoid in the first place because if you already dealing with it, there is little contribution from disconnecting or revoking things.For better references, I strongly suggest you read the information from Metamask: Disconnect wallet from a dapp  How to revoke smart contract allowances/token approvals",
