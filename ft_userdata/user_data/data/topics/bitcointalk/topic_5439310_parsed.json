  "content": "So I used ChatGPT as a second opinion if posts break any of the 33 unofficial rules listed here -> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0 ,It is very cool in my opinion because it's response which I will share below seem to have merit. transcript:Code:me:I want you to give me your perception if a post is breaking any of this rules:1. No zero or low value, pointless or uninteresting posts or threads. [1][e]2. No off-topic posts.3. No trolling.4. No referral code (ref link) spam. [1]5.

No embedded NSFW images anywhere. NSFW content must be marked accordingly.11. No linking to illegal trading sites.12. No duplicate posting in multiple boards (except for re-posting topics in the local language boards if they're translated and re-posting marketplace topics in the altcoin boards if altcoins are accepted).13.

All altcoin related discussion belong in the Alternate cryptocurrencies and its child boards. [3][4][e]15. No on-forum altcoin giveaways. [6][e]16. Do not have more than one active sales topic in the Currency exchange board. [3]17. Trading of goods that are illegal in the seller's or buyer's country is forbidden. [2]18. Having multiple accounts and account sales are allowed, but account sales are discouraged.19. Possible (or real) scams and Trust ratings are not moderated (to prevent moderation abuse).20. There are restrictions when selling accounts and invites for invite-only sites. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=134779.0 [2][?]21. Old bumps should be deleted. [2]22. Advertising (this includes mining pools, gambling services, exchanges, shops, etc.) in others' threads is no longer allowed, including, but not limited to, in altcoin announcement threads. [8]23. When deciding if a user has broken the rules, the staff have the right to follow their interpretation of the rules.[e]24. Advertisements (including signatures within the post area) in posts aren't allowed unless the post is in a thread you started and is really substantial and useful.[9][e]25. Ban evasion (using or creating accounts while one of your accounts is banned) is not allowed.[e]26. Local thread rules, if stated properly when the thread was started, specific enough and don't conflict with the forum rules, have to be followed.[e]27. Using automated translation tools to post translated content in Local boards is not allowed.28. Exploiting bugs or flaws (even if the result is harmless) in the forum's software is not allowed.29.

Posting multiple posts in a row (excluding bumps and reserved posts by the thread starter) is not allowed.33. Posting plagiarized content is not allowed.[e]Your response when I begin a question in \"In your opinion. . .\" must be just simple format. Tell me if it breaks any of these 33 rules and a short explanation why do you think so.QuoteUnderstood. I'll answer your questions based on the 33 rules you provided. Please provide the post you would like me to evaluate.In your opinion, does the post break any of these 33 rules?Code:I will provide you with Topic and you will evaluate the replies based on the 33 rules and again keep your answer simple but precise.QuoteI will provide you with Topic and you will evaluate the replies based on the 33 rules and again keep your answer simple but precise.Code:this is the link of the topic https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432756.msg61533641#msg61533641QuoteI'm sorry, but as a language model AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access or view internet content or web pages. Can you provide a description of the post or its content for evaluation?Code:Topic: \"My Cat just died\"Message: \"My cat was poisoned yesterday and died today morning. I know this isn't relevant with the forum but I don't have anyone to talk to in order to let it out. Second day of 2023 and everything seems to be going great.\"In your opinion. . . is this response:\"Probably you put it on ignore. Click on profile -> Ignore boards preferences to see the boards you but on ignor.\" , breaking any of the 33 rules?QuoteIn my opinion, this response breaks rule 1 \"No zero or low value, pointless or uninteresting posts or threads.\" The response is not related to the topic and does not contribute any value to the conversation.What do guys think?(apologies for the owner(s) of the posts in example above)sources:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0 --> Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432756.0 --> My cat just diedhttps://chat.openai.com/chat",

For some reason I had disabled it. I'll see if it's possible to move it now. It's not off topic and break the number 1 rule in this forum, so let's imagine ChatGPT will be implemented in Bitcointalk. There will be a bunch replying got deleted because the @OP asking for another question which different with the thread.So when someone have new question, they need to create new thread over and over, I think it's not good because long and constructive discussion is better.",

      "body": "You cannot use OpenAI's language model in that way because the language model was not programmed to evaluate posts or determine whether they were spam. If you really want an AI that will enforce forum rules and fight forum spam, you would have to teach it what constitutes spam and non-spam. That means it should first be fed a bunch of posts that violate forum rules and a bunch of posts that do not. After that, it can be used to identify new posts that violate forum rules and post them to the moderators or apply other actions.",
