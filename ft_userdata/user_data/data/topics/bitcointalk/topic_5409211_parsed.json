  "content": "\"Well it does not matter which employee or part owner of Bitlucy contacted you to work for them. Based on the facts as they are known thus far, Bitlucy was owned by two people: Royse777 and the Bitlucy CEO - therefore some would say it does have something to do with Royse777.\"I do not know the member posted it i read, it's gone from my screen.You are over 90% wrong but you make it sound you were 100% involved. You are misunderstanding. Roy had only 10% share which was not legally signed but gentleman words from Lucy (Bitlucy CEO). If anyone is supper harmed by the scam casino than it's Roy. Even the highest roller in the casino did not lose a small percentage of the amount and time Roy lost.I was in their support team, support agent was my work. Anyone in doubt can verify with others who were in our team, my name was Shawn. In our team we had Eureka07, @Mcturnbull, @strongkored, @meyennnggg, @hckmq, @Nobodd3 with another account @Noonah_20, graphic designer @insanerman. Myself and @Mcturnbull are not in bitcointalk. But all others are in bitcointalk and they are high rank members. But Roy was the one who always pressured Lucy for our payments and client payments. It was for him we received some of our salary and some clients were paid. If he was not in the team then I do not think Lucy was paying anyone anything yet. The day 22nd June Roy talked about it in the forum, Lucy paid us all including our team members in Philippines till that date all were paid but except him (not a single fraction of bitcoin until now as far as I know) and another member (@Nobodd3 had around $800 left but received the rest) later I found he was our ex manager. Roy lost $6700 and out of it $3200 was his own money that he paid to clients and others to recover their loss. Roy was trying to fix everything as gently as he can. It's hurt aching to see this far the case has gone against him. Roy was one of the highly careable colleague and a true gentleman for us. If Roy had selfish intentions then it was easy for him only to pressure for his money and stay silent for others but he always did the selfless act. Roy is not the scammer but he was the protector for all of us, he was protecting everyone to ensure all are receiving the dues from the main cone man Lucy.",

Also, Royse777 has received two red trusts due to cooperation with Bitlucy.ScamIt isn't due to cooperation with Bitlucy scam, or maybe it is just a language understanding issue here, the red tags are for failure to sense the scam earlier than Royse did, even when there were numerous red flags, Royse should have acted earlier, but he didn't cooperate with Lucy in that sense for people to lose moneyQuote from: re-start on August 09, 2022, 08:15:02 AMYou mentioned that \"all others are in bitcointalk.\" Why didn't you create a post earlier and save the other users?Save them? No other member got into trouble for this, they only worked for the team and probably were not paid too, so there is no saving them.Quote from: re-start on August 09, 2022, 08:15:02 AMYou knew everythings were going to be destroyed, but you kept quiet, and saying \"Roy is not the scammer\" doesn't help others get their moneyOp is not a member on bitcointalk until now.Quote from: re-start on August 09, 2022, 08:15:02 AMYou are nothing more than a scam.

      "body": "OP, I've read just a little bit about the Bitlucy drama and Royse777's involvement in it, and that being the case, this thread is confusing as hell.  If you start a thread in Reputation, you've got to be clear about details and not assume people are familiar with an issue that was dealt with in another thread.  Plus the title ought to describe what the thread's about.  So in other words, you're better off posting your input in the other thread that was opened about Royse777 (if it's not locked) and locking up this one.",

      "body": "It took me several days to create an account, several hours to resolve captcha. After several unsuccessful try, i was able to create an account but it asked me to pay because i am ban. I sent some emails to unban it. Eventually i paid and it allowed me to post. I have no idea why it is too complected to use the forum. I read a post from a user and replied it. Few hours ago i realized this is not a reply, i made a new topic. There are no idea for me where the post is anymore. I am still learning your forum.re-start, please explain me red trust, i am not known to it. They are not my friend but colleagues. It was not obvious that Bitlucy was scam, it felt they were having issues until it became obvious that Lucy was playing with all of us. When it become clear that Lucy was playing with all of us then we realized that we are trapped in his scam. How am I going to save others when I was not sure that I am in the trap. Those users are from your network and experienced, but it was obvious that like me they did not also realize that we were being used. I do not understand how you are calling me scam. It sounds a preset mindset. People lost their money for Lucy which is true as daylight and it is also true that a lot of people got paid because Roy was there. You are calling him scammer which is not true. You are calling he has mental problem, anger problem which is not true too. Z-tight, thank you for answering re-start on behalf of me. You are correct. About the numerous red flags, when Roy realized probably we all are trapped then the only thing that worked in his mind to recover the salary and get paid as many clients as he can. The site was not live always. It was down more days than it was up for few hours only. There were no new clients too to deposit. Roys took his final chance which is to wait to see if Lucy pay the Philippines staffs that was scheduled to 21st. It was a part of plan and if this is missed then there will be no doubt left Lucy was tricking us all the way. As planned 22nd was the day he decided to write about it on the forum to make everyone aware about it. Something might seems too long to you but it was for a reason to be sure.The Pharmacist, i lost the thread where i wanted to reply. I hope i did not make any mistake for posting it on this page.",

That would help user to justify Royse777. Creating such separate thread will only create some chaos, no good for Royse777 of course.",
