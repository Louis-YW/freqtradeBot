  "content": "Welcome to the first edition of the Bitcointalk Pie Baking Contest!See it in your local board: French | Indonesian| Philippines | Romanian | Spanish | TurkishVoting phase has started! Cast your vote here.In order to truly celebrate the upcoming Pie Day on 3/14, a small group of users discussed that it would be fun to use the event to launch a contest within our community related with baking and posting delightful pies but with a small twist - Instead of the main star of the event being the famous Pie number, we would replace it with no other than Bitcoin itself.Prize:There will be 3 places for winners - 1st, 2nd and 3rd place and the prize will be paid in BTC. The way that the prize will be handed out is fairly simple - 1st place will earn 60 % of the available pot, 2nd place wins 30 % and 3rd place wins 10 %. Additionally, icopress has brought awesome news from Betnomi - They will contribute with 1 custom wallet (Ledger Nano X) to the 1st place and thus officially sponsoring our event!Everyone is free to contribute to the prize pool and, if you do choose to do that, I kindly ask you to post here in the thread the amount and I'll update the table below. At the end of the contest I'll make the math and post which amount should be sent to whom and by which user. Currently the prize pool holds the following funds:Prize Pool:╔══════════╦══════════╗║Username║Amount (BTC)║╠══════════╬══════════╣║RickDeckard║0.0065║╠══════════╬══════════╣║Daltonik║0.003║╠══════════╬══════════╣║Porfirii║0.003║╠══════════╬══════════╣║PowerGlove║0.002║╠══════════╬══════════╣║Total║0.0145║╚══════════╩══════════╝Sponsor goodie:Contest rules:Pie must be made by yourself and the theme should be Bitcoin related (you could even include a homage to bitcointalk  ).Edit 07/03/2023: The definition of a pie, per Merriam-Webster, states:Code:a: a dessert consisting of a filling (as of fruit or custard) in a pastry shell or topped with pastry or bothIn order to be qualified you should post a picture containing your homemade pie + a piece of paper with your username and date;Only 1 entry per user (you're free to include any number of pies on your picture);Competition will be held in two phases:1st Phase - From 14th February (00:00 GMT) to 14th of March (23:59:59 GMT) : This is where all the users are free to submit their entries -> Live Countdown2nd Phase - Voting process from 15th of March to 29th of March (23:59:59 GMT).

I really can't thank him enough and I urge you to reach out for his services[2] and, if you're still in doubt, do check out his awesome work while you're on there. Once again, thank you so much jayce![2]https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1142066[3]Banner image taken from CryptoBriefing[4]Table design taken from Stalker template found here. Thank you!",

(i hope not)The first rule mean you can only create one pie to submit in the contest, but you can post the picture of your pie as much as you want.The second one mean there's no minimum members need to join in order the contest to run, so let's say only 3 users join, three of them will have 100% guarantee get the prize. The same applies there's no limit people who want to join, if there's 100 peoples, 100 peoples are valid as long as they follow the rules.Recreate work? I think even someone want to try to recreating a pie he found on a website, they can't copy paste 100% like the original work and there's will be an uniqueness from each participants. So I don't think it's possible for someone trying to copy paste other people's pie.",

If I understood corretly, you're saying that I should publish a donation address for those willing to contribute to the prize pool. I've discussed also this issue on my previous thread[1] about the topic. Basically we could have three options:Option 1 - I would publish a donation address under my control - I would sign it - and whoever wanted could donate funds to it. When it was time to distribute the funds, I would personally send them to the winners. However, with this option, it would mean that users would have to trust me as someone who would distribute the funds when the contest ended. Some users could rightly say that I don't have any kind of trust in the forum to deal with other people donations and that they wouldn't feel very at ease with that;Option 2: Use a trusted escrow from the forum in order to deal with all donation related questions;Option 3 (the one that was chosen): Whoever wants to donate just needs to post in the thread and I'll update the initial post with the user name and amount promised to the prize pool. When the contest ended, I would do the math and post a table with the distribution needed in order for the winners to receive their money.At the end of the day it was just a matter of making sure that users were confident in the option chosen and considering that I don't have any trust established here, we ended up going for the third option as it seemed a balanced one.Quote from: AHOYBRAUSE on February 17, 2023, 03:29:23 PMPlaceholder.Making a cake this weekend and updating here then.

I guess there is no way for knowing for sure if the wife made the pie or the participant Now you know why I said.  I like to play fair, even knowing that no one will be able to prove that he did it himself. Like Gazeta correctly said, while your wife may be the one who bakes it I'm sure that you're helping her with the concept of designing or even washing the dishes after right? To my eyes that's a collaboration and thus it's still a valid participation from your side Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on February 18, 2023, 06:20:41 PMAaaaaand here is my submission   A delicious apple pie! Yum!(...)Bon appetit!Thank you for your submission Gazeta, the apple pie looks delicious! I like that you added cinnamon since I believe it blends perfectly with the apple filling!",
