  "content": "My brothers I carry one update come wey go fit help reduce stress of adding special character for our post dem or thread, though some persons fit kick against am because dem dey write directly for this site, but this tactics na for those wey dey do their writing outside this forum den transfer am after dem don finish, because writting inside this forum some time go make you feel like make you give up some times.Reason I say so, this thing don happen to me many times, wen I don write enough thing to post sometimes my hand go mistakenly touch refresh and before you go know every thing don go, wen I give up to do my writing for this forum na wen I been dey translate one  fillippone thread I don almost Finnish naim the page refresh, omor I wan ves spoil my phone that day but i just hold myself because na only me for still face the consequences, so because of that one I com go download note pad wey get undo and redo should in case any mistake arise.So the update I dey carry come na like this, those wey dey write for digital note, na to just write all the most commonly used command for one page of the note then pin that one for the first page, for easy asses so when you wan use dem na to just go that place then copy am go paste for where you dey write.This na the way I arrange my command dem:Code:1. [b]  [/b]2. [url=  ]  [/url]3. [url] [/url]4. [quote] [/quote]5. [list]    [li] [/li]    [/list]6. [img width= height=] [/img]7. [code] etc[/code]So you fit copy the command go past for your note pad so that when you need am na to just extract am from there. This na image on how I take package my own.And also the fastest way to take edit your post na for this button wey dey for right bottom corner of our post,   na the image be that. E go make us make easier and faster edit to our post rather than using the main edit button.",

      "body": "I have had this experience several times and to be frank it sucks mate. It is not worth the experience of writing a very long and lengthy post and after which you mistakenly press the back key making you to loose all you have written. After that experience I decided to download sticky note for external typing and after I am done, I copy and paste on the platform for publication here. That is how I roll after then.For the code breakdown you have done, that is a good one on your side. One can copy them and keep on their notepad there so it could be accessible for them when ever they are writing things to be be posted here for reading.",

      "body": "Sincerely speaking what just happened to me now just blew me up right now, could you imagine after drafting a message for one hour I just ended up selecting all and clicked a button and all vanished. I felt like biting my self just tired and decided to take a break. This is making it twice now. I think this thread is a useful thread. although most of this problem is caused by phone, expecialy when you touch screen is having a little malfunction. So my advice is that, bitcointalk typing keyboard might cause you repeatedly typing a particular thing, where as one have other things to do with time.  In this line of business you will understand that time is very useful. When you are fully dedicated here , every minute becomes useful and you will not want to miss any of it.So let's try and look for a secue way of typing to avoid waist of  time and energy.",

Guy you get time oo. Just download a notebook app in your phone from play store where you can easily type,copy,do and undo what you have typed. Rather than waisting your precious time in writing. Morover you are just starting so you can not continue like this when you start typing 200 to 300 word per Page you'll get tired.I have experienced this couple of times and it make me feel so bad and makes me tired. I quoted someone for like an hour only for my to save it. I just refresh the page.",
