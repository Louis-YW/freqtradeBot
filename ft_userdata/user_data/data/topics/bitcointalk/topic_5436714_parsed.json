What you are trading in that kind of financial casino is mostly fake, created in such a way that there is a very high probability that you will lose your money.Bitcoin was created precisely in response to that kind of false and speculative economics.",

Leverage trading is not as straightforward as knowing the ratios, there are peculiarities associated with the collateral and the exchange. So a collateral of 500,000BTC would influence the amount of leverage one can take considering the exchange reserve funds.Quote from: cafter on January 25, 2023, 12:07:17 PMlike this than we can rich more than 19miillion coinsor more than exchange's reserve , I am not absolutely certain on the laws, but it could be illegal for an exchange to allow margin trading beyond its reserves.- Jay -",

Those are real coins only at depositing and at withdrawing, when they are visible on the blockchain. All the rest is numbers in the exchange's internal database.Yeah, in additional, trading derivatives like future and option enable us to trade any underlying asset such as bitcoin, but not necessarily ownership.  Because an investor is not buying or selling the asset itself but the contract that gives the holder the right to buy or sell the asset at a later date at a predetermined price. This allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without actually owning it.Quote from: CryptounityCUT on January 25, 2023, 02:09:12 PMOn leverage you actually don't trade with real coins, I can say if you own on-spot trading and have let's say 1BTC I can say to you, you don't own this BTC till you transfer it to your cold wallet.

Saying it as an illusion is not factual right because you are borrowing a money with a contract that you will have a liquidation on your pice once your asset reach the amount which is just equal to the amount that you borrowed to pay for it.It’s not an illusion but rather a contract trading.",

It is all just happening inside the exchange, You can't withdraw it or transfer it to others. As long as it doesn't appear on the blockchain, It is not yours.

There is no point in adding Bitcoin beyond the supply that has been set by Satoshi Nakamoto. The circulation of bitcoins circulating on exchanges is still far from 21 million, and some bitcoin voters also hold them in their wallets, but some leave the wallet without anyone being able to open it. So the circulating supply of bitcoins will not reach 21 million. this will make bitcoin even rarer when the mining process is complete, the price will be more expensive because of limited goods with great demand.",

There are methods to brute force Bitcoin keys and wallets but it must have many clues. A more clues (words, characters) you have, a more chance you can find your keys and seed.
