Do you think their prediction are realistic, seeing that there will be a \"Halving\" soon and miners presumably hoarding the coins that they mine?",

Do you think their prediction are realistic, seeing that there will be a \"Halving\" soon and miners presumably hoarding the coins that they mine? ¬†Yes, I also think that their prediction is 100% realistic and it will definitely happen that way, but I still think that it would be hard for Bitcoin to reach $50k by the end of 2023, however, the prediction about the Bitcoin's price by 2025 at $120k is 100% accurate and I totally believe that. The Bitcoin's price will surge once again after the halving event, and that's why it can easily reach $120k in 2024-2025, and whoever predicted that Bitcoin will reach $120k is definitely correct in their prediction.",

      "body": "While it's nice to have bigger companies publishing some bullish Bitcoin forecasts... It's again not much more than speculation.Bitcoin Halving is coming early-mid 2024, given how the price reacted to the previous cycles I personally believe there is indeed a good chance. Then again, Bitcoin is always up to some suprises and you cannot just assume things will always play out the same - one of the reason in a market situation is: If everybody assumes the same thing, the actual response to the assumed outcome will happen way before the expected outcome.So let's just see what reality has to say to these predictions - after all Bitcoin-price \"may\" go up to $50k and beyond. Or it may not.",

I would much rather spread predictions that are based on things that are going to happen in the future, than the doom and gloom that are being spread by the haters and the competition. Let's set some realistic goals to beat the previous all-time-high price and take this to the Moon.¬† ¬† Thank you for the responses, it is nice to get some feedback.",

These predictions are based on a number of factors, including the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by businesses and institutions, the growing demand for Bitcoin as a store of value, and the limited supply of Bitcoin.It is important to remember that Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and its price can fluctuate wildly. So, while these predictions are possible, they are not guaranteed. Nobody are saying that it is guaranteed.... it is a prediction after all.¬† ¬† They are saying, based on their research and info that they have gathered..that it is possible, under the right circumstances.... that those prices can be possible.¬† ¬†We know some positive things are in the pipeline for the future and history has shown that these \"things\" can boost the price significantly. The thing is.... negative things can happen too... which will drive down the price.",

I think we may see these numbers come true, meaning 50k$ at the end of the year and 120k$ after the halving.Frankly, there are a lot of optimists who expect these numbers to be reached, this optimistic news will cause miners and investors to hold on to their Bitcoin and this will lead to an increase in the price.",

Though am surprised they are predicting low prices, thought they would be going over board like a million dollars or something...certainly played it safe with their predictions. But while they are bullish on crypto, what have they done as a bank to make their mark in the crypto world üåé, ¬†my guess nothing!! And I think being in the crypto space for a while now, such news will always remain mere speculation as everyone is trying to tap into a new niche that could benefit their business and this is no different!",
