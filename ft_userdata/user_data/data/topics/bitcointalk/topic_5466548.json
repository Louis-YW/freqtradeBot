  "content": "Hey guys as already mentioned in our BSFL thread here is Cro2 with new promo this time covering Newcastle Champions League Run. Most of this text is copy/pasted from this post. No need to check it again, I will mention all the important stuff here once again.This thread will be used mainly to showcase the competition since our main BSFL thread is already quite cluttered with all the info. We will still use main BSFL thread for all discussions regarding this promo but it will be easier to have dedicated thread for the links, tables, reminders... Whatever we need and feel like it could create confusion in main BSFL thread.The rules:The competition will last for as long Newcastle is in the Champions League.Initially the plan is to have 7 rounds - 1 round before the group stages and 1 round for every game in the group.If Newcastle progresses from the group, we'll have 1 round before the knockouts and then 1 round per every following game again.The questions will be only about Newcastle's CL games, 5 questions per round, the system will not be H2H but most points collected across all rounds.The player(s) with the most points at the moment Newcastle's European challenge ends will be pronounced as winners.There will be no Divisions, every player participates equally.The side-competition is for current and future BSFL players - the ones that apply for the new BSFL season before the first CL game starts. We will also accept you if you are participant of any Sportsbet sponsored pool this season.Prizes:1. 2mBTC + 100$ freebet2. 1mBTC + 50$ freebet3. 0.5mBTC + 40$ freebet4-10. 30$ freebet11-15 - 20$ freebet16-20 - 10$ freebetFormat:You will submit the answers in the same way as you do for the BSFL.It will be a separate form, and it will be measured in a separate spreadsheet.It is easier to handle it like that - because the competition will span across multiple weeks.The deadline for submission will be 2h before every game and you'll be in charge of checking the deadlines yourselves.Small print:Some rules might still be tweaked a bit before the start of the CL promo. If that happens, we'll let you know.How to join:Just answer the questions in our form and you are in automatically provided you are allowed to participate. Check the rules. Form with first bunch of questions will be live tomorrow. They are not time dependent and we would appreciate if you fill it up as soon as possible so we can judge number of participants more correctly.",

When I started to follow football, I was surprised that there is quite big Newcastle fans community in my country. It was strange that people select to support them instead of Liverpool, MU or Arsenal. But it's probably from these old good times when Alan Shearer played for Newcastle.",
