  "content": "Ostrich ($OSTRICH) is a highly deflationary token. As Ostrich.Club, we aim to bring together the real sector and Blockchain technology in line with the incoming investments. In this direction, we promise high earning potential to our investors and Hodls.In addition to applications such as Wallet, staking, NFT projects, P2E games and launchpad, which have already been created by all other meme coin projects in the following process, as Ostrich.Club, we take initiatives with high added value for the real sector and provide liquidity for $OSTRICH, except for the expenses we have obtained. and we will use it to reduce (burn) its total supply.Who are we?We are a group of software developers who embrace decentralization and believe that it will be beneficial for the whole world.While we have been following blockchain technology closely for a long time, we realized that the system has shortcomings and cannot fully connect with the real world. We have seen that even the projects that can be beneficial for different sectors disappear in a short time. For these reasons, we decided to implement the idea of Ostrich.Club in order to create a better decentralized structure.Why Binance Smart Chain?Build N Build (BNB) Chain is a distributed blockchain network upon which developers and innovators can build decentralized applications (DApps) as part of the move to Web3. Decentralization is one of the core properties of Web3 blockchain technology and its applications. The key design principle of such systems is that there is no one person or organization in charge. Rather, the tech allows users to transact safely without having to rely on a third party to maintain trust. It also opens the door for computer software known as smart contracts to automate many of these interactions, allowing for the  creation of decentralized applications that support a wide array of products — from financial services (DeFi) to games (GameFi) and digital collectibles (NFTs). As of October 2022, BNB Chain is the world’s largest smart-contract blockchain in terms of transaction volume and daily active users. At the time of writing, it has processed 3 billion transactions from 163 million unique addresses, and has an ecosystem of more than 1,300 active DApps. The decentralized nature of the network means anyone can build a product on BNB Chain without having to ask for permission, and potentially reach a massive audience.Learn more about Ostrich.club.Be sure to check out the WhitePaper.Join & Follow Ostrich Club Channels. https://linktr.ee/ostrichclubcoinIt will be arranged in detail later.",
