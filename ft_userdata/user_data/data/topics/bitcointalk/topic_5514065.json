      "body": "China and India are big countries, if they really make bitcoin legal tender in their country it will have a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin and other crypto, since making Bitcoin legal tender means legalizing Bitcoin to be used not only for payments but more than that, and it will increase the market demand for Bitcoin. But is that really happening? I don't think so, because making Bitcoin legal tender is quite complex in a country as big as China and India. And especially they are protective of their economy, so legalizing Bitcoin as legal tender in their country is just a dream, because it will never happen.",

China is the second largest economy in the world, while India is the fifth. These nations have a higher GDP than El Salvador, so I predict that the price of Bitcoin will increase. However, the impact will be higher if it is the US that adopts Bitcoin as a legal tender because the US economy is bigger than the combination of both China and India. However, there is no significant level of chance that these nations will ever make such a law.",

However, as far as I know, India still sees Bitcoin with much skepticism and has loaded heavy taxes on it, while China has on several occasions straight-out banned crypto transactions. Thus, their current regulatory positions, while sounding exciting, would indicate that it isn't likely to happen anytime soon, and even if it did, the overall global impact might not be quite as huge as might be anticipated.",

Why did you choose these 2 countries? Because they have the largest population in the world and you think that will drive bitcoin price better?But as far as I know these are two countries that are not very friendly to bitcoin. So far, China has maintained a ban on the entire cryptocurrency industry, not just bitcoin and they have no intention of lifting the ban in the near future. Meanwhile, although India has legalized cryptocurrencies but they still apply quite high taxes to this industry, making investors feel uncomfortable. So I don't think there's any scenario where they accept bitcoin as legal currency. Not to mention both countries have their own currencies and things are going so well they wouldn't need a decentralized currency like bitcoin.",

For now, that's very unlikely to happen. They might legalize bitcoin but it would be highly impossible to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender. They surely would prefer to launch their own digital currency instead and make it as a legal tender rather than resorting into bitcoin, and yet they won't take full control with people's bitcoin.So even if adopting bitcoin as a legal tender would bring a lot of positive effects on bitcoin and its community, but it won't be enough to convince these countries to shift into bitcoin as their legal tender.",

These two countries already know that it will be a blow on bitcoin, if they make it a legal tender and that will give them less power to control their citizens, especially China who the president is a communist that wants all of them to be under his surveillance. Bitcoin is not from the government and they will not adopt it, because they hate the decentralized nature of bitcoin since it cannot be controlled by them.",

It is technically impossible to make Bitcoin the main means of payment in a country with a population of over 1 billion people. As far as I remember, the Bitcoin architecture allows for no more than 400,000 transactions per day. This limitation simply does not allow Bitcoin to be made an official means of payment in China or India. In addition, what about runes and ordinals, which can unexpectedly increase transaction fees not even several times, but by orders of magnitude? China and India are interested in protecting their national currencies, and they are also planning to introduce CBDC. Bitcoin may become an integral part of the gold and foreign exchange reserves of these countries, but it is unlikely to become an official means of payment in India and China (in my opinion, this is an unlikely event).",

If there is such decision taken by the governments of India and China that they will accept Bitcoin as legal tender in their countries, there will undoubtedly be a major boom in the Bitcoin price and cryptocurrency markets as well as the adoption of Bitcoin will continue to grow exponentially and it is more likely to happen because we know that India and China are the most populous countries in the world.According to a 2022 UN report, China's population was 1.426 billion while India's population was 1.412 billion at that time.When Bitcoin is legalized as legal tender in these two countries, the number of investors will increase exponentially, which will also increase the price of Bitcoin significantly. Moreover, institutionally investors will be encouraged to buy Bitcoins which will be able to increase the value of Bitcoins significantly. Not only that, when India China legalizes Bitcoin, other countries will also start investing in Bitcoin and the same time Global trust will be created.When India and China legalize it, they will also announce their country's full support for miners. As a result, the amount of investment will increase as miners express interest. That means  positive impact will be created for bitcoin from all aspects. It will have a positive impact on the entire world.",

As far as I remember, the Bitcoin architecture allows for no more than 400,000 transactions per day. Even in El Salvador with their humble 6 million people they recurred to Lightning for mass adoption via the Chivo wallet when they introduced Bitcoin as legal tender. I'm sure if a bigger country even thinks about designating Bitcoin a legal tender, they would either first investigate the layer-2 landscape, or develop an own layer-2. And they could also offer a completely centralized Bitcoin sidechain, copying Blockstream's Liquid model but with institutions of the state as members of the sidechain federation.Of course even Lightning needs some time for \"onboarding\". But sidechains don't have that problem. And the current sidechain landscape evolves quite well, and even if most have still centralized elements, projects like tBTC (Threshold Network), Nomic and (upcoming) Stacks are already \"as decentralized as most altcoins\". And there's also BitVM which can make sidechain creation even more decentralized in the future (but it needs some time).So I don't consider the scenario impossible for technical reasons. Of course, politically it is very, very unlikely from today's point of view. However: If there's a \"Bitcoin adoption race\" e.g. if more countries adopt explicitly Bitcoin-friendly policies and their citizens begin to benefit from price increases, then it may not be completely impossible, above all for India.",

It will create a temporary rise to the price of Bitcoin. That's the impact.Since most of the altcoins follow Bitcoin's price movement, there's a chance that they might increase as well, but not as much as Bitcoin.After that, it will be back to normal. Do you expect that Bitcoin becoming a legal tender to these 2 countries have a long-term effect towards the price? I don't think so, and TBH, I don't see this ever happens as well. I mean China has banned Bitcoin at first place, and until now, there's no sign that they're unbanning it. Well, if for some reasons this will happen, I don't also think that there will be an increase in daily transactions as well because I believe people would rather hold their Bitcoins rather than using it to pay something especially now. I guess let's just not expect for this to happen.",
