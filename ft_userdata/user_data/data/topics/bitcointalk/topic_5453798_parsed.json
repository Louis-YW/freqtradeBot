You can always build your own binaries you can trust from the source under any supported OS. As you mentioned, the potrerocoin.org website is currently down, but in any case, the GitHub link is the central distribution point and should be considered the source of truth. For additional support, PotreroCoin is on Discord as well as the IRC node mentioned on the GitHub project page.",
