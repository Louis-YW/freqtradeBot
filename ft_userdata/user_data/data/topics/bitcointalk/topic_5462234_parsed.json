It is the most difficult or cumulative difficulty that is used to classify it. If you look at the blocks, the difficulty varies for them to be mined, although the average time for each one is 10 minutes but the adjustment varies and since there is no constant then the longest chain is not about height no more but the cumulative difficulty.

Your chain is the longest chain but at the same time, your chain has the tiny amount of hashes.So, to sum up, the length of the chain doesn't matter. It was in past when the longest chain was the main chain but that was quickly fixed. Right now, the chain with the most accumulated work is the main chain.",

      "body": "Miners cannot obtain the longest chain by simply maintaining a low constant difficulty or altering timestamps. In essence, the concept of the longest chain is not determined solely by difficulty or timestamps, but by the cumulative computational effort (proof of work) expended by miners to extend the chain in a way that the rest of the network recognizes and accepts.First,  if miners were to artificially maintain a low constant difficulty, their blocks would be mined quickly, but they would not necessarily form the longest chain.  Other miners with higher computational power would continue to mine blocks at the normal difficulty level, and their longer chain with more accumulated proof of work would eventually become the valid chain.Second, the valid chain is the one with the most accumulated proof of work, and miners are incentivized to contribute their computational power to extend this chain honestly.  Attempting to manipulate difficulty or timestamps would likely be detected by the network and rejected, as the protocol is designed to maintain the integrity and security of the blockchain.",

The difficulty is determined by the protocol and not the miners. It is not possible for miners to maintain a low difficulty unless they all agree to limit their hash rates.In addition to what o_e_l_e_o said, by manipulating the timestamp the difficulty adjustment algorithm will be forced to reduce the difficulty because it assumes the attacker spends longer time to mine a block. Delaying the timestamp to take longer time is more effective. Quote from: Dzwaafu11 on August 06, 2023, 08:27:58 AMOr will it not function until they produce a large number of blocks and then alter timestamps to maintain the constant difficulty, at which point they will be able to obtain a longer chain than the one that is already in place?With enough computing powers, if a chain with all difficult blocks solved is built and it's long enough or more than the honest chain, the nodes will reorganize and join the other chain. Which still opens room for 51% attack, this can take a huge number of miners to work on an alternate chain, and a long time too, as the bitcoin chain is quite too old to catch up with easily, if they mine from the genesis block. On the contrary, miners don't think about this because their block rewards depends on the honest chain, and it'll take about 100 blocks ahead of the miner's block before they'll be eligible to withdraw the bitcoin, so they'll keep working on the honest chain to earn more bitcoin.",

However, I'd say that the network has been well thought out against any reasonable attack, like you mentioned the majority nodes controls the network. Because a single controversial change on the consensus rules could have been a loop hole in the network and attackers would have taken advantage of it, imagine having the non-upgraded node becoming the majority against upgraded nodes that would have caused a problem to the network, but such things have been tackled with block and transaction versions.

Most changes that we have so far are soft forks and there isn't any compatibility issues with the older un-upgraded nodes. The whole point about block versions is to ensure that the miners signal readiness to accept the changes to the network. This by no means prevents any sort of forks, just that if the miners have upgraded their nodes, they should have no problems with any newer rules or TX formats.

Block version number can be used to dictate a fork or helps to remind a user they need to upgrade their software. If the non upgraded node sees new blocks with a different block version, which they don't understand it can signal the user to upgrade, but if the non upgraded node keeps mining using the old rules and gets to block headers that has six blocks with more computing powers than the blockchain bitcoin core considers valid, it can detect this issue, using RPC command Code:getnetworkinfo and Code:-alertnotify this means bitcoin core can flag the blocks from non upgraded nodes as not valid and it won't be get added to the honest chain. Hence, Miner Activated Soft Fork depends solely on miners for nodes to execute the new rules while, in, block version and transaction numbers nodes work with the version number they're compatible with and ignore either the old or new version depending on the version they're wearing.  this can help us understand the block and transaction version numbers better",

The fact that Bitcoin Core warns of the activation of unknown rules isn't always accurate; miners can use version field as extranonce for ASICBoost, though this has changed through the years.Quote from: Accardo on August 14, 2023, 04:18:34 PMIf the non upgraded node sees new blocks with a different block version, which they don't understand it can signal the user to upgrade, but if the non upgraded node keeps mining using the old rules and gets to block headers that has six blocks with more computing powers than the blockchain bitcoin core considers valid, it can detect this issue, using RPC command Code:getnetworkinfo and Code:-alertnotify this means bitcoin core can flag the blocks from non upgraded nodes as not valid and it won't be get added to the honest chain.

That is not correct. Soft forks are activated with evaluating a range of blocks, for which N of the last M blocks are signalling a higher version bit. Bitcoin Core which are upgraded are designed to enforce the new rules with the miner's participation while maintaining backward compatibility at the same time. Upgraded clients will not reject any blocks unless the threshold is met, and for which there is still a grace period for the rest to upgrade.It has happened before, and that was when SPV mining was prevalent. Use of versionbit did not prevent these forks: https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining. The prevention is contingent on the miners mining the blocks with the appropriate rules and the user to update their clients and hence versioning system does not explicitly prevent any sort of issues with it.",

Fun fact, intentional hard forks are by and large only happening with splits that wants to fork a Bitcoin with different rules. We generally use soft-fork most of the time save for extraordinary circumstances (twice, 2013 chainsplit and unexploited inflation bug). Hard fork simply means that old nodes cannot accept it, regardless of what happens.Hard fork is very complicated and lots of things can go wrong, you simply have to weight the risk and reward.",
