The recent incident on luna dumped is really shocking and I am not gonna say no one would do such thing due heavy loss especially on those bet all im theit hard earned money. Its really depressing how this turns out plus the market sentiment. But of course they should be always ready and dont forget the golden rule that invest only you can afford to lose.",

In my case, I’m sad bitcoin dipped below 30k, really sad because I planned selling some bitcoins to pay for my medicals. The dump was unexpected and bitcoins is still dumping. I know I can’t sell now if I do I will suffer 50% loss. This is why it’s good to have fiat in hand.",

Sometimes a team's decision can reflect why their altcoin has become more expensive, but sometimes it will just cost them a large part of the price. It would definitely remind me of the best investment advice: Do as much as you can afford to lose.I believe depression can happen to traders as long as their expectations don't match reality. But suicide is not the final solution that will solve the problem because in reality life is still much more meaningful than money.",

But, a cryptocurrency investor would most likely look at the positive side of the spectrum- this volatility is nothing but normal and they would take advantage to acquire more in the process.",

That kind of thinking is too disappointing, not it deserves to kill yourself because you lost money. In fact, this situation is already been anticipated. We even think that this will come last year supposedly if we are right with our predictions but it comes late. I understand that many were just new to this bear market but I don't think we are not aware of this. Because if we do the search before investing I believe we are too aware of the volatile nature of the market that one day prices will pump and dump.",

When you see a cryptocurrency crash, and it crashes by 50%, and it crashes by 80%, and it crashes by 100%, many people in the crypto community really get concerned about their future and their wealth. People have a hard time accepting the fact that their money is gone and can't be gotten back. There are emotions involved, too, like blaming one other or blaming the developers of the cryptocurrency, or blaming the community. The whole thing is very emotional. And some people get very upset and can't take it. It's hard to predict how all of this will play out in the next few months, but most people are sure that these collapses will not go on forever. Crypto will come back. People will once again get excited about buying digital assets. Eventually, I hope that people will learn their lesson and be more cautious about spending their money in the future.",

There is nothing good in storing fiat in the long term, and here the advantages are on the side of bitcoin. In turn, using BTC for short-term purposes, as many have now seen, is very unprofitable and dangerous. Each financial instrument has its own tasks that they solve. There is no universal tool, and therefore, there is only one way out - diversification. Investors who only bet on crypto are now depressed and in serious financial trouble. \"Games\" with money are not amusement at all, as many people think.",

      "body": "Although suicides are a sad thing, those people are in a way victims of their own greed. For this to happen there has to be a certain chain of unfortunate events and irresponsible actions taken by an individual. In case of Luna it was the following:They chose to invest in a new altcoin, instead of an established project like BTC or ETH.They went all in, investing more than they can afford to lose.They did not set any stop losses, did not react fast enough. They were greedy and decided to hold a coin that obviously had huge problems. For me personally, the first red flag would be promising to buy 2 billion in BTC and buying only half of the promised amount. The second red flag, selling the btc safety fund all at once - it's a sign of panic and irresponsibility by the owner. If you sold at first red flag you'd be up on your investment, if you waited to the second one you'd be down about 60%, if you disregarded both, you took a 100% loss. Only shitcoins and scams can go that low. No matter how bad it looks, you are alive. Money can be made again, it's not the end of the world.
