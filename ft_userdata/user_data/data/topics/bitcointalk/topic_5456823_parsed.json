  "content": "Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has announced that the global exchange has no affiliate with the company Binance Nigeria Limited parodying its self as a subsidiary of the Exchange. CZ made this statement on his official twitter handle the entity has a scam entity that should be desist from. If we could recall just last week the Nigerian Security Exchange Commission had warn of the illegal running of the entity Due to lack of registration and not been regulated. Now The CEO of the global exchange himself has come to tell people to avoid the entity and not believe everything they read online. According to Nairametrics the entity was registered on 9th of December 2019 on Corporate Affairs Limited (CAC) number “1639782” and MABUSHI DISTRICT as the physical address. A search on the CAC website shows that the company under which it was claimed to have registered on has no record with CAC, and it also doesn’t have any social media handles. The only recognized binance subsidiary in Africa is the Binance Africa which has a twitter and instagram handle. It is fair to say that this is the only recognized entity of Binance in Africa according to CZ",

Even Binance do not have any option than to comply with the regulations. But SEC and other regulatory bodies concerning cryptocurrencies may not know their work and doing it poorly. Not only Binance, but other exchanges like Bybit, Kucoin, OKX, Huobi global and many others are used by Nigerians and the exchanges are making money from us, all of them have to be registered in Nigeria just like how banks like GTBbank, First bank, Zenith and other banks are registered in Nigeria. If they can not comply, the can block Nigerians to access the exchanges. What the exchanges are looking towards are profit, they will not want to lose providing their services to Nigerians.",

      "body": "What is going on behind the scenes if CZ claims he is not in collaboration with the company then who owns and runs the Binance Nigeria? How hilarious so CZ is trying to claim that Binance Nigeria impersonation. The whole situation is confusing, and if it is true that CZ don't have any collaboration then it is very risky to do any transactions there and that is why I always avoid keeping my money in any form of exchange because it is always risky.",
