The command you are pointing to is re-aging like the above said under that parameter those values might be the frequencies of the hashboard you can change it and test if it can help improve your miners hashrate but if you want to optimize the unit you need to use aging command instead of re-aging.Here's the command belowCode:[{\"command\":\"ascset\", \"parameter\":\"0,aging-set,1\"}]If you're looking for more commands check my post below- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381842.msg59012568#msg59012568Quote from: osmbtrk on November 06, 2023, 02:53:03 PMMy asic was working with low hashrate then I start aging yesterday and he still aging until now and keep reboot every 20min it work with good hashrate for 15min then stop for 5min and reboot I have try to stop aging by this command but I still have this problemThe command you are pointing to is not the command to stop aging I already provided from my previous post of what command you can use to stop again.Code:Stop aging: [{\"command\":\"ascset\", \"parameter\":\"0,aging-set,3\"}]And, normally, the unit keeps rebooting while aging because it is still under the aging process let it run for a while and let it find the best settings for your unit.",

However after, I've noticed that hardware errors increase, and the hashrate decreases. Eventually, the miner reboots due to `AM_BOOTBY_NOSHARE = 0x11`, indicating five minutes without hashrate.Given these observations, it does seem like a more intricate issue, possibly related to hardware. If you have any further suggestions or if there are specific diagnostics I can perform, I'd greatly appreciate your guidance.",

However after, I've noticed that hardware errors increase, and the hashrate decreases. Eventually, the miner reboots due to `AM_BOOTBY_NOSHARE = 0x11`, indicating five minutes without hashrate.Given these observations, it does seem like a more intricate issue, possibly related to hardware. If you have any further suggestions or if there are specific diagnostics I can perform, I'd greatly appreciate your guidance.Honestly, it's hard to troubleshoot this kind of issue without the unit on hand.I have a few things that I would like you to try instead of running the unit at high performance mode can you switch it to low power mode you can find it under pool config.Also, I noticed from your logs about ECMM that it also has an abnormal value meaning the the mmboard might have a problem or have poor contact with the hashboard. Solution try to replug all cables from the control board and hashboard then it again.",
