  "content": "When it comes to the choice of a wallet, the first thing that comes to the mind is the safe type and most recommendation you will see everywhere is to get a hardware wallet and that is because when your wallet is not connected to the internet, it protects you from insecurity such as hack and any other attempts that can stop bad people from harming your bitcoin especially when you have it in mind to keep it for long term. However, there are many people who use software wallets as well, it might not be for holding but for spending often every time.All wallets have common features like the ability to send, ability to view received bitcoin, customized amount in QR codes and other simple features but if you want to use any wallet whether it is a hardware wallet or a software wallet, there are more primary featured that must be looked into before you accept it as a choice, I have tested, installed and see some of the basic feature that give you good choice when it comes to wallet selection, I will explain them below. Let's delve into the general factors you should keep in mind to make a choice of wallet.Open source: There has been a lot of debate about the source of wallets and how safe they are, the majority of bitcoiners prefer an open-source wallet and not because an open source is the safest. It is safe to some degree in that when a wallet code(building blocks) is open to the public, it can be tested, reviewed and audited by everyone in the Bitcoin community to see if the wallet is really okay to be trusted and safe or not. Using an open-source wallet is better than a closed source because what you know is better than what you don't know. It is much easier for the community to detect a bug in an open source wallet than for a closed source, so when it comes to the choice of wallet, always make sure that it is open source.Standard recovery seed phrase: To have access to any wallet, you first need to have the seed phrase or Mnemonic phrase that controls the private keys to coins, no seed phrase, no private keys, this is one the best part of every wallet. There are some wallets that generate seed phrase that cannot be used in another wallet because they are not BIP 39 standard, not that these wallets that generates another type of seed phrase standard are not useful, they can only be used in other wallets compatible in their form. To avoid future problems when you want to reuse your seed phrase in the future, make sure it is BIP 39 standard seed phrase that can be imported to any other wallet, it is basically the most available type of seed phrase but there are some wallet that can be open source and not BIP 39. An example is an Electrum Wallet.Advance mode to run a node: One of the benefits of using some wallets is that with some tweaks and configuration, you can be your own node. What node does is that they help you communicate a transaction that is been broadcasted from the sender to the Bitcoin network and then to the miners to be included in the next block. The benefit you get from being your own node is that you don't have to depend on anyone to help you broadcast a transaction to the Bitcoin network, with your own wallet advanced configuration, you can be your own node for privacy and also help protect the bitcoin network.We have a wallet like Bitcoin Core to run a node with your own computer provided it meets the requirement space needed and also other wallets, you can configure your own node with an external set-up like plug and play where you can build your own hardware nodes and DIY(do it yourself) nodes. E.g. Raspberry Pi. So, when it comes to the choice of wallet, either hardware or software wallet, make sure you can use it to run a node.The general and important features you need in a great wallet.Coin control and Label: When you receive junk of many outputs, it becomes a task to spend, when you care much about your privacy, you begin to wonder which coin to send out and which to leave because when you combine some outputs together, people watching transaction can easily identify who own an inputs. You need this feature in a wallet to spend your inputs the way you like but unfortunately, some wallets don't have coin control and label features to identify an output in a transaction.In some wallets, when you want to perform a transaction, they combine your outputs altogether, this increases the weight of a transaction when you combine different outputs all together as they increase the transaction fees, if you don't check well before you send out the transaction, it can get stuck in the mempool for a long time if the network fees spike up, this is why you need coin control and label in other to consolidate inputs when the fees is low.Fee adjustment: Creating and sending a transaction, by default, the fee is customized by the wallet with dependency on the fees they are getting from the bitcoin mempool but sometimes these fees change in seconds when the transaction has already been sent, you have to wait for the transaction to fee to drop to that the level of the fee you paid for your transaction to get confirm. You need this fee customized to set high fees for your transaction when you want your transaction to be faster on the bitcoin network but there are some wallets that to date, they don't have this feature yet, so avoid this type of wallet.RBF(RBF (Replace-by-Fee): Basically, some wallets don't have this feature yet and it is very important in a wallet. What RBF helps you do is that it can help you replace and change the transaction fee of already broadcasted transactions. When a transaction is sent into the Bitcoin network and the fee needed to confirm the transaction changes, it will stay in the mempool and if the fee doesn't come down, it will be there for a long time with a maximum of two weeks before it will drop from the mempool, this means your transaction will not confirm and you can't do anything to adjust the fees, this is what RBF does. It helps you adjust the fee to a higher fee so that it can be included in the next block ASAP.Sign and verify a message: Signing a message requires a private key to a wallet address and with this, you can prove to anyone that you own a wallet address. Doing a complex online business transaction sometimes requires a message to be signed before they will want to proceed, this is just to remove doubts and red flags in the end, this feature also helps in the forum to claim ownership of a wallet address. So, when you want to use a wallet, make sure it has this simple feature to verify and also sign a message.Among all, there are other features needed in a wallet but if we place priority, I think these are a few most basic features you need in a wallet to enjoy the wallet in making transactions and at the same time enjoy them without any problems. Whether you want to use a hardware wallet which is a most have or a software wallet, make sure that these features are there in the wallet for comfort and privacy.",

Take note that if nodes have dropped your transaction from their mempool, you can broadcast a new transaction to them, even if the previous transaction had not been flagged as RBF.There are also nodes that have enabled full-RBF and accept the replacing transaction with higher fee even if the original transaction has not flagged as RBF and they still have it in their mempool.",

It helps you adjust the fee to a higher fee so that it can be included in the next block ASAP.The 14 days is the default for a each node but it should be noted that this count begins from the day the node picks transaction, one node can pick a transaction on the 23rd October and another node could pick it on the 25th October, if the first node drops his on the 5th of November, the other node will still have his waiting in the pool till 7th. Also the first node that drops his could also comeback before the 7th November to pick the same transaction again and that’s why we see transactions been unconfirmed for over a month and yet doesn’t get dropped There are also wallets who have an inbuilt function to rebroadcast your transaction which will allow it not to be dropped. They continue to rebroadcast the transaction and also anyone who has the TXID can also rebroadcast it",

You'll also need an accompanying online watch-only wallet which would be used for creating, tracking and broadcasting tx's, your airgapped wallet would only be used to sign your tx's.",

SeedSigner relies on the libsecp256k1 which is used and maintained by Bitcoin Core. The most important Bitcoin operations are done using the miniscript embit library, which is also used by Specter desktop (which is far more tested than this). Now add that there is an active team working on it, you verify everything, and that it's airgapped.Still, maybe it's more secure to setup an airgapped computer with software like Electrum, but I can't deny the fact that this is secure and tested as well.",

Testing the authenticity of open source is in a way neglected due to ignorance in testing it like I still don't know about the science of code.Another tendency for people to choose a wallet is due to the number of users and the trust score in the application.My question is whether just looking at the availability of features such as open source before looking at other features including the Replace-by-Fee and Sign and verify a message features without paying attention to the authenticity behind the mask of open source is dangerous?The types of wallets such as Electrum or mobile wallets that are recommended may not be included in my question because they have been proven to be good if we download not from a phishing link.",

If the code has been reviewed by many people and the no vulnerability has been reported, it's probably secure. It's possible that there's a vulnerability that hasn't been discovered yet, but if many people have reviewed the code and the wallet is well-known enough, that's unlikely. If a wallet is close-source, I would never consider that as a safe wallet even if there are millions of people recommending that wallet.",
