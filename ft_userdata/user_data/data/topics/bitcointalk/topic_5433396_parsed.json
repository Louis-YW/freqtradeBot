  "content": "There is one thing that the January 6 riots are proving over and over. Yet, this thing is trying to be hidden by Democrats exposing criminal activity in the riots. Here is what it is.Trump won the election. How can we tell from the riots?1. Nobody else ever had as many people trying to get him elected as Trump.2. Biden could almost never have gotten any kind of a crowd cheering for him.3. The fact that the Dems are trying to make the rioters look bad with nothing to what they say shows that they are scared.4. The fact that it was Dem leaders in Government who stopped Capitol security from preventing the START of the riots, shows that it was the Dems who wanted it.5. The fact that many people who were simply there, not partaking in the riots, were arrested, some still being held, shows that the Dems are trying to make a big deal out of nothing.6. The fact that people like Ray Epps, who are shown on video to have incited the riot, yet have not been arrested, shows that the Dems wanted the riots to happen.7. Videos of Capitol police ushering people in shows that they wanted the riots to happen.8. The fact that Dem leaders turned down requests for more security, so that they could use the deaths of the cops as martyrs, shows it was the Dem leaders who were the REAL perpetrators (perpe-traitors).9. Ashley Babbitt died for doing almost nothing wrong while many who did REAL destructiveness go free, including the guy who shot her.Much more.",

I personally believe we won't do it, because they will focus on other things they believe to be more important to them, like economy and the energy situation on the USA, preparing to the election of 2024, that is coming sooner than later.",

I don’t think it would be very productive. Everyone with common sense already knows there was no invasion. The Feds were there egging people on and the Democrats removed security to allow the “invasion” to happen. If you watch the video the protestors were mostly fighting back against being funneled into “invasion” position. Who I think should be investigating the Feds involved is the family of the only victim that day, who should be suing the shit out of those who ordered the reduction in security and were funneling protestors toward the “invasion.”",

The case of Ray Epps is particulary interesting, so it is the fact Babbitt's mother was arrested yesterday and those police officers who died, some of them committed suicide, which is of course, unfortunate. Also, if Babbitt's family tried to sue I am sure the defense would declare that girl was trespassing.",

      "body": "^^^ In the States, it's supposed to be 'innocent until proven guilty in a court of law'. The shooter murdered Babbitt rather than take her to a court of law like many of the other protesters and rioters have been. He should be prosecuted for murder, because she wasn't a direct threat to him... if she was a threat at all.Babbit's mother was released.",
