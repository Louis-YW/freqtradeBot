Now they have an average price of $29,803 to each bitcoin which I see is a very good price considering where the current price is right now pre halving period.

Even when the price of bitcoin was dropping and the public thought that they would sell off their bitcoins, they didn't. I think one they have a visionary leader who during the bear market assured investors that they weren't dumping bitcoin and secondly, their shareholders isn't mounting any pressure on them to sell.",

I just don’t understand why they actually buy Few in the DIP or is this another DCA method that could work potentially.I think they were like us, when bitcoin plummeted but they didn't have the money to invest. Despite being a large business, it is not always possible to have the money to invest in bitcoin, especially when the economic situation is crushing large corporations in the world. They hold a huge amount of bitcoin, and many people fear that they will dump it, but I would be very excited if they did. I don't know what the reason is, but as long as bitcoin is cheap, I think it's an opportunity to seize, not panic. Because no matter what they do, bitcoin will always bounce back.",

Which means the company actually took a $183 million loss for the year, not $1.469 billion.Still, not great they took a loss for the year of course, but they aren't losing anywhere near as much as the financial numbers make it sound like.Notice they made about $300 million the previous year when you account for the bitcoin impairment \"loss\".In 2022 you can see their revenue went down slightly, their cost of revenue went up slightly and their operating expenses went up slightly. None of that is too bad. Their interest expense doubled which presumably is from paying interest on loans for bitcoin, remember they just paid off their Silvergate loan so this year their interest expenses should go down significantly.The main difference is the line called \"Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\".

Make no sense for him to sell at $30K, however I can see him taking profit this time at $50K if we get there in the near future.Personally I don't see this as a concern, based on Saylor's belief and purpose in holding Bitcoin. It's purely as a reserve asset, better than cash reserves, as opposed to speculating on turning a profit. Ultimately he's aware that his stock won't be able to outperform Bitcoin long-term, only keep up with price at best, and by holding Bitcoin reserves as opposed to cash MSTR stock does much better.Pople forget that MSTR stock was basically a shitcoin until they started buying Bitcoin (down 95% from ATH after 20 years). So if they were to start selling, it'd likely return to it's shitcoin status. The only reason I can see them selling is if they need to access their reserves due to liquidity issues with Microstrategy - as ultimately that's the purpose of having these reserves, in order to act as a back up.So in summary the only issue with MSTR holding so much Bitcoin is if they go bankrupt and go into liquidation, then the BTC reserves would be dumped. That's the real risk here, which is probably quite low.",

But since I don't know what the \"Provision for income taxes\" is I have no clue why that changed or if that will continue to be a problem in the future or not.I'm not quite sure why is the Bitcoin holding impairment loss included in the operating results, unless crypto-investing is considered a part of their normal business operations. But that loss is very real - they bought in higher than the current price, so the value is lost and they have less money than they had before. There are no accounting rules that would allow keeping such loss off the records.And if you propose that BTC impairment loss should be ignored - then, consistently we should ignore the btc asset in the balance sheet, which would increase the Total stockholders’ deficit from ~$383 millions to ~$2.2 billions, making their shares worth less than a toilet paper.I guess your point was that they could keep going even when bitcoin keeps dropping, but I don't think that's the case. That would only be true if they bought bitcoins with some excess cash that they didn't really need, but currently their total liabilities exceed their total assets by $383m and that's including their $1.8b btc holdings (at 31 Dec 2022).Link to press release with complete quarterly and annual figures:https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/press-release-archive/microstrategy-announces-fourth-quarter-2022-financial-results_02-02-2023.pdfps. \"Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\" is just a funny wording for \"tax charge/(credit)\". It simply represent corporation tax (+ deferred tax), and as it includes multiple elements (i.e. tax losses carried forward, tax reliefs etc) it sometimes can result in credit for the year rather than charge.",
