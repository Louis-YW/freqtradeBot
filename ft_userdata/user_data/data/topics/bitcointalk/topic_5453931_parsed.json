  "content": "I am looking for a crypto wallet that can connect to third-party websites.That works on the Ethereum Mainnet.  That will show my WALLET address and my TOKEN VALUE to third-party, connected websites. But has a \"firewall\" feature that will not allow the third-party to withdraw my tokens.I have used other wallets (i.e., TokenPocket) where my tokens were removed by questionable, connected websites (rep-eth.com). I am seeking a cloud wallet where I can connect to third-party connected websites; and customize the permission, or has a built-in \"firewall\", where connected websites can VIEW my wallet address and VIEW my tokens, but CANNOT WITHDRAW my tokens.Can Electrum wallet do this?  (or know of any other cloud wallet with this ability?)",

      "body": "First of all, cloud wallet is a not correct term. Two, there is none of the wallets is able to stop such a thing if you give the permission of some sites/contracts to access your funds.Most of the cryptocurrencies wallet gives the ability to its user to do whatever the user wants to do. That means, you already have the ability to filter what kind of permission some sites or contracts have on your wallets. A likely reason that the site is able to move your funds might be because you unknowingly give them permission.As a basic security principle, do not connect or confirm any permission from unknown tokens, smart contracts, and sites. Also take a look at: https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4446106184731-How-to-revoke-smart-contract-allowances-token-approvals.",

      "body": "I don't know but what you are trying to describe is not working to decentralized systems, you need a firewall to protect unauthorized third party access to a centralized service, bitcoin is decentralized so you only need to protect your private key.You can extract what is known as Master public key, using that key you can track your balance without the fear of losing your money.As for what you are looking for, if I understand you correctly, you are looking for \"Crypto Prices and Portfolio Tracker App\" and you can find some good services if you use Google, but I personally prefer --------> https://coinstats.app/Electrum wallet only supports bitcoin not tokens.",
