      "body": "First, you don't need to pay anyone to get a quality reply. Yes, without the private key or phrase that proves complete ownership of a wallet, you can't sign in to a message. You either need the private key to the wallet or the phrase. Some bitcoin wallets have a sign-in message function built into them, so you don't need to use any third-party sites, which might end up compromising your wallet to sign in the message. Personally, I use Electrum and BlueWallet for my transactions and sign in with a few messages.",

He is no longer active since 2017.If you can't trust that source why not run this offline?Or do you want to run this on your website? If yes then you need to study his code to make sure the codes are safe.",

      "body": "1.Yes, you need the private key to sign a message. Signing a message involves using your private key to create a digital signature, which can then be verified using your public key.2.No, anyone cannot sign a message using just a public key. Signing requires the use of the private key. Verification, however, can be done using the associated public key.3.There are several trusted tools for signing messages, such as Electrum, Bitcoin Core, and online tools like https://tools.bitcoin.com/signature/.4.To implement message signing in PHP, you can use libraries like phpseclib or bitwasp/bitcoin along with the necessary Bitcoin functions. Here's a basic example using phpseclib:phpEdit<?phpinclude('vendor/autoload.php'); // Include the necessary libraryuse phpseclib\\Crypt\\RSA;// Your private key and message$privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE';$message = 'Message to sign';// Create an RSA instance$rsa = new RSA();$rsa->loadKey($privateKey); // Load your private key$signature = $rsa->sign($message); // Sign the messageecho \"Signature: $signature\"; // Output the signature?>Remember to replace 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE' with your actual private key.References:Bitcoin Wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/phpseclib GitHub: https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib",

But Electrum is open source where the code is available on https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum. And i doubt you can find simple project since signing involve so many things including ECDSA implementation and checking whether you use valid private key.",
