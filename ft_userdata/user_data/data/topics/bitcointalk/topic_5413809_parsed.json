I guess people who purchased beetcoin on this site were sent one (or some people were at least) - https://rally.io/creator/BEET/I’m a fan of the Stern show and a huge fan of Beetlejuice, so I would love to be able to find one of these. If you’re not familiar with Stern or Beetlejuice, here’s some video clips of them- https://youtu.be/Wuvp8gnFs4ohttps://youtu.be/EnuwukJwbqM",

I was in my early teens when I’d watch it back when his show was on the E channel. Crazy now as a grown man he’s still going.  I absolutely can’t stand Robin. Completely talentless as well as classless.  @OG- his show was definitely better back in the day. I think when Artie was fired is when it really started going downhill. It’s still decent at times, but it’s not what it was.  My favorite part of the show is Richard and Sal. I love those two morons so much. Obviously I’m a big fan of prank phone calls.@Owl- lol, that would be kinda fun if Theymos gave me something like that. Speaking of Theymos, what I hope he ends up reviving is making a forum coin like he proposed a couple years ago.

Was trying to see if I could get a handful at cost from the original source but haven’t heard back yet.",

Ahh to be young in the 90s again. Will keep you posted on the Beetcoin.",
