  "content": "QuoteTotal household debt for Americans has risen to a record $16 trillion, according to a report from The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as Americans grapple with inflation and rising costs.“Americans are borrowing more, but a big part of the increased borrowing is attributable to higher prices,” NY Fed researchers wrote in a blog post accompanying the report, released Tuesday.The total rose 2 percent between the first and second quarters of 2022, or about $312 billion. This year’s $16.15 trillion household debt dollar amount is $2 trillion higher than what was recorded in pre-pandemic 2019. Increases in mortgage and auto loan debt are reactive to rising home and auto costs, the researchers wrote, and the uptick in credit card debt shows the effect of inflation.Mortgage balances were the biggest contributor to the $2 trillion increase, rising by $207 billion to $11.39 trillion total. Auto loans rose by $33 billion. Credit card balances went up by $46 billion, one of the largest recorded by the NY Fed since 1999, “at least partly reflecting inflation on consumer goods and services purchased using credit cards,” the researchers wrote. Non-housing balances — including credit card, auto and student loan debts — saw the largest increase since 2016, up by $103 billion.The NY Fed reported student loan balances, at around $1.59 trillion, didn’t much fluctuate from the first quarter.The report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York drew from the New York Fed Consumer Credit Panel, a nationally representative sample of Equifax credit report data.https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3584781-americans-household-debt-surpasses-16t-for-first-time/....As new data is compiled, we are seeing interesting trends emerge. QuoteCredit card balances went up by $46 billion, one of the largest recorded by the NY Fed since 1999The above could validate rumors of americans using credit cards to buy food and other essential goods. Which is a frightening thought to consider. Most americans believed it was impossible for these levels of inflation to affect us. We're still living in denial, that this is actually happening. We thought things like this only happened to other nations.If we're to address these issues, we will need to adjust our perspective and way of thinking of things. It will take time. I'm not certain if time is a luxury we can afford.",

Yes, I do not argue - since 2020, COVID, and then the global crisis caused by the terrorist war unleashed by Russia in Ukraine, has led to an increase in the number of consumer loans for simpler purchases than a house.On the other hand, the US is not so afraid of these trillions. The USA provides the whole world with DOLLARS. And 1-5-10 trillion is a drop in the global economy. This means that the government can print and give out this amount to the population, or pay off household debt to banks, or give out another aid to those in need .... And all this money will then flow into .. THE WORLD ECONOMY! Well, and an important clarification - now the military-industrial complex will start working at full speed in the United States - and these are real trillions in the form of a finished product, these are wages, these are jobs, these are insurances, these are taxes. So don't worry too much about the USA!",

Today, the average cost of housing in America is 217 thousand US dollars. That's 3.6 times more than the median annual household income of $60,336. Across the country, real estate values ​​vary considerably, and in some states, owning a home is much cheaper than in others.2. Owners of real estate in the United States spend an average of 1-4% of the value of the property per year on the maintenance and repair of housing. Average monthly housing costs in California are $600, in Florida $520, in New York State $560, and in Texas $700.This is what I mean - $ 1,500 a month for housing, as I understand it, this is a mortgage. FOR the whole house. Which corresponds to the example of a 15-year mortgage, at $1,500 per month (including the mortgage rate).It seems to me that for a family, even from 2 working people, this is not very much. I could be wrong, but it doesn't look too scary...I have not heard about total unemployment in the USA, although I know that inflation \"ate\" part of the income. By the way, does the mortgage agreement take into account inflation? If not, then on the contrary it has become more profitable than before all epidemics and crises",

You said it yourself, getting indebted is a trap, now if the economy was relatively stable during a very long time then taking a commitment to pay for a house in 20 to 30 years would make sense, but since that is not the case indebting yourself over such a long period of time not knowing what it may happen and still lose your house at the end is a very strong possibility, which is what happened to a lot of people during the financial crisis of 2007, so with this in mind it is important to try to reduce the amount of time you spend while being indebted as you never know when a crash may be coming.",
