A 4,500 km long infrastructure, allowing for 165 million passengers to travelby Hyperloop every year, while saving the atmosphere from 368 million tonnes of CO2,complements the current urban planning.Under the initiative, Riyadh would become a transportation hub connecting cities such as Jeddah,and the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, with Virgin Hyperloop pods capable of carrying groups of 25 passengerscomfortably at speeds of 1,000 km per hour.[AHL] Arab Hyper Loop Token is the official partner of this project and will not only act as a pure investor,but will also establish a payment option with cryptocurrency. In addition, for every tonne of CO2 saved,a certain percentage of [AHL] tokens are invested in new technologies to support carbonization progress.The system would also allow for safer social distancing, thanks to the small group sizes,lack of frequent stops, and adaptive artificial intelligence, which would allow for additional podsto be added, as necessary.contract:0xB58bCD77A4cCEe0feF7501b638903D3884D82C4aExplorer:https://bscscan.com/token/0xb58bcd77a4ccee0fef7501b638903d3884d82c4aSourcecode:https://github.com/ArabHyperloop/sourcecode-AHL-V1.1.3/blob/main/AIWhitepaper:https://github.com/ArabHyperloop/Whitepaper_AHL_v1.1.3/blob/main/whitepaper-ahl-arab-hyper-loop-v1.1.3_2024.pdfRoadmap:https://github.com/ArabHyperloop/Roadmap_AHL_v1.1.4/blob/main/AHL-arab-hyper-loop-roadmap-v.1.1.4%20(1).pngTokenomic:https://github.com/ArabHyperloop/Tokenomics_AHL_v1.1.2/blob/main/arab-hyperloop-ahl-0xB58bCD77A4cCEe0feF7501b638903D3884D82C4a-crypto-bsc-tokenomic-2.pngAudit:https://blocksafu.com/audit/0xB58bCD77A4cCEe0feF7501b638903D3884D82C4aTeam:AHL - CEO Mazen Al khayat  مازن الخياطhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/mazen-al-khayat-7b7197269https://x.com/MAZENALKHAYATS?t=G7aliiULMdMI3YJYhNemSQ&s=35https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090790625560AHL - COO ِأحمد الخالد  Ahmad Alkhaledhttps://x.com/AHMADALKHALEDS?t=VFDg436wsalZ6Nm9iju44A&s=35https://t.me/AHMAD_ALKHALED_AHLAHL - CTO Waseem  jallabi وسيم جلابيhttps://x.com/WASEEMJALLABI?t=aYZBcxKQ_IPq8bt3x0TWkg&s=35https://t.me/WASEEMJALLABIWebsite:https://www.etihadrail.orgofficial Mail´s:contact@etihadrail.orgsupport@etihadrail.orgsocials:Twitter:https://x.com/arabhyperloop?t=5IBC9r7eBYRcbP1EIYlvXA&s=35Telegram:https://t.me/ahl_arabhyperloopgithub:https://github.com/ArabHyperloopMedium:https://medium.com/@arabhyperloopFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090392302629Reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/ArabHyperLoop/Discord:https://discord.gg/hehT4ysXq8Linktree:https://linktr.ee/arabhypertiktok:https://www.tiktok.com/@arabhyperloop?_t=8itDjnClrQP&_r=1youtube:https://www.youtube.com/@ArabhyperloopBitcointalk:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3539735;sa=showPosts",
