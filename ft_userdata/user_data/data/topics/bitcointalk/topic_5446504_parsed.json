  "content": "Hello,A couple days ago Coinplay decided to close my account and confiscate all my sports bet winnings (291mbtc).Let me tell you what happened:After having monitored their ANN thread regularly since December last year to read about experiences from users about Coinplay, I finally decided after 3 months of hesitating to open an account at Coinplay.com on Monday 20th March. Oh boy, do I regret that decision now.I deposited 70mbtc to start betting live on NBA. I only bet on NBA game winner market, never any totals or handicaps. First day I only placed 1 bet on Warriors to beat Houston at very low odds, which was a winner making my balance 84mbtc. Then the next day I placed my 84mbtc balance on the Clippers versus Oklahoma, which sadly lost. So the third day (Wednesday) I had to make another deposit, this time I did 200mbtc. I placed some more bets: Warriors to beat Dallas, Miami to beat Knicks, Lakers to beat Suns and 2 separate bets on Portland to beat Utah. All of them were favourites in range from 1,40 to 1,65 odds, apart from Lakers which were small underdogs at 2.20 odds. Lucky for me, all my bets won this day and my balance was 561mbtc after this Wednesday 22th of March. This meant 270mbtc deposit total plus 291mbtc of winnings. So I decided to quit for the day and withdraw 200mbtc, planning to play on with the remaining funds the next day.But then a couple minutes after requesting my withdrawal I was suddenly auto-logged out from my account. I tried to log back in but the system said I had entered a wrong password even though I was 100% sure I had the correct one. So I went into livechat and was asked to email to security@coinplay.com so I did.Then I got the response \"hello, your request has been sent to the specialist, wait for the answer\". And then 15 minutes later the following email:foto onlineSo I was flabbergasted, that they simply decided to confiscate my winnings even though all I did was place a couple of NBA bets. It is just a very vague copy/paste of some terms which basically state that I have somehow \"manipulated\" or \"cheated\"....and the joke is also that it says \"the decision was made after a careful investigation\". How careful can an investigation have been when it took less than 30 minutes in total? Within an hour of my bets being settled or within even 30 mins from my withdrawal request this \"investigation\" had already been concluded.Let me summarize the facts:- I am not from a forbidden country, I live in Germany- I have not bet using VPN, I simply used my normal German IP-address- I have not bet on dodgy unknown leagues where I could maybe gain an unfair advantage- All my bets were on one of the biggest leagues in the world: the NBA. And not even on handicaps or totals but the most reliable market of them all: the game winner market- I have not used any software or robots placing my bets- I did not claim any bonus- I only have one accountSo all in all my experience with Coinplay has been horrible. I have done nothing wrong and I am being accused of manipulating and cheating when I simply bet on a huge world famous league. How on earth can I manipulate or cheat with those bets? And how on earth can Coinplay determine this within 30 mins from my withdrawal request?Why was nothing wrong yet with my betting when I lost my first deposit of 70mbtc? Why only after a winning run?I sent an email to Coinplay stating I did nothing wrong and asked them to re-evaluate their decision, but waited now 4 days and received zero response.My conclusion is that Coinplay is an abosolute scam and they are free-rolling their customers: if you lose they gladly take your money but if you win they only return the deposit. This is simply theft and I need to warn every Bitcointalk user against this practice. Coinplay are welcome to defend themselves and maybe they finally see that they made the wrong decision here to treat me as a cheater, and hopefully they re-instate my account. It can always be the case that they had an internal miscommunication about me and by accident flagged me as an abuser, in that case they are free to admit this here and the case will be closed. We all make mistakes, it's just how you handle them what determines how good or bad you actually are. But until that happens: AVOID Coinplay.com if you want to receive your fairly earned winnings. I will give them some time to respond and will create a flag against them if this does not lead to a solution. I will also file complaints with their Curacao license holder and with Askgamblers and if that does not help, will even take legal action on a no-cure, no-pay basis with a Curacao lawyer I know.Here you can see all bets which have been voided after they were already settled, and now have odds of 1.00:Here you can see my transactions on the account. First my 70mbtc deposit, then my 200mbtc deposit, then my rejected 200mbtc withdrawal and then my succesful withdrawal of only the 270mbtc deposited funds. After that my account got closed down and right now I cannot login anymore.And here you can see my profile page with my account number and emailaddress:",

By playing with their TOC, some of these bookmakers might be taking advantage of their customers. For the purposes of evidence, it would appear that we would require a screenshot each time we place bets in the event that the bookmakers will close our accounts without prior notice.",
