Many users believe that there's a security issue in Ledger's ConnectKit library. It's possible that DAPPs that use the library could allow an exploit, that steals your coins, injected in their very own protocols.",

      "body": "It was a hack of Ledger's web3 library that can drain funds in connection with 3rd-party DApps. Ledger has stated that the bad library has been updated, but that's not all that needs to happen. Each web wallet and DApp that uses that vulnerable library needs to patch the issue on their end as well. Therefore, it's still not recommended to use Ledger in connected with such apps until further notice. I wish there was more information on the exploit. Like, is it really capable of draining coins from the hardware wallet, or is it a user mistake after accepting and confirming a malicious transaction? The first defeats the whole purpose of the hardware wallet, while the second is avoidable. I just found this recommendation on Twitter that might be useful if anyone uses a Ledger HW with 3rd-party DApps.You should clear your cache and site data and make sure you are using version 1.1.8 of the Ledger Connect kit.

We recommend waiting 24 hours until using the Ledger Connect Kit again.The investigation continues, here is the timeline of what we know about the exploit at this moment:- This morning CET, a former Ledger Employee fell victim to a phishing attack that gained access to their NPMJS account.- The attacker published a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit (affecting versions 1.1.5, 1.1.6, and 1.1.7). The malicious code used a rogue WalletConnect project to reroute funds to a hacker wallet.- Ledger‚Äôs technology and security teams were alerted and a fix was deployed within 40 minutes of Ledger becoming aware. The malicious file was live for around 5 hours, however we believe the window where funds were drained was limited to a period of less than two hours.- Ledger coordinated with @WalletConnect¬†who quickly disabled the the rogue project.- The genuine and verified Ledger Connect Kit version 1.1.8 is now propagating and is safe to use.- For builders who are developing and interacting with the Ledger Connect Kit code: connect-kit development team¬† on the NPM project are now read-only and can‚Äôt directly push the NPM package for safety reasons.- We have internally rotated the secrets to publish on Ledger‚Äôs GitHub.- Developers, please check again that you‚Äôre using the latest version, 1.1.8.- Ledger, along with @Walletconnect¬†and our partners, have reported the bad actor‚Äôs wallet address. The address is now visible on @chainalysis. @Tether_to¬†has frozen the bad actor‚Äôs USDT.- We remind you to always Clear Sign with your Ledger. What you see on the Ledger screen is what you actually sign. If you still need to blind sign, use an additional Ledger mint wallet or parse your transaction manually.- We are actively talking with customers whose funds might have been affected, and working proactively to help those individuals at this time.- We are filing a complaint and working with law enforcement on the investigation to find the attacker.- We‚Äôre studying the exploit in order to avoid further attacks. We believe the attacker‚Äôs address where the funds were drained is here: 0x658729879fca881d9526480b82ae00efc54b5c2dThank you to @WalletConnect, @Tether_io, @Chainalysis, @zachxbt, and the whole community that helped us and continue to help us identify and solve this attack. Security will always prevail with the help of the whole ecosystem.I can't resist posting this edit of their bio",

It all goes back that you don't simply click on ok, sign, or proceed without verifying every piece of transaction information on the screen of your hardware wallet.
