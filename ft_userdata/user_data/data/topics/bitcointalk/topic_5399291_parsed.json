This is manipulation of crowds.This is mostly pump and dump, or selling useless courses of things you could learn for free in the internet. They exist because there is a lot of people trying to find quick-rich schemes, which usually are ponzi schemes.It is sad, but most cryptocurrency influencers are scammers, and there are just a few honest and serious people in social media really spreading good information.",

In a sense, crypto has a greater chance of success if many people believe in the success of a particular coin. Itâ€™s like economics - the law of supply and demand. Is it mass manipulation? Of course, it is a tool like anything else in marketing. The chance that a person will support a product, service, or coin depends on how many people have already endorsed it. Therefore, the role of Instagram here is hard to overestimate. It gives people a sense of massive support for the project. Humans, deep down, like being like everyone else. It is the mind of the crowd. Therefore, the crypto also uses services for buying likes on Insta and more. The more engagement a coin has on Instagram, the higher the chance more people will trust the project and invest in it.",
