Maybe using people's computer resources while they think that they are busy looking for private keys",

That is plain theft or robbery. For many reasons, I am leaning more into tagging OP. Why should such a person be trusted?",

That is plain theft or robbery. For many reasons, I am leaning more into tagging OP. Why should such a person be trusted?You're right. That's exactly what it describes. Unfortunately, there is more than this site that offers something like this. I wouldn't trust the OP and other operators of such sites, that's for sure. At least such sites show that it is almost impossible to find a key this way, but it doesn't really make it any better. Everyone has to decide for themselves whether that justifies an tag. I'm holding back, but I hope my opinion here in the thread will make people think.",

I am not responsible for anyone, neither do we collect any information of any sort.How can I be sure that I am the only one who has the private key and that no one will be able to generate that private key? You are talking about an online tool that needs to be online which means you can keep a copy of the private key, wait for me to send the coins, use a fast bot to transfer the coins once they are deposited and claim that you are not responsible for anything.What is the probability of finding an address with balance? Is it possible for this to happen to addresses that were generated at random?Quote from: digaran on January 23, 2023, 11:28:06 AMDon't know why people attack the OP, there is already a bunch of open source applications designed especially to search for private keys with a speed of millions/ hundreds of millions of keys per second, why don't you go to their topics and slap some morality to their faces?Because it is open source, you do not need to connect to the Internet, you can download and manage it locally.And because generating the address/private key does not require a high CPU ability to trust an anonymous third party.If his tool is open source and can be used without the need for the Internet, all negative comments will stop.",

One can generally see it this way. I'm not a fan of such sites with such a service I always see the danger that someone could lose their coins. Yes, I realize the chance is very, very small, but it's still there. That's why I don't like it when a new site like this comes out and I try to remind people what it means to use such sites. It's not a treasure hunt, it's theft when you use the keys you find to take coins that belong to someone else. But everyone can see it how they like it and it can certainly be discussed.",
