You can move or sell it in anytime you want. What we can't control is the price since it's depends on the demand and supply.QuoteTo me bitcoin is there to gives you money when you're satisfied to take the money or take your if can't wait when is dropping.

Many experienced users are only give advice and guide because they don't want to see the next generation regret their own decision. After all if you disagree with them, you can do what you like. You can hold your coins on unknown closed source web wallet, submit every KYC to shitcoin projects, use scam exchanges etc, no one will able to control you lol.QuoteIs that long term bitcoin don't experience losses?If you look at the graph, you will know the answer.",

I can sell my services for bitcoins and then convert them to my local currency and I can also do the opposite. (buying a service or a product) I can do the same thing with a credit card but they only work with the big companies. What If I just want to buy something from some random dude?

I know you are contented, no matter how small your profit is, but not all people have the same mindset as you; it doesn't mean they are greedy, but they want to get more profit, as there is also a high chance in a few years that you can get more profit, though it requires patience. It won't work on you since you can't wait, so we have different strategies. Some of us have the same strategy as you: a small rise, which they will then sell off, while others hold on for a greater chance of getting big profits.",

The most logical move would be to keep it and use fiat which does the opposite process whenever possible, by the way this process has a name and it is called the gresham law and it has been a known process for a very long time.",

Don't you feel like you're inconsistent?Well, on topic, you are always the master of your investment. No one forbids you to hold Bitcoin as soon as its price rises by a few dollars. But if you don't need money and have an understanding of the value of bitcoin, you must understand that long-term storage brings great profits, as time will always prove.But yes, I agree that depriving yourself of everything you need in life is sometimes a mistake.  Again, if you have free capital that you don't need to spend now, why not invest in Bitcoin?",

Bitcoin is not your Goldsmith or some banks you build at home that you can control anytime you like.Targets, priorities, mindset.It all depends on the investor.

There are some investors who are buying Bitcoin for short-term profits. You don't get it because you are only focusing on one side. Quote from: Blisszi on February 19, 2023, 04:30:38 AMWhat's the secret that's different from taking profit?Is that long term bitcoin don't experience losses?Long-term depends on how many years is \"long-term\" for you.Long term might be 3 years and with that span of time, Bitcoin experienced losses after it going up so much. Bitcoin experienced losses over the long term, but looking at its price movement for the past 14 years, it goes up, it goes down to make a huge retracement and it will go up again even higher than it's previous high. Now to answer your question, my reason why I'm holding Bitcoin is for the future and I'm holding because of trust. Trust that it will up in the future then I will sell it as it reaches my target.",

When our future is over then Bitcoin as an asset that you use as a means of profit in real life will end for you.

What's the secret that's different from taking profit?Is that long term bitcoin don't experience losses?There are two types of people holding Bitcoin. The first type uses Bitcoin as a means of payment. The second type uses Bitcoin to reap huge profits when the price of Bitcoin reaches the latest ATH. Whether it will be a loss because of holding it for too long, my answer is no. Bitcoin will reach the latest ATH level and that is the basic motivation in holding Bitcoin because history has proven how Bitcoin travels.",

I don't get, why are you holding it for long? As long as am concerns is just a matter what you want, long term or short term.I guess you're looking at people who look at Bitcoin as investments. Ofc they wouldn't want to sell it when the price is low (or below their initial investment price), they'd simply end up at a loss with that. As an investor they'd always have a set goal or point where they'd naturally sell their coins to take profit, it could naturally take a long time if the price point they sell is higher than what it is currently right now. As for being a currency, well, Bitcoin is pretty much usable anywhere and no one can actually limit you to using it as one.  I don't think anyone would have a problem with having something like that at all times.",

Bitcoin is not your Goldsmith or some banks you build at home that you can control anytime you like.First of all everyone suggests you to invest in Bitcoin for long term. Because we have seen before that many people have made huge profits by investing in Bitcoin for the long term.  Maybe now you are buying some bitcoins but after some profit when you sell the bitcoins you might get small profit.  Everyone tells you to hold for long time to get more profit.Quote from: Blisszi on February 19, 2023, 04:30:38 AMMy questions is people keeping bitcoin for too long and begins to hear story? What's the secret that's different from taking profit?Is that long term bitcoin don't experience losses?Investing in Bitcoin does not mean that profits can be confirmed. Profit and loss are mainly invested with them.  However, the amount of profit that can be earned by investing in a short period of time can be several times more than that of holding for a long time. Yes maybe long time holding has not only the possibility of profit but also the possibility of loss. But if one can be patient then surely it is possible to recover that loss and earn much more profit.",

Bitcoin is simply a digital and decentralized currency which may be used for transactions but is also an asset wherein there is a tendency for a market price increase over years, problem only is market price volatility. Given that the market value is solely dependent with demand, it is not surprising that its value will change from time to time depending on events related on this technology or industry in general. But many investors are making a way to make use of this volatility and to generate profit so I guess there's no other reason.",
