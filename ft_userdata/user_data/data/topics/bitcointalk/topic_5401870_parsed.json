  "content": "Hello, today I want to talk to you about my DeFi venture and make a short introduction. The AGAM project. (https://agam.finance/)I am passionate about traditional finance and I was about to be a producer agent until I met DeFi. I see enormous potential in what it can contribute to personal and business finances, in a free and transparent way, where the user is in control, which is why I want to make this project a reality.I firmly believe that the traditional market is going to be linked more and more in this world that is advancing by leaps and bounds.The project's main idea is to offer investors a range of options depending on the degree of risk aversion and investment horizon. Making clear the different types of investments that exist.Most of the primary equipment belongs to countries with high degrees of inflation. We know its effects perfectly and we know what causes them.That is why the AGA native token (not yet launched on any network as of 06/08/2022) will be deflationary and there will be strategies to make it have a growing value over time and be reflected over time.The team comes with a different perspective, dedicated to creating foundations in each of the decentralized instruments that are going to be generated.With scarce resources and a lot of effort, we have been able to form a team to carry out the corresponding background development.We want to realize a successful IDO to create such investment instruments and bring the deflationary token to life.Thank you for coming this far and I look forward to your comments or emails.We are looking for VC investors who can help us in this stage.
