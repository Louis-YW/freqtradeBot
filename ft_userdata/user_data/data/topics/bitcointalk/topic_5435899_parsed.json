      "body": "The solution is simple. Update electrum to the latest version. Very old versions of electrum cannot sync. Warning:Download electrum only from its official website and do not forget to verify your download.Edit:Follow the suggestion given by LoyceV below before doing anything else. I don't know how the version 1.7 works. You can also check if it's possible to export your seed phrase. (Note that if you have imported any private key into your wallet, they are not backed up by your seed phrase.)",

So you managed to update windows os spyware to v11 but you use electrum wallet from stone age Â Why don't you first update with latest version of Electrum wallet and replacing exe file with one you have on your device?Using portable version is not recommnded for regular users, and it's better to use other available options or Electrum with Tails OS.Quote from: freds4408 on January 18, 2023, 01:26:27 PMThe worst is that i had misplaced my seeds and master keys i only have just the files backed up on my onedrive. I would be very happy if you can assist me sir. It's very important to never keep any sensitive files on cloud like onedrive aka someone else computer drive!Misplaced words can potentially be corrected if you have all of them written on paper.",
