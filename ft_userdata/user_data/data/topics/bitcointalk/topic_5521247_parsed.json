FUD won't last long because FUD is fabricated to make people panic, when market makers complete their manipulation plan, load up enough bitcoin, bull run comes and market makers are not stupid to fud in a bull run. They can do it but less regularly than in bear market, but fud in bull run causes market dips which are great opportunities to load more bitcoin, and get profit with a continuous bull run.Bitcoin is not dead but it was called as dead 450+ times.",

They never had any \"base\" back then either. Those spreading such FUDs didn't believe in it themselves either. It was also not always about \"going down to zero\", but generally about a big dump coming. The purpose of these FUDs were to try to cause panic sell among newbies so that their own buy orders at lower prices could be filled.In that sense we can still see similar FUD being spread where they try to make newbies believe that there is a drop coming and they should sell sooner. If they manage to convince enough people, there will be a small drop and their buy orders at low price will be filled before price goes above $100k.",

I thought this world can be good with true information from rich and well recognized people but this forum change my thinking as I saw many rich people wrong comments. The first person was Warren Buffett but which is an old man which we can still consider. But Peter Sheriff said bitcoin will go to $zero. Also with all his criticism, my thinking changed. Do not just believe in what people are saying. Make your own research because they can mislead you.",

Trump has only four years in the White House, and his legacy can be good or bad for Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will be lively long time after Trump resignation from the White House.If Trump does good things for Bitcoin market, it's good because Bitcoin will fly to the Moon sooner. If he won't be able to do it for Bitcoin, I have no worry, Bitcoin will crawl to the Moon, slower but it will be there. With Bitcoin, its Moonish target changed with time, $1, $10, $1,000 to now is $100,000 and magically $100,000 now is no longer considered as a Moonish price for Bitcoin.Moonish target price now becomes $200,000, $500,000 or $1M.",

Having FUD's isnt something new into this market on which there would really be tons of it and for those who dont have sufficient experience on this market will easily panic out whenever they do able to read it up, but for those who have been here on this market for a while then they are really that getting used into it. There are those people who turned out to make up some FUD but actually they are really that making up some accumulation into their stashes on which this is really that made up on silent.They do really just that making themselves look to be negative but actually considers out Bitcoin to be part of their investment for long term.For those people who had just simply make out some negative words and havent been able to make out investment and now seeing the price almost touched up $100k then that will really be bringing out that huge regret on their part and keeps thinking that they were wrong. Somehow its not really that still late to make out some investment in Bitcoin on which we arent that still on a bull run yet on which there's still time and space on where these investors will be placing themselves at least. The price might be high as of this moment and pretty sure that there are those who do waited up for some serious correction, but i dont see that it will really be making some major correciton soon as the price looks like trying out to break some all time high and creates a new one. No one really knows on what the future looks like but Bitcoin had proven out itself over the years. It would really be that up to you whether you will really be that making yourself that getting dragged with those FUD's and panic sold on which this action is really that regretable.",

Does anyone still listen to these people who say that Bitcoin is a Ponzi, Scam and its value is going to be zero in some days? I've been hearing that since 2016 and what I only see is that Bitcoin is setting new records and these people are missing the chance to change their lives for better forever by investing in Bitcoin and earning a good profit.I tell everyone, who thinks that Bitcoin will go to zero one day, to register their account on any exchange and start futures trading. If they are so confident that Bitcoin is a scam Ponzi scheme, they can open a short position on futures and make a decent profit while Bitcoin goes down to zero but in reality, they know that it's not going to happen but don't want to admit that they are wrong about Bitcoin.",

Surely those FUD will resurface again in the future when fear on the market was strong due to correction. We should admit that FUD is always part of Bitcoin cycle since it’s the weapon being used by those people that want to enter on lower price. We can’t guarantee either that there will be no negative news on Bitcoin that will happened so the chance of FUD is always high on a currency that display a strong price growth.But only sewer rats will believe that Bitcoin price will go back to zero.",
