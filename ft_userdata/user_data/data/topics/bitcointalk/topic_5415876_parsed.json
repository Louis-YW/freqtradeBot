Marketing is always essential with anything.That's going to be a risk that they are going to take, knowing that you need to market it and at the same time give payments to the bounty hunters. If they still have time and think it's worth investing, why not? If there are projects you think would be worth it, do so. Just don't expect too much at the start.",

Most of the time people will buy because of its cheap price and they will become confused once they realized the variety of choices out there available in the presales sections not only the price is important but the team behind it as well. That's why when you see a bounty that has already hired a bounty manager that is trusted and the coins reward already with the manager, you already fulfilled a 50% chance for that project to succeed and it only depends on the sales and trust of the investors if they will gonna buy more to make it push and developed to its roadmaps.",

Do you think the marketing is important to do as of now since the dip have gradually affected many people around the cryptospace.it is very difficult when a new project becomes successful while the bears are still going on. because all crypto is still experiencing irregular declines and like bitcoin is still sideways. because all coins still depend on bitcoin price and if BTC price is still sideway very difficult new project will be successful. you can but it's unlikely and won't last long.Quote from: MainIbem on October 04, 2022, 08:30:39 AMAnd what happened if they run the marketing at last didn't succeed, what would or might be the outcome of the bounty hunters? Does it mean they should stop joining bounty since the market is in dip or what could be your suggestion.bounty hunter is a kind of side job and always do it as long as you can still do bounty hunter work. unless you consider bounties as your main job. maybe when a situation like this you will immediately stop and look for a job in the real world that can earn more money. but if you have a main job and you are also a bounty hunter, just do it if you want. don't think about whether the project will be successful or not. if today is not successful or the token from the bounty payment has a low price just hold it until the bullish season arrives who knows in the future it will have a very high price (if the project owner wants to develop the project)Quote from: MainIbem on October 04, 2022, 08:30:39 AMI don't mostly pay attention those bounty's that are paying with their token and i don't join any manager who is not trusted and reliable, so i only select those bounty's paid in Busd, Usdt.if you're just looking for a bounty that pays in BUSD or USDT it's probably very rare and it's likely that it will be full soon.but what you are doing looks good following a bounty that pays in USD. because from there we can see that the project is willing to spend money for the development of the project",

Hard work in terms of diligently doing your assessment with regard to the potential of the project.Some new projects are worth taking a look if they do have valuable mission and vision and if they are really serious in implementing their objectives.In such case, it means, you should not follow where the hype is but ask yourself vital questions like if they can survive in this market?Because if they do have sincere intentions, they will accomplish the items on their roadmap and see to it that they are providing valuable services to the community.So the answer is yes, as long as this new project has authentic mission to implement their goals for this project. But you need to be updated with their progress.",

Do you think the marketing is important to do as of now since the dip have gradually affected many people around the cryptospace.Marketing is a way to introduce their products and services which I believe this is very effective in all businesses. Good market strategy usually gains a lot of returns and business profit but a long with this, the company/project developer must also be true to what they been spread during their marketing otherwise, instead of gaining more investors this will make them leave. And this is certainly a helping tool especially during this bear season but of course, as an investor, we don't rely on it but have to check the background of a particular in order to have assurance than regrets later.",

Still that does not mean that there are no new promising projects in development that are worth an investment. I personally like Magicsquare for example. It's a web3 crypto app store that will probably has its TGE in the Q1 2023, but has already received funding from BinanceLabs, Kucoin, Huobi and many more. So once this token is listed i will try to get a few of them.Regarding Bounties; it is definitely true that 95% of those altcoin bounties that are paying in their native token are not worth the effort. Some of them are dead before the bounty is even finished, some of them are paying out the rewards but the rewards are just worth nothing. That does not mean though that all altcoin bounties are dead.I participated in the bountie of Radix 2 years ago or so and i think the payment even with the current prices of radix was better than with a BTC or USDT paying bounty.",
