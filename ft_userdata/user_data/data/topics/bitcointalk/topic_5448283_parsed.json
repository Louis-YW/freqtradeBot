How the lives of a people, the civilization hoped to attain and attained is been determined by a game, q game where all fowl play can be summed up as corruption and nothing could be done about it most times especially when it is by the ruling party.It's always up to the people to revolt and disagree to be subjugated by the games played by these politicians but, after several attempts without success, you see the masses hands getting weak and no one wants to put themselves in the line.It becomes a patient thing, to wait for the next tenor which might come in 8years as somehow, the ruling party often gets re-elected through the very first means that they got into office.Power corrupts.",

I think some people become so disappointed and apolitical towards their local government and seek for alternatives in movements which embrace anarchy as fundamental value. Which can be dangerous, depending on the context of the nation.There are good and bad politicians and itself, I find politics is a necessary evil for the society to function, because unfortunately, humankind is not perfect and since the beginning of civilization governance was necessary, to the point a great part of religion back then was to enforce order.",

Political offices in my country are too lucrative. These politicians allocate high pay and financial benefits for themselves and family without considering the meager revenue the government is getting from trade. Our legislatures are one of the highest paid in the world while our nation is among the nation that has the poorest and uneducated population globally. Until our governors, lawmakers and other political appointees earn what others get, there will always be desperation to grab power which will lead to bloodshed, corruption, and electoral malpractice. The people who contributed to the rigging of the election in my country are just looking for juicy positions that will allow them to loot the country's resources. Politics have become a full-time job for many people because it is now the easiest means of acquiring illegal wealth. But one day the river will overflow and they will have nowhere to run to and then the hunters will become the hunted because we cannot be enslaved by a few rogues forever.",

He was right, if you look at it from Africa view of politics. The masses kill and fight each other to show loyalty and to get their leaders into power. But the leaders are few enjoying the resources and fail to deliver the promises they had with the people. It's a total madness in Africa, the citizens keeping malice with each other because of a political parties. Party A will not talk to party B. They made political system like a secret society. In Africa party system that ought to be an interest group had turned to be a blood shed groups. We, the citizens must learn and observe how political system works in our continent and practice it well.",

So, basically, you will do great in politics if you tell people that they are actually not sheep, while actually treating them like sheep of the dumbest kind.Glad to read you can eat salmon...

Influence and money really makes several politicians want to sit on the highest position they can get and never let go of it. While there are others that are truly concerned for the people, they don't get to high positions that much since they would have to disregard some of their morals just to get some sponsors on their political campaigns even if it means getting it through illegal means or from syndicates or high profile criminals. It may sound like something out of a movie but it really does happen in real life. It's just sad to think that the very few politicians that have good intentions for the people either aren't given the opportunity to really serve the people or get corrupted by the environment they compete and become the same as the people that they used to really hate. sigh...",

These puppet masters encourage the masses to come out and vote assuring them of the freedom to choose their leaders. But the Electoral Commission are their appointees which will make it very easy to manipulate the elections. Elections in my country are mere formalities because the puppet masters already know who they want to give power to. I have stopped voting for any political party or candidate because it is just a waste of time and energy. This is because the freedom to vote and be voted for is mortally wounded in my country.",
