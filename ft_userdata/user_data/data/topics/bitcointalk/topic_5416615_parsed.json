Out of 100 ip 6-8 ips give out 401 and the rest are not working at allWait, why are you trying to connect to 100 IP addresses? Did you get IP addresses of random Bitcoin nodes and try to query them? That doesn't work. Especially since they most likely do not expose their RPC interface to the internet. That would be highly insecure.Do you even have your own Bitcoin node?",

It's just basic bitcoin security and security in general.-DaveCan you link to documentation and examples?Take a look at: https://riptutorial.com/bitcoin/example/26000/node-configuration that more or less gives all the options that are available in the conf file.You also have this file generator: https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/ I have not used it so I can't comment on how accurate it is, but I know people who have used it that say it does generate valid files.Keep in mind when running this against your own node that it does have to be fully synced for some things. I know some (most?) commands will not work until your node has finished the IBD and if you re-start it until it finishes whatever housekeeping it has to do at startup.What are you trying to do anyway?-Dave",
