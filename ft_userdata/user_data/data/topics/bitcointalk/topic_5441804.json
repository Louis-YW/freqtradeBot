  "content": "Regarding Poolin, I try to provide accurate and reliable information as much as possible to help all creditors get back their own funds.Since a lot of my information is pieced together, I cannot guarantee that all the information is reliable.When blockin wallet was in the bull market, its asset size was close to 300 million US dollars. As a loyal fan of Bitcoin, the boss, Kevin, always felt that this round of bull market would reach 100,000 US dollars.He felt a little bored because of the policy of clearing mining machines in mainland China: \"I have so many users' money in my hand, and China won't allow mining, so I will go to the United States! I bet that Bitcoin will rise to $100,000 in the future market.\"Then began the road to bankruptcy of Poolin. He kept overdrafting the money in his wallet. First, he used the user's usdt first, and then mortgaged the user's funds to AntAlpha under Bitmain.Note: Up to now, the scale of misappropriated assets is about 8000btc, 35000eth, 30000000usdt and more ltc/zec/doge! ! !Their road to the Great Leap Forward was in a hurry. They acquired land in the United States, opened mines, transported machines, lost machines, committed crimes by executives, chaotic maintenance, and low online rates. The management in the whole process is quite chaotic, the consumption is extravagant, and there are even rape crimes. These contents have been exposed by others before, so if you are interested, go search. But these are not important to Kevin, because he feels that he has gained a foothold in the United States.In the process, the price of Bitcoin kept falling, 50,000, 40,000, 30,000, 20,000. In order not to liquidate the position, he kept increasing the collateral, and finally mortgaged all the funds of the user in the wallet. At a price of around 15,000, the position was closed. Regarding the reason for closing positions, some people say that they were liquidated by AntAlpha. Some people also said that it was because Kevin was afraid that he would lose everything if he liquidated his position, so he voluntarily closed his position, with a balance of tens of millions, which was used to buy back assets at a lower price later (the money cannot be withdrawn!). But after he sold it, the price began to rebound, and he has not been able to buy back the asset until now. Now the price of btc is 23,000, which means that it has lost another 50% increase.So the ending is doomed, Poolin has been unable to repay users' assets. :1. If the price goes up, the assets sold can never be bought back.2. If the price remains unchanged, it is expected to pay off the arrears in 30 years (provided that the price, difficulty, and computing power do not increase)3. If the price falls, the mined BTC will not be able to pay the electricity bill, the machine will depreciate, and the mine will depreciate.In any case, the debt cannot be repaid.Do you still remember that the mining pool changed the pplns settlement mode halfway? Because there is no money to deal with the loss of lucky value of fpps. So why change back to fpps now? Because their bottom layer has been distributed to other mining pools.In short, as an investment activity, two to three hundred million dollars has been invested in the project, let's see what the results are:* $300 million in liabilities* Liquidation of user assets: 8000btc, 35000eth, 30000000usdt, it is said that there are tens of thousands of ltc and zec, and tens of millions of doge* The user's IOU scale is basically this number, so your funds have been embezzled and sold. Unexpectedly, the big bulls turned into big short sellers.* After encountering a liquidity crisis, another boss did not want to take risks and chose to leave. After the core development of the wallet was completed and the IOU was issued, he also worried about the risks and chose to leave. Now the currency printing wallet has not been developed for a long time, just to delay the time.* It is estimated that the remaining money will allow them to live for half a year.* For a period of one year, there was no standardized report, and it was impossible to analyze the proportion of electricity bills, and it has been losing money.* No one cares about the maintenance situation. If the machine is broken, it will be given to the maintenance team. No one cares about how much it is repaired every day and how long it will take.* At present, the output is 3~4btc a day, excluding costs (electricity, labor), the net profit may be 1btc. Such a profit situation, pay off the arrears after 30 years?* The entire currency printing cash flow is extremely unhealthy and may go bankrupt at any time, but the relevant assets are already in other entities, right? So if it goes bankrupt, it is the customer who is injured.* Kevin initially stood up and told everyone that the user's assets are safe, the net assets are positive, and it is only a liquidity crisis. Now he dare not come out and say that. Even, it is impossible for him to show up, because he is afraid that you will find him. It is said that he does not turn on the camera for meetings with insiders now.Although a lot has been said above, it cannot describe the decline of this once world's number one mining pool. Say two gossips:* Her wife and daughter have gone abroad* It is said that domestic assets have been sold* He bought a house and a car in America* The female secretary who has been following him has nothing at first, and now she also bought a car and a house in the United States. Is the salary very high? Or is there a special gift?Say something really useful, I hope it can help you get your assets back, and don't let the bad guys who misappropriated assets go unpunished.* Poolin initially had a main body in China, but in order to avoid risks, the main body of the wallet was separated first, and then registered in Singapore?* Whether you are Chinese, Singaporean, or American, your money is stored in your wallet, and you can still log in to your wallet now. Please take screenshots of relevant evidence as soon as possible.* The underlying service of the wallet is mixin, so they cannot destroy the transfer records of funds, and the entire criminal facts are clear.* I don't know the law, I reckon only Americans/Singaporeans can do him harm at the moment.* Kevin is now in the United States, and 95% of his assets are also in the United States (sites, mining machines). He may not dare to return to his country, and he may be inspected after returning home.* One of the two mining site is called pyote and the other is called tarbush. Maybe Texas? Delaware?* If you can directly find their mining site, then congratulations, you can directly ask for the funds back, or discuss moving the machine away. He is afraid of you going to him.* For unknown reasons, they are preparing to call the police. After they expose the legal subject and financial situation, they may be able to form a chain of evidence, and they can in turn prosecute his subject* hashingnow is actually a product of Poolin Smiley* It is said that they now have a large customers debt solution plan, and make a separate plan for large customers. The specific plan is unknown, and it should be to transfer the risk to a third party. As for the retail investors, he didn't ignore you on purpose, there is really no way to solve it. So if you are in the United States, report the crime and find their mining site.* If I have more news, I will update again.-----关于币印，我尽量提供准确可靠的信息，帮助所有债权人找回自己的资金。由于我的很多信息都是拼凑的，我不能保证所有的信息都是可靠的。区块链钱包牛市时，其资产规模接近3亿美元。 作为比特币的忠实粉丝，老板凯文一直觉得这一轮牛市会达到10万美元。他对中国大陆的清矿机政策感到有些无聊：“我手里拿着那么多用户的钱，中国不让挖，我就去美国！我赌比特币 未来市场将涨至10万美元。”从此开始了币印的破产之路。 他不停地透支钱包里的钱。 首先，他先动用了用户的usdt，然后将用户的资金抵押给了比特大陆旗下的AntAlpha。注：截至目前，被挪用资产规模约为8000btc、35000eth、30000000usdt和更多的ltc/zec/doge！ ！ ！他们的大跃进之路是仓促的。 他们在美国征地，开矿山，运机器，丢机器，高管犯罪，维修混乱，上线率低。 全程管理混乱，消费大手大脚，甚至有强奸罪。 这些内容之前别人都曝光过，有兴趣的可以去搜一下。 不过这些对凯文来说并不重要，因为他觉得自己在美国站稳了脚跟。在这个过程中，比特币的价格不断下跌，5万、4万、3万、2万。 为了不爆仓，他不断增加抵押品，最终抵押了用户钱包中的所有资金。 在15000左右的价格平仓。 关于平仓的原因，有人说是被AntAlpha强平了。 也有人说，是因为凯文怕自己爆仓会血本无归，所以才主动平仓，手头有几千万的余额，用来以后以较低的价格回购资产（ 钱不能取出来！）。 但他卖掉后，价格开始反弹，一直到现在都没能买回资产。 现在btc的价格是23000，也就是说又损失了50%的涨幅。所以结局已经注定，币印币已经无力偿还用户的资产。 :1. 如果价格上涨，卖出的资产将永远无法回购。2.如果价格不变，预计30年内还清欠款（前提是价格、难度、算力不增加）3、如果价格下跌，挖出来的BTC交不起电费，机器贬值，矿场贬值。无论如何，这笔债是无法偿还的。还记得矿池中途改变了pplns结算方式吗？ 因为没有钱去处理fpps幸运值的损失。 那么为什么现在改回 fpps 呢？ 因为他们的底层已经分发给其他矿池了。总之，作为一个投资活动，这个项目已经投入了两三亿美元，看看结果如何：* 3亿美元的负债* 清算用户资产：8000btc、35000eth、30000000usdt，据说还有几万个ltc和zec，以及几千万doge* 用户的欠条规模基本就是这个数字，所以你的资金已经被挪用和变卖了。 出乎意料的是，大牛变成了大空头。* 遇到流动性危机后，另一位老板不愿冒险选择离开。 在钱包核心开发完成，借条开具后，他也担心风险，选择了离开。 现在印币钱包已经很久没有开发了，只是为了拖延时间。* 估计剩下的钱可以让他们多活半年。* 有一年时间，没有标准化报表，无法分析电费占比，一直亏损。* 无人关心维修情况。 如果机器坏了，它会交给维修队。 没有人关心它每天修复多少，需要多长时间。* 目前每天产出3~4btc，扣除成本（电费，人工），净利润可能为1btc。 这样的盈利情况，30年后还清欠款？* 整个印币现金流极不健康，随时可能倒闭，但相关资产已经在其他实体了对吧？ 所以如果它破产了，受伤的是客户。* Kevin最初站出来告诉大家，用户的资产是安全的，净资产是正的，只是流动性危机。 现在他不敢出来说了。 甚至，他不可能现身，因为他怕你发现他。 据说，他现在会见知情人是不开摄像头的。上面虽然说了很多，但无法形容这个曾经的世界第一矿池的没落。 说两句八卦：* 她的妻子和女儿都出国了* 据说已出售国内资产* 他在美国买了房和车* 一直跟着他的女秘书，本来什么都没有，现在还在美国买了车买房。 工资很高吗？ 或者有什么特别的礼物？说点真正有用的，希望能帮助大家把资产追回来，不要让挪用资产的坏人逍遥法外。* 币印最初在中国有主体，但为了规避风险，先把钱包主体分开，然后在新加坡注册？* 无论您是中国人、新加坡人还是美国人，您的钱都存放在您的钱包里，您现在仍然可以登录您的钱包。 请尽快对相关证据进行截图。* 钱包底层服务为mixin，无法销毁资金转账记录，整个犯罪事实清清楚楚。* 我不知道法律，我估计目前只有美国人/新加坡人可以伤害他。* Kevin现在在美国，他95%的资产也在美国（场地、矿机）。 他可能不敢回国，回国后可能会受到检查。* 两个矿山之一称为 pyote，另一个称为 tarbush。 也许得克萨斯州？ 特拉华州？* 如果你能直接找到他们的矿场，那么恭喜你，你可以直接要回资金，或者讨论把机器搬走。 他怕你去找他。* 由于不明原因，他们正准备报警。等他们暴露了法律主体和资金情况之后，可能能形成证据链，就能反过来起诉他的主体了* hashingnow其实是币印的产物Smiley* 据说他们现在有一个大户的债务解决方案，针对大户单独做一个方案。 具体方案未知，应该是将风险转移给第三方。 至于散户，他又不是故意不理你的，实在是没办法解决。 因此，如果您在美国，请报告犯罪并找到他们的采矿地点。* 如果我有更多消息，我会再次更新。https://i.ibb.co/0c5ZY7t/tool.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/xqGnq60/tool-1.jpg",
