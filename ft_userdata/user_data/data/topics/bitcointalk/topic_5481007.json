But famous says Everything has it time when it comes to your life. Today i can say proudly i Own amount in Btc when it is going to make it new All time High very soon inshaAllah. Happy Birthday Day Bitcoin",

He has made many people happy 15 years is not 15 days . Respect should be given to who its due. The Most important thing that has happened to me this year is knowing about bitcoin. Sometimes I wished I stated earlier when Bitcoin mining started. but even If I was aware about it, I don think if I would have afford the mining tools because mining tools are very expensive.",

All these sorts of celebrations really remind us of how far bitcoins have come and the rich history it has. Remembrance of these sort of celebrations is encouraging to newbies who are new to bitcoins. Thank you for reminding us of and informing those who are unaware of this date to take note of. I do not think this date will be remembered by people who are investors in bitcoins but not members of this forum. As a benefit of being in this forum we are made aware of these sorts of dates.",

Honestly, I should join you in this celebration of a technology that's like a blessing to the world. I'm still looking back in history till today, if I could come across one, single technology that was invented selflessly to liberate the world from the autocratic system of leadership we have in the world, where just a few people within the systems that try to control all the affairs of the world including the financial system. It doesn't make sense to think over how our leaders remain selfish in their judgements thereby caring less of what it makes of their followers.Thank you bigly to the great inventor of all time, Satoshi Nakomoto who brought about the existence of the Bitcoin and by extension the cryptocurrencies to become another alternative to the fiat currency that's solely controlled by governments. Happy birthday guys!",

Thanks for bringing this to our notice, and I also saw a news that says the Genesis Block of Bitcoin was created with a huge amount of Bitcoin last week and I believed all those ones were to celebrate the anniversary. Really it is an event that needs to be celebrated. If it is possible there be like some kind of quiz or debate on how we know about the dates of Bitcoin history and it events. Really Bitcoin is a liberty to man kind. What the National Governments can't do for the citizens for years past but Bitcoin did it within the 15th years frame. And it becomes a savior to mankind and with that I also join you The Cryptovator to celebrate the creator of Bitcoin and also Salute üôã with the maximum salute.",
