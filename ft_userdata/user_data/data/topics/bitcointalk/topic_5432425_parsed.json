I think it's too expensive myself but it's also worth asking how much people would be willing to pay to have a payments card that is anonymous and not connected to their real name and identity? If everything is legit and works as advertised, of course. The other service offered AlexPCS costs even more, but he has still sold several packages, meaning there is a market for that sort of thing.",

I have answered your question more than clear i this topic: shorturl.at/mxELN Your question had also absolute nothing to do with the service we provide. And this is what your private message state, as you refer to it. Nothing of significant. If you gave us time, we would have responded to your request to test our cards for free.But unfortunately, you just post random stuff and giving a neutral (negative) feedback because you expect different answers. It's unfortunate, because if I go true your comments on this platform, I see that you do that a lot. 90% of your comments have absolutely no value to bring this forum up, and I believe because of users like you that this forum is going downhill. Because slightest things can trigger you asking the same and same questions 100 times and making your own unfounded opinion that something is not good, untrustworthy or simple not possible without doing any research at first. This is the same reason why companies also don't see this forum fit to advertise, because of your continued negative attacks on anything people post.It is absolute good to question tings, but when you personally are not satisfied with the answer giving, you keep ranting random things. I'ts unfortunate because 90% of the users here are great, giving good options or questions and do research before commenting 100 times on a topic. Your personal message.\"Hi.Do you know when Bitcoin and Litecoin willl be added onCoinPayCard.net website?I am interested in testing when this happens.Cheers.\"",

That's something CoinPayCard.net can answer you.  Absolutely right, so we issue cards directly from the bank issuers. No other 3rd parties are involved that would make our program sketchy and a risk to use. There are some providers for example get a Stripe issuing account and issue cards. These cards are first issue in their business name, and then they forward the cards details to the user.We don't work that way, all our cards are instantly issued to the end user. So in the backend of the bank and the card issuer, they would see the name that the user, not ours. This makes us not liable for any cards we issue because we are not the cardholder, the user is. It also gives control back to the users, because the funds on the card belongs to the end user and not us.",

      "body": "Regarding the service offered by AlexPCS, I recall posting in his thread a long time ago and I had serious doubts. Subsequently, some members have vouched for him after using the service and to my knowledge no scam accusations have been made against him therefore his service is considered by some as genuine and trustworthy because packages were purchased and feedback was left.As far as CoinPayCard is concerned, here are some initial observations which I am happy to revise if I have them wrong:Cons* As this is a virtual VISA card money cannot be withdrawn from ATMs* Card load fees at 4% + $1.50 means $10 load will give $8.10 to spend* $249 annual fee for $5000 monthly spend limit* $499 annual fee for $10000 monthly spend limit* At present only USDT is accepted method of payment* Website sign-up page uses reCaptcha (from Google) rather than Hcaptcha or simple bot checker that does not harvest data* Website terms and conditions do not state who is behind the project and who an end user can take to Court in the event there is an attempt at litigation. Ideally it would have been a company or incorporationPros* Customers can register a card in any name* No KYC required before or after registration* Only email address is required to register* Customers are issued a card number instantly via your website* Customers are issued VISA cards* Customers can add their card numbers to Apple/Android phones to use to make offline payments* Card load fees at 4% + $1.50 means $100 load will give $94.50 to spend* $99 annual fee for $2.000 monthly spend limit (probably just about acceptable for anonymous cards)* Direct dealing with issuing bank, no third party intermediaries are involved* Promise to make a full refund if cards are blockedSuggestions* Reduce the $99 annual fee to around $49 at least for an introductory period* Reduce the 4% + $1.50 card load fee to 2.75% + $0.99 for an introductory periodI have always cited not having ownership details and appropriate terms and conditions as a sign of major concern and this as a negative in many ANN threads because it has potential to give scope for exit scams but several members expressed views saying it was alright for project owners to remain anonymous. Many or most signature campaign participants are promoting businesses that have anonymous owners therefore it is something that has become acceptable as the norm.Keeping all I have mentioned in mind, I am confident enough to want to test the service soon. I will provide more comments, suggestions and ask some questions after further analysis in the coming days and look forward to reading comments from you and other members too.

      "body": "You raise a valid concern about KYC and I look forward to reading what CoinPayCard say about it as well as my comments here but going by what they have said their customers will not be asked for KYC. I would assume these would work anywhere online and in-person via Apple/Android phones because they are VISA cards but CoinPayCard should address this too.They also stated if customers had cards blocked they would refund them. As you said, having no KYC requirements means customers can register using any name they pluck out of thin air and if that eventually leads to a blocking of the card by virtue of not providing KYC then it should also cover the refund promise made by CoinPayCard.@CoinPayCard please let us know what happens if a card is blocked. I am aware you stated it will be highly unlikely cards will be blocked but in that scenario will you refund the same amount in the same crypto (as it was sent as a load) to a customer wallet or will you replace the blocked card with a new VISA number and transfer the balance of the blocked card on to it?Up to this point after some basic research, I like the project and think it has potential. Not having to give your real world home or business address in order to receive a physical card has always been something many people would be avoiding as well as giving their KYC to companies who could theoretically be hacked and KYC stolen or even sold by unscrupulous businesses if exit scamming. These concerns do not apply to CoinPayCard so these are positives for me. Apart from the higher end pricing structure and just a few unanswered questions and required clarity on some answers given, I like the concept behind the project.Quote from: Pmalek on January 01, 2023, 08:38:25 AMQuote from: CoinPayCard.net on December 31, 2022, 08:51:01 PMWe don't work that way, all our cards are instantly issued to the end user.
