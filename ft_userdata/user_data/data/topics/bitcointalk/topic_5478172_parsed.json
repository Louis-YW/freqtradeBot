We all know that during bull run alts get pumped too, so ordinals would likely skyrocket together with Bitcoin and speculators will be able to afford higher fees.Bitcoin's main use case is investment and speculative trading and the fees are a result of that - those who make trades with thousands of dollars in profits can easily afford to pay $40 fees.",

Now, it is about 400 satoshi/vbyte.https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weightI care more about the fee and fee rate in BTC, satoshi when I move my bitcoins.

Even if the total cost is greater than the amount sent the solution is for me personally to wait. Because this is a bullrun phase where speculators are very aggressive in the market and we cannot control that. OOT, I even received news from a friend who attended the Taipei Blockchain event where one of the developers had plans to build a large project on Bitcoin Layer 1 and this project has now received massive support from Bitcoin maximalists. I was quite surprised because this will also result in even higher transaction costs in the future.",

We also know that a considerable percentage of these newbies tend to go to the shitcoin market and start buying shitcoins for the first time not knowing what kind of garbage they are wasting their money on.This means that this time these newbies would also go to this new but fake market called Ordinals Market and try to pay for that garbage hence making the scam spam attack even worse and shoot the fees even higher.As I've said many times before the severity of this attack is only increasing with time and possibly with price rise.",

Maybe if you send huge amounts of Bitcoin then you don't care about the fees, but for the average investors who are using the DCA strategy, it's kind of nonsense to do it because of what's happening. The only option that I see is to use another altcoin, send it to an exchange, convert it into Bitcoin then STORE it there. That's if you want to risk your assets.I wonder how the signature campaigns that are paying their participants through Bitcoin will react to this one. Nevertheless, this ordinal thing causes trouble to us average investors. TBH, I might opt to invest in other top altcoins then will just convert it into Bitcoin once transaction fees go back to normal.P.S. It's already at $34 per transaction.  It's just a bit surprising that there are still many people who are still transferring their Bitcoins despite it's high fees.",

I think it's obvious already that these inscriptions are just a pain in the ass for many of us that's using bitcoin to do some sort of transactions because the tx fees that we could've used for other stuff, we have to spend it on tx fees. The reason that these ordinal shit is still existing is that the miners will be the one that's affected because this is a gold mine for them, the higher the tx fees, the bigger they're getting out of this so unless they don't mind the developers putting a stop to this ordinals, we won't see any changes anytime soon.",

Given that we have more and more ordinal nonsense on the blockchain, it seems that we are heading towards a situation where on-chain transactions will become so expensive that most people will not want to pay for them.
