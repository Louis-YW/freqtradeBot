Let us get into that topic: We are not even aware of that FAQ article and this was preliminary where FNT was planned to be handled credit/discount token to the initial Global Unit Pay (GUP) system. We already forwarded that FAQ to get it deleted, since the information is outdated.Also to clarify the standpoints: FNT is not the child company of Evorich. FNT basically just used that marketplace for the presale and didn’t have any further commitments or relationships to it. You can see FNT as a B2C extension of GUP, where GUP was till now a payment gateway and OTC desk in the B2B sector, FNT mainly aims at B2C with further licensing in Swiss.Related to the relation of GUP, which is just a payment/prepaid provider for many B2B companies, where Evorich is one of them. GUP is still fully compliant with its asset management and services through every regulation in Switzerland.",

FNT basically just used that marketplace for the presale and didn’t have any further commitments or relationships to it. [...]Ahh, I see. So it's just a misunderstanding of an outdated info and you have relationship at any degree with Evorich. Was the outdated info also covers the relationship with Ms. Serdjukova? I see that she's your CMO, as well as a very well-accomplished marketer on Evorich.If I may get ahead of myself, the specific curiosity of evorich and you is due to me being stumbled upon these articles during the preliminary DDEvorich scam: https://behindmlm.com/mlm-reviews/evorich-review-skyway-capital-ponzi-spinoff-bumbles-along/The exit scam: https://behindmlm.com/companies/skyway/evorich-investors-being-funneled-into-fnt-exit-scam/",

Having this thread opened and thus marked as read, it disappeared from my \"new replies\" page and I completely forgot about you. The lack of your update on this thread for the entire week, though, I find it quite disturbing for a project with a huge ambition.As for the truth behind the article, I can not read Cyrillic, but judging from other sites written in English, I would say the accusation itself is not baseless? The image where the article attached a proof of, it can be traced down to other articles and videos. Like this one  in Cyrillic? Was it baseless and your strategic cooperation with them is still good? Or was it your security and marketing team failed to take a deep DD that you saw your cooperation with them is/was a good idea? Or was it simply because the claim of the article is true, that you're actually related to Evorich, thus employing Ms. Serdjukova?",

In general judging the activity (here) based on the stage where we are right now and what we focusing on + the time of the year shouldn’t „neutrally“ be seen as disturbing. As mentioned, we discuss further steps internally based on your feedback, again we believe in our product and the extension of our already existing b2b arm.",

Having some licenses in place through GUP is beneficial, but it is not enough on its own.FNT will not rely on GUP's infrastructure, as it is being developed primarily from scratch, which includes the integration of our native token. However, certain elements of GUP's infrastructure may be utilized. Despite the different databases, GUP's current clients will definitely use the extensive services of FNT",
