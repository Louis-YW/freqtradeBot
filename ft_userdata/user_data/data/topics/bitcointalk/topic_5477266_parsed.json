Investors gain profits from Bitcoin because they worked for it, they had patience with the up and down of the market,  This is not an easy work that anybody with no understanding can achieve from bitcoin. Well you are right because no investor wants to lose though they do lose at times but in anything one is doing in life you need to be positive regardless of obstacles that might come along the line you need to remain focused and determined before you can attain great results. One of the things that's taking some persons that would have made a headway is impatient, like you can't be able to take your eyes off your investment for a long time before you start reaping the dividends that comes along with it.Bitcoin investment requires a long interval of time before you can see the proceeds of your investment so I see nothing bad if someone buys Bitcoin and feel so relaxed about it. Okay let's take for instance someone who bought Bitcoin when the price was still $27,000 and is watching his investment growing gradually now ain't you gonna be happy and excited?Our major challenge in this life is fear, like you begin to feel that what if you invest and lose at the end so the fear of failure has been taking so many persons backward. The only advice that should be given to an investor is not to invest all his income because if things doesn't really go the way they expected they might run into emotional trauma.Bitcoin investment is far from being a ponzi scheme because when you invest in Bitcoin you will see how the market is going and know when you're making profits or incurring losses unlike ponzi schemes that is very fraudulent because what they basically do in a ponzi scheme is just to rotate people's investment and after which they've witnessed a large number of investors the system eventually crashes.",

It would have ended just like other ponzi schemes that placed over the years.  Bitcoin as a ponzu scheme wouldn’t have lasted till date. Based on how bitcoin technology was built, it will not have a taste of being a Ponzi scheme or something similar to it. Most people that see it as a get rich quick scheme are not enlightened well about it and they just get some bitcoin and have it in mind that they are already rich. Time tells when they don’t get what they want and they exit the market with regrets and hatred for bitcoin since they didn’t get what they expected in the end.

When it comes too easy then it isn’t worth it to make you rich for a long time to come. A lot of successful people pass through a lot of hardwork and patience before they reached where they are today. Nothing is free and no one guarantees you that you’ll become rich overnight no matter how simple it looks. Becoming rich in bitcoin requires patience and hardwork, it is better for you to have that mindset so that you don’t end up being disappointed when you don’t achieve what you wanted.",

QuoteThe way some people think about bitcoin they feel too comfortable and so relax as if life is so easy like money can be achieved with no form of workOp, after investing in Bitcoin you don't need any work to be done on your Bitcoin investment. What you just need to do is to hold your Bitcoin for a long term like 4-10 years depending on your plan in your Bitcoin investment. What you need most is to have a source of income that will solve your financial challenges so that you will not have to depend on selling your Bitcoin even when you are at a loss to solve your problems.",

Because of the loss, some people do not want to invest at all but later not happy if the price of bitcoin has gone up.Beginners believe bitcoin can make them reach because the price has always been going up in long term. As the marketcap is increasing, the price may not increase as it was before, but the price is still going higher in long term. It is not a wrong believe if they can research and learn when to invest and when not to invest.If someone still invest in bitcoin in time like this, it is good because next year is halving and we are expected all-time-high.",

And I think the cause of that is misinformation.I think if information about a business plan is been introduced,  there is need for proper research before venturing into it. Quote from: Y3shot on December 10, 2023, 07:11:17 AMThe way some people think about bitcoin they feel too comfortable and so relax as if life is so easy like money can be achieved with no form of work. Investors gain profits from Bitcoin because they worked for it, they had patience with the up and down of the market,  This is not an easy work that anybody with no understanding can achieve from bitcoin. Success is not achieved on a platter of gold. There is a tendency to work smart to aquire success. The problem most newbies face, is by expecting quick gain from investment, becoause they feel like people who are bitcoin investors are super rich. And probably anybody who adventure into Bitcoin will be as rich as the old investors no mater the time of entry. Why some feel that they have been so patient and looking for way to succeed in life. And any slighted opportunity they get to imvest, they feel the need to also make quick money. not knowing that it took the old investors time, consistency, resilience, hardwork and other factors before they could achieve what they achieved. So what they need to understand is as follows:1) time factor and understanding the scope of any investment plan given to them. Before adventuring.2) don't invest with emotion or mindset of to get Rich quick with bitcoin investment.3) be self decisive and self moderated by encourage yourself on long time holding because it's the only way to achieve bitcoin success.4) don't be too quick to conclude about fast success on bitcoin.",

If an individual actually has or learns about Bitcoin from the right source, they will never have the idea that Bitcoin will make them rich.In fact, investment in Bitcoin can only generate profit depending on the amount invested. For example, if someone invests $2000 in Bitcoin and another person invests $30k in Bitcoin, their level of profit will be greatly different, and the person who only invested $2k should not expect to make more profit than the person who invested $30k.In essence, what I'm saying is that not everyone who invests in Bitcoin will be able to generate a very significant profit.

And secondly why we can blame them is that these people tend or fail to do what most anxious person or curious people should do which is to actually make research on the news that they have heard and tend to believe in their fantasy of getting rich by just acquiring Bitcoin without even knowing or researching and if only they did, they would know that acquiring Bitcoin doesn't guarantee one to be rich as gone are those days of the early person that bought Bitcoin when the price was very low.For now if anyone wants to actually get some profits in buying Bitcoin they would need to strategise and make good use of the price advantage and hold their holdings so that they can get some profits and this method also requires lots of discipline because if you are also not discipline you might end up selling your coins at the wrong time.",
