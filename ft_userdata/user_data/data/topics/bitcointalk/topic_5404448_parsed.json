  "content": "Hello ! First time posting in this forum, so nice to meet you everyone  I have a little issue, and I need some help please. I used to mine FLUX (ZelCash) with my 1060 6gb at 23 Sol/s. Yesterday I finally bought a Founder's Edition 3070 so that I can mine (and game) with it. My Afterburner settings are 80% Power, -502 Clock, +1107 Memory.However I cannot reach 60 Sol/s (or MH/s) like all 3070 owners with these settings ! Best I can reach is 49,5 Sol/s, using 186W.I tried setting the Core clock to 0, and it suddenly went up again to 60 Sol/s at 186W. But isn't that bad for the GPU's life and the power usage ? It doesn't feel right.I'm using the latest nvidia game-ready drivers (should I?), miniZ, on windows 10. What am I doing wrong ? (Thanks for reading my post by the way.)",

I am a bit confused.I've seen many users sharing their afterburner settings with very low core clock (-500MHz) and very high memory clock (+1000MHz), getting about 60mh/s. Yet the issue is that my hashrate drops significantly when decreasing the core clock.",
