  "content": "The reason why I added \"fund will drive\" is because Bernstein thinks that ETF has made things very easy for the investors. With the giant backings like blackRock and Ark 21Shares bitcoin ETF applications we have upper hand in thinking that Bitcoin is really gonna get safe place for the trading environment. This will also attract the customers who are always afraid  of the pure decentralization but always wanted to posses the Bitcoin. I think this will have positive flux on the investors and might just drive more funds in the time to come. We are also on the verge of having halving event. This is well known and effective one to attract more people into Bitcoin economy as the volatility goes crazy during this period. The sudden drop in prices can make huge impact on true investors and they might start buying more and more. QuoteNew capital will enter the market from fresh stablecoin supply, tokenization of traditional assets, native crypto infrastructure tokenization and ETFs, the report said.Crypto exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) add capital to the market not just by creating demand in the spot market, but the market signal of regulatory approval of these products produces a growth flywheel for retail and other institutional flows that are seeking legitimacy, broker Bernstein said in a report Monday.“With the interest of leading global asset managers in bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs and potential mechanisms to address the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) objections, the probability of approval has risen,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.Bernstein expects a spot bitcoin ETF market to be sizable, reaching 10% of bitcoin’s market cap in two to three years.The SEC extended its review of the Ark 21Shares bitcoin ETF application on Friday, as the regulator continues to assess applications from traditional finance heavyweights such as BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity Investments.Cryptocurrency ETF’s will benefit from a “strong brand marketing push by leading global asset managers,” and a “distribution push from retail brokers and financial advisors,” the note said.The broker says new capital to power up a new crypto cycle will come from fresh stablecoin supply, tokenization of traditional assets, native crypto infrastructure tokenization and ETFs.Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Could Help Power up a New Crypto Cycle: Bernstein",

This is not something new in fact i think the reason behind the delays have something to do with the halving of bitcoin and what's that relation i can not say for sure but there are two possibilites which are if ETFs got approved then these will act as a boost to the BTC dominance and market cap as the demand of BTC will increase and the second possibility is if they (ETFs) get declined then it will provide another buying opportunity for many investors who still have some fiat in their bags.Well, other than that, the halving period will still happpen and it will still impact the price of BTC. If there is any other possibility then i am opened all ears. And i can not agree more to your thoughts that i have bolded.",

I agree with your viewpoint about possible effects of ETF approval on Bitcoin price. Indeed, such approval can act as a catalyst in boosting Bitcoin's market dominance and marketcap. However, it is difficult to accurately predict the timing of these approvals, although I think eventually it will obtain approval from SEC as applicants like BlackRock are highly influential and heavily funded. Regarding the influence of halving event on Bitcoin price, the prevailing unwelcoming investment environment due to tight monetary policies, I am afraid it might not have substantial effect on Bitcoin price.",

Its 2023. My fully regulated broker, which I use to invest in foreign markets, offers CFDs on 150 cryptocurrencies. Plus500 (popular blrokers) offers 19 crypto pairs, you can buy crypto using your Revolut app or even paypal app. Microstrategy bought 1% of all bitcoins, tesla also had their bitcoin investment also without ETF. So retails don't need it so as institutions. I really can't image a person that see bitcoin pumping from 10k$ to 60k$ and don't buy because of the lack of bitcoin ETF. I am aware that CFD and ETF are completely different, but in my opinion, if some retailer is not able to understand how to buy a real bitcoin and put it on the wallet, he probably does not know the difference between CFD and ETFIn my opinion, the introduction of ETFs will have a positive impact on the price, but much less than everyone expects.",

Because these tight monetary policies are the one that are bringing those ETFs for better adoption of Centralization under the skin of real BTC (means decentralization). Long story short they are trying to lure people into thinking that they are getting decentralized BTC which i know mostly do know the difference but these steps are just to attract those traditional people who still not entered the market well i can agree that we should not jump to conclusion yet because things are still delaying and according to new news the ETFs are delayed further.",

So don't hold your breath that the price will take off anytime soon.This is only if you assume that there cannot be a hype before Blackrock ETF is accepted. Also, it's not like that ETF is going to start trading right away and it's not like Blackrock Starts buying the moment it gets the green light from the SEC.So, to address the first problem, we had plenty of bull runs without any ETF. We were at $68k without an ETF, so we don't have to wait and hope that an ETF will take us back up because eventually, with or without it, we will go up. It's also important to note that there's an ETF in Canada and now we have also one in Europe, but the price is actually lower than it was a month ago.",

However, if we are talking about something that would be difficult to handle then we wouldn't be even applying, but we end up with something that would be a lot more troublesome if we kept going even though we knew that it wouldn't be accepted.So all in all, I guess that we know that it is not going to be something that matters, it is going to be way too important for that and we should definitely be considering the situation to be as much of an important thing as we possibly could and we will do fine.",

      "body": "Sometimes, I'm torn between appreciating these spot Bitcoin ETFs and imagining that all this shouldn't even have a place in a decentralized system. Why can't we just own Bitcoin according to its fundamental principles? Why do we have to have a manager for it? Is this kind of marriage between the traditional and revolutionary approaches necessary?Just like the sentiments of others here, I'm not sure if a spot Bitcoin ETF application would really drive up the price. Bitcoin ETF, although futures-based, was once a thing of interest in the past, for example, but how much did its approval and actual trading contribute to the appreciation of the price? How are they now?I know that the entry of the likes of BlackRock means a lot to Bitcoin's image, but we'll see whether an approval of a spot ETF in the US would really translate to an exponential rise of Bitcoin's price, just as it seems to be implied by many.",

You made a valid point that introduction of  ETFs could be seen as an attempt to centralize Bitcoin under the cover of Bitcoin's inherent nature of decentralization, as these prominent institutions will release substantial amount of shares against their real Bitcoins holdings. This is indeed a concerning aspect. it is also important to acknowledge that these shares could serve as a driving force for wide spread adoption of Bitcoin, specially when general public begins to purchase these share in anticipation of making substantial profit in future.",

Do you know if these Bitcoin ETFs will be backed by real bitcoins? If yes, then funds will drive and we will move towards further centralisation. If not, no funds will drive into crypto market.",

The topic was Blackrock which bribed a lot of people to buy the homelands. Then after making this statement, OP said, it's a matter of worry that BlackRock might make a collude against real BTC like they could hire all the developers and miners, and validators of BTC to shift the interest of people from old BTC to new pegged BlockRock's provided BTC. I mean really, people are talking shits but I can not assume how people could come up with this type of discussion even I almost got worried after hearing the OP content but then I was relaxed after sometime. Here is the OP post I am talking about.  Should the Bitcoin community be concerned about BlackRock?",
