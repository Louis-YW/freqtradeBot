  "content": "Hi everyoneTotal scamI have played for few weeks, and now when I want to withdraw they ask for a huge number of different documents (ID, banking info, credit cards, crypto wallets, selfies, selfies with id and the mailing background with them...)i have sent all the proof they have asked for. ALL OF IT. All original documents.My current balance is 3341€. I managed to withdraw actually at the very beggining and have no problem at all. Once i started to win a little bit this shit started.Betwinner answer when they have nothing else to ask is literally this one:\"Scanned copies and screenshots are not accepted for verification.\"\"Without providing the requested files any further actions are impossible. All further messages from you will be ignored.\"i did not send any screenshot or scanned copies, all original.they are not answering more emails and are keeping my moneyAfter sending them a lot of more emails, photos in every angle, even selfie videos proving my identity, they asked for more crazy documentation, including more banks statements, utility bills, selfie with the utility bills.. and they are answering me is not enough and the documents are not correct:\"You should send us photos of utility bills for the last 3 months (e.g. payments for gas, water, electricity). Your name should be seen on it.You may also provide us with the photo of the bank statement where your name and your address are seen.\"\"Please pay attention to the requirements of the Security Department, otherwise further actions are impossible.\"Betwinner is fucking with me in a super high levelThey don't want to pay. Period. No more excusesBetwinner is total shame, scammers. They dont want to pay me my legal money.Im a little bit desperate because i dont know what else to do.I have never before played in this website. I really did nothing wrong and I dont think I deserve this treatment by their sideHope can find a solution",

I don't think they care if you win or lose, they will seize everything you deposit there.I deposited 2000 euros, betting on esports, and ran my bankroll up to 6200 euros. When I tried to withdraw 200 euros, I got a rejection and was blocked. Then I was asked to provide various information, really ridiculous screenshots and selfies. They always take 72 hours to respond, and after following every crazy thing they asked me to do, they asked me to post a regular mail to them in Ukraine.. Which I did, but they have stopped responding now, its been 3 months since my withdrawal request, and I think it's safe to say they robbed me, not only of my winnings but also my initial deposit.Maybe best to stay away from this site as there are lots of accusation for years now",

Looking at the Quora link given above, the casino has been scamming many times too so OP is not the first victim. It's just unfortunate that he didn't know these accusations before depositing.

Complaints have increased significantly.After the assassination of one of the founders of 1xbet, the situation has changed across all 1x platforms. They have tightened procedures even further. For instance, Mostbet has introduced video calls for KYC verification. 1xbit has begun closing accounts without refunding the deposited amount, and Coinplay has implemented KYC procedures. As a result, all security departments are now centrally managed. Others, like Betwinner, Megapari Melbet, 22bet, Betandyou, operate under franchise names.Stay away from 1x and its clones!!https://www.casino.org/news/1xbet-co-founder-sergey-karshkov-dies-in-hospital-mishap/",
