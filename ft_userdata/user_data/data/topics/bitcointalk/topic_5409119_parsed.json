  "content": "The standard for most meme coins and NFT projects is to focus solely on aggressive marketing push, cult mentality, and of course; hype. We strike when the anvil is hot, and think about the use case later. With House Of The Dragon (HOTD), we intend to bring you the best of both worlds by implementing solid utility and a strong community. There is no denying that NFTs and meme coins have far surpassed industry expectations but we recognize and know there is always room for improvement. We believe in the future of Blockchain and NFT in the gaming world and there is an opportunity now to build good reliable products and a strong economy. Whilst offering the investor a token built from the ground up that can provide all the utilities required, we also provide transparency, history and above all security. $HOTD will be the native currency. $HOTD will be used as currency in the HOTD ecosystem. $HOTD is a BEP-20 Token that fosters and promotes the project's healthy and widespread usage and decentralization through fast, secure, and public transactions. Any trade in the HOTD ecosystem will be through $HOTD.The holder can participate and win HOTD tokens in the P2E Games. Also, $HOTD can be used to buy NFTs and can also be earned by holding those NFTs. Holders of NFTs will be rewarded with the $HOTD Token directly into their wallets. The P2E mechanism makes the game more exciting than ever. The competition and reward bring up the true nature of the gaming warriors and allows them to fully use their mind and skills to win the game. Like the season the blood will be spilled to sit on the iron throne of 1000 swords. This is pure domination, blood will spill, and houses will fall because Battles will run hourly with lady chance offering new fates to top the lobby leaderboard every turn. HOTD is a 3rd generation peer to peer cryptocurrency. It is built by people and for the people. An expert team, modern tech, a broad vision, and a strong community are what make up the foundation of HOTD. The community is the heart of our project and we want to give back to our community. HOTD helps its community through features like a P2E, House Release, and next-generation NFT collection.Above all else, we want HOTD Token to be easy to understand and simple to use, empowering those who may have never purchased or traded cryptocurrencies before. As we continue to grow, we are actively building an engaged and passionate community and having a ton of fun along the way! We look forward to creating a better future with you.
