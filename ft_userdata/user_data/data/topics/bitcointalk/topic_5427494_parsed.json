      "body": "I see you're still a little bit on the fence about reinstalling your OS. I'll try to help you make up your mind:Ask this question to yourself: \"How much is the crypto you're currently storing on a desktop wallet worth (in FIAT terms)\". Then ask yourself the question: \"How many hours will it take to setup my system again\".Divide the hours you'll spend on reinstalling by the net worth of the crypto you're storing and decide if it's worth to invest your time.Maybe you'll come to the conclusion you only hold (for example) $100 worth of crypto, and it'll take 25 hours to completely reinstall and reconfigure your pc so everything is back like you like it to be... So reinstalling could potentially \"save\" you from losing $4/hour and for you that might not be worth it.On the other hand, you could come to the conclusion that a simple reinstallation might save you from losing hundreds or even thousands of dollars per hour of work invested, and the decission becomes really simple.What you could also do is disconnect your pc from the internet untill you receive your christmas present (hardware wallet). This way, at least your key(s) cannot be stolen from this point in time (There's always a chance a hacker already has his hands on your private key(s) but hasn't yet robbed you, in this case disconnecting from the internet won't do you much good... But those odds are rather small and can only be circumvented by making a new wallet on a clean pc and moving your funds).This is a decission everybody has to make for himself/herself tough... Personally, i'd wipe my system right away if i even had the suspicion i had malware on a device holding a software wallet of mine.",

This is not a question that can be given a unique answer, because everyone has their favorite when it comes to AV and everyone will give some reason why they think their AV is the best - with the addition of those who use Linux and think that it is the only one correct way that makes sense. If you want to experiment with AV, I suggest you try one of those that otherwise have the best test results, and most of them have trial versions, so it won't cost you anything.However, if you want to sleep a little more peacefully, listen to the advice of others and buy HW or make cold storage on an old computer, which is an even safer option.",

You can see how they work by installing VirtualBox and Linux.Linux is also a good advice, but the starting part of only removing the browser may not help much if his system is indeed in trouble (and if one hides the problem it doesn't mean the problem is gone). Plus, although I tried to keep Firefox as main browser, it turned out that some websites (and apps) just don't work properly on Firefox (some development houses decided that testing only on Chromium is fine/enough).If OP decides to stay on windows then indeed, an antivirus that offers real time (and URL) protection is a must.

Sure, it's a hassle to restore all apps and settings to the way they were, but it'll do a better job of getting rid of malware than any other option. Better to be safe than sorry, right?You may also want to consider using a bootable Linux live CD or USB drive to scan your system for malware, which will be left behind by most other methods. This is especially useful if you're not sure what else to do with the infected PC. Personally, I also use a combination of antivirus and malwarebytes. But because my computer doesn't do much besides surf the web for geeky stuff, there isn't much chance that it'll encounter dangerous files anyway! Of course, I still wouldn't feel comfortable keeping large sums of money in this machine. It's better to use a more secure PC for that purpose, or better yet - a hardware wallet.",

      "body": "I wouldn't rely on antivirus for this, honestly if you think you're compromised then wiping the hardware is probably the best idea. If you've got a Solid state drive (SSD) you could potentially use Secure Erase ATA. Booting into a live usb of a distro of your choice, and using HDPARM to perform it. It should, theoretically wipe everything from the mapping to pretty all the data. It sends a voltage spike to each of the chips on the SSD, and that should erase everything, and you can then reinstall your operating system. Backing up files when you're already compromised is a tricky affair. If you can't realistically do this, then I wouldn't risk putting your Bitcoin on that device. Maybe, consider a offline device as an alternative. Most people have old computers lying around that they could repurpose for a offline Bitcoin wallet. Then, create a watch address on your existing potentially compromised computer. If you want to send Bitcoin, things start getting a little more tricky. However, you could use a hardware wallet to mitigate some of the issues.",
