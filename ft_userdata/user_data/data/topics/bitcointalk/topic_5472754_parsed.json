I do not know of copy trading, but it is better as you follow the trades of people, unlike signal providers that you will follow nothing than the providers to find ways to earn money from you without them thinking of you winning or losing. As for copy traders, I do not know much about it, but there is nothing that is better than learning trading yourself and use the amount of money that you can afford to lose to trade.",

      "body": "I'm not surprised that those traders are not using stop loss, just as they code bots to the scalp for them without the use of stop loss and some utilise a wide stop loss which is risky. In these cases, they are putting your account in danger and they are doing that mainly for a reason, they do not want to have records of many losses simply by the market hitting the stop loss and going back to their positions.As painful as this could be for traders, it's also protective since leaving a trading position to run for too long in losses or without a protection is a very bad idea. This is unless the trader is always present with the trading platform to close the position in real-time, still, this boomerang at times.Advice: It's not a must you use a signal provider, and by experience, they do not have long-term positive performance. With scalping, it would be worse, why not look for the regular intra-day trader or a long-term one that practices a decent risk and money management?It's easier to find traders with those criteria than to find the ones that scalp with the use of stop loss.",

It is not possible to identify whether a copy trader is using stop loss or not as the exchange only shows traders statistics about past trading activities. If any of the copy traders has any communication channels in that exchange or outside that exchange then it will be better to ask him personally. There is no way to know about this without them telling you personally.",

The only thing that is not good about other copy trading promoters is that they don't really inform about the cons. This is the problem; if they promote copy trading, they make it appear that you will have no problem with it.If we look at it, it's not ugly when someone tries copy-trading. That's why you should be critical before deciding to do this. Or if you join other signal providers because the capital investment is dangerous when it happens.",

I don't recommend following signals from other people, as many of them tend to offer services for a fee, or if the signal is free, the quality of the signal is cheap, which is why I don't recommend following and relying on signal providers. If the OP wants, he can use Etoro, which is copy trading. You will just need to select the traders you think are trustworthy and, of course, have a good record in trading in crypto.If you, for instance, follow signals, I still think that it is not suitable. Why? What if that signal requires a lot of equity and the trader has only a limited amount? In short, there are a lot of things to consider before you can follow and fully utilise a trading signal, so it's much better to rely on yourself, who is fully equipped with knowledge and skill in trading.",

Trading signals and groups just giving you an insight with the coin and positions they will entry but not yours entry its your mistake once you joined them even at your self you dont know the run of this coin or the current state of the market. Theres nothing wrong with copy trade but of course atleast you have an idea with the basic TA of the market or else youll let other people make risk for you with your money still with proper monitoring.",

Check trades history of traders first and some description so you can select what you want.It's hard decision to set stop loss on your order, I can confirm that from my experience. Usually, I try to stay alert and watch price in live when I am trading because I can more likely understand whether there is a pure manipulation or there is a real panic. There is only one time when I set stop loss on my orders and that's only when I sleep because I got liquidated when I was trading on futures without setting stop-loss and lost thousands of dollars.My piece of advice is to use stop loss feature if you aren't able to watch price in live. If you watch it in live and are confident that you'll be able to take the care of sudden price spike or dump and are alert at the same time, then you can continue without it.",

This is very reckless especially for a copy trader class, even though they showed good performance before, following it for a long time is suicide. One day he and his followers will realize how important stop loss and TP are.I'll skip the signal provider. There is no benefit, sometimes they give misleading directions.Learning analysis yourself without following other people is the most appropriate choice. Change your dependence on other people and start being independent. Sometimes our own family can betray us, especially other people. We shouldn't trust other people in investing or trading. do it and determine it with your own efforts and analysis.Good Luck",

All these sudden spikes in the charts happen for a reason. On the playing field, you only see what is in front of you, but the exchange sees the entire playing field and plays against you. Set stop losses work very well in moments of unexpected market reversals. Just don’t forget that after such unexpected changes, the market very often returns to the state it was in before this sudden change. Only you are no longer in the market, you were thrown out. Thanks to the stop loss.Yes, everyone believes that. However, for me stoploss is very helpful, in every direction of market movement there is a trend, if price movements are impulsive during a trend, with the help of analysis we can apply stop loss and take profit. Of course, our trading also follows the trend, not the opposite.However, it is up to each individual - there is no compulsion in using SL and TP. For me, SL and TP have brought me to the safety of my balance and increased my balance.",

Thanks to the stop loss.You are basically right here, stop-loss cascades have already led to several flash crashes on exchanges where the various coins were traded significantly (!) below market price. Everyone who had positioned their stop losses relatively low was thrown out and definitely lost money when the upswing occurred. I will certainly remember this flash crash from 2017 for a long time, but in a more positive sense. I had placed a very low order on BTC there and simply forgot about it. However, the order was triggered by the flash crash:SourceOn the other hand, stop losses have personally saved me many more trades or allowed me to take profits. For me, the use is therefore clearly positive and I would recommend sensibly placed (!) stop losses to every newcomer.

But I haven't seen or communicated with him for a long time. But as a scalper, it seems he also often uses stop losses. Because he often tells me that it is important to always set a profit target and place a stop loss entry. Because fast-scale trading is usually carried out on trading pairs that have high volatility. Like coins with projects that are holding events or something like that. I personally am not a scalper. Because I once tried to become a Scalper but I didn't seem suitable or mentally ready.
