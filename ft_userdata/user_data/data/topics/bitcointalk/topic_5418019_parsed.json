It is not convincing here for me, I will consider listening to those reviews if come from the community, not a single author or the website owner that could have a possible biased review or actually did not gamble on the site. We have a lot of gambling casino review websites here and how can you compete with them?I don't know either where did you come from those top 5 gambling casinos and how you rated other gambling casinos. Here are some other gambling casinos here that will probably be the best if you will include them in your list https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5333602.0.",

I've seen \"review websites\" like this before where they only provide referral links on their website and nothing more.",

I spent a long time dealing with the casinos and of course also played, I can take away your worries, because no dubious casinos will make it into my top 5 list.Would not be more convincing and attractive for your visitors if you presented a collection of reviews made by different people about those casinos?I mean, usually when I look for reviews of any kind of service which I would need to trust my money, one single review by one single person would not convince me to use the service, I would need at least 3 or 4 separate reviews, I do that in order to avoid biased reviews and promoted ones.You could associate with some reputable people here in the forum so you could invite them to write review for you (if you can you could even offer a reward), that way your reviews and your web would accumulate more reputation, also for the visitors of your web to be sure of the origin of those reviews the people working for you could even attach a signed message at the end of the review.That is my opinion.",

Well, this might be your own perspective about the top 5 crypto casinos, and I think all the gamblers here have their option as well.
