The above is optional if you want to instantly be able to post image you need to pay for copper membership. Getting merit is not easy you need to be constructive or helpful and reply some useful response to every thread/post if someone found your post helpful I'm sure you will earn not just 1 merit but more than 1 merit.",

Thanks to yahoo62278, at least you don't have to worry about the merit requirement anymore.    The latest post has been made after a period of 581 days or say 19 months of period so expecting the rank to grow is like day dreaming and it would have been of little effort to push up to the junior rank within these two years.But stiil he has not made even 10 posts but if want it now then he has to make some regular posts and will gain the required 21 activity within a month and then he will be junior rank member on the forum.Quote from: The Pharmacist on August 16, 2022, 08:39:29 AMOP, if you've got all the answers you're looking for (and it appears you got even more info than what you requested), please lock this thread using the button on the bottom left hand corner.  If you don't, this thread is going to fill up with useless responses *not like mine* that'll keep it going on and on when it doesn't need to.  Best of luck to you.Yeah that would be best in case he has got his doubts cleared and work on his posting that will make him rank up on the forum to promote his business and add images to it as somehow he got his merit criteria fulfilled and it was his lucky day also.So now thread should be locked.",
