  "content": "B.A.U.B.L. - the Social Game app releasedThe Web app provides a friendly user interface to interact with the B.A.U.B.L. Ethereum blockchain contract and play a simple social game for networked friends / participants.The details how this game works are detailed in the B.A.U.B.L. Ethereum contract.The rules are also discussed and clarified in the FAQ section of the B.A.U.B.L. web site.For those impatient, here is a summary of the main game features:     The purpose of the game is to distribute as much free $BAUBL as possible      to as many players / participants as possible.     The value of $BAUBL increases when more of it is distributed to more participants.     - Initially participants can ask for and receive free $BAUBL     - Participants that own $BAUBL can send it to friends that do not have BAUBL.        For the effort they receive even more $BAUBL.     - Friends that receive $BAUBL can now start sending that to their friends        and receive more $BAUBL as bonus. This chain of friends can continue indefinitely.     - You have to figure out how much $BAUBL to send, balancing the urge to receive        more $BAUBL bonus with the consequences down the chain of friends.Happy B.A.U.B.L. gaming and we wish you as many friends as you can findWeb: https://www.baubl.ioApp: https://app.baubl.ioContract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbd514651067342047cd21b4e4dd07cd1152d3fbGitHub: https://github.com/baubltoken/baubl",
