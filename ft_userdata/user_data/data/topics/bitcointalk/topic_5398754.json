  "content": "I got this notification from a telegram channel which I follow. It is a telegram channel of a Youtube influencer who talks about cryptocurrency in his regional language. When I checked the notification from that channel it stated QuoteJUST IN: Goldman Sachs and Barclays have invested in Bitcoin and crypto trading platform Elwood Technologies.I was curious to know that Barclays had invested in Bitcoin! Did a simple search and found the accurate story. If your read the complete article you will know that this investment has nothing to do with Bitcoin.Unfortunately this is how influencers and media has been promoting their hidden objective, that is to earn money no matter what can be the consequences and what it may end up?This is why you need to do a search before believing anything promoted.",

It's even worse if you're exposed to them 24 hours a day through notifications, which in my opinion really doesn't make sense and turns a person into an addict who just stares at the screen all the time.Unfortunately, the article is only for those who pay for the content (at least that's the case with me), so I can't read what exactly it is, but I'll take your word for it that it's a clickbait title.",

It is a telegram channel of a Youtube influencer Yeah, I understood your problem the first second that I read your first sentence of your post. Rule number 1: never believe any influencer, no matter how influencial they are. Especially when it comes to important matters like investing your money or buying a certain product/coin.They obviously only advertise something if they get paid or otherwise renumerated for their efforts. Only trust yourself. A lot of people keep falling for the \"influencers\" and their scams but see it as an expensive life lesson instead of a mistake. Next time, do your own research on whatever you want to invest in and do not listen to others.",

Doing investigations and seeking the truth from various sources is what I often do. Because swallowing the raw information that is shared will only generate a lot of doubts. Even so what you are doing is a good way and don't trust only one source. Especially when it comes to investing, where you have an obligation to know the truth factually.

The reality is that if they just make the headline something boring related to the news itself then it would not be getting that much attention. SEO changed the news world too much, the more clicks you get means the higher you will be ranked and the higher you will be ranked means that you will be getting more clicks and that is why they changed all headlines to this clickbaity stuff. Not going to really change anytime soon either because having a lot of clicks results in getting paid more and that's all they care about at the end of the course.",

Nowadays, as information gets easier to find, more unreliable sources pop up which makes it quite bad to trust a single source alone. Just goes to show that like how televisions were used for personal gains and agenda by the media back then, social media platforms nowadays are also experiencing the same greedy manipulation caused by the same selfishness of the capable individuals or groups. Which is why I never follow any shillers/influencers and only hear about them coincidentally. Although, I still watch sometimes but just to hear about new hypes and all so I can do my own research about how worthy are the ones being mentioned and yes, some are true but not all.",

Create some videos keep publishing them until they get shit loads of subscribers who believes in them and keep watching the video on daily basis. They show the advertisement, they get paid believers get screwed in wrong investments. Its good you researched it before publishing.
