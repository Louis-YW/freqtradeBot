Can you provide valid source or you are basing your opinion base on exchange price depth volume?Your price prediction is very close to the current price while you are predicting for the next year forecast.",

I am not saying that bitcoin may go down to $17000, but it is just a guess that if bitcoin fall below $20000.

But what happened current?Then just went sideways and no one was able to know whether the market could drop so low. We can't say going low or high but let be optimistic that something positive would likely happened.",

I know the recent dump is from the FUD around billionaire Michael Burry shorting Bitcoin heavily a few days ago. Crypto (or Bitcoin) is moved by either of these two – FUD or FOMO. So, wherever there's any of the two the market shakes. I believe a lot of investors panicked because they didn't know why Mr Burry would be shorting it that much. Paper hands like exiting the market at the slightest rumour, even before confirming it to be reality or not and that should be what happened. Waiting alone without taking action can't move the market. Let the money bags roll up their sleeves and get in the work, instead of staying on the sidelines in wait. As for me, whether Bitcoin goes below $20k or not I ain't moved. What I know is that it will return up there.",

Anyway, the market is unpredictable so whatever the trend is make sure to be more ready and if the price started to dump again, its a good opportunity to buy more so don’t panic and look for a long term trend.",

My hope now is for the price to be last corrected and at the end of the year a bullish market will start to appear. However, if that doesn't happen, I don't think there's anything to worry about, because my goal is to invest. if bitcoin actually hits $20k, it also doesn't cause panic, because we can buy it back to invest, so in this case I have several plans with different scenarios, so we can react wisely",

As both are different and both have different meanings. If you see the chart of Bitcoins, then it always follows a 4 year cycle in order to achieve new ATH price. 2024 is the 4th year, and everyone expecting it to become a big one. So yes we will definitely see a lot of roller coaster ride in this 2023. So I don’t know who said this year gonna be boring.

At this time, Bitcoin is in a better position to catch than at other times, but there is no guarantee that the market will not go lower in a few days. Within a few days the market may go down as well as the market may increase from the current position it completely depends on the movement of the market. The Bitcoin market has grown by nearly $10K over a six-month period. Even 6 months ago Bitcoin price was around $18K and now Bitcoin price is at $26K even though Bitcoin price has moved from $30K a few days ago. The market swings between $18,000 and $30,000 have been very short, so nothing can be said for sure about the rise or fall in the price of Bitcoin.",

And OP would bother putting images anyway because someone will quote on it to show everyone anyway but OP didn't so it's a waste to tell OP that he/she needs to have a Copper Membership. Regarding the analysis if you like to call it that, anything can happen to bitcoin, it's volatile that's why people can say whatever number they want and call it a day, one thing I have to say is that if it ever really happens that bitcoin goes there, better make sure you have cash because you're going to be missing out buying at that price.",

I feel like it is going to be just a talk so people do not really care about it all that much. I think it is quite important to make the difference between them of course but if you are trading based on speculation then it is sort of related to each other at the root and that is why people do this kind of stuff.In the end, we are going to see it go up if you ask me and when I say this, that means it is related to trading as well, I say its going to go up, but I also mean that you should buy right now and sell next year, when I say buy and sell like that, that means you are going to make a trade and that suddenly becomes related to trading.",
