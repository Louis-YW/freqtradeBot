Does anyone have a specific selling strategy during the bull run or do you just do what feels right at the time? When it comes to trading the crypto market there is no perfect or specific time to sell your asset because if you are waiting for a specific time some investors we take profit from your money. What you have to do is to deploy a trading strategy that will help you take a profit any time you see one. Also, learn not to be greedy when trading in the crypto market. For instance, if you invest in a token with $500 and your investment turned to $1000 you can sell off your token and wait for the token to retrace so you can buy the token again.",

Does anyone have specific selling strategy during the bull run or do you just do what feels right at the time? There’s no perfect timing when it comes to bull run. I know that the next year’s halving is one of the catalysts here, but the bull run can happen anytime even before the halving due to various factors. I am still down as of the moment of the original BTC price that I’ve bought in doing DCA (dollar cost averaging). I always have to be readyb wherever the market goes. If the bull run does happen, I would sell a reasonable amount of my assets and keep the capital. Ain’t planning to sell them all.",

Don't have any specific plan since I just base my profit taking depends on what situation will occur. And I never get hype easily with more hyping words we can possibly ready anywhere then wait for more since for me profit is profit on whatever forms so don't get hype about ATH since the more you chase then wait for more you will just end up missing the train. So make sure you will not act like that since that traits makes you a bag holder then regret for not selling at the moment where best time to sell your bitcoin or other alts.",

Of course, if you think about investment planning you will end up with a bull market.In fact, no one can estimate the exact time to sell. or wait for ATH and we just sell it. everyone just predicts and doesn't know whether what we do will be right or not. therefore when you are in a bull market, try to be consistent with your initial investment plan. a bull market can be a strong pump and then a correction. if you have no experience, you can very easily panic in this position.",

The best strategy is to be obsevant on the market movement. Plus youll feel that its highly likely to continue if the charts looks promising. You can never predicted if its gonna be a continous movement since thats impossible we always expect some rough patch down trend sometime and we gonna thought its over nut reversal is imminent. But never be greedy not to sell when you already know its a good profit and dont regret not selling much higher.",

If you are lucky and your target is hit, then you can sell, but keep in mind that you will find it difficult to sell at the top, and since nobody knows how high it will go, nobody will be able to recommend a price to sell at for you.",

The fear of selling too early is often making investors sell too late or worse - not sell at all and wait for another bull run.  The bull run starts with a sudden spike and after that lasts for 1-1.5 years, so a good strategy is to wait 1 year from the start of the run. Also, if DCA is popular buying stategy, than the reverse can be an exit strategy - sell some BTC every week of the bull run and you will get the average bull season price. Ofc the best outcome is to sell at the very top, but tops usually last only a day or two, so it's unlikely you would catch them. The average price of a bull season is way higher than the average of the previous bear season, so it's still a great profit.",
