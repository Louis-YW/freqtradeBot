      "body": "I would like to add that I send the payment through Paypal Friend or Family, so I could not cancel the payment. Once the money is sent from my Paypal account and on your account I cannot withdraw it.Also, I do the first step, that is, I first pay the euro amount via Paypal Friends/Family and only receive the BTC in the next step. That I am a newbie here in the forum is of course discouraging for the whole thing but I would like to add that I already have done successful a trade with a trusted user here from the forum. I had sent him first via Paypal / friends the amount in EUR and he has then sent me the BTC to my wallet. This was all uncomplicated and he has also left me a positive entry in the forums trust system (I have of course also rated him positively).I think and hope that maybe someone could still find to sell me some mBTC. Thank you very much for your effort. I am looking forward to positive feedback.",

Unfortunately I don't, I wouldn't have asked here.EDIT: BTW --> nice trust status you have  I was just wondering why you don't want to just purchase BTC through a regular app wallet (Trust Wallet) by entering your bank card number and going through a little verification, or ask your friend or relative about it. You want to buy with a small amount of BTC, not millions of dollars. I don’t know what you think, but you didn’t delve into the essence of the red flags, all these trusts accusing me of non-existent scam are lying",

Just be aware that other users will also read about it and they are unlikely to want to exchange something with you knowing that they can easily be ignored. Great job!",

Nevertheless I will have to look for a solid future solution to get some more BTC. After some research here on the forum I have installed Bisq as it looks very promising and I like how it works. Hopefully this will be the solution to get some (m)BTC. Meanwhile and as an addition I am trying my luck with small sport bets on the bookmaker you're sponsored  Thank you so far.",

Hopefully this will be the solution to get some (m)BTC.Thank you so far.Bisq is great.  Through my keen powers of observation I've gathered that you're a resident of Europe.  If I'm right, Bisq enables many payment methods that work well for European traders.  I see lots of offers for Revolute, Wise, Swift, and Instant Swift.  Revolute is kinda neat because it provides an affordable method of exchanging one fiat to another (if you need that.)  There are still pitfalls for selling BTC for fiat, but because of the way Bisq works (i.e. security deposits that the sammer may lose if the trade goes to mediation) it can be much safer than Paxful, HodlHodl, Localbitcoins, or Localcryptos.  The security deposit is a key factor that makes bisq less prone to scammers' succeeding.The other advantage to Bisq is there are no KYC requirement.",

      "body": "Much appreciate your feedback, thank you! Yes, I am a citizen of Germany and I live here. I already had tried Paxful with negative experience. At luck I did not loose a high amount of EUR. I absolutely decided to NOT subscribe to any regulated crypto exchange from now on because I do not want to have all the KYC stuff. I am new to bitcoin and I already felt in love with it. I like the way it works and it's decentralized. That's why I also liked Bisq at the first read. I posted this already HERE on the german sub-forum, unless you understand german you'd need to translate it to english though  Nevertheless, I think Bisq is the right path I need to take and I'm looking forward to dive into it tomorrow. For today, I'm tired and go to bed now   Thanks again mate for any assistance and information provided.",
