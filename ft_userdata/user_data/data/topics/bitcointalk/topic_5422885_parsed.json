  "content": "I appreciate the fact that bitcoin is a truly free market, not only for the wealthy or those with money to invest. I've heard people grumble that they don't have enough money to buy bitcoin after hearing how much one bitcoin costs, but they should remember that they can buy them in fractions. People who get access to such knowledge should be welcomed rather than discouraged, now that the market is a bit down by some friction, it is cheaper to get pocket some Bitcoin in your wallet.Additionally, because scammers have evolved strategies to take advantage of those investing in bitcoin, it is critical for everyone to exercise extreme caution and research typical scams. Knowledge, as they say, is power. Even while knowledge is rapidly spreading, many people are still unaware.If you have the intention of buying some bitcoins, you can buy as low as $10 bitcoin on local exchanges or any exchanges that doesn't require verification. To buy bitcoin:1. Select any exchange to buy from after the account has been created.2. Deposit cash to invest in your local vendor or deposit if there is an option.3. Place an order and buy bitcoin.4. Move it out of the exchange to an external wallet. Don't leave your bitcoin on centralized exchanges. Happy being a bitcoin holder.",

      "body": "Not just an external wallet, but ideally a open sourced, installation verified, and a wallet which allows you, and only you to own the private key. Usually, Bitcoin Core for those looking for a full copy of the Blockchain or Electrum for those looking to not have a copy of the Blockchain are the recommended options. It's also vital that the download of the wallet is verified, I can't emphasis that enough. It seems like a step that a lot of users skip out of complacency. Ideally, you'll check the signature on a different machine to what is what downloaded on for redundancy.",

Bla bla blaaaIf anyone should feel apathetic about crypto, then it's because they don't just wanna get involved with any cryptographic stuff ( reasons best know to them) but to deny the fact that they haven't heard the term \"crypto\" and - atleast, understood a bit of 'em is a \"no no\" for me.Inflation isn't something that anyone should enjoy. If you look at the world's economy today, you'd realize that things ain't moving smoothly, the way it were -- ain't even desiring a chance if a revamp is impossible, just yet. So I'd urge anyone out there to \"dance to the lyrics of his/her/ their days\" ... Get yourself into the system and feel the essence of having the knowledge in the first place.Sandra 💇",

Since privacy concern is really important, I advise to buy and sell Bitcoin in decentralized exchange and the instructions you can read it here [1]You can also do P2P in this forum by posting your offer on currency exchange section, in this way you can also protect your privacy but you need to be careful if you trade with untrusted user.[1] https://docs.bisq.network/getting-started.html",

But I had this situation once when a friend asked me about bitcoin. how to own and how to buy Of course, to own bitcoins, the easiest and fastest way is to buy. but seeing the price they prefer to buy the altcoin that looks cheaper to them.from that experience I can see, some people who learn to invest in crypto see the number of their assets not the value of the assets they have. like $10 bitcoin and $10 TRX. the value is the same but they are happier to have $10 TRX which doesn't look like 0.00x.people who are beginners are more interested in trading on the exchange than investing in Bitcoin for the long term. need more time to tell them the best.",

The difference between rich and poor people has always been that the rich have assets, wealth, while the poor live off their work, which gives them just enough to live on. Already in the Middle Ages, successful merchants could climb the social ladder, and since then, the way to climb was to set up a business. But today salaried people can build up a wealth of financial assets, which over the years, with compound interest, becomes considerable. There is no need to set up a business.50 or 100 years ago, buying shares was impossible for the average Joe because the minimum to buy and the commissions ate him up. But today a citizen with a modest income can buy shares, investment funds and cryptocurrencies with very low amounts, something we see in the forum that people from poor countries do.Thus, someone with low or middle income can gradually build up a wealth of financial assets, no matter how much they want to sell us a mentality of a victim of the circumstances against which nothing can be done, or worse: you can only wait for a politician to come and save you.",

What limits people most time is not the doubt that they can get some bitcoins regardless how much they have, but the ideology that they've missed the train and it's to late to get in now, so they go searching for the 'next bitcoin' among a bunch of garbage coins and end up losing money.Quote from: mk4 on November 24, 2022, 03:28:43 AMThis is why I still advocate for using sats by default — to prevent the \"bitcoin is too expensive\" argument from newbies, then picking a sub $1 altcoin because \"what if it goes to $1000\".I don't think changing this would make much of a difference to many, since it's still the exact same asset being discussed. Having people actually check up what they plan to invest in would go a long way in convincing people that bitcoin is still early on its journey and is still the leading cryptocurrency. Also, that the buy in price is only a minute metric to check when contemplating an investment.Being incapable of this makes it extremely difficult to make any shrewd investment decision at all.",

The most hilarious of them is the PI coin which is been tipped to worth close to 10Btc. Sadly there are even people already buying tons of it. This are people that feel its already late to invest in bitcoin even if you advise them of how these shit coins do not have future. Sadly some will learn it the hard way just like the Terra Luna investors, I just hope it doesn't get worse before they pull out",
