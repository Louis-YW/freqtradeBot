  "content": "I am not suppose to say this here but i want forum members to advice and tell me on how I can go with my bitcoin journey as a newbie and become successful in it without losing my bitcoin. My Dad is late and he left us a building which I and my siblings inherited. I rented my own apartment because I stay in a more civilized area. Whenever my tenant pays me my rent, I just keep the money in the bank and sometimes it stays there for more than six months in my account because I have a job that takes care of my responsibilities. This year when I joined this forum, after reading through topics and comments from forum users on bitcoin investment, I said to myself that it will be wise if i give bitcoin investment a trial and see how it will feel like holding a bitcoin. Last week Monday, I recieved my rent, but guess what I was scared of investing it on bitcoin because I was having so many thoughts in my head telling me to invest and not to invest. I continued with my forum activities and kept on reading, at a point, I got to realize that what will I gain, if I have the knowledge of bitcoin and I don't invest in it to have the experience on using bitcoin and to also have the experience of holding in long term, so that i can talk about bitcoin from experience. This means that it is important for me to buy bitcoin to acquire more knowledge,and this will be an advantage for me Â to buy bitcoin now that the price is dip, before it pumps back. Yesterday, I used 60% of the money my tenant paid me to buy bitcoin and I was relieved and happy. I have also created an electrum wallet which I have transfered my coins into, the reason why I chose electrum wallet because it is noncustodial with RBF and Ligthening Network features, which can allow you to double spend,incase the network is congested and your transaction fee is low,since sometimes bitcoin blockchain used to be congested with dust transactions.I intend to hold by bitcoin for long, because I just started my bitcoin journey and, I know that it isn't going to be an easy one for a newbie like me. I will use 10% of my income to DCA every month, because I also noticed that fiat currency is depreciating due to inflation and that it is better that I save in bitcoin than to keep it in fiat. The moment my bitcoin reaches $1000, I will look on how to transfer my coins to a cold storage wallet for safety. I couldn't keep this to myself and I said let me bring this to the forum for advise from experienced members on precautions I need to take for me to achieve my bitcoin goal target.If you haven't invested in bitcoin yet, you should try and do so, if you have the resources so that you can feel the vibes that am feeling right now. Let's discuss.",

Having knowledge of BTC without investing isn't a waste, you don't have to 'invest' to gain experience about BTC, so many people invest in BTC by buying it and holding it on exchanges, and some even invest through etf's without owning the keys to their funds, these kind of people have no experience or knowledge, but they are BTC investors. You can test all the features you want to without investing, so also can you spend BTC without investing, you can do all of these to improve your knowledge until you are ready to convert some or a great portion of your fiat money into BTC.",

      "body": "It seems you know about Bitcoin Wallets that support RBF and other features. But I see you have used a centralized exchange to buy Bitcoin. I hope you did not keep it there and withdraw it to your non-custodial wallet, as it's safer to have your own key to your bitcoin. I don't know which wallet are you going to use, but I suggest to use electrum as it's available for both Desktop and Mobile. Edit: Oh sorry, I missed the part you said you already transferred your Bitcoin to your Electrum wallet. All good then. Now, back to the original point of this thread. Indeed, sometimes you cannot get the proper knowledge without using Bitcoin. Learning by reading only and Learn by practicing things has a big difference. But it's not true that having knowledge is a waste. You can help others with your knowledge. It's not a waste at all.",

Which means that either it is true or the OP has gone to great lengths to make it sound credible. To the OP I would recommend that Bitcoin investment be encompassed within an overall wealth building plan. He seems to be on the right track, he has a job and rental income and is going to use 10% for DCA. Very good. Think, OP, about having a 3-6 month emergency contingency spending fund, in fiat currency, not bitcoin. It doesn't matter if it devalues, it's like insurance, it's a price to pay for your peace of mind.You could diversify more, but if you have cash-flowing RE and bitcoin as assets, I think you are doing well.",

This year when I joined this forum, after reading through topics and comments from forum users on bitcoin investment, I said to myself that it will be wise if i give bitcoin investment a trial and see how it will feel like holding a bitcoin. You have already started a new BTC journey by buying them, keeping them in Electrum. And in the process you must have experienced new things which you might not have known before by just learnings. Point is, we all have to start from somewhere. I am also holding my savings in BTC but believe me, you should only hold that amount in BTC about which you are sure that you are not going to need it plus you should save extra bucks in fiat too. I am saying that because, someone in my relatives wanted to borrow some money, who lend me some money back in time, but unfortunately, my savings are all in BTC and currently due to dip in the market I am at lose. So, If I withdrew the funds to lend him some money then I have to book the lose which I don't want to. So, for now, I have to ask another person in my zone who can lend him money. The point is, either you are in emergency situation or not, just save funds for emergencyÂ  situations. So that, you could use those funds. You asked what you can do to become a successful BTC holders, that you have to bear lesser Loss. The only advice I have for you is, make a profit expectation before investing in BTC, and also make a time period expectations for holding that amount because if any of the both have not in your mind then you can fall greedy and could sell at lower profits or market could take you to the path where you might have to bear lose too.",

And if you have knowledge and have no money then don't be sad be the next day you will have and you will buy Bitcoin but buying Bitcoin without any knowledge is dangerous for you.
