  "content": "There's been a recent topic in which @leonair has mentioned me Re: Merit Overflow of ltcrstrbrtHe has accused me of abusing merits and having multiple accounts. And first I was scared because I thought I might get banned from this forum. That alternate account belongs to my sister. It's Tanvi50_. So technically it's not mine, but I do have access to it. I have taken some of the merits in the past from that account, and I will say this again. I didn't know back then that how merits works. And other submission were getting a lot of merits, so I thought I can get some from my sister's account. So I did. The amount is 28, but I did also give merits to other people too. You can check my merit history. Someone I know personally, I shared it with him, and he said it was against the rules of Forum. So after that I stopped doing it and only gave out merits to who deserved it. And one last thing that @lovesmayfamilis has mentioned in here Re: Merit Overflow of ltcrstrbrtYou can see those ID's detail and social links linked to their bounty reports. This belongs to a friend and someone who I have taught how to work for bounty.  They needed some fee to swap their tokens, so I gave them this little amount to cover up their fees. I have never used alternate accounts to cheat on anything. You may see them in many bounties that I have worked for. It's because there's a telegram channel where I post all the bounty links I found. Here's the link if you are interested. https://t.me/bounty_update1So I just want to apologize to all forum members that I have lied about something. I was afraid that my account will get banned, and I won't be able to access this forum again. It took me almost 2 years to get to this point and that scared me. But I will stand my ground by saying this. Without the merit exchange, I have never done anything wrong here. I have never harmed anyone or done bad things to any person. It was a mistake in the past for which I am asking for apology. Those multiple accounts have nothing to do with me. All I did was just help them. I promise to all the mods that this won't happen in the future. Please don't ban me. I am really sorry. Again!leoniar & lovesmayfamilis you guys have done a great job. I know I shouldn't have lied in the first place. I am personally asking forgiveness to you guys.",

There is some sort of etiquette, you should merit only posts that are good, but you will find also seasoned members sometimes meriting a meme or a nicely done entry in a Christmas contest.However, exchanging merits can also be seen as shady and some may even tag you for it. It's softer than banning, but your account will no longer look good.Plus, this \"the other account belongs to sister/brother/best friend/colleague from same office\" and so on are stories we've heard far too much and many won't believe it/buy it.So, the current actions pose a risk. Some may give you a second chance, some may not. No matter you get tagged or not, you will have to learn something from this and stop doing shenanigans, since they can only drag you down.",

First of all abusing with the merits won't get you a ban and moderators have nothing to do with the merit abuse and DT community decides whether you can be trusted after doing such a thing with their ratings.Technically you circulated the merits between yourself either its from your own account or your sister's as per your story but you did on yourself which is not really encouraged again this won't get you a ban but you're at the risk of getting negged.And for the next part, you can merit any post you want as long as you're doing it from your own sMerits, like if you simply like a post or even a post with one word received tons so it all depends on the adding meaning to the discussion in some part.",

Believe it or not. In the beginning, he used to copy my POA and edit it to provide his own info. Maybe he left it like that over there. you can check that on the campaign spreadsheet He hasn't been online for a long time. He's busy with his study. I am explaining this again because it is the truth. that is not my account. And that internal transaction as I mentioned was for fee. And why we need to do it, let me explain. We are from Bangladesh and only way to acquire any crypto is via person 2 person transaction. And buying from any exchanges was costly. There was a limit on how little you can withdraw. So for that tiny amount, we need to send it to each other. i think that will clear your doubt.",
