  "content": "Thailand's move to exempt crypto transfers through government-approved exchanges is pretty interesting. The government's goal is to promote cryptocurrency trade on authorized exchanges (approved and regulated by SEC).However, this is just temporary. The tax exemption will eventually stop on Dec. 31, 2023.I see what's happening here...They fail to encourage traders to prefer authorized exchanges since there are cheaper alternatives. The problem is digital asset operators see this as an opportunity to provide services outside the government's surveillance and control.It's a good thing because:1. Government already fully acknowledges crypto trading. No more resistance.2. They want to create a more secure environment for crypto investors. Better security = Higher confidence = More investors.3. They don't want to control the blockchain--they can't. They only want to regulate transactions to protect investors from losing money. Of course, they want the government to make a little bit of profit, too. (As long as that profit--tax--benefits the people, that's fine)Overall, this is good for the crypto space.",

This happened just as Bitcoin and crypto have already developed a good relationship with businesses, just as Bitcoin started to fulfill its role as a currency. Now, it is relegated to just being an asset, an investment opportunity, where people can trade but not spend. So this must be a step backward rather than forward.",

I had to look up the news because I didn't know what you were talking about. I found this, for example:https://news.bitcoin.com/thailand-exempts-crypto-transfers-from-vat-until-end-of-2023/What I don't understand is, in Thailand is VAT applied to transfers? There is nothing added there. VAT is supposed to be a tax that is levied when there is value added, and I am not aware of such a tax being applied elsewhere, as capital gains tax is usually applied if you earn money, but VAT as if when you buy a loaf of bread?Well, each country may have its own rules. The doubt I have now is that I guess they apply VAT but not capital gains, no? Or do they apply both. Let's see if someone who lives in Thailand clarifies.",

If the exemption is lifted, will the taxation affect individual traders, crypto exchange companies or both?I think it's reasonable when governments try to regulate the crypto industry, as long as the intent is to encourage the industry to come out of the shadows and flourish, not to kill it. I hope Thailand is trying the favorable approach, but banning crypto as payment is not a nice move.",

If you are sending your money to someone you do not know in crypto, then consider that as a gone money and not the reality.We need to really make sure that we shouldn't really do something that would be beneficial for it.

Gold could be used as a currency the same way it's used as an asset. There used to be a system of currency backed by gold which acted in place of lugging around pieces of metal to trade with. Bitcoin's convenience bifurcates the utility as a currency and an asset. Whether people store their coins for long term appreciation or whether they use it as a currency, there are still funds allocated to crypto that would have otherwise been utilized for other assets or currencies. A win for crypto either way.",

The reason for which the government have taken the decision is really appreciable and a forward thinking compared to the countries that make a direct ban of cryptocurrencies. Slowly the country needs to provide way to spending, through which the real usage of crypto can be understood. What Thailand government have done, given the access similar to digital gold.",

So this must be a step backward rather than forward.  If Bitcoin is basically a currency, and someone says you can't use it that way, then it's actually attacking the very essence of what Bitcoin represents. This, of course, does not prevent individual transactions, but it undoubtedly sends a clear message that this is something that is forbidden in public business. If we remember that Turkey did the same thing more than a year ago, then it is very possible that some other countries will do the same in the future.Bitcoin is obviously a problem from the perspective of most world governments only if viewed from a currency perspective, because the centralization of the monetary system is one of the cornerstones of human society’s control. So I think this is a change in tactics that once went in the direction that Bitcoin is something used by criminals to the point that mining it is a big environmental problem - and if you can't convince someone that something is bad, you simply disable it legally.If we add to that a profit tax of say 30% as is the case in India, then we will throw a lot of small players out of the game.",
