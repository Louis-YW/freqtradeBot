  "content": "OverviewbitcoinBible is a Node.js application that scans through all books, chapters, and verses of the King James Bible to uncover potential hidden Bitcoin wallet information. The tool offers several modes for searching and hashing Bible verses, aiming to identify potential Bitcoin-related data in religious text.This tool offers a fun and unique way to explore how hidden Bitcoin wallets might be encoded in one of the most widely known texts in history—the Bible.Features:- Electrum Mnemonic Search: Search for Electrum mnemonics in each verse of the Bible.- BIP39 Mnemonic Search: (Planned) Search for BIP39 mnemonics in each verse.- SHA256 Hashing: Hash each verse with SHA256.- Reversed Mode: Option to hash each verse in reverse (SHA256).- Stop on Match: Stop the program once a Bitcoin wallet or mnemonic is found.- Customizable Configurations: Easily configure the script via the config.json file.Interesting FindsI’ve found some interesting hidden Bitcoin wallets while scanning the Book of Genesis and the Book of Numbers. These verses seem to contain potential Electrum mnemonics and hash patterns that resemble valid Bitcoin addresses and wallet seeds. The tool is still in its early stages, but the results so far have been promising!GitHub LinkYou can find the full source code and contribute to the project on GitHub:https://github.com/AusPrinzip/bitcoinBible",

      "body": "Quote from: Dunamisx on February 04, 2025, 06:31:13 PMThe name sounds funny, bitcoin bible, but why use the word bible, we have millions of words that can be used to still carry the meaning of what you're trying to portray instead of a religious book called bible, well, that is left for your choice.I don't know if you read the post because it's is actually talking about finding hidden Crypto-currency related stuff in the Bible.But honestly I find this very disturbing while will you be looking for Bitcoin wallet information in the Bible? Firstly is that not actually trying to steal? I don't think you should be looking for some random wallet informations that's not yours. Let's not portray an automatically obvious scam prospects on good light.",

      "body": "Thanks for your feedback!I completely understand your concerns, but I want to clarify that this project is just a tool and does not have any built-in malicious intent. The tool scans the Bible for potential patterns that could resemble Bitcoin wallet data or mnemonics—it’s an exploration into how blockchain-related data could potentially manifest in the text. The tool doesn’t “steal” or automatically take funds, it simply identifies possible patterns.How it is used is entirely up to the user. If someone were to find a valid Bitcoin address or wallet, they could take ethical steps such as:- Donating any found funds to charity- Making a small transaction to alert the wallet owner, if possible, or simply researching to understand the origin of the wallet.The tool itself doesn't imply or encourage unethical behavior—it’s just exploring an intriguing intersection of technology and history. The existence of a wallet address or mnemonic in the Bible, for example, doesn’t imply ownership or that it's a \"found wallet.\" It’s simply an exercise in recognizing patterns.I agree that these types of things should be used responsibly, and I’m confident that anyone using the tool can make informed, ethical decisions. The idea is simply to create a fun and thought-provoking way to explore how decentralized technologies like Bitcoin might \"appear\" in unexpected places.If you have further concerns or suggestions on how to improve this project, I’d love to hear them!",
