I honestly don't understand how that could be the case with everything that has happened in the past 11 months. QuoteIn the first 9 months of 2022, VC firms poured $19.9 billion into the crypto space, which is 44% higher than the same period in 2021. However, there is a considerable slowdown in Q3 2022, as VC funding dropped by 38.3% compared to Q2 2022. Q3's total figure is around $4 billion. Can the overall crypto space recover until 2023, or is crypto funding going to decline in 2023?Source:https://app.getresponse.com/view.html?x=a62b&m=BVlN1b&mc=9I&s=BtgXWnG&u=QcLhh&z=ECp6MIP&",
