Around $68k now, got down to $66k.This is the time to buy before the bull run really gets going. This MIGHT be the lowest it gets. While a deeper fall during this correction, or another correction in the near future, is certainly possible, this might also be as low as it gets. After the near future, the only time it might get this low again is in like two years on the next bear market, and these prices may be the bottom of the bear market.So anyone who has money sitting on the sidelines and who wants to buy Bitcoin, today is gonna likely be one of the lowest days we're gonna see for at least the next 18-24 months, and maybe forever! Buy!Do you have more financial advices ?   Guy is high on hopium and can't deal with any critic, it's like talking to a wall.",

      "body": "I dont think this data is accurate either because Satoshi most likely has more coins than that AND i doubt 3.7M coins are lost. People count the coins lost because they haven't moved in a decade and they assume that the user lost the private key or seed. However from time to time we see coins which move from 2010 every couple of months or so. Many of those unspent coinbase coins from 2009 could also move one day. This is not a good way at gauging lost coins.Coins which are lost for sure are those which are sent to an address where the private key is impossible to calculate such as sending coins to an address such as 11111111111111111198743. There is also that guy in UK which is fightning in court to get his old HD back from the dump. One day he might win his case and they might actually try and recover that HD, if the HD isnt damaged then you got tons of coins which can enter the market any day.",

But I have no data, it's just a hunch.I've heard podcasts with people who are in this space for 10 years and they were pretty much in agreement that there's much less bitcoin available for buying than it is estimated. For instance, they have a certain time for which an address has to remain dormant until it's regarded as lost. This means that if that time is 3 years, people who lost bitcoin in the last 2 years will not be counted. On the other hand, I personally have addresses that were untouched since 2018, so my coins are surely counted as lost. I wonder how is bitcoin deposited on exchange treated? Is it money of an individual investor, or maybe it belongs to a corporation?",
