Today I read an article it’s more than 10x expensive than it was between 2010-2020. This can’t be true.The first part is true, Germany has had the most expensive energy in Europe for a decade and it has some outrageous prices now, but the second part is not true, prices haven't gone up by 10x. Just one quick look at the offers on the market and you can see that they haven't gone up anywhere close to that.One of the most expensive ones, like E.ON is offering 56,35 ct/kWh for new clients, guarantee tariff till 8.2023But there are \"cheaper\" alternatives, you can compare prices here.That being said, nobody in Germany has seen 5cents per kWh this century, from the bills I have from one friend since I had this discussion before the used to pay 26 cents per kWh during 2019, now he is on 47 cents. Still expensive but no way near 10x.",

I found this, which I'll share for anyone who doesn't quite know what's going on:'BERLIN, July 18 (Reuters) - Germany may extend the life of its three remaining nuclear power plants, the economy ministry said on Monday, as public support rises in the face of a possible cut-off of Russian gas.Germany's remaining nuclear plants are scheduled to be shut down by year-end after former Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to phase out nuclear power following the meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011.The three plants made up 6% of Germany's power production in the first quarter of 2022.'Whereas in Spain Nuclear power produced 20.8% of electricity in 2021.",

According to you, gasoline in Germany costs €1.50 per liter. Here in India, it costs around ₹100 per liter (€1.25). That means that the tax on gasoline is not that atrocious in Germany. Even in India, around 40% of the price is consisted of tax. On the other hand, for me it looks like electricity is being taxed at a rate of 500% or more. In India, we pay anywhere from €0.03 to €0.10 per KWh, and Germans are paying around 5-10x of that rate. You maybe OK with this, but I don't think that such a high level of tax can be justified.",

Instead of Merkel, people pay it.I planned to move to Ireland in February but the housing crisis is so severe there that it's impossible to live in Dublin. Germans will have to say no to a comfortable living. Even with minimum wage, I think people will have money to pay rent, bills and food prices. I think that we have to decrease the heating and put on warm clothes. Not so long ago I spent winter days with winter coats and no heat. Was it harsh? Yes but not a big problem.",

      "body": "The difference between Spain and Germany is because Germany use more gaz than Electricity (IICRC), and since some decades, in Europe, the electricity's network is \"connected\". We can trade/block/limit between countries. Added to the fact that Spain, as well as Portugual are at the end of this network so the price isn't the same depending on the country.The funny thing with Germany (but it's not the only country in this situation) is half of the electricity produced comes from renewal energy. That's good? Maybe, but the country sell a percentage of its production to other countries. Less supply for the same demand so the prices can only increase. On the top of that, they're looking for more gas but without Russia, they're out. That's why other countries in Europe will have to help Germany (at least for France so there are surely others countries too. At leastn I hope)Man, the electricty price is a big problem for us in Europe, and they say the spot price will probably goes up x3 or x4 this winter.My bills are currently a nightmare, and the worst thing is that we are in the middle of summer, I can't imagine this winter.I think I'll do like that at home, like a gipsy lol",

I am also in favour of nuclear, because it is the least bad solution. Especially in Europe, where we have (almost) no oil and gas. But we must not forget the issue of nuclear waste. Another thing is that Germany, and Europe in general with Germany at the head, has had a suicidal energy policy. While Germany was closing nuclear power plants, China was opening new ones. In Europe we have set ourselves up as saviours of the planet when what we are going to have to consider is how to save ourselves, which is why I believe that in terms of energy the best option is nuclear.",

This can’t be true.Can someone who lives there verify this? 10x more seems a bit excessive and I really hope this is not going to be the case. In Germany usually there is a fixed payment at the start of the year to the electricity company. The advancement is based on the consumption of the last year with current prices. This also works with the property managers who usually make their plan for the year during spring/summer to calculate the new utility bills for each year. I haven't received any bill for this year yet, which worries me a bit on how much electricity prices actually increased. The problem with the system in Germany is that it can take up to a year in the worst case for the new cost to be transferred to the customer. From a friend of mine who already received all documents for this year and they adjusted their new budget for this year, the only have a 15% increase in electricity cost. From a colleague who lives a bit further away he told me his bill is up 20% this year.",

Germany's refusal to develop nuclear energy looks less populist and frivolous when viewed from the aspect of dependence on enriched uranium imports. To reduce dependence on Russian gas in order to become dependent on Russian uranium is a dubious deal in the long run. Even the United States cannot now refuse Russian enriched uranium, so you will not find uranium and the state corporation Rosatom on the sanctions lists.Interesting argument you raise, I had not heard it until now. So what do you think could be the solution for Europe to have enough energy supply?Hydrogen. More precisely, a mixture of 80% hydrogen and 20% natural gas (because hydrogen itself is a very volatile gas). For this mixture, the existing infrastructure of gas pipelines and underground storage facilities can be operated without changes. Moreover, two years ago the European Union published a hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe. Of course, the covid-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have pretty much confused the cards, but the EU has no other strategy on this issue.",
