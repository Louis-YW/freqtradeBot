Sad news for football fans from over the globe. I don't personally use it as I'm not really that big on football but considering how massive the sport is, and how indispensable free stuff on the internet is nowadays, it's definitely going to be a big loss not having hesgoal for usage. In any case, I'm pretty sure there are other sites on the web that people can use, albeit some of them are perhaps riddled with ads and are definitely a little subpar compared the hesgoal, but it would suffice, until such site that's on par with hesgoal comes around once again. I understand the laws that people must abide and all that but growing up on the age of internet as a poor bloke, I'm really saddened to see another pirate site going down amidst the huge crackdowns that the governments take to \"protect intellectual property\" which is just a load of bs.",

So it’s less about crypto and more about a service that crypto gamblers may utilize to track their bets. I’m not surprised the government would shut down a site that was facilitating illegal behavior. Seems like this should be expected.",

This is kind of funny to a point like it can spill military information.If they says so then the website must have violated something besides illegal services to football fans.
