  "content": "Well sorry I came with this post today after my analysis with just recently created thread by hugeblack days ago I felt so ashamed of my self seeing that we have only one merits source which is CryptopreneurBrainboss, although we are very much happy for at least for having a one out of none. But after going through the history of hugeblack saying report any quality post of yours and that of another gets me shading tears why we haven't been honored all this while by Theymos. Actually I can't question him for his actions towards our local board but it's something to be considered and look into it as a matter of urgency to remove this shameful acts from us.I know vividly that few people had applied from our Localboard to help the growth and acceleration of members, to reduced the tension and attention of members from applying in such a thing whenever and wherever they found out such opportunity to review their post to gain merits. I know this is not just something a woman like me could just come out to handle it but I believe A mother like me always understand the cry of my baby whenever she's hungry and testy for something very needful to her life. So I keep it up for Theymos to also hear the cry of his children as I believe his our mother and father in this forum and he should know how testy and hunger we are currently to remove this shame from us, personally have also checked that of Fillippone Thread that says of review post, almost out +25 percent of applicants are from Nigerian Local board.To prove that what I am saying is worth looking into is;Quote from: hugeblack on September 01, 2023, 12:02:15 PMIt is related to account, you can participate once per month, during this time share the best 10 links in your local board. if you find them good, you will get merits and/or all links.Merit LogAbout 140 Merit have been sent Code:Lida93  -------------> 1/10/2023  Some posts are good, next time diversify your users.Makus  -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts, but next time add (Naija) local language.SmartGold01   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts, but next time add (Naija) local language.Samlucky O   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Sim_card   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts, but next time add (Naija) local language.Spaceman1000$   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Salahmu   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,sokani   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Zanab247   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Hatchy   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Davidvictorson   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Bitcoin_people  -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Frankolala  -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,CryptSafe  -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,khiholangkang   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,rachael9385   -------------> 1/10/2023 Good posts,Stable090   -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,Compromise me   -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,Mate2237   -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts, I like you add other postsOnyeeze   -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts, I like you add other postsGencecikmen    -------------> 2/10/2023 Amazing, thanks +4 Merit for uAgbamoni   -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,Nalain420    -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,RockBell   -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,Dr.Bitcoin_Strange  -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,2Pizza410000BTC  -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,Obari -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts,Except from below users which I have never factor them within Nigeria local BoardCode: 1. 2Pizza410000BTC  -------------> 2/10/2023 Good posts2.

Sincerely speaking I myself do need help so, I also applied for the review as well. Below are users from our Local Board who had applied for merits source which I think it needs urgency to be accepted to;1. From Igebotz: Igebotz Nigerian Local Board Merit Source Application  2. From Charles-Tim: Charles-Tim merit source application + Nigerian local boardNote: This post was created out of curiosity and the rate at which our people needs a helping hand to spread merits across our Nigeria local board.I didn't create this post to harassed anyone other than pleading to Theymos to removed us this shame from our eyes by honoring to the above mentioned applicants who had applied so long to became a merit source.Thank you as for hearing our cry for so long.",

I was so ashamed of myself to see how copious we are in applying for that in hugeblack thread it just as if that thread was raise basically for our local board poster, like I can't even imagine someone from another locals helping us out while we have able and reputable members that I have seen potential in them to manage the merits source position in our LB.Yes I meant, those people are extremely good to be in that position why not give them a trial and see how they manage their allocation in the board, apart from that our brothers already requested for the increment of his allocation which I can see to be a very good move as well because having just a limited numbers of merits can't really go all round within the locals I do also find some post that worth meriting as well.Theymos should remove this shame from our eyes and make more source from our board, especially Igebotz and Charles-Tim.",

You all can focus on distributing sMerit in local board instead of spending it on local users of the same local in global board (including you), this is what I noticed with some local users of Nigeria.

      "body": "OP it is obviously clear that all you have noted are very much correct. I had to join you in doing a statistic review as well on the local board meriting and to be frank with you, Nigeria board lacks merit source. Little wonder upon the opening of local board meriting by hugeblack, the turn up were majorly Nigerians whom are lacking on merit in one way or the other. This has impede the fast development and growth of the board but Nigerians are much enthusiastic about this platform and hence didn't allow that to bother them much and it has been a success drive so far that a local board was achieved.Now to remedy the situation, the Nigeria board would definitely need merit sources as her growth is fast rising to the point that Nigerians are lacking behind in merit as  there are lots of quality posters out there who are lacking in merits here.Based on my findings as well, we have a merit source already in the person of   CryptopreneurBrainboss   but his merit allocation is not enough to serve the board hence we appeal to Theymos to increase his merit quota so as to aid him in doing his work as a merit source without any challenges. However, some Nigerians whom are much recognised and have contributed immensely to the development and growth of the local board have indicated interest by applying to becoming a merit source which is a good move and also a welcome development. If they are considered, I believe it would aid in the meriting of more quality local posts while mending the lapses of looking outside for merit which has made so many Nigerians here not to look into the local board.Nevertheless, I am in full support of the merit application of igebotz and Charles-Tim of the Nigerian board origin and I pray their application is given the urgent attention it deserves.",

Thank you for this uncommon thing you do.Cheers bud!As someone who is part of another local board, I understand how important part of this forum they are, and how much they can help people all around the world. I wasn't new to bitcoin or forums when I first joined bitcointalk and I had no issues commucniating in English yet my local board was a big help so I can only imagine how confusing this place might be to those that are for the first time on a forum, new to bitcoin and have issues using English. Growth of Nigerian board is a proof that theymos did a right thing by giving you your own local board and getting few more merit sources can only help in that as I think that you have a potential to surpass Turkish board and who knows, maybe even come close to Russian. Quote from: hugeblack on September 05, 2023, 08:29:39 AMAlthough I would like to see more merit sources but what I have noticed is that Nigerians are ranking up, it is true that it is difficult for those who only post in the local board but it is possible.Their average 12 months post/merit ratio is ~0.3 which means it is indeed possible to rank up there, but harder than on many of the other local boards.",

Many of them have left the local because there's no much merit there. And those who spend most of their time on the board don't get merited as much  as they'll do on the main board because 1, I'm the only merit source and 2, low source merit. I saw you have 1k+ monthly and I barely have over 120+ meanwhile we have over 1k posts monthly on the board and that means only 100+ (quality posts) of those can be merited (that's if I send only 1 merit each for each quality posts that I come across).I have message theymos severally and when he was giving us the local baord I talked with him about the merit condition because that has been my allocation before the local board was created but his reply was that the forum isn't looking to add more merit to circulation and that's just frustrating to the local board but what can we do, most times I even keep my smerits earned from merit received for the baord just to keep the energy high on the board.",
