  "content": "Time for part 3 in what now seems to be an ongoing series. Who would have thought centralized exchanges could fuck up in so many different ways!Parts 1 and 2 are here:Recent events should make everyone withdraw all their coins to their own wallets - Centralized exchanges censoring users and seizing coinsRecent events should make you withdraw all your coins to your own wallet: Part 2 - Centralized exchanges going bankrupt, users losing everythingPart 3 is doing to be a two-parter.The first issue is a follow on from Part 2 above. As part of Celsius' bankruptcy proceedings, not only have all their users lost all their coins, but Celsius have now published a complete list of every user's full name alongside their account balances and a list of every deposit and withdrawal they have made. I'm not going to link to it for obvious reasons. Given what we know from previous data leaks, these people will now be prime targets for phishing, malware, other malicious digital attacks, or even physical threats. And you can guarantee that blockchain analysis companies have already downloaded this list and will be linking deposits and withdrawals against blockchain data to start linking previously anonymous addresses to real names.The second issue is as raised by gmaxwell in his thread here: PSA: Get your Bitcoin off any exchange supporting \"BSV\" (due to insolvency risk). The TL;DR is that (as we have already seen above with Celsius collapsing secondary to the Terra Luna scam) even if you don't trade in shitcoins or scamcoins, by using an exchange which does support these coins all your bitcoin is at risk of being included in their bankruptcy proceedings. The next biggest threat at the moment is any exchange which is supporting the BSV scam, but any sufficiently large enough altcoin could collapse and take an exchange down with it, resulting in their customers losing everything.Not using centralized exchanges at all is the best thing you can do, but getting your coins off them if you are already using them is a close second.",

The Celsius Network is a US-based company so GDPR regulations don't apply to them, but isn't there a US equivalent law that makes such actions illegal? If not a federal regulation, then at last something on state level. Or does everything change due to Celsius going bankrupt? How do they justify their actions of making this data public? Did they have to do it for regulatory compliance, are they just scum, or what am I missing? There surely are better ways to share this data with 3rd parties who are required to have it by law without giving the whole world a chance to look at them.",

The irresponsibility here is just uncanny.  You may be correct that this data should not have been made public, and if needed should have been sent only to the appropriate agency, but i think that is the risk of using centralized services we are actually talking about here, centralized exchanges do not care about privacy, they aren't thinking along the lines that you are now, you (and most bitcoiners too) understand the importance of privacy, they do not, services that censor users and steal their coins may not worry about publishing a list of their users after going bankrupt.Needless to say that publishing such info is wrong, but in my humble opinion centralized services hardly worry about what's right for their customers and their privacy, they are about business and making money & they'll even go as far as doing many shady things to save themselves from collapse or to comply with regulations, so people who still use them should know this.",

This is the same as if you had bought shares in Amazon and they filed for bankruptcy, although this is the first time it has been applied to crypto, as far as I am aware (although now a precedent has been set, any data you have shared with any exchange or platform is now similarly at risk of public disclosure). Without a public list of creditors, then it would be impossible to transparently process claims. As noted in the court documents:Quote from: https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174909282280000000026.pdfEnabling parties in interest and the public to see the identity of creditors and the amount of their claims, and then tracking the disposition and treatment of claims during the bankruptcy case, is important to the fairness and public perception of the bankruptcy process. Only in the rarest of cases should these ordinary expectations be upset.Quote from: Z-tight on October 08, 2022, 11:11:12 AMthey'll even go as far as doing many shady things to save themselves from collapse or to comply with regulations, so people who still use them should know this.I mean, this is absolutely true, and the whole Celsius issue has shown repeatedly that they did a multitude of shady or downright illegal things, but this is not one of them. This is a legal requirement. Any exchange which goes through a similar process will also be forced to submit such a list of names and transactions. Having your data exposed in such a way is a risk you accept when you use a centralized exchange.",

There is certainly scope for a guide on how to \"uncentralize yourself\" if you are already involved in centralization exchanges. As you say, using Bisq and cold wallets moving forward is an obvious step, but you also need to break the link between your identity and all the bitcoin you have already bought from centralized exchanges, via mixing, coinjoining, or even just selling it all and buying it back peer-to-peer. You will also want to request that as much of your data as possible is deleted, although centralized exchanges will legally have to retain it for some number of years (depending on your jurisdiction), and who knows how much or how little care they will spend processing deletion requests.Quote from: Lucius on October 09, 2022, 10:41:53 AMPerhaps the real danger is that someone will take advantage of these two databases and start comparing the data to try to identify valuable targets.Almost certainly. As I mentioned above, I'm sure blockchain analysis firms are already hard at work using this data to link addresses and wallets to specific individuals, and that data will then be sold to data brokers around the world. With one study showing that 99.98% of completely anonymized data could still be used to identify the specific individual it came from, then these data brokers will have no problem whatsoever working on data with just the address redacted. It won't be long before the majority of individuals in this Celsius data will have their exact bitcoin addresses and holdings linked directly to their real identities, for anyone who is interested to see it.",

Many a time I come across posts of users touting centralized exchanges as a necessary evil which one must deal with, and this is far from the truth.Whatever your deal with Bitcoin is, there's always a decentralized and private option which many choose to ignore:• For storing coins, there are so many non custodian wallets one can use, electrum, Bitcoin core etc.• For purchases and sales, there are P2P platforms like bisq.• For trading, there are also decentralized options.

Some of the services of some centralized platforms like Bisq are not available in our locations. Their policies sometimes don't suit our country and when it is available our currencies are hardly offered for transactions. In this case, decentralized wallets only suit bitcoin investments and not for daily or usual transactions. It would be nice if these firms that offer decentralized services expand their operations to more countries, especially those that have large bitcoin communities.QuoteI also think a large part of it is advertising. The likes of Coinbase and Binance obviously have huge advertising budgets, and market themselves aggressively to newbies via Google ads, Facebook ads, and so forth, whereas DEXs such as Bisq, by their very nature, do not have an advertising budget.In my location, I have never seen a single advert by any decentralized platform. They usually attract fewer investors and cannot compete financially with centralized platforms that have a large customer base. But recently according to  coindesk decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs) have grown faster than centralized exchanges (CEXs) over the past two years because customers want to avoid their annoying know-your-customer procedures. QuoteWe obviously can't force anyone to stop using centralized exchanges, but we can continue to point out the countless risks they take and countless examples of scams, hacks, thefts, breaches, and data leaks, all of which they expose themselves to constantly.It is very glaring that the disadvantages of using centralized exchanges are greater than their benefits. But sometimes we face so many challenges that force some of us to use these platforms. I think it is the collective responsibility of all bitcoiners in my country to raise awareness about the consequences of using these centralized platforms. We hope that in the nearest future our bitcoin society would be able to attract more decentralized platforms that would help us avoid these unreliable exchange firms.",
