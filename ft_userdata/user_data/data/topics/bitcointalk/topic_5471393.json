Because Yahoo published a news story, BlackRock plans to seed its Spot Bitcoin ETF in October. So most likely, they are planning to buy Bitcoin, and the price start to go up. From some tweets and other sources, it seems the ticker add upon ETF approval. But I am wondering why there is still no official news or announcement.Also Cointelegraph posted: BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF now listed on Nasdaq trade clearing firm — Bloomberg analyst",

Price has been very decent for the last days (and could be in anticipation for Bicoins halving next year?), so next step here is ETF FOMO.  Quote from: adaseb on October 23, 2023, 11:16:24 PMWondering if it has anything to do with this news because that was posted hours ago and the pump happened about 30 mins back. Probably it's all due to massive speculation. No one wants to be missing the bus, when Bitcoin is going to take off. We have seen it before - from 1k to 20k and from 10k to 65k - people, especially market experts or HODLers, know about it. It's much better to get in at 30k than to get in at 40k...",

Also ETF Blackrock’s clearing to trade at NASDAQ. So basically, ETF NASDAQ is coming as well which could inject more liquidity\".Regarding the \"clearing\" word, it means they already have clearance in NASDAQ but haven't started due to not having a weekly volume inflow just yet. This isn't the Bitcoin ETF approval yet.Now this is why the Bitcoin's price has slightly skyrocketed to as much as $34.2k before pulling back a bit to $33k quickly. I guess $34k would be the new possible resistance level or the Fair Value Gap. But the real question is on how long would the Bitcoin bulls keep up in this price range? Time will tell but this would be an interesting week for us to see on where Bitcoin would go after this.",

And just imagine if it is really true (I haven't read that it's confirmed yet). But in any case, good to see bitcoin making a rally at the end of the year and proving once more that October is a great month for us.The target of $40k-$50k at the end of the year is still on target.",

I'm also surprised to see the rally this morning, at the very least this proves that people are very easy to get into fomo when there are some speculative changes on the market. Nothing wrong with securing their profits though, it is impossible to make money if you don't follow the market to begin with. CMIIW.",

The first time we've seen it since May of 2022. Take note it's just a ticker symbol, and people are going like crazy, traders are trying to long the market to get short term profits. Can you imagine what can happen if what we're waiting happened. When the Blackrock ETF will be accepted. It's only a ticker symbol, but it is a positive sign already. People are very optimistic currently, and as for me, this would be a perfect time to sell some Bitcoins if you have, and take profit unless you're a long term holder then I don't recommend it doing. I will not be surprised if Bitcoin reaches $40,000 for the first time for a long time this year. This is what most investors are waiting for. A good news, but this isn't enough. A good news after a good news would be better. A series of good news would be the best one.  As for me, I don't have Bitcoins to sell currently, so I'll just watch the market. Congratulations to those who took profit I guess.",
