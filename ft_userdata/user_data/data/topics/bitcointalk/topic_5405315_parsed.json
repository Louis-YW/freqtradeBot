  "content": "So the thing is today sometime ago, I withdraw some ETH from FTX exchange to my trust wallet account! But I got no notification of receiving the ETH. Soon after that a notification popped up and somehow all the assets (ETH) was send to some random address. It did got in my account when I checked on the blockscan but immediately it was sent to that random address.here's a screenshot of it Also the address 0x8E456599dB2429cFf0AC8f9d5b5aA29E7C921642 - this is the Trust wallet address.So is there any way of refunding? And also is my account hacked? should I transfer all my assets to another account? or is it still safe to use! experts please leave your suggestions",

I've done the same but as I monitor the fees, I'm trying to look at better rates and once it's good enough for me, I did transferred.As said, no way of refunding it and if you've got some other assets left, transfer them to you as soon as possible. You may have downloaded a malicious app that have contained the malware and infected your PC.And before you transfer and confirm, always check the address many times for you to verify that you've got the correct one.",

You might not have been notified as the supposed hacker must have had this disabled too.Meanwhile, its important you confirm the keys by importing wallet on another device just to confirm so, you don't be sorry, do a hard reset on current device and import the wallet as well.
