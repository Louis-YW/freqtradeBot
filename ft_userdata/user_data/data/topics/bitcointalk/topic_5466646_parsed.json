The forum time may not have to work with your own local time in your country, what i expect from you is to know that the forum has the same time which you can view if you're on the forum regardless of the board you're, just look up by the right hand side and there you see the forum time and date, you can also view through your profile, you also can check under your profile look and preference and adjust to your own local time if you want.",

Forum time is subject because you can change it base on the time zone you preferred. You should pay attention on the time zone given by the campaign manager to make sure you are using the correct time format. The default forum time on my account when I created is UTC but some manager use different time zone so you can adjust it on your Look and Layout Preference on your profile.",

When you have changed your local time zone then others will also see the changed offset instead of the forum's default time zone.",

I hope now you looking at the right corner to observe the time. And the section where you were finding the forum time, is really a good place, you can find some decent topics there. Like the recent ones. But TBH, I never used that section for anything at all. As, recent section, consists of Bounties-related posts most of the time.

OP seriously where are you rushing to that you're so concern about the time?😅The time you see from the provided image is the main time, like they call it FORUM TIME and I believe it can never be the same as that of the time you have at home so it can be a minute late or an hour ahead or late.Like mine is 1 hour ahead of the FORUM TIME  When it's 1am in my country time it will be 12am on the FORUM TIME  so mine is ahead of the FORUM TIME So that's how it works and I hope you've gotten where it is and how it works so that you won't get confused, happened to me though.",

Good point.Local time is what you really know, with your clock, watch or on computer, you don't need to change it in your forum setting.Know what time zone a manager uses and simply remember it or if feel hard to remember, write it down and stick it on your working table.You can click on a manager profile and see his local time like Hhampuz.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=881377His local time is +2 of forum time.",
