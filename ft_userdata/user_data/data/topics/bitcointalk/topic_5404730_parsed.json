The current bear market did not affect the price as its majorly held by long term holders or hasn't caught the attention of whales.

AFAIK and from my personal experience, DApps on Tron network cannot compete with DApps on Ethereum and BSC is due to lack of public attention and trust regarding DApps on Tron network. The majority of developers also usually build their projects on these 2 blockchains (ETH & BNB), again, why don't developers want to develop projects on the Tron network? certainly due to a lack of public attention.",

You're talking about DApps and I've already answered your question with an answer regarding DApps residing on the Tron network. Now it becomes clear that you are actually questioning the development of the Tron network ecosystem as a whole. Did you know that Justin Sun issued his own Stablecoin (USDD) which originally ran on the Tron network? That's part of the development in the Tron network. For complete information regarding USDD (Decentralized USD), you can find out on the official website.",

Tron was still thriving but all they can do is copy someone else's project, themselves was a copy cat chain too. I think the confidence isn't that great yet on Tron, what people can see in it are the pump and dump side of the ecosystem. They are doing the USDD stablecoin and that's a huge leap but for me, it was an experimental move once again by Tron foundation.",

Because there is no new development of this blockchain. There is no initiative to attract investors. No new projects are being launched in this blockchain. This blockchain is now limited to TRC20 USDT transactions.This is what I am noticing, a lot of apps appeared during early 2020 until middle of 2021 and now nothing is happening for almost a year. There are only 2 acceptable dex's, none good enough as volume,the games available right now are just lame. I don't understand why it doesn't attract users.About USDD i find it normal for any chain to look for alternatives for tether, usdc and busd, I don't see the problem in creating your own stablecoin, no matter how shady or make the team rich",

So it is not surprising that Tron has not depreciated as much as other coins today. It is true that Tron will not die but it is really not a potential altcoin so the developers don't care much about the Tron network, they choose ETH and the BSC network.",

Tron(TRX) is a decentralized Blockchain-based operating system created by Justin Sun in 2018 but its owner is not taking seriously their project on a right wayWhen the owner of a coin is regularly part of the news for the right reasons doing partnerships, launching great products, and developing new use cases for their projects, So for sure, the price of the coin increases. In my mind, Tron(TRX) is a good project for the future but still, its owner lacks care for their project.Tron(TRX) is good for investment some experts say that the price of Tron(TRX) will rise again at the end of 2022 & their price go up as so far at 1$. I hope when the bull run startsit's clear that TRX will cross its All-time High but it's my opinion.
