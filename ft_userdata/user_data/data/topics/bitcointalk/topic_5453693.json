  "content": "What is a Bitcoin-backed Dedicated Server?Dedicated hosting is a type of web hosting configuration where an entire server is dedicated to a single client. Unlike shared hosting, where resources like storage, CPU power, and bandwidth are distributed among multiple websites, dedicated hosting provides all these resources solely to one user. This means the user has total control over the server’s resources, offering better performance, increased security, and more flexibility to customize software and hardware configurations according to the client's specific needs. And most importantly, a hosting provider must accept Bitcoin.Why Dedicated Servers by COIN.HOST?Pay with Cryptocurrencies: We accept payments for dedicated server hosting with crypto, stablecoins, and tokens. Our payment methods are as diverse as the digital world itself. Check our full list of accepted coins.DDoS Protection: Our platform offers extensive protection against DDoS attacks.
