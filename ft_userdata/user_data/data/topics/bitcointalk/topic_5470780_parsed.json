  "content": "They say that appreciation is a pathway to more blessings. When you appreciate the good or kindness in people, no matter how small, you create trust and establish a strong connection with them. Some people don't realize the value of appreciation, which is unfortunate. When you show appreciation, it makes others feel valued and appreciated and encourages them to do more for you and those around you. We should make appreciation a part of our daily lives.I want to thank everyone here who has helped or taught me valuable knowledge or lessons with their contributions. I want to give special thanks to certain groups of people here who have made it their mission to assist newcomers and members like us. We see all that you do, and you have displayed true leadership and mentorship skillsThank you to our legendary leaders, Heros and others. I could have mentioned names, but I don't know if it's against the rules, you all know yourselves. Thank you very much for all you're doing to make this forum organized. Where there is no leader, the people perish. You all are the real MVPs.",

Where there is no leader, the people perish. You all are the real MVPs.Mentioning names on the forum is in no way a crime my friend, but, the context through which you mention/use a person's name also matters a lot. So you are free to mention any name, you think has been of help to you here on this forum, because at times not everybody you think had helped you could even remember being of good help to you until you mention their names because, to some, they might have been doing their daily routine task, not knowing they were literally touching lives, not until you mention a name so as to make them feel special",

I like your diplomatic approach in writing this your posts and I must say that you did well for not mentioning names,  and to some extent I prefer it that way to avoid any unnecessary thoughts around people's heads because we are all human some love praises why other don't so you chose the one that best for you and you have done most easily and simply.",
