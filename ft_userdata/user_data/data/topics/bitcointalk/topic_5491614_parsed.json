If you check Binance withdrawal fees in the last 2 months and now, the withdrawal fees is probably the same despite the fact that the fees are down to less than 15/vb sats on average, anytime the Bitcoin mempool became congested, it has never gone pass 50/vb sats for many weeks now. This is exactly how they are treating ordinals, the Bitcoin transaction fees are down atleast for now but they wouldn't reduce the fees and raise it later if demands and hype comes from ordinals again but since they are no longer supporting the \"exploit on the network\", no need to reduce the fees.Now that they are stopping the supports, what next with the ordinals and the NFTs market in general, there is going to be a decrease in activities and will lead to reduce in interest and perhaps Bitcoin network will have a space to breath and allow normal transaction to flow without having to fight for the next block space.",

There are several blockchains made for NFT, go and explore that! May I suggest Matic? I strongly support the decision made by Binance to suspend bitcoin blockchain based NFTs from their marketplace.
