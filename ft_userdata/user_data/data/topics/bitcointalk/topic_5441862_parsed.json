I wouldn't want to be investing to something that doesn't raise enough money. Because according to your roadmap you have been trying to sell passports and land since q3 2022.And i am currently trying to figure out is all the graphics made by AI and post-processed by hand or do you have an actual artist with you.",

You will need a huge capital to make this work and I can see it from the number of cards available on your minting page for minting, 1 million cards at 0.02Ether is 20,000Ethers which is equivalent to approximately $30 million from minting alone. The problem I have with this is where is the demand going to come from when everyone has already minted their own card. Also, can you post your Github link so as to follow what the team is actually up to?",

Graphics look really cool, i didn't mean to diss them.Land is too pricey for my taste just for risking it so i buying a passport or 2 later on. And good luck for the sale. I am hoping you have put some money/tokens towards advertising too so you get to sell everything (although that would be 30k eth raised which would make this insanely big project)",

Also, can you post your Github link so as to follow what the team is actually up to?Thanks for your support. It means a lot. We don’t expect to sell out any time soon. The demand for minting passports comes from the need to obtain several characters to form a strong clan. Your clan members work together in open world (quests) mode, and can engage in battle with other players if they have chosen to enable battles on their account. Players will be able to choose if they want to fight or be left alone. You’ll want a number of strong Evium for this so minting is the best way to get Evium with strong attributes for “cheap”. We can expect strong Evium to enter the secondary market at much higher prices than mint value. There is an element of randomness in mint order, but there are no poor characters. All Evium have their strengths and weaknesses. Gamma energy Evium have high attack and defence values but tend to be weaker in other areas. Beta energy Evium tend to have higher HP than other groups. There are outliers of course. Example: Toocoodo from Omega energy has a defence figure of 100, the maximum, and they are oblivious to their defensive skill. They can also help defend your other Evium. Additionally, passports with high boost values are easiest to obtain by minting from the Evium website. We should iterate that selected game quests can only be completed if you have a particular Evium in your clan. You also need Beta Evium to explore Evium’s oceans. One Evium passport can be enough to have a great time in game, but can be so much richer when you have a large diverse clan. One should aim to have at least one Evium from every energy group of which there are 7.We have a GitHub but the nature of our work is not open source. Rest assured we have so much planned for the expansion of the Evium universe. Our GitHub username is ‘Evium’.Thanks for the reply. It seems you know what you want from this project, but there is a need to show proof of concept for people to take you seriously, almost every day I see close to 2 or 3 projects in this space and you are all competing for the same audience, though there is need for more improved cards and game studios in space but it requires a lot of energy, funding and commitment to reach that level, I will be following",
