Users continue to use that address as long as they use the platform, so scammers can deal with the matter more flexibly, as happens with addresses received on MetaMask.Platform owners should be aware of this and enable users to change their addresses whenever they want or request it.",

Because several people in the group suggest similar things for security reasons. While I have never tried it so far. because I still feel it's safest not to save the address book/contacts for the wallet which incidentally is from the exchange. As mentioned, exchange wallets may can be changes, so this is the reason I always input/scan for sending. There is concern (for my self), the virus can change the address on the contact if I save it that way.",

A single mistake can be disastrous. If you are not patient to double-check your transaction details, you would spend more time and resources to trace the fund you lost. Anyone that perceives the crypto space as a get-rich-quick system would soon be scammed. This is because he would be attracted to the mouthwatering profits advertised by fraudsters and would soon lose their investment.

Imagine sending all your coins only to discover that your clipboard has been hijacked by malware, not that I'm saying your computer or device is not immune to attack, it is just a precautionary action I choose to avoid unnecessary stories that will give me heartache, it is better to pay a cent to test your destination wallet than lose all your money at once.",

I agree never be in a rush to do a transaction. And never let anyone to put you under pressure to make a transactions. Scammers feed on the victims impatience because they know that they have a split second until the victim recovers themselves. On the other hand, aside scammers, always take it slow. Last year, I read the story of someone who sent $800 worth of bitcoin to a wrong bitcoin address. Why? He was driving and put under pressure to make the transaction quick. He should have waited until he got to his destination but he didn't. Coins got lost forever.",

Would you like the browser to secretly collect all the information about the sites you visit, changing links to referrals? In addition, it was noticed that the browser leaked the data of users who used TOR, thereby exposing them. And although their new version allows you to bypass TOR blocking, all its previous holes do not inspire confidence in its full functionality. Should you trust a product that regularly receives accusations? Take a look in Firefox.Also on the subject, read how dangerous it can be to use the copy and paste keys, CTRL-C and CTRL-V.",
