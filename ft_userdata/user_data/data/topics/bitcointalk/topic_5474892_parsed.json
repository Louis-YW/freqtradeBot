I want some honest opinions here.Even with all these and more supposed advantages of Monero over Bitcoin, I will still choose the later. A lot of projects have been developed with some claiming to be able to solve the scalability trilema that is attributed to Bitcoin but none have been successful in achieving this. There was a time ripple prided itself as being able to achieve this until time shows that ripple might be heavily centralized.  I believe with time, the weak side of this major contender will also surface and it will become obvious that Bitcoin will always be the leader. Nothing is perfect, but Bitcoin is unique in many respect. This argument of Monero is coming up again because of the high fees of Bitcoin which is a consequence of Ordinal attack on Bitcoin Network. \"This one too shall pass\"",

I can understand the comparison between Bitcoin and Monero in general, but in terms of privacy, Monero is better.Bitcoin was not built to enhance privacy in the same way as Monero, but rather to enhance transparency and make it difficult to track and stop who sent the transaction despite the possibility of knowing who sent it.",

I believe Monero has potential for future growth, but it's unlikely to surpass what Bitcoin has already achieved. Bitcoin remains the main cryptocurrency accepted by the majority, and even though it doesn't offer complete privacy due to government regulations, we still need Bitcoin to lead the market. This way, altcoins like Monero can have a chance to progress.",

Because I know there's a lot of DEXes that are supporting Monero, but it seems like centralized exchanges are rushing to drop it like a hot potato (because \"money laundering\" and \"crime\" and ... you get the idea).Centralized exchanges should not be taken to be the arbiter of what is a good coin or not. They will list endless numbers of outright scams if it makes them profit. All their decisions are driven only by what will make them profit, not by what is good for their users or the community.Quote from: 348Judah on November 21, 2023, 12:15:16 PMThere's no other cryptocurrencies that can provide you with the level of privacy you can have with bitcoinThis is just false. Monero is exponentially more private than bitcoin.Quote from: Helena Yu on November 21, 2023, 12:27:47 PMSo holding and using Bitcoin give you a neutral impression instead of Monero.Various governments around the world are currently advancing legislation to make it illegal to own and hold bitcoin outside of fully KYCed centralized exchanges and in your own wallet. So you will soon be viewed as equally suspect. The correct answer is not to acquiesce to these crazy regulations and give in to the surveillance state.I've said many times before that Monero is the only coin other than Bitcoin which I own and use, and the only altcoin I consider not to be a shitcoin. It shares many of the good things about bitcoin - decentalized, PoW, no premine, etc. - while also being far more private if used properly. I don't think it will ever replace bitcoin, but I also think it is one of the only altcoins which will continue to grow and continue to be used many years in the future.",

So, to me, Bitcoin is enough. When using a wallet like Electrum, I'm not providing any information about my real identity to anyone, so it's private enough for me. Perhaps, if someone really put their mind to it, they could find out my real identity, but why would anyone want to do that? It takes resources, and I'm just a regular human being. I don't mind Monero and the existence of similar currencies, but I also appreciate the transparency that comes with Bitcoin's pseudonymity, so I don't feel like I need Monero, personally.",

There is literally no competition in this market and the best part is that Monero is minable through CPU. You do not require those expensive rigs to mine this cryptocurrency. But the majority of the crypto users are mainly investors. They do not like to spend their cryptocurrency. I have no shame in admitting that I am also an investor. So monero is not something that are appealing to this investor community. Investors will always stay with Bitcoin because of the huge upside potential.

(thanks to you who pointed it out to me).I have some difficulties with monero, that I think can be addressed in this topic:1. I don't properly understand the address system it has. It supports stealth addresses. I have seen in various places on the internet that with Monero you can always use the same address and don't bother with changing addresses, like in Bitcoin. It seems strange though, because monero, like bitcoin uses UTXOs and not balance system like Ethereum.2. I can't sign transactions offline, no matter how hard I tried. Perhaps if I bought a Trezor model T, I would be able to do so, but for the time being, I can't.3. I am not sure whether the variable sized blocks are good or not... I haven't come to a conclusion yet, but I would like to hear your thoughts.Also Governments, CEXs, the Press, Twitter etc, HATE Monero. This is another reason why I love it.",
