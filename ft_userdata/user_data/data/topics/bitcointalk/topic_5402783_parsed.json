  "content": "You guys have probably heard the phrase “The future is multichain”. I’m a big believer in it myself, that’s why I love and support projects like THORchain and THORstarter, as their efforts for creating a truly cross chain crypto ecosystem are remarkable.If you guys are like me and are actually in it “for the tech, you probably didn’t miss the Cross Chain Expo, an event that just happened a couple days ago that united the biggest and most revolutionary minds and innovators speaking about what’s important about our multi-chain future. Some of the highlights for me were Maya protocol and THORstarter, Maya being the first THORchain friendly fork that aims to create a decentralized way to move native assets across blockchains, and THORstarter on the other hand, being the best (imo) chain-agnostic launchpad for new quality projects.This expo was actually an incredible thing to witness being a cryptocurrency and blockchain believer, and I truly hope it becomes a recurring and important event in the entire crypto world, as the conversations and discussions that took place were eye-opening. In case you missed it, the Cross Chain Expo and all it’s discussions were recorded so once they release they are probably  going to be posted. So keep an eye out for that.",
