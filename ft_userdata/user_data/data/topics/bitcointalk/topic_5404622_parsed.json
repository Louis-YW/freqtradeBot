  "content": "I love pancakeswap and uniswap and all of that, but I just want to have a swap that has absolutely none of that. Obviously it will require a liquidity in order to be a DEX, but that could be attracted from all routers that is possible, and find the best rate?So what I was thinking; a swap where you can swap any token in many chains. For example if you want to make a swap in ERC20 then it could use uniswap, or any other swap and their liquidity and search for the best one and whatever would give you the best return it will use that. If you want to do BSC then it will use the list and check the best rate there and would help you swap it. It is quite similar to what metamask has, metamask has a swap feature as well where you can turn your tokens into other tokens using metamask, but they actually use other dex places liquidity to do, so you are using metamask but in reality you are swapping on 1inch for example.I just want a website like that. It would have 5 chains for now, maybe add more later. It owuld check dozens and dozens of decentralized exchanges, find the best rates for you, and help you swap your tokens to any token you want with the best rate. And it would not have any native tokens because it is using other places liquidity anyway.Is this possible?",

How do you plan to keep the exchange running for long if there is no way to raise money, or, are you just going to depend on the small fees you take from users?2. Without own token, how do you plan to market your product?, you need something to use as an incentive, a rewardÂ  to encourage traders to use and keep using your exchange, how are you going to make this happen without own tokens?",

I also know BISQ dex for bitcoin don't have a token until now.It will be tough to keep the platform running if the developer of this tokenless \"DEX\" will only rely on rewards from running their own nodes on five different chains. I would rather create a controlled a privacy-centric P2P exchange and earn from commissions than maintain a DEX.",

DEX is not actually need the token to build its ecosystem but the main thing that is actually needed is the profesional programmers that can execute the code. Basically token was not the main thing for the ecosystem. You can build thing and basically that's called as aggregator. 1inch is also aggregator exchange site but this is not supporting so many chain. what about forking 1inch but adding more possibilities to connect with the various chains?",

We have a lot of DEXs that already exist that don't have their own token, the main purpose is just a DEX that operates as a decentralized exchange.I think Bisq exchange dont have tokens, they just only facilitate peer-to-peer or known us p2p trading by relying on automated smart contracts which are to do trades without an intermediary, so I think that is possible.",

They started a business! and take a very small % of the trade as a fee. These \"reward tokens\" are a gimmick that was enabled by leverage-fuelled bull markets, FOMO and widespread financial and econkmic illiteracy among crypto users.

With this idea, its basically what metamask does, metamask is not a swap at all, you are not going to be a swap in this idea, what I was asking is being a place that does what metamask does for swaps. I do not mean wallet by the way, do not get me wrong. Just because I said metamask, doesn't mean I mean a wallet. No. What metamask does is, you want to turn your X token to Y token in Z chain and they just go out there, check like a dozen dex places, and then they offer you the best return. For this job, they take a bit of a smalll cut.This would be the idea, its a \"swap\" but its not a swap, its just a middleman that finds the best rates for you, and in return takes a tiny bit of cut. Yes it would make a little amount, but who says I wouldn't be happy with just a few hundred dollars per month? That would be fine for me tbf, its just a hobby type of work.Would that work? Is it possible or viable?",

But without any form of incentivization or way to collect fees, how do you think your DEX will survive? Some DEXs use the underlying blockchain network's native token to pay for fees and whatnot. Others have their own token that's used for governance purposes.The thing the OP said about swapping any token using other DEXs as liquidity providers sounds more like cross-chain atomic swaps to me. This already exists but I believe it's still experimental. atomicDEX is one of those DEXs where you can swap almost any coin or token by using atomic swaps. Fees are subject to the coins' underlying network congestion, though. We're still in the early stages of DEX adoption, so any idea or proposal to help improve the sector would be of great benefit to the community. Just my thoughts",
