In the last few pages of the bitcoin white paper, it's clearly stated that it does not need any form of third party in order to execute its transactions. That was its purpose from day one: to eliminate trusting someone to do it for you and explain why you can do it for yourself without needing approval from anyone. Or did you read the back of the white paper? Or I was the one who did. It will be helpful if you can highlight the part that states the above statement that's getting you confused.",

Anyway, it does seem that Bitcoin is not on a path to be a p2p currency as described in the whitepaper. However, it can still be transferred p2p even if it can’t scale and you can still self custody, so there is hope that Mile will turn out to be wrong. However, the jury is still out.",

We don't really need any financial institutions for Bitcoin transactions.Clearly, the OP would like to do analyzes based on unrealistic and arguably imaginary probabilities. Although this seems a little naive, it explains the confusion in the minds of many, especially those who find it difficult to comprehend the idea that there is a transfer system that is actually capable of working without the help of a third party. It is a culture that has been entrenched in people's minds due to the current payment systems that always require the presence of an intermediary.I hope that the op’s vision is a little clearer now and I invite him to further examine the details of the Bitcoin protocol as detailed by Satoshi.",

So, it's nearly impossible to create sustainable de entralised system which would successfully balance between these two problems.",

I would tell you that almost every core bitcoiner will tell you that they frown upon a middle man when a P2P transaction is done, if you can go through the forum on centralized exchanges you see replies of members warning people off it and telling them to trust decentralized exchanges where there isn’t a middle man. But as we have it this technology is still new even if it is a more than a decade old, and this has made some people doubt the ability of a free P2P without middle man and as such the idea of an escrow comes in handy which is definitely something the centralized exchanges do. If you asked me I would say it doesn’t solve any problem and also doesn’t defeats any purpose of bitcoin rather it creates an open space for everyone to use it to the way that it suits them. This is probably why bitcoin is characterized as pseudonymous by some. But the idea of Satoshi wanting it to be a direct P2P still hasn’t been changed, it depends on your preference",

      "body": "Great point!!  Bitcoin can be used both ways.  Problem: most of the solutions provided by the market are third party because they benefit the provider and not the user.  The profit generating solutions require an additional revenue stream and that requires a third party in the transaction.  Can businesses provide solutions that don't centralize the transaction?I think we can. Everyone needs their own node.  That was Satoshi's vision.  Each transaction from a privately held node. No node, no peer-to-peer.There are two things that have to happen for a transaction to be p2p. First, each participant must have their own node and second, each participant must self custody their bitcoin.If people want a new form of money that transcends the fiat currencies we have now, the only option available is Bitcoin used the way Satoshi intended. Otherwise we have fiat banking 2.0.This concept is what gives Bitcoin it's value.  Without the potential to be a revolutionary money we are just using electricity to generate encryption codes.  Sounds like a waste of energy don't you think? But if that energy is used to create value stored in a new form of money then you have something.https://webtc.io",

Bitcoin is a pure peer-to-peer transaction which still stands today, people send Bitcoin to each other the way they like but now, there are groups of people that brand exchange as creativity(centralized exchanges) which some people feel is safer for them( I don't blame, them, that is what they grow up to see when they come around) but using decentralized is more of p2p than centralized exchanges.One of the challenges is that you can't stop how people want to use their bitcoin, it's meant to be pair to pair but some people also want trade their bitcoin into other branded altcoins they need or want to have, and the fastest way this can be done safely without running into a scam is through the middle man (third party in this case), so this is what you can't change but Bitcoin remain a pair-2-pair transaction.",

(In case you didn't know it, both implement KYC and treat the currency as non-fungible)Ultimately, I think we're approaching greater decentralization as times goes by.
