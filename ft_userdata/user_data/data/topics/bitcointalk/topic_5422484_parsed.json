  "content": "If I became a CEO of  a company,I will be a man of my words,I will go to work earlier before any other staff just to  show them how I suffer before getting here,so that they will also learn that punctuality and consistent is the driving key to good success.In a bit to these ,I just want to drop an expression that even though you,re a boss or the oga,no need to sleep til noon before going to work,by going early it portray you don't play with your company and as your staffs see that examplary lifestyle they will also not play with your company.A phrase for thought.",
