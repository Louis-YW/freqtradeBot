  "content": "I have been using lightning payments for the last few months quite often, but now all of my payments seem to fail all the time.After providing the deposit request, the payment does not go through and I get an error window \"Payment failed Giving up after 25 (or sometimes more) attempts\".In the lightning network I am connected to 4 peers, 15K nodes and 83K channels.I also tried trampoline routing with the same results.Any ideas on how to make lightning payments work?",

      "body": "The most common issue from lightning network payment failure is sometimes no balance so do you have enough funds?Also, if you open a channel with low-quality peers then you will also get this error based on this \"Why did my network payment fail\". Would you mind to try to reopen a channel? It might fix your issue update here if it didn't.",

      "body": "I guess you've already closed your channel and opened another one so this is mostly just for more info:Quote from: bomberb17 on September 22, 2022, 01:55:09 PMAfter providing the deposit request, the payment does not go through and I get an error window \"Payment failed Giving up after 25 (or sometimes more) attempts\".In the lightning network I am connected to 4 peers, 15K nodes and 83K channels.Not just your channel, the receiver should also have enough liquidity or connection for it to go through.Do you often send to different services/wallets or just one?If just one, the receiver's channel might have a very low receiving capacity, not enough for the \"deposit request\" invoice.If tried to different recipients, and if you can't send to all of them, then the issue must be in your channel.Also check your channel's status if it's still \"OPEN\" before sending anything.Quote from: bomberb17 on September 22, 2022, 01:55:09 PMI also tried trampoline routing with the same results.It will render your channel(s)' sending capacity frozen if your channel's remote node isn't a trampoline node (with kangaroo icon).Since it's \"same results\" and not prompting you to open another channel, yours must be trampoline.In that case, leaving \"trampoline routing\" active is better for faster/better connectivity (the hard-coded trampoline nodes are well-connected anyways).",
