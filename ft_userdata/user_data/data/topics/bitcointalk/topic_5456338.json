Just like the heading reads, I received that amount of Bitcoin from an unknown address and don't know what to do about it. Should I spend it or let it be?The decision is left for you to make: where did you receive the money, your exchange address or a personal wallet that you have total control of? If you know you are not expecting money from anyone and you are sure the money did not belong to you and you are also not the type that takes what belongs to others, I think the best thing for you to do is to send it back to the sender. You can trace back who ever sent the coin from the transaction history, then you can get the wallet address, and you can just send it back to where it came from.If this is actually true, it's a lot of money to even come out in the open and be announced, and this kind of money can give one a lot of positive thinking, so it's now left for you to choose what to do with it.",

You can send it back to the address that sent it to you if you are bothered or use mixer to have a privacy to that amount.If this is true, You will not gonna make a public post about it since you are just attracting scammers that will claim ownership for that amount.",

Just like the heading reads, I received that amount of Bitcoin from an unknown address and don't know what to do about it. Should I spend it or let it be?First it is tricky to actually decide on what do currently, because one it could be a stolen funds looking at how huge this is and probably the thief went through something like a mixer. So the first thing to do is to wait a little bit and check the public key or address from which the funds came from since everything is recorded on the public ledger this will give you the idea of how that address sends out this funds. If coincidentally the address actually sends similar funds to multiple address like yours then I will advise you to wait a little bit maybe some information will come out. I doubt this is just a serial mistake of copying wrong address considering the number of bitcoin involved. And if you hastily send out this coins back now you might be aiding a thief or you yourself getting into a hacking scam",

Should I spend it or let it be?I believe this to be the biggest lie I've read of on this forum In the last 3 or more years, to be sincere, anybody who owns up to 65 bitcoin is not a newbie, and should know the basics of safely sending crypto so he or she does not end up making a mistake as this, it is unheard of that any body in time past sent 1 bitcoin to a wrong address by mistake, not to talk of you receiving 65 bitcoin from an unknown address..If you must be taken seriously, then I will advice you share the transaction ID here for everyone to see, otherwise, I will just see this as one big fat lie, and solely for the purpose of making us to believe you are an honest person, as well as earn merit.",

With the way hackers are on the loose, it's possible that you've just received BTC that a hacker was trying to move to another address and unfortunately or fortunately as the case maybe, must have entered yours.  It's a huge amount and I understand your dilemma, OP, but I think I'd consider this option or possibly send it back.

Should I spend it or let it be?This sounds strange to me.How could someone make such a mistake with such a large sum of Bitcoin?Although it is feasible, it is unlikely, because anyone with such a large sum of Bitcoin is a savvy Bitcoin investor who would never make a mistake like transferring Bitcoin to an unknown address. Nonetheless, you can be generous and see whether the Bitcoin's owner responds.But I'm remaining suspicious of this scenario because it sounds odd to me.If you are prepared to return back the Bitcoin, I am sure anyone claiming to be the sender will have to produce transaction data from Blockchair to claim the Bitcoin.",

You do not need to create such scenarios which looks like lies as you can still get attention.But if you do really received 65 BTC, then its a good news for you, but be assure from where you had received them are they white or black (i hope you understand) do no try to withdraw them from CEX because if they are black then you might be questioned by Authorities near you. (It's just my thought i am not asking you to do it) but if you do want to return it to the real owner be aware of that too because they would get in some problem if they are that rich. Its upto to give them back or not because who are we to tell you,. If you are a man of morality and does not care about money then you should give them back but before returning it to them make a public announcement and share the news with News companies and on social media and you can get famous by using this scenario as i think its a big news. But still, if i were you, i would give them back no wonder my life would become more easy but still its not my money someone mistakenly send it to you so i would prefer to give it to them but i would also try to get some fame because that's at least i could do.

Follow your Church mind: By this, you send back the entire money to the sender's Bitcoin address, after all, it's not your money and you have access to the details of the sender.2. Follow your Church mind with a little alteration: With this, you might send only 64 BTC and keep the remaining 1 BTC as the inconvenience fee. I can only imagine the psychological issues going on with you on this money right now, so for the inconvenience caused by the person's mistake, let such pay for it.Ordinarily in court, if you have a good lawyer, such a person might still be compelled to credit you with something for the inconvenience of receiving such an amount that will never be yours by mistake that has caused you psychological issues.Conclusion: These are the best deals anyone could go for. After all, over 50% of people would disappear with the money, yet you are not stealing it but sending it back.Above all, let your spirit guide you.",

An individual who would send that much money using BTC will definitely double-check and triple-check the address before confirming. If he still made a mistake after that, he really is careless. He will not get the BTC back whoever he may complain. But the OP's story however may not be true though.Like anyone above, they would appreciate it if there is a tx ID and his inbox will really be a party if he posts it.
