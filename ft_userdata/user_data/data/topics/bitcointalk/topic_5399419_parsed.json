  "content": "ok before everyone tells me that I am wasting my time I am not mining bitcoin. I am mining Cheetah(CHTA) and Nengcoin(NENG) but they are in the same algo family.  These coins and local wallet nodes are pretty fun and you can make a little money surprisingly.  I am not sure where else to ask since the Altcoins forum sent me here.I was hoping someone would know but I need a newer version of CGminer that supports pure solo addressing. I can do this in Cgminer 4.1.12 with my gekko miners but the gridseed  I cant find anything newer than 3.8.5 and it doesn't support this argument,--btc-address <arg> Set bitcoin target address when solo mining to bitcoind (mandatory)I was reading about following the instructions for compiling a new build from Github but I dont see anything about compiling the gridseed libraries or support files into it.this is an example of the arguments I use for a gekko or antminer to pure solo mine with to a local node.cgminer.exe -o http://127.0.0.1:8536  -u pos  -p cap --gekko-newpac-freq 450 --btc-address CaNJXn5KgMeaFMtgVwuJaK2rU8uPcGNCgiThe --btc-address argument is not supported by cgminer verison 3.8.5 which seems to be the most recent version that does support gridseeds.Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated in brining this older miners back to life. Thank you in advance.",
