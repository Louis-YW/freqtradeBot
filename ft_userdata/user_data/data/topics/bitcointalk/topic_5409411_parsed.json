  "content": "Introduction:My name is Michel and for the past year, We've been working on a project, called Cypher, and now building a group of developers called \"Cypher Crypto Labs.\"Cypher is a new Blockchain/Cryptocurrency whose purpose is to prohibit data collection and espionage by companies and Governments and companies in private Messengers.As we all know, companies like Google, Apple, Snapchat, Meta and many others, are collecting data of their users, and partially maliciously using it. Now even if these companies don't use it in a bad way, if at some point they have a data breach, your data, and more importantly, your messages will be stolen. Even if that is not the case, a government could pass a new law to stop encryption (or add a secondary encryption where the government receives the decryption keys) and/or force companies to collect more user data. This has already happened in a few countries, and is a violation of privacy, and is a huge weakness in the security of such Live-Messenger services.What is Cypher and how does it help with this problem?Cypher is a decentralized Live-Messenger built on Blockchain technology. This means in simple terms that the infrastructure on which Cypher runs (Nodes) will be used to run a decentralized Live-Messenger, thus preventing data collection and spying by companies or governments.There is an in-depth explanation in the Whitepaper which you can find on GitHub.Get involved:So now that you know what Cypher is, and why it is a project in the first place, We would like to ask you to take a look at the project. If you are a developer, you can contribute to Cypher, it's written in JavaScript, and built on NodeJS.Currently We are planning on launching a test network, with the aim to test the stability of the Nodes, and find potential bugs. For this a Network of 128 Nodes or more would be ideal. Everyone who contributed to the Source Code and this test network will later be rewarded with 100 Cypher (which will cover the minimum staked Coins to become a Validator/Forger) on the real public Network, once it is launched.Cypher Crypto Labs. is a group of people that will actively develop the Cypher Blockchain, with the help of contributors. If you want to join, all you have to do is help with the Cypher Project.We believe in Free and open source Software, where \"Free\" means freedom of your data, freedom of use, and free as in free Beer.Feel free to ask questions, we will try to answer them as fast as possible. Thank you a lot for your interested in the project, we are looking forward to work with you!Michel from Cypher Crypto Labs.Links:GitHub: https://github.com/CypherCryptoLabsWhitepaper: https://github.com/CypherCryptoLabs/WhitepaperNode: https://github.com/CypherCryptoLabs/CypherDiscord: https://discord.gg/bZ3HVZJUSwEDIT: added discord link",
