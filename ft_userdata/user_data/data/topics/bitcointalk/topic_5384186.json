  "content": "Everyone who is into bitcoin has heard this story before.A guy cloned his hard drive and threw away the wrong drive in the trash and knows it was in a landfill site. Think they made a episode on the US sitcom series Big Bang Theory out of it.But the story didn't end there as the person wants to have permission to excavate the site looking for this hard drive with over $275 million worth at today's price of bitcoin.\"A man from the Welsh city of Newport has offered his city council a 25% cut of his 7,500 bitcoins if it allows him to excavate the landfill where he threw away a hard drive containing the fortune in 2013.\"source: https://www.businessinsider.com/man-offers-council-70-million-dig-up-bitcoin-hard-drive-2021-1He is willing to give the city of Newport in the UK a cut of the bitcoin at a sum of $70 million so to be able to do this with approval of their local government.This story has been run all around the globe at this point and has alot of people scratching their heads as to why he would need permission to rummage around a landfill site in garbage. Alot of countries allow those who want to go around their local trash site looking for pop cans for recycling or whatever they want to bring out of it. Since it is just garbage there.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/uk-man-makes-last-ditch-effort-to-recover-lost-bitcoin-hard-drive.htmlCall it the green initiate if you want but there are many who scavenge around in trash looking for those gems.As they say: \"One man's trash is another man's treasure!\"",

Who thinks that it’s still gonna be in at least poor condition to dig it up and run smoothly ?It’s not worth it.",

The land is owned by a local council and they will NEVER let a member of the public go looking through any rubbish. Imagine someone going rummaging and they manage to get a used syringe needle stuck into themselves - this person could then easily sue the council.

I think it is a hopeless idea and government might put it into consideration. It is good if they get $70M from the offer but the chance to find the disk and be able to recover Bitcoin inside is very very low. They can not arbitrarily break or adjust laws just because of small hope for $70M.",

First, the hdd is not operational so the life is much longer than only 9-20 years. Second, the important thing here is the data stored on the platters, the condition of the platters is crucial not the drive itself.

There is a small ventilation hole on the top cover with filters, so the HDD can \"breath\" when the air pressure changes like on higher altitudes but even if there's corrosive fluid leaking into the drive which is highly unlikely, the platters are made of aluminum or ceramics covered with magnetic \"dust\" which is coated with extra layer of carbon. There are probably mechanical damages from the transportation to the final point, but since the drive was not in operation the heads probably hit only at one specific spot on the platters, creating physical damage.I assume the guy threw his whole computer with the mounted HDD inside, if that is the case then the chances to recover the hdd are much higher.

Also was thinking since it was 10 years ago, ssd drives were in existence then so it might be one of those that have their data collected on the drive differently and I think last longer and in harsher conditions than one with moving parts.If he had said what kind of drive it was (brand, type, year made) then it would of been more helpful in determining if it could be still salvageable.Maybe in the countless other sources of this very same story he did but I only referenced the two I found the most recent even if a year old.The hard drives in those army-grade laptops (tough books) which are used by the military and police officers should have drives that are more resistant to the elements or even a bullet & electrofrequencies.",

Both articles from the OP are more than 1 year old, and besides, there is no evidence that this man ever had so much BTC in his possession, nor that he threw the HDD in the trash. Someone who works in the IT industry (or has worked) must have known better that HDD is never thrown away (at least that's my rule) - because you never know if you'll ever need it or if someone will manage to extract some confidential information from disk. Who says a worker hasn't already found that HDD in a dumpster? It would have been much smarter if he had tried to find the disc without creating so much media attention - I mean the time when he discovered what nonsense he had done.As far as I know, at first he was allowed to dig in the trash and look for a disk, but when he announced it in the media and when people started coming to the dump, the authorities had no choice but to ban further searches.

After unsuccessfully trying to negotiate with the Newport City Council for 25% of the amount stored on the hard drive, \"Even if we were able to agree to his request, the question arises as to who would cover the costs if the hard drive was not found or was damaged to such an extent that the data could not be restored\" - the Newport City Council replied to him. James Howells claims that his ambitious plan has received financial support from a hedge fund that will claim part of the giant amount. Now he plans to start a 12 month search at a landfill containing 400,000 tons of garbage, for this purpose artificial intelligence-based scanners, X-ray scanners and other high-tech tools will be deployed. This is reported by The Sun newspaper https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15496798/james-howells-275million-bitcoin-hard-drive-search-landfill/Quote from: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15496798/james-howells-275million-bitcoin-hard-drive-search-landfill/    So by that deadline in search of the most valuable hard drive in the world he has July of this year til this venture expires.",
