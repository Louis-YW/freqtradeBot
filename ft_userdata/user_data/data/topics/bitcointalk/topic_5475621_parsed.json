I really like to know what's going on here, but I don't have the time to go through 10 topics to find what I want to read.That's why I was thinking about a thread collecting all the gossip and making it easy to adjust the clock to the current forum situation.Kind of TL;DR for lazy ppl Where shall this thread find its home?",

Like in the same way people update the thread of signature campaigns in the service discussion section of the forum? I am not sure how interested people are about gossip and drama (I personally prefer to look and not comment at all) but it would take at least a half dozen of people to be willing to get out their way to collect all that information. Also, perhaps you already saw it, but there seems to be a little bit of drama going on, concerning some red-tag left on the admin profile. You may want to take a look at it...",
