The Euro has been worth well more than the dollar for many years but they are on par right now and I don't think that things are going well for it, the winter is coming! I'm afraid the inflation of USD will continue for a while and both, USD and Euro aren't great options right now.You need some money for emergency cases, so, you can't save everything in crypto because it's very volatile, the exchange charges you some fees to deposit/convert and withdraw.I'm thinking about four currencies to hold for the next 2 years or more:Swiss FrancNorwegian KroneChinese YuanJapanese YenWhat are your plans? I want to get an answer, especially from Europeans cause we all lost 12% of our money in a matter of days.",

      "body": "Let me start by saying that fiat is not money, fiat is currency.As an investment to keep your purchase power, I still stick to bitcoin, gold and real estate because all of them are good investments that are always appreciating over time (real estate may be different in other countries).Quote from: Synchronice on September 11, 2022, 07:21:50 AMYou need some money for emergency casesYou need to have your own country's fiat because when you go to the grocery store in lets say London you can't really pay then with Japanese Yen!Quote from: Synchronice on September 11, 2022, 07:21:50 AMyou can't save everything in crypto because it's very volatile,You should never ever store anything in \"crypto\" because it is always dumping. Which is only bitcoin is considered a long term \"investment\" not cryptocurrencies. Quotethe exchange charges you some fees to deposit/convert and withdraw.Technically the profit should be high enough so that you don't care about the small amount of commission you pay, if it isn't then maybe you made some bad choices.QuoteI'm thinking about four currencies to hold for the next 2 years or more:Swiss FrancNorwegian KroneChinese YuanJapanese YenThe problem with fiat currencies is that the government keeps printing more of them, specially when they face a crisis (like the ongoing energy crisis in EU). That means they all lose their purchase power.Besides, at this point relying on another country's currency is very hard because of what the world is going through. For example if China invades Taiwan (which is very likely this year) it will pull Japan and Korea in that war which could tank all their currencies.That's not to mention the economic war that China would wage on the world specially EU and US that have their economies tightly tied to the Chinese.This makes the future very unpredictable in my opinion. Which is why I believe traditional assets like gold are more reliable than anything else. And of course bitcoin but with a higher risk due to how bitcoin is designed.",

Calculation of the volume - 2-3 months of family life (food, refuel a car, clothes, medications, etc.). The equivalent is not more than $4,000.- Cryptocurrencies In wallets, 15 tokens from Bitcoin to Avalanche.- A small reserve of euros (due to the difficult situation in the EU, the amount is small). Calculation - moving to the EU is allowed, no more than 2-3 months of family life + possibly renting housing + food. The equivalent is not more than $6,000.Yuan - I wouldn't risk it. The growing global crisis of the Chinese economy is clearly not going to be positive for the yuan either. Inflationary process and a lot of difficulties are ahead.",

I want to get an answer, especially from Europeans cause we all lost 12% of our money in a matter of days.From everything you mentioned, Bitcoin seems to be the best option for me, not only because the Euro is weakening and losing its purchasing value, but because I trust the decentralized system more than the institution called the ECB (European Central Bank). Given that my country is not yet in the Eurozone, I always have a certain amount of local currency that I need for everyday life, but luckily I can buy a lot directly for Bitcoin.If I had to choose something else, perhaps the choice would be the Swiss franc for the reason that Switzerland has always been and probably will be neutral regardless of what happened in Europe. Of course, gold is always an option, in case everything goes to hell we will return to the time when it was a universal way of payment anywhere in the world.",

The fiat original value will surely back to it’s original price once the market already recovered like what happened to Rubble that plummet during the start of the war but now already recovered after people that already panic convert there Ruble buy back again. I’m leaving on a separated country and maybe this is the reason why I don’t feel the urgency on investing on different fiat currency.Why not Bitcoin?1. Why fiat? More precisely, the part in fiat. Because - there are often situations when using a payment system or a debit card is simply technically impossible.2. The ruble has not recovered, the ruble is artificially restrained in order to keep the population of the country of the world terrorist from panic  Soon you will see the real exchange rate of the ruble...3. Bitcoin - I will explain very simply: imagine that you bought, with all your fiat savings, bitcoin in November 2021... What would you say about bitcoin now?",

USD inflation is above 8%, as is the Euro. NOK is only marginally better at ~6.5%. CHF is still pushing 4%, despite historically being one of the most stable currencies in the world. Obviously you need to hold your local fiat (or USD if widely accepted and your local fiat is hyper-inflationary) to cover living expenses and emergencies, but holding fiat as an investment will only ever lead to loss of purchasing power. Unless you are making gains above the rate of inflation, then you are losing money.I would only hold an emergency fiat fund in the best rate of return fiat account you can find. Everything surplus goes in to some kind of investment which will outperform fiat over the medium to long term.",

Based on the current situation, having cash on hand gives you more peace of mind since during the calamity, almost all your online transactions will be limited.
