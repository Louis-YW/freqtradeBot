Female in general is not attracted on gambling therefore there’s very little demand on sports involved woman in gambling industry.Most user here follow men sports as support to our favorite team. Sports existence is not for gambling while gambling is not that popular to woman. It just happened that sportsbook cover both gender for their book.",

Quote from: Queentoshi on October 10, 2023, 01:38:11 PMIs it not easier to win on gambling on women sports than men's sport?would you mind elaborating as to why it would be easier to win when betting on women's sports than men's sports? are you saying that women's sports are far more predictable than men's sports?",

You can check it out and join it if you like. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404654.0About the question, I think it's because traditionally people are used to watching the men's game and now that there's also a league for women it still needs to gain attraction for more people to support it. Even women fans do watch the men's game more but I don't think there's a deep meaning with that. It's just that it must be introduced to people first and it's not like in just a snap fans will come to watch them. It's slow, but I do believe they are getting there. WNBA had been selling out their tickets in the playoffs and now in the Finals so it's somehow improving.",

It's always men who discuss sports and betting.Somehow a group of ladies doesn't always discuss sports with them, they just talk about boys. I don't even see the women talk about WNBA that is supposed to be for them. Instead, women watching the NBA.",

      "body": "Women sports I think does not have that vibes and momentum like the men sports and in terms of popularity, the men sports are much more popular compared to the women sports although women are good players because the time I watched their sports, I saw good players amongst them and their performance was excellently displayed for all to see but I think their sports should be given priority to make public and gain more recognition it deserves. At least they gain attention and recognition when it comes to other sports like volley ball and basket ball. Although I have seen some  of the casinos put up women games for gambling too which is encouraging so that the female would have that sense of belonging and to patronize their gender games as well.I had another thought about the women sports as it relates to performance. Not every  gambler knows the women team key players to gamble for. Some do check for historical performance before gambling because that gives one a bit assurance of win in the men sports and another too from analysis from others gamblers that do play men sport game regularly too one can gamble but in the women sports if you are not a regular type that watches female sports how do you know gamble even when you have some one to do the analysis for you, you would doubt it because their names are not popular.",

Is it not easier to win on gambling on women sports than men's sport? or is there no gambling site offering odds for betting on women sports?Female sports are not popular in many countries. In fact, many people don't watch female games in my location because they see it as a waste of time. I think it also has some cultural and religious undertone. Most cultures or religions don't give women the privilege or freedom to express themselves. In some nations, females are barred from engaging in some sports and this will discourage investors from gambling firms. Another issue is that you can't compare the quality of male sports and female games. The male competition is more serious, exciting and entertaining. Sometimes female sports are so boring that you might even sleep off watching them. But this doesn't mean that there are no interesting female matches.All sports are unpredictable so we cannot assume that female games are easier to predict. An example is the just concluded World Cup when some African nations defeated a few highly rated female teams. Popular games like the female World Cup are also covered by some gambling houses but I have never bet on them.",

If you really want to, you can open a thread about women's sports here to represent that, of course it will open up discussion for other female gamblers to discuss. Moreover, this forum is open without selecting men and women, it's just that the discussion of topics is mostly made by men, so there are lots of discussions about men's sports, personally I don't follow women's sports betting.",

I remember betting on the Women's Champions League a few months ago, and when it came to the playoffs, you can never trust the big favorites to secure the win most of the time (even with the home advantage). The amount of upsets that happened was too much, i'd better switch to a different sport and go back to the leagues that i'm more familiar with before I lose most of my profits and bankroll.",

Is it not easier to win on gambling on women sports than men's sport? or is there no gambling site offering odds for betting on women sports?When you assume that low engagement on women sports is due to casinos not offering odds on the sports, I would say that its far from that, at least, in the last women world cup that ended just few months ago, a lot of casinos, both global and local casinos offered odds on the games, I even placed a few bets on some of the games, some I lost while other I won,Personally, I would say that the major reason why discussions on women sports is very low is possibly due to the low interest, you will agree with me that women sports is not always as interesting as the men's, and this I assume is because men's sports are more competitive than that of the women, and it doesn't end there, men display aggressiveness in their game, which is something i believe the fans like to see, its trilling and always exciting.This are qualities women sports lack, and personally, i believe this are the reasons why interest in women's sports is very low compared to that of the men.",

I also suspect that the reasons why most football or other sport bettors prefer to speculate the male matches more than the female matches is because females score more in their matches and it seems so hard to predict how many scores and which club is going to score higher in the matches,  so this male footballs matches becoming the favourite for some sports speculators.",

I rarely like to watch tennis. However, let's come to your point, all gamblers bet on sudi men's games. The main reason for this is that the sports that we gamble or like to bet on are men's sports because we mostly watch men's sports. So all those who are gamblers are more experienced in men's games, be it football, cricket or casino etc. Although women's sports are seen on the surface, they are always watched carefully, because of which many things remain unknown about the game. For example: how a team plays, how they have played in the past, how a player plays, etc. From my experience I can say that to bet on any sport one must have thorough knowledge about that sport. If one bets before becoming experienced then the gambler will definitely lose his money.",

Of course we would really be that interested on betting on men or males games which it isnt really that something boring where movement is really that masculine and not really that something that you could really be that bored of when it comes to game executions and movements which it is really that totally opposite if we do speak about women who would really be that playing. We arent really that interested on something that we dont prefer or does have in mind and this is why its not shocking that there's a significant difference in between interest and demand.",
