As for deleting posts, I find it annoying and it can prove difficult I imagine to verify certainfacts in the future.If people are worried about privacy they can always buy items anonymously, obviously thatwouldn't work with raffles and auctions.But in traditional auctions can't people bid \"over the phone\" so essentially their identityis only known to the auction house and eventually the seller. Could something like thatwork on the forum?",

Fact is, it’s not your call regardless of how annoying or inconvenient it is. There is no need to take things personal as I pointed out a mitigation strategy to show issue with the example, so slow down.  I never made a call so I'm not sure why you say its' not my call regardless of how annoying or inconvenient it is; this is invalid in the context.  I know it's a big world out there and you would be surprised at the amount of requests I have gotten to take pics of items with someone else's \"username/id\" and date, along with either upfront payment or part of the proceeds.  I wouldn't dare compromise our niche and ever growing space of collectibles- yes, we are still under the radar but this won't always be the case.  What I am saying in essence is the simple step of user name and date in picture with item has prevented an untold amount of scams from even happening.  Perfect, not exactly; very effective thus far- hell yes!",
