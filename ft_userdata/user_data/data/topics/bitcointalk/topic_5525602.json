Bitcoin was created with very specific goals in mind to empower you to break free from the traditional financial institutions. Bitcoin has reached to a stage where even the countries like US can't ignore it anymore. It was one of the agendas for Trump to win the presidential battle. Everything has a purpose and Bitcoin has been constantly deliverying on its purposes.",

Sorry but I 'll agree with headingnorth.The great majority of people who buy altcoins don't even know that they own them.I 've seen multiple occasions where people buy an altcoin based on a Twitter meme, and then forget they even had it.Especially this statement Quote\"After all they won't invest anything if they don't know what the investment is all about. \"is the exact opposite from what really happens, unfortunately.I 've never hidden that I 've been in the altcoins market before I turned bitcoin only. My post is based on personal experience, so I can't provide proof, but I am very serious about it.So, if you read the whitepapers etc, really congrats, because you are among the very very few.",
