When the people we call leaders enter into power they ignore their responsibilities and work towards achieving their personal interests. So with these experiences, e dey very difficult to tell person say make him/her vote without reasoning to collect money which will then result to wrong choices of candidates. But realistically, this is not another chance to get it right but the last chance to get it right.",
