I think it's the former to be honest. It sounds very odd that someone getting a hardware wallet (knowing what the Hardware wallets are for) ends up typing down its own seed during the setup. If this is true, this guys did not even do the basic research he was supposed to before buying a wallet.Before buying something on the internet I usually watch reviews, video tutorials, opinions, anything I can find; specially if it is about a device which is intended to preserve assets. So this man woke up one day, over-heard that hardware wallets are the safest way to store Bitcoin and alt-coins, did no research and jumped onto Amazon immediately.  Any responsible hardware wallet user knows how to set up theirs, even before it arrives in the mail and if something is slightly different from what learnt previously. red flags everywhere.",

Yes, but as others have said it would have to have been someone who had no idea of how crypto worked or how a hardware wallet works. AND also not know any basic IT / PC security tech knowledge.Is it an attempt to get hits / views? Most likely. Is there a possibility of it being something else. Yes.Also, people do make mistakes, some people own up to it and try to make it right, others just blame.-Dave",

It is always important to be cautious and diligent when it comes to purchasing and using hardware wallets for storing cryptocurrencies. While buying directly from the source may offer some additional peace of mind, it is also common for many people to purchase hardware wallets from trst able retailers such as Amazon.

What are the chances he bought a counterfeit Ledger or the Ledger box as altered so we would visit the fake website after going through the setup.
