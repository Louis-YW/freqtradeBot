  "content": "Hi guys, can someone help me? Here's a background.* Paper wallet generated from dot_walletgenerator_dot_net * Funds have been sent to this wallet over the past two years.* 7 days ago, wallet was wiped out.* Balance is now zeroThinking back, I believe the mistake was made when generating the wallet. Instead of going offline, the wallet was generated while still connected to the Internet.What are the chances of the BTC being recovered. I saw a company called hireahacker(.)com which appears to be genuine but in this type of marketplace how can you be sure? I would be very grateful for any opinions and more importantly whether there's any hope in recovering the stolen Bitcoins.Thank you in advance.",

Do you think it's not worth using a hacking website like the one I mentioned? Or am I throwing good money after bad? I can give a good example of a specific type of scam here.Once there were many HYIP/MLM websites that used to pop up, run for a month or two and then one fine morning shut down without a trace leaving the investors on this forum discussing about where their money vanished. A few days later a website claiming to recover money lost on that site comes up and asks for a small fee from everyone in order to get their money back. The ones who do that, are hopeful that this \"recovery service\" will help them, but after a few days even the \"recovery service\" stop responding.I prefer to call this the recovery scam. It is common when people are in a chaos and emotional about lost money. Whether it is applicable in your case - I think you have already understood that. Remember that to keep bitcoin secure you need to secure your devices, how you generate and store your keys, what shit you download from the internet. So called people who hack and recover stuff are mostly charlatans.",

It's probably best to do it offline and with a LiveCD. You should also sure to download the source code from the official GitHub repository: https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.orgHi! I just want to point out that JS is not a superb language to use for entropy generation. The reason behind my claim is that they usually tend to use user input to generate it. For instance, they tell the user to move their mouse around. This process looks \"random\" but in my opinion it is not the safest. I don't know whether they (at bitaddress) do something that increases the randomness, but in my opinion, even though bitaddress is commonly used, I would avoid it. Anyway, if OP wants to use it, they should definitely follow your advice and do it properly to diminish all risks.",

When using these tools, it is always a good idea to clone them and run them from your hard drive while staying completely offline for that extra layer of security. Working offline with such scripts isn't enough precaution and security when that computer will go online again at some later point of time. It's difficult to assess a computer's security status and be very sure there's no hidden malware. If you want security for your mnemonic recovery words or paperwallets, then you need to operate in a pristine and secure and disposable environment, like a live Linux box or agnostic Tails OS that don't permanently save any persistant data on the device.You have to be certain that no data traces of your handling with mnemonic recovery words or exposed private keys are left on a device that might go online later. Don't do such things on your daily internet shit computer/device.",

Also, writing down a seed phrase is much more easier than writing a private key.",

If your computer is \"disconnected for a while\" and then reconnects, then it is not airgapped. What you have in your set up - a computer which never connects to the internet against - is exactly what is meant by an airgapped device.And as Loyce says, you don't need to destroy it. Remove all permanent storage before you start and use a live OS, and then after you shut the computer down all traces of everything you have done disappear within a few minutes.",
