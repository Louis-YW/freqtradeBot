Do we never get tired of killing each other? will we never learn what happened in WW2, tens of millions of lives were lost. It is always civilians who become victims of the selfishness of those in power. May eternal peace come soon and there will be no war anywhere anymore. condolences to both parties affected by this war.",

Different countries are sending different aid but it is not reaching them. Israel must remember the human rights issue.Every state should bring the two sides together and come to a decision to stop this war or come up with a fair plan to ensure the survival and necessities of the common people That should be ensured and both sides should refrain from oil spill policy and trade arms with people should come out of the policy.",

The main root of the evil which we all are witnessing in the middle east comes mostly from the ambition of destroying the opponent and conquer  as much Holy Land as possible. Only with respect and isolating extremist we will have a chance of not getting more bad news from Gaza and the east Bank.",

I couldn’t imagine if that was the only option I had left to try and feed my family. It was completely expected to happen, to be honest. Sooner or later people will start to fight, rob or kill in order to get food, because we are talking about a society which was left with no power, water and food as a political mean to punish for the actions of a terrorist organization, which coincidentally blends itself among civilians. Very sad, considering civilians did not even choose to have such a destiny in the hands of the Israel army, anyone there could be as apolitical as possible and yet they still would need to evacuate and flee their homes if they wished to have a minimum chance of survival.",

Just imagine how Hamas took a wrong decision to attack Israel without thinking about some impeding dangers that it will impose on residents and individuals living in Gaza. I'm too worried about innocent children that are going through severe pain and hunger at a very tender age like this. Now, this can still lead to more conflict because there's going to be a fight for survival of the fittest because the relief materials that the UN are sending to them might not be enough thereby some persons will want to monopolize the palliatives to their loved ones thereby still gonna create a conflict and disagreement among themselves.It is important for everyone to use what is happening between other countries now as a food for thought because those that mostly solicit for war, have never gotten a taste of what war is all about. Just look at how everyone in Gaza is suffering both the rich and the poor everyone is suffering together so.no matter how intense an issue is, going to war should never be an option.",

Please, check your facts /. Anyway, I also saw the video of that statement. I think what that depict is that the war has caused serious hardship in the Palestine territory making food a very scarce commodity. Of course that should be expected with the continuous bumping going on in the area. Hence that is a call for humanitarian support and not that human beings would take the life of another person for food. At least I believe it won't get to that, aids will come in at least from the arab countries.",

Hunger and taste can turn humans to become crude and brutish like wild animals. Men can steal, injure, or kill because of food and you can't blame them because it is unthinkable to see your children die of hunger and do nothing. This is a situation that was created by Hamas and is now promoted by the US. The US is the machine that provides and sharpens the knife of the butcher.After the death of 8,800 people, including 3,500 innocent children, for the first time, President Biden is asking for a pause. Israel and its allies are not just killing people with guns and bombs but through hunger and taste. I am grateful to Egypt and all the nations that have sent aid in the form of food, medicine, and other provisions. Let's see how things will turn out after the main supporter of this massacre has stylishly called for a cease-fire.",
