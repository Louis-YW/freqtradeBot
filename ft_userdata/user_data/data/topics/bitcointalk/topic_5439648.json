None of them offers quick money. If you want quick money you probably should look into going into trading and that will require you to acquire certain knowledge like how to analyze market movement and also which coins or token will do well in a certain period of time. The main point of my post is that you have to be knowledgeable before you can make decent amount from Bitcoin or crypto but for now you can just purchase some Bitcoin to hodl if you have some cash to spare. Quote from: collinscoinz on February 12, 2023, 09:33:15 PMplease the crypto and bitcoin are they the same currency?No, there are not the same thing. And here is an excerpt from an article explaining the difference. here's the link to the article just incase you want to read the whole details I will also recommend that you check out the following links provided below to learn more about Bitcoin and crypto as a whole.

This is a question that your most likely not going to get any definite answer on because, it often comes with blames and your likely not going to take much pride in it in the event of a success.Bitcoin might be your best choice but, even bitcoin have got its own ups and downs. Normally, it's about buy low, sell high and hold when need be. When you are unable to do either in proper time, you would be at disadvantage.Should the attention be drawn to altcoins, it gets even worst. Best would be that you study the threads on the forum as per where concerns are raised on your choice of investment, coins and more about the crypto space, do your  research and invest with a mind set that you could lose whatever you put out. That would better prepare you for uncertainty.",

Invest in bitcoin which is the safest among all.

Well in your statement above, \"wanna invest my money on decentralized digital currency\", if its a decentralized currency then I propose you go for a bitcoin investment and that would be a long term investment because an investment in bitcoin doesn't pump up overnight just like that so even after investing you will have to wait and hold your coins for some time to get at least some tangible profit added to your investment capital. Any other coins apart from bitcoin is very risky when choosing for an investment because these coins can drop from their current price rate to zero in no time amounting to a very big loss in your investment. Although their some altcoins which you can invest and your profits can pump up real fast but the risk of knowing and choosing the right altcoins is always there.",

I can see that you have the money to invest. But it doesn't not end in having money. Just keep your money safe and  learn about bitcoin and altcoins. When you have an ample knowledge of them, you can be confident to do your own research and make your decisions yourself. Looking at your post, a bitcoiner will always advice you to buy bitcoin that other coins are crap. Likewise an altcoins lover will preach to you how possible it is to make x10 x20  x100 etc",
