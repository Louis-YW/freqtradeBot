      "body": "Typically speaking, asking for someone else to verify your account is considered fraud.  It can be dangerous for both parties involved.  For example, let's say you pay someone to do this and they see that there are valuable things being held on the account (speaking broadly).  They could contact the site after you pay them, prove their identity and take back control of the account, thus stealing your funds.  On the flipside, you could be doing illegal things with the account and leaving the person who verified to take the blame.  That's why this sort of thing is frowned upon.",

I can pay 40$I think, only the Revolut administration team can verify accounts on their platform.  you are looking for a very delicate thing, here is a big red flag and a warning that someone will be deceived. I believe that everyone is already aware of that. the offers you will receive are from duplicitous fraudsters, that is, those who will sell you fake or stolen personal data. so in the end you will be scammed yourself.",
