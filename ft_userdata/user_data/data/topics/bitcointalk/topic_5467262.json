Because if not, then this makes no sense at all to me and shouldn't for anyone else neither.People are making sure that they are doing something without them actually doing anything and that just feels funny to me. You said bunch of things without saying anything at all which is an accomplishment and many journalists does that, think about that as your next move on your career. This is just an idea on a piece of paper and feels like it is not going to be that much of a big deal.Of course, it's just words, because we can't colonize Mars first and then tell you about it. And I have already said a lot of times that we are not going to colonize Mars tomorrow. First we will develop the AI sector, in the future we will create our own android robots, and even later we will first explore the Moon, and then in the future we can colonize Mars.You can't even create a good ann thread for that token and now you want to convince people here to believe all words that you say? Maybe try something cool and realistic approach since maybe from this many people mightÂ  have an interest to invest on your token. But it seems that's not happening unless if you can make people that you can give good project as the plans for future for this project is really promising.I can appreciate your worries and need for quicker outcomes. I agree with you that we all want the project to continue and grow.But as you probably know, it takes a lot of time and effort to create a good project. Depending on the circumstance and the response of the market plans may need to be changed.",
