I found bugs in Betfury by logically calculating the operation of the system. A total of 4 bugs were found. The first report was made about six months ago and then I was denied a bounty, citing that the bug had already been closed before my report.Bug was with a bonus for registering 100 free spins, which allowed, after spinning the free spins, to receive bonus money to the main account and you could immediately withdraw it, with certain manipulations.What does it mean that the bug was closed? Was it there when you reported it? I'm asking because if it was reported by someone else, but not fixed before you reported it, they should at the very least give you some small reward, like a casino bonus, free spins, or something like that. What if all companies that put a bounty on bugs acted like this? Each time someone reported a bug they'd say that it's too late because they found it themselves, thank you for your service you sucker.

Maybe a minor bug which can be understandable but at least there are some bugs that seems threatening to the casino that to should be rewarded whether there is a bug bounty or not, those users who discovered them should be appreciated and rewarded because what they have done have saved such casino the unforseen danger they could have encountered in the nearest future but have been averted by a good Samaritan who has the casino at heart. The idea of rewarding bug finders should not be swept under the carpet because those bugs discovered could have been loopholes by hackers to make their ways into the entire system to commit their crime. In all, bug hunters or finders should be appreciated and rewarded for their work because what they do is not as easy as one of thinks it is.",

I have a friend who is also a bounty hunter who likes finding bugs for companies and projects, he have to join multiple bounties before one or two pay him what he deserved, most times they always fail or some other lucky bounty hunger beat him to the prize with time. Some platforms are well organized, they always give reasons why they may not pay up even if you find a bug and they will give details on how many bug finders they will pay, so even if 20 hunters are on this maybe only 3 will be selected, this is one of it's disadvantage.What I believe that Betfury may have some wrong is keeping it to themselves after someone already found a bug, they should have a email alert in place that will notify all the bounty hunters and they will stop working on their bug finding journey.",
