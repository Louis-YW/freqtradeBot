  "content": "Hi everyone, I hope everyone is well & safe  I'm trying to figure out how to keep tracking my coin collection using any inventory or dedicated coin software to track many factors. I would love to hear if you have any ideas or suggestions on how you are doing it today, I'm using an Excel datasheet with all the data related to the coin itself, but I would like to sort it better. I really appreciate any help you can provide. QB",

I understand what you mean about the phone app and privacy, note that all the SaaS software is not as secure as it's should, so exposure will be not a great idea. if to use the software it's better to make sure it's a brand, common cloud provider, MFA & 2Fa, encryption will be a nice addon.
