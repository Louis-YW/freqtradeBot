  "content": "I haven’t been received well. I don’t like Bitcoin, I don’t like cryptocurrency. I’ve been bullied online, and I’m tired of all these weird emails I’m getting and people begging me for money. I am exhausted from receiving messages supposedly from the CIA and NSA. Because of all this, I am looking to make some changes and move forward.We had ambitious plans and wanted to bring them to life, but they are now just concepts. How a Fair Election Would Work:Candidate Running REAL TIMEI’m seeking your support to increase my merit. I am running for the role of Bitcoin Scammer President, aiming to lead Bitcoin for a day. To achieve this, I need your hash power. If I can direct the 1 Bitcoin address against the Network Hashrate, it will be a monumental achievement. I’m campaigning for what could be the greatest scam in history and need your 635 EH  hash votes to succeed.**Election Bitcoin Address PLEASE POINT YOUR MINERS TO**: bc1qpsa8q6supe8uxzeedu0zu974t2lp7atrlas5n8This approach ensures a fair and transparent election process by leveraging the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network:1. **Decentralization**: Using hash power as votes ensures that no single entity can control the outcome. It distributes voting power across the network, reflecting the true consensus of the community.2. **Transparency**: The process of directing hash power is transparent and can be verified on the blockchain. Every participant can see the hash power contributions, ensuring the election is open and trustworthy.3. **Merit-Based Voting**: By tying votes to hash power, the election incentivizes active participation in the Bitcoin network. Those who contribute more to the network have a greater say in the outcome, aligning influence with investment and effort.4. **Revocability**: Participants have the power to withdraw their support at any time. If the elected president does not meet expectations, the community can collectively revoke their hash power, ensuring accountability.5. **Resource Utilization**: The use of hash power as votes ensures that the election process does not waste resources but rather utilizes the existing infrastructure of the Bitcoin network.I pledge to use the rewards to provide liquidity for promising current projects. If you don't support my presidency, you can turn off your hash power. If you do, provide more hash to empower my leadership and help organize our efforts.Together, we can shape the future of Bitcoin with a fair, transparent.\"If this concept ever comes to life, there are about 10 projects I will buy using BTC rewards, provide liquidity for, and stake. I will announce them on this thread at a later date.\"",

      "body": "You have not been received well in the community since you have been caught lying and the US SEC has discovered your illegal activities. Your proposal for a \"fair election\" for the role of Bitcoin Scammer President is full of false promises and misleading statements.First of all, your suggestion to use hash power as votes in a decentralized and transparent way is not feasible. Hash power is used to secure the network, not to cast votes. Your proposal goes against the basic understanding of how the network operates.Secondly, asking people to point their mining hardware to your Bitcoin address is not a legitimate way to fund your projects or provide liquidity. It is a scam and an attempt to get free Bitcoin. Your proposal is not only unrealistic, but it is also dishonest and misleading.Lastly, begging to increase your merit is ridiculous when you haven't brought any real merit to the community. I urge you to stop making false claims and misleading the community. I hope that the US SEC will bring you to court for your illegal activities and protect the community from potential scams and frauds.",

Your response doesn't change the fact that you have a history of scamming and illegal activities. Pretending to be nice doesn't erase the fact that you're a liar and a criminal who has yet to face the consequences of your actions.Your repeated attempts to deceive and manipulate others with baseless claims and fake evidence are pathetic. It's time to take responsibility for your actions and stop trying to weasel your way out of it.Your involvement in illegal activities, such as illegally raising over one million dollars in proceeds through the unregistered offers and sales of securities to crypto asset investors, is a serious offense. You need to face the consequences and make things right.",
