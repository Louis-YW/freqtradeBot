  "content": "I mostly use the blockchain explorers like https://www.blockchain.com/explorer or https://blockchair.com/ to view my wallet transactions confirmations or sometimes to even check the balance etc.Recently i was away from home and was check my balance on one of these explorer at my relative home. He is also involved in cryptocurrencies so he knew what i was doing. He told me not to checl my balance through these sites as these are public sites and it can be a threat to your privacy.I told him that i was putting my public address in these explorers and no one can hack my coins knowing only the public key. Only the private keys needs to be hidden while public keys can be entered anywhere to check the balance or given to anyone if they want to send us bitcoins.Still he was insisting that you should avoid these explorers. I diagreed but what to know your point of view? What is the harm of checkng your transactions and wallets balances through explorers",

What is the harm of checkng your transactions and wallets balances through explorers  When you use any blockchain explorer you IP address is logged with them and they know that this IP address access this btc address multiple times.They can give this data to blockchain analysis companies who will put one tick in the box that since this IP address searches this btc address multiple times, so one possibility is that btc address belongs to that IP. I hope you already know that tracing you by the IP address is not difficult at all.Its better to have a read only wallet configured where you can see your balances (For example , Blue Wallet) or if using the explorer is the only way, then better use it through TOR or VPN.",

What is the harm of checkng your transactions and wallets balances through explorers  Blockchain explorers can't harm your wallet, can't steal your coins, can't harm you, they are just explorers. The only concern here is that if you type your address in their search bar with your naked ip address, there is a chance that explorer will log this, i.e., explorer will save the data that you were checked address X. But you can search a lot of address, right? How can they know which one you really own?I don't know if your friend knows it and told you but when you use Electrum wallet that is connected to other nodes, there is a chance that when you make a bitcoin transaction, those nodes log your IP with it. I say, there is a chance, we don't actually know. By the way, this is nothing to worry about but if you are super cautious and worry too much about your privacy, then run your own node.Quote from: philipma1957 on September 22, 2023, 03:18:10 AMtor brings about other issues i.e. why is that guy using TORlets try to track him.That's what I am saying here for decades that the fact that you use Tor is an issue itself. For quick checkup that doesn't require a lot of bandwidth, one should use Tor bridge. Or use a VPN you trust.",

Your bitcoin wallet address being tied to your identity though, is a far bigger problem.But yea, you don't necessarily need to use Tor. Maybe a proxy or a VPN.

For master public key, I will not advice you to use it to track your bitcoin transaction on any explorer for privacy reasons. It is better to get a watch-only wallet instead. For anonymity, use Tor.

When that is done, we do not enter the private key but the public address.My guess is why he insists on what you are doing, because there are other things that your relatives are worried about to prevent you from frequently browsing the explore site to see transactions and check the balance.

Your statements are correct but they are about security and have nothing to do with privacy. Privacy is about your identity, the list of addresses you own which also includes your total balance and being able to link these two together.When you visit a blockchain explorer, the owners of that site can create a link between your identity (IP address, browser finger print, etc) and the address you checked there. Eventually they can build a database which would determine which addresses belong to you and how much bitcoin you own.",

They can safely assume with a high level of certainty that the owner of IP XXX.XXX.XXX owns the keys to access the addresses you search for. They can't be sure, since you could be looking for an address you found online or for many other reasons. But yes, they could track multiple addresses and link them to you.2.
