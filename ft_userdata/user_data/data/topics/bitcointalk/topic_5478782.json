      "body": "if you actually read blackrocks actual policy it mentions about fork decisions, you will see they base it on many factors.. none of which suggest they will move to an altcoin already createdits about future forks where there might be some contention about what the community decide.. and blackrock will go with the best case of what the community also followpart of the factors is to follow the chain with most economic services, maintained by core devs and has most workthe clause does allow them sole discretion but this is usually of a fork done by core devs actually causes more problems, where the unaltered version remains active they will go with the unaltered version. but again they do state its based on many factors which include miners, devs, services",

To be honest, I don't think other than BTC, BCH, LTC there is any other fork of BTC that is doing good, and the halving of LTC has already happened and it still has not started its bull run.This is a bad sign and I don't have any much knowledge about BCH but if BR wants to make money then BTC and ETH are the main sources they will go after. I must say, you should be worrying about BTC ETF approval first because other's forks are not that important.",

Yeah, we're all feeling the same that it's likely to get an approval from the SEC. With the news came out that they've been in talks for several times.That means that there can be like more chances of seeing this live soon. But until it gets an approval, we should still insist that we have to wait and halving as it is going to be the major event of next year if we don't see any approval at all.",
