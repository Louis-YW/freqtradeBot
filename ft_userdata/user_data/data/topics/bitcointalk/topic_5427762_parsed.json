  "content": "So my client and I are arguing which he orders a logo design from my service. I can't tell you the company name, but this is a new casino, and he (using his project account on this forum) approached me like a week ago. He asked the price of logo and ANN thread design. I gave him the prices, and also the combination price if he decides to purchase both designs at same time. After the discussion, he decided to just purchase the logo only, and holds the order for ANN design. Anw I was bit surprised when he, as a new casino representative, was trying hard to negotiate the price, so I asked upfront payment and he promised to pay it in 2-3 days (but I still haven't received it). After thinking about it for some time, I decided to trust him and started the work.During the process of logo design, he suddenly pmed me saying that he has created the logo himself, and ordered me to just shift my focus on the ANN thread design. At that time, the logo design was almost done (~95%) and I had no idea what his message means. So even though I got that message, I still sent him the logo design after it's done. In the next day, I got his reply saying that no need to create the logo design and I'm expected to just prepare the ANN thread design. Of course I rejected that, since the payment sent for the logo. I admit that the works took a quite longer time than expected, but it doesn't mean that he can change the agreement himself because I also didn't exactly mention when the design will be ready. Though, it still doesn't change the fact that he pays for the logo only.I would like to ask, if he still keeps insist to order me creating the ANN without additional cost on it, or doesn't pay the logo, is it harsh to put negative feedback on his profile? I know it's normal to sue a company who steals our work, but I'm not sure about a company that does not paying something they don't need although they ordered it before. I just don't want to ruin the reputation of some company without solid proofs and prosecutes.",

The agreement that was made should have ended professionally between client and OP, but when agreement was canceled by one party when the work was almost finished, then of course this was a form of client's unprofessionalism towards the agreement.But for something soft, neutral tags are possible in this case so it's useful and good as a reference for others in the future.

Second, don't appreciate your efforts that have worked on completing the initial order (logo) which is already 95%.There was another possibility why he suddenly changed the deal and insisted on not paying the extra money. Firstly, it wants to test you and secondly there is a possibility that the company is not serious about their project.Sorry if I involve myself in this matter.Regarding negative or neutral feedback, I leave it to you as our other friends have said.",

Eventually, I won't do that for now and will still keep trying to find a good solution between us. If it leads us nowhere in the end, I'll let you know on this thread.Its your call of course, but I don't see why it would be too harsh to leave him negative if in the end he refuses to pay you for the logo you designed. Its not your problem that he decided to change his opinion in the middle of it, created the logo by himself and now demands that you create something else for that money. Btw, he still didn't send the money for logo/ANN, right, still stalling? I mean, you can leave him neutral as well with clear explanation so everyone doing any deals with him is warned, but the way I see it he basically tried to cheat you and for that negative is not too harsh. After all, if they are serious casino they wouldn't even bother with such trivial stuff that could endanger their reputation before they even started promotion here. Market is swarmed with shitty casinos that barely have enough money to start the business and based on his behavior your client might be one of them.",
