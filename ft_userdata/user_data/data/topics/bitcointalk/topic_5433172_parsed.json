  "content": "Yesterday I stumbled across youtube videos displaying AI generated images creating new versions for what could be games and movies of our modern days, if they were made in the 1980's dark fantasy style. I thought it fascinating and found they were created at a Discord channel called Midjourney, where anyone can have access and create the images they want, through the AI, by writting simple words as prompt command. Then I saw someone creating a Bitcoin related image, and started trying as well. You have to be creative with the words to reach the most accurate and interesting results possible.I would like to ask you to try as well and share your results on this thread. I will be posting mine as well.This is what I've done so far with the AI:     Midjourney website: https://www.midjourney.com/ (click join the beta to be redirected to the Discord server)Once there, you have to enter NEWCOMER ROOMS (newbies rooms). Then insert \"/imagine\", space bar and a prompt icon will appear. So you can start inserting what you want the AI to create. Press enter and it will generate 4 images based on your command. Below the 4 images there will be U1, U2, U3, U4 buttons, respective to each of them. You click on the one you want the AI to render for you. Wait the process, then save it.Bitcoin VaultCyberpubCold WalletCrypto Whale OceanBitcoin SynergyClassicalSt. Nicholas of BitcoinRainbow Mistery RevealedThe Missing LinkBitcoin AdoptionEmerald Bitcoin MeteorRadioactivityBitcoin FountainBlue Bitcoin Spell",

I enjoyed those pictures as well! Midjourney is great! It's indeed under constant improvement and development.Unfortunatelly I already hit my free trial limit of 25 generated images. Now they require a subscription in order to continue using the service. 30$ monthly to have access to unlimited number of generated images.I think it worths, especially for people working on this area. If I had some spare money right now I would purchase it!",

You can render each image separately by clicking the U1, U2, U3, U4 respective button below the images, after they are generated by the AI. So you can also discard the ones you didn't like or which aren't accurate.The possibilities are infinite. The limit goes until your imagination and creativity can reach. It's just a matter of time until they introduce convincing movements, like short movies to this feature.",

If it doesn't then I could go through all of them to see the best one, note this was my first time on discord using this AI.It has a feature I really dislike, it shows everybody's images in a scrolling page which is being updated with a few images every second, these kind of settings could be changed somehow but I didn't go through them all. Also knowing all or at least most of the functional commands would be helpful but that requires you to spend hours reading their guides and tutorials.I also have a NSFW idea but am not sure if the bot accepts to render them or not.Following is considered NSFW, reader discretion is advised.Something like \"a young supermodel blonde with big booty and tities wearing bikini, surrounded on an alley by 5 big mean green trolls with evil smiles on their faces, the girl looks really scared but the trolls only want to give her bitcoins because they're her onlyfans.\" Or \"kid batman with his parents get jumped after a movie night on a dark alley, suddenly the thief looks at Martha's pearly melons and points the gun at Bruce asking Martha to pull her pants down and bends over, he rapes Martha infront of Bruce and his father and then kills them both, then he gets nervous and tries to flee the crime scene, but a few bitcoin falls off his pockets, which later turns out Joker had touched them leaving finger print on them, hence the fued between Joker and Batman.\" This won't look good on a single image, maybe using GIF is better for this.Lol that was a whole new scenario for a Batman movie.ðŸ¤£",

It's still a beta test and the AI is learning in real time to become smarter, more accurate with results and probably will be able to execute more challenging tasks futurely, as technology never stops evolving.In some time, once it achieves the goals I mentioned above, there will be better use for it, without any doubts. For now it's nice to put our imagination to work, materializing images and situations we thought could exist only in our minds.",

It truly looks like a HQ's story scene and just by looking that we can imagine there is a whole story going on that world.Could you share which prompt keyword you use to cause that effect?Thanks. Like I said it's been almost a quarter of a year that I created these using Midjourney. So don't remember the exact prompts. The BTC logo and some details were later edited in PS.I remember using something like \"most epic Kubrick movie scene\" for the first two. Also setting the aspect ratio to a cinematic format like 21:9 or similar (or 215:100 I think?) helps for the AI to immediatelly go for a more movie-like look. I think for the 3rd render with Guy Fawkes face I added \"award winning photography\" but in a painters style. It was quite some fun to combine over-the-top-elements, sometimes even contradicting each other. Will probably try and see how far Midjourney has evolved since then, in the upcoming weeks.",

It's only good for creating boring and forgettable illustrations for cheap products.That's your opinion and I disagree.- There are many original artworks that combine things in a way never seen before.- AI is just a tool, it will never replace traditional art, but can be utilized for inspiration, as a basis for further modification etc.- It can be used to copy existing art and create endless variations, but it can also be used to create something completely new. A good analogy is sampling in music. - Sure, there is a lot of ugly, unoriginal, clichee, copy-cat AI images. A lot is an understatement. Definitely more than in traditional art but, like I said before, not exclusively.Quote from: uneng on January 08, 2023, 03:55:42 PMQuote from: DrChaos.eth on January 08, 2023, 11:32:23 AMGreat images!I tried myself to generate some and it was a disaster.
