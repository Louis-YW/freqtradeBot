We have to prioritize solutions that gives us decentralization. We have Mastodon that seems to me to be I nice heaven. There are a few communities there like Bitcoin Magazine, Stefan Livera is also there and quite a few other Bitcoin related communities but for some reason, people keep using the same old shit like Facebooks, Instagram, Whatsapp, Twiter etc. We eve have alternatives to Twitter, Reddit, etc! Google services should be another one to avoid!",

He was a top dev he deserves them but this relates to my other post I made this morning.No he did not get them back, nor should he. He had poor OpSec, kept a large amount of funds in hot wallets on a local network that was probably compromised.His arrogance of \"I know better\" cost him a lot of money. I will even go one step past that and say it made him an easier target. Bragging about how smart you are will only make people want to prove you wrong.But, it did help others see why you should always use a hardware wallet and keep most of your funds offline.-Dave",

Initially a lot of users unbanned, but since then a significant amount banned. In reality the censorship remains relatively high, just significantly different. Rather than censorship targeting far-right it has targeted far-left, as well other new reasons such as sharing live location data of others without consent (doxxing), hacked materials, etc.If I had to guess it wouldn't be due to his religious believes, as these are generally well tolerated on twitter. Maybe worth pointing out he had an account on a mastodon instance called \"Bitcoin Hackers\" (now closed). So if he shared any hacked materials from there on twitter then that would be an account suspension. That's speculation I know, but other users have been banned recently for sharing hacked materials.He's on Nostr I believe, so if you wanted to find out the reason for his suspension you might find it from him there.",

What we see as ok in our Kingdom is often misunderstood, seen as foolishness or madness in this world.I wish the suspension isn't too long or permanent even though I think he need to be somewhat sensitive to the feelings of others. Humans are too fragile and can be quite volatile especially this time their world is weakening",

I don't know what the revenue advantage this will be on the company revenue generation but I also believe that this is more of a power stunt by the new CEO trying to control the services and that will lead to Twitter losing its users to other similar platforms.",
