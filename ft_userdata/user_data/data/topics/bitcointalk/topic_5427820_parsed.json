  "content": "Free Bet Blackjack, is based on the popular variation of Classic Blackjack. The game includes a big added attraction of selected ‘Free Double Down’ and ‘Free Split’ bets.Rules: In Classic Free Bet Blackjack, players get a ‘Free Double Down’ bet on two-card with hard totals of 9,10, or 11. Added to that are ‘Free Split’ bets on all pairs except 10, J, Q and K. What’s more, the free bets are automatically offered to the player whenever their hand qualifies, so there’s no effort required by the player.So far this is my favorite variation of blackjack by evolution gaming since it offers double reward without increasing the original bet. Free bet regular table is what’s the best compared to the infinite version because you can increase your chance on getting free bet on multiple seats.Important Note: If you have free split then 1 hand win and other hand lose; therefore you will just breakeven.  If you have free split then 1 hand tie and other hand lose; therefore you will lose your original bet.  The game is draw if the dealer busted @ 22 count except when your card is Blackjack. Busted card will still busted. Source: https://www.evolution.com/our-games/live-blackjack/Livecasino.io is the best online casino to play this game because they usually give special promotions for Blackjack in weekly basis that you will not find on other casino.

This is the only disadvantage of this game but it’s compensated by the free bets offered. I rarely encounter this scenario but it’s just a small price to pay for having an extra free bet especially if you are wagering huge amount.Quote from: electronicash on December 11, 2022, 03:53:11 PMwhat could be the disadvantage when its automatically offered? There’s no disadvantage on splitting since it’s free. It can only be a disadvantage on splitting pair of 9 in case the result of your two split cards is less than your original count as 18. But having 2 bets for paying only 1 bet is great deal in blackjack. It’s better than having a blackjack win because you will get x2 which is greater than x1.5 on blackjack.My only dilemma on free split is when I have a pair of 5 since you will be entitled to free double or free split. Free double down will give you 1 shot chance for a better hand while free split give you 2 shot with just a twist on winning condition that you can check on the important notice on the OP.",

      "body": "I used to like this game mode but the push on 22 eventually made me hate it since I always imagine the potential winnings I could've gotten if I played at a regular table. My experience is somewhat similar to Lightning Blackjack, it encourages you to go for aggressive plays because of the potential to win more and the downside is that I always go on long losing streaks because of those aggressive plays though. I recommend playing only for a few rounds just to try out the free split and free double as the extra rule can be annoying to deal with if you plan to play for several rounds.",

This is the only disadvantage especially if you are betting in huge amount. Much better to play on regular Blackjack if you are betting huge amount so that you don’t have any regrets on push at 22.Anyway Livecasino has a new promotion which is the win streak on Blackjack. Top 50 players will share the 3000USDT and this type of Blackjack is best game if you want to participate since double down and split is counted as 2 win if you manage to win. Free bet Blackjack give free split and double down which means you are not risking extra bet while you still have a chance to earn free 1 win count. Push does not stop win streak so this blackjack type is really the best fit for this promotion. Make sure to Option in before you bet. So far only 5 players listed on the leaderboard while there’s 50 slot left.You can check full details of the promotion here: https://livecasino.io/promotions/2022-12-12-winners-only-blackjack",

I manage to hit 3 times win straight including 1 double down on freebet blackjack but my win doesn’t credited as 3 win because freebet is not counted. I ask this to the support and they confirmed that freebet is not included on this promotion. Only double down and split from regular blackjack is counted as multiple win. I don’t recommend this type of Blackjack when participating in the promotion because it might jinx your win streak once the dealer is 22.",

My recent record not came from the freebet blackjack but on the onetouch live casino game that I play yesterday. I’m intrigued when I saw this post so I verify this with the support and they confirmed what you said. It’s just odd that they didn’t include this on the ToS of the promotion especially that free bet blackjack is popular nowadays on evolution gaming table. I’m sure many players expect the same to my assumption on this game.Nevertheless I want to make my point still valid on using this game as good tools for the promotion because it offers free bet for more chance of winning money to increase your bank roll. A push doesn’t destroy the streak so it’s still ok in case dealer is bust @  22.",

The push on 22 for the dealer only (and not for the player) is not fully compensated by the free split and free double down bets actually since the optimal theoretical RTP is only of 98.45% instead of 99.47% for the classic unlimited blackjack from Evolution with the 6cards Charlie rule too. So I think it's only interesting for very good blackjack players who have a special strategy for this game along with a specific counting method. Because the game seems to only be profitable if you get several double down or split hands or if you are able to bet higher when they are the most likely to be drawn.",

Hitting on hard 17 above and splitting pair of 10 are the worst when you are playing with them since you share cards and it affects the result tremendously if the dealer is supposed to be busted if only this players don’t do this kind of novice stuff.Atleast on multiple table, you can play with pro that knew how blackjack works with less chance for this kind of mistake. Lesser newbie incidents means less to blame and happy blackjack experience.",

What will you choose on this situation?Is it free split which will give you 2 chance to have a better hands or just simply double down and aim for a high risk high reward of easy x2 in case you hit Ace or 10 while dealer count is below 20.I experienced many times this hand and I always choosing double down most of the time since its very hard to get a good count when I split pair of 5 but I saw many players splitting it especially those high roller to have a good count on one hand to breakeven since double down that result to bad hit is very risky for them to lose there bet.",

It's true but there is at least one blackjack variant at Evolution with a house edge smaller than their regular Blackjack. Their regular blackjack tables are offering a RTP of 99.29%, that is to say a house edge of 0.71% while the Lightning Blackjack game is offering a RTP of 99.56%, that is to say a house edge of 0.44%. I don't play very often to this game, and I didn't get very good results up to now each time I tried it, so I don't know if this RTP asserted by Evolution is real or not. Has anyone got results confirming this figure?",
