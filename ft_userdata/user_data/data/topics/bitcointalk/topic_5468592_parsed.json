Smaller exchanges hardly have the liquidity to even keep up with the market price, especially with lesser-known pairs. So you may already be paying significantly more for the coins than you would on other exchanges. This is less important for intra-day trades, but for trades over the course of the day it can be quite noticeable. What I would also give to consider is the withdrawal fees. Even if the trade does not cost any fees, it is possible that the withdrawal fees are significantly more expensive than with other exchanges.",

Just trade with reasonable amount and you can be good. Anyway, if there's a good list of good exchange here that offer a free trade, I might also look into it and try it.",

Or maybe it depends on the trading pair that you will use.QuoteAlso, try to do your own research about what you are looking for, dude, if you are having second thoughtsabout what you are given here about what you want to know.Source: https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/zero-fee-exchanges/",

I know Binance is in a very weird place right now in terms of regulation and reputation, but if I were to use a centralized exchange, it would still be Binance.Interesting detailing, thank you! Regarding the regulations, it has already become very difficult, especially in Europe. Exchanges like Bitpanda usually require detailed proof of origin when depositing coins. If these coins come from \"dubious\", unregulated exchanges or DEX, there can be problems to prove the \"clean\" origin of the coins. I am curious in which direction the regulatory frenzy in America and the rest of the world will go. Europe has basically created a very good and fair framework with MiCa, but the strict regulation of the exchanges and the necessity of proof of origin will still bring a rude awakening for many ...",

Because your personal data should be more valuable than any feeses, and first of all, you should take care of your confidentiality. Exchanges may cooperate with regulators or governments, Binance does not even hide this, think about who can access this information.",
