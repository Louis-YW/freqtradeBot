Its crucial to be cautious of misleading or biased content found on various platforms. As you said To ensure accuracy consider referring to alternative sources like books, GitHub repositories, technical discussion boards and reputable websites. Also Andreas Antonopoulos is indeed a valuable resource for answering questions and providing reliable content I follow him on his youtube channel and watch videos regularly his contribution to promoting reliable learning resources is greatly appreciated.",

      "body": "Dear op i totally agree with you, but to some extent only. How? let me tell you, you aforementioned the first article is misleading one but didn't mention the reason so i read it. All i found is in their title they said \" What security? Bitcoin enthusiast cracks known 12-word seed phrase in minutes\" but actually this is not what happened, the actual story is, a person named Wicked share a task worth some dollars as a reward, he provided 12-word seed phrase by himself by in an unordered way and he asked others to combine it in an ordered way to unlock the wallet and some dude used brute force method (the easiest one but requires heavy GPU) to make combinations of all these 12 seeds. Well, the scenario was totally different while the title is giving other meanings. And i found nothing surprising here. Because that's what a news company does, they make shocking and misleading titles while the context is whole another thing. And In the second article, you said it's a biased one, but didn't mention why?. And I was unable to figure it out too because even if they have wrote something biased but everything seems right to me. And how did you get your answers from Andreas Antonopoulos like he is a tech entrepreneur and are you talking about asking questions in person like in meetups etc or at any online platform? Well in the end, i do not think depending on only your mentioned one platform for getting knowledge is advisable because diversifying the knowledge from different resources will make it better.",

Because even though it's true, sometimes websites or news platforms, sometimes make up the news too far, and even lie to the public. But what I know and have experienced so far, most news websites, mostly do write real news. Maybe by chance what you found, is a news article that is not good or contains lies. So you conclude that all the articles written on a website are all lies. But in my opinion, leveling all opinions like that is very inappropriate. Because if you only look at the negative side, all sites that write articles are considered normal. Therefore, we must be better able to filter information or knowledge that is on a site or platform. So that way, I'm sure it will be better.And I also more or less learned a lot about bitcoin from an article on the website. Looking for information is also certain to see from a website, and one of the ones you mentioned above.",

Most of the books and other source material explained Bitcoin in a technical way while articles usually simplified the content to make sure that reader can easily grasp on the idea and this is what many newbie preferred reading rather than books that is very hard to understand.We always use the books and other materials to verify the article content. Also not all content provides wrong information. Sometimes they are just wrong since the content is very subjective which is why they think that’s the right approach while the others think different. But in terms of basic knowledge. Binance academy and other site that you mention provides a decent explanation to educate newbie on crypto.",

      "body": "It is always wise to be wary of information sources before accepting them as accurate. We have a saying: \"Don't trust, verify!\" When we read articles online, it's easy to get caught up in the story and click through without thinking twice and sometimes it can be difficult to break out of a narrative once we start believing it, but it's worth taking the time to ensure we are not being manipulated by clickbait headlines or biased content. I think it's important to remember that not all information sources are created equal. So, when it comes to articles on platforms and news sites, consider cross-referencing the information with other reliable sources to ensure accuracy and avoid misleading or biased content. The same applies to social media and forums. If you see a post that seems too good to be true or overly dramatic, take the time to check it out and ask yourself if it seems credible. One of the most important things to remember when it comes to online content is that you are not just reading random words on a screen. You are reading words written by people with an agenda who may or may not have your best interests at heart. As such, it's important to consider how the writer is framing their message, why they are writing it and if there is any bias in what they are saying.",
