It's obvious your account got hacked as a possible phishing attack on your system or whatever you have used to access your online account. It is advised not to click on link we have no knowledge about so s not to give room for a cyber attack against your details.  Always cross check details so as to know wether it is real and from the right source before clicking on it. If there is any possible discrepancies, do well to contact customer care of that Service to confirm for your safety.If you are wanting to pay for who will help you,  I will advise you to seek the service of an escrow before engaging any one for transparency and credibility as this will guide you to achieving a smooth agreement or memorandum of understanding.",

It would be understandable to expect some level of accountability on their part in this situation. I hope that they will take your concerns seriously and work with you to find a solution. It's important for online casinos to prioritize the security of their customers and have measures in place to prevent incidents like this from happening in the future where such a suspicious activity happens and from a different IP address.For that phishing website i have reported it to Hostinger team and hopefully they will close it ASAP",

Example : You provide them with a code word... say \"Freebies4Ever\" .... and this code word is kept with support. If you give a large tip (x percentage of your balance) ..it will trigger the customer support to contact you to ask for the code word.

I wrote in and asked for help in making my account incognito or some kind of privacy and was denied.What has happened is that my telegram where I get the notifications from stake was found out, someone sent me a link on telegram so it popped up on my computer looking just like stakes messages. I clicked it and the rest is history. As far as withdrawls and kyc no stake doesn't have any kyc on withdrawals up to 60k i believe for instant. In any event, clicking was idiotic but the 2fa being stripped and money not being withdrawn but tipped over to a new account is pretty shocking. They stopped 105k and are congratulating themselves for doing so but I lost 100k in the process of them cashing out a bet and stealing the funds.Was hoping due to my level at the company they would reach some kind of agreement but it's simply 'we can't pay for stolen funds'OP if i may ask you these question, does anyone know about your identity on stake casino? Does anyone knows you have such amount of money right there in your stake account? Try do a flash back to remember events and occurrences surrounding your account when you made the deposit into your stake account. When you contacted the customer care service of stake complaining about the threat you received in respect to your account and people sending you messages, did you send them the proof of the messages as evidence for them to see? If you did and they ignored you then they too have  questions to answer for not keeping a close monitor on your account and also for not keeping a close monitor in the account that sent you those messages if they are onboard the stake platform. You took a proactive measures early enough to lay a complaint to stake about your experience but they did ignored your complaint and here is the end result of the whole thing.This is a serious case I will advise you to register your account as a copper member them post the evidence of the threat messages you have been receiving from the players onboard the stake casino also the messages you sent to stake for help and their response to you because if they had helped you earlier enough, this would have not occurred maybe minimal experience. How can they explain this that a customer registered on their platform with huge amount of money attached to account sent a complaint to stake customer care service in respect to the threat of account doc received still yet they could not be proactive to the complaints.I strongly advise you to start uploading the evidence here so members could see and follow up the situation.",

From time to time here we read of accounts that get blocked \"for security reasons\" in suspicion of multi accounting or whatever but real fraud in 6 digits doesn't get found out, that's alarming.Well looking at stake history of things like that ( I am very active in stake's forum and read about strange cases a lot ) I think there is nothing that they will do to refund you. A little bit of a shame since you are almost diamond 5 and therefor have wagered almost 500 million $, what a crazy amount.I am platinum 4 and also ran into problems in the past where I didn't get help, for some reason though I always stick with stake.Edit: maybe you can make this case public at https://stakecommunity.com/ .Spreading more awareness and put some small pressure on stake to maybe rethink about helping you.",

The money went to bitfinex which I know people will say they probably used fake kyc there to move the coins...I just doubt that, real hackers aren't sending money directly to exchanges, they are cashing them out, tumbling or swapping for different coins. The link was sent to me on telegram which directs it towards the same group of players who have been trying to extort for the previous month. If anyones able to help, genuinely, then please let me know. I'm not wanting to post thousands of pictures and arguements w the site and ownership as I don't think that will lead to any positive results. I don't expect to retrieve the stolen money but I do suspect there's a trail that could be uncovered.I think exchanges accept reports if you were to show them the links and proof about the hacked account, the wallet involved, and where it's going right now? (I am not sure of this, but they do this kind of stuff in big hacking events so you might as well try ig) I don't think they're able to directly return it to you though. I suggest just compiling everything you have in one place so that whenever someone asks you can just link them to that pile and have them read it all instead of repeating yourself. As for the doxxing though, I don't think stake is at fault here, they might've just pieced the details themselves when they got access to your data. There are a LOT of places out there that can link back to you if they're knowledgeable enough. I highly doubt stake would help with that tbf.",
