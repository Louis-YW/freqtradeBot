Maybe it can't even be called popular, because ordinary users rarely come (or stay) here. Simply put, this forum is not as useful to everyone as YouTube or the like.Before I came to Bitcointalk, I followed some very good forums that also worked on SMF, for me, this look is quite enough, and maybe it's just a matter of habit.",

Just check youtube dark mode. Are you looking for the forum to look like YouTube? Or you want dark mode because of the strains the current light mode causes to your eyes?You have given multiple choices here on how you can use the forum on dark mode so I don’t see any reason why you’re still dragging YouTube into the discussion, if you so much like YouTube’s dark mode then you might as well just stay there. Currently there’s no inbuilt dark mode the only way you can use it is either you use a browser that has a dark mode feature or you install extensions or run the script in your tampermonkey.",

I happen to have color blindness and I hate dark mode. Smaller the screen the harder it is to read.A lot of men have color blindness so if you go to forced dark mode which is easier than lite or dark mode you are screwing a lot of people.I have zero issue if we go to two modes lite or dark as long as we keep the old school method of thread formating.",

Bitcointalk is old - although improvements such as mode features are also expected, but you can expect them to be implemented in EpochTalk. There are many improvements that users expect from bitcointalk - but they realize that they cannot be realized easily. The main solution is to use help from a third party - that will help you for now until there is an official upgrade on the forum.",
