You can put it in  Development & Technical Discussion > Wallet software > Electrum mods don't need to.But no, there is no way to have electrum add all the totals. Evey wallet file is independent of each other. How many are there 2? 5? 10? more?You can export the private keys from all the separate wallets in one, but that takes time and leaves the potential for mistakes.And as been stated many times before, never delete wallet files even if you move everything or they are empty. You never know when you might need something from them.-Dave",

Thank you!To make this work for a full wallet (non watching only), I did a few modifications:Instead of \"xpub\" key, import the \"xpriv\" key gotten by using the command in Electrum's console: getmasterprivate()Add \\\"active\\\": true, to the 'receiving' and 'change' descriptors to set those as the active descriptors.Remove \\\"watching-only\\\": false, from the descriptors also.Would this work also on a non blank wallet? Or will it cause problems to have multiple active descriptors?",

Or will it cause problems to have multiple active descriptors?There'll be only one active parent descriptor per script type of receiving and change derivation paths.If you imported another with \"active: true\", the original descriptor of that script type will be deactivated.For more details, go to my reply in your other post: /index.php?topic=5409926.msg61174577#msg61174577",
