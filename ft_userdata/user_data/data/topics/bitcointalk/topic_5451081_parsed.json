  "content": "Hey, collectors!I heard that Bitcointalk is a great place to give away and there are quite a few people here who appreciate custom collectibles. We would like as many people as possible to hear about our Bitcoin Mixer and seriously think about raffle for members of the forum. One of the forum users recommended that we consider buying a custom batch of Ledger or ColdCard and we think it's a good idea. However, we would like to know your opinion on what collectibles can be personalized and are there any sites or people that provide such services? (or perhaps there is one of the manufacturers of collectible items here on the forum).I will appreciate any feedback! And I hope I chose the right board for this kind of question.",

Maybe Unijoin can do this and show us they are planning long term.",

Betnomi recently launched several rounds of their Free Cold Wallet Raffle (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5446281.0) I guess you know whom to ask to organize raffle like that¬† For sure it may brings attention, as free items are always desired. My only concern is that I suppose hard-core mixer user would not want to reveal his home address (even to 3rd party like minerjones). But yes, at least for some time the brand will be more visible.Home delivery of wallet with ordered, already mixed coins, LOL",

(or perhaps there is one of the manufacturers of collectible items here on the forum).Several hardware wallets are already offering co-branding solutions.I recently did a research about that for one of our local member campaign, so I am posting more information about that here with links.Please note that I don't support any closed source wallets, and my suggestion is to avoid doing any deals with them, plus ledger nano X is one of the worse hardware wallets with many issues with battery, and that is a big reason to avoid it (S+ is better and cheaper).However, I will be be neutral for co-branding and just the post links, for ledger that is:https://www.ledger.com/co-branded-partnershipSecond option is OneKey hardware wallet from Hong Kong, they started as Trezor fork, but they are most popular hardware wallet in China, and they are open source:https://onekey.so/co-branded-partnership/CoolWallet (they are closed source):https://www.coolwallet.io/cobranded_card_partnership/Keystone wallet is open source and you can contact them for potential co-branding:https://keyst.one/Satochip is also doing custom crypto cards, but someone already mentioned them above.",
