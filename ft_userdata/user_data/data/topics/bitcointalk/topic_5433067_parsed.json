  "content": "Hello,First of all I would like to apologize if this has been posted in the wrong section.I have absolutely no clue where else I could ask or post this.I'm not accusing this casino of scamming at the moment.---Yesterday I won a significant amount of money on a slot called Fruit Party. (Provider: Pragmatic Play).The amount won exceeded $35,000+.I tried withdrawing my funds but the transaction got rejected.Reason: Complete KYCWithout any hesitation I filled in my information, sent through my ID and more.My KYC information got accepted and I was verified.Currently this known crypto casino has disabled my withdrawals.Their reason: The Game Provider needs to confirm that there are no issues with the winner round, after that you are able to withdraw again.Is this normal? I never heard of anything like this before.I asked them an ETATheir response: We do not have an exact ETA since they are a third-party company.-This is a pretty known crypto casino.I am still patient, therefore I will not be giving out the site name currently.I will wait for another 48 hours, if the matter is still not resolved then I will post more information regarding this case.",

Since you're said the casino is big and popular in this forum, I don't think it's should be worried since they're really care with their reputation in this forum except 1xbit.",

Every casino has the right to undertake this type of procedure, unless it does not have it written in the ToS, but I have not yet met one that would not have mentioned the right to do it.",

It's quite unusual already that they need a 3rd party though.",

This is the right thing to do the casino has no control over the time Pragmatic will address the issue, although they could request to fast track, after you received good suggestions you could lock this thread and open it when you are ready to file accusations or the issue has been resolve, the one thing that you should not do is to play with the money that you intend to do, control yourself from doing so, w have seen issues where a player waiting to get his issues resolved made the mistake of playing with money that he intends to withdraw and losses it all, now he blames the casino, play on other casinos but with minimal funding just to satisfy your urge.",
