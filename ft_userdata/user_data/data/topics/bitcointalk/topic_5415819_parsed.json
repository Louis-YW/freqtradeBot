But for now I'll advise you focus more on beginners and help cause it's like a foundational building for you to grow in knowledge fast about so many things concerning the forum and crypto inquiries too compared to other board (my opinion though).",

So at that stage or time now he became selective. He select where to make comments. And newbies are more in beginners and help board more than other boards. Other boards also have newbies. Newbies make comments on others boards based on their knowledge so if have a specific knowledge on particular board that you can contribute knowledge to it. You are free to educate comments and contribute knowledge to it. Newbies are not stopped only on this board boy unlimited boards but your knowledge is needed in other boards. Beginners & help is best place for newbies that just join bitcoin to learn. But if you have knowledge on others, you can go out. You can navigate to others.",

The culture of hitting on newbies, for the sake of it is quite unhealthy to me. Members ask questions based on ignorance of the fact, and sometimes can, and should, be given the benefit of the doubt even if it looks obvious to older members.Op could be asking if there's an unwritten rule about it, and even though the can post there (other boards), is it something the should be doing, or it could be a simple oversight.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on October 04, 2022, 06:45:42 AMIf you are asking about the opportunity to write on a topic for beginners, then such questions, if they continue, are unlikely to give you a reputation.
