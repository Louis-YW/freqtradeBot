That shouldn't be the major problem for banks to collapse; such huge withdrawals shake centralized systems, but it's not enough to shut them down. It's only when some of the depositors funds are not available and they are using Depositor A's funds to pay Deposit B that an issue will arise when both A and B want their funds at the same time.For the sake of our privacy and to be in full control of our funds, we should avoid completely relying on the banking sector. And use an alternative to save our hard-earned money under something that will give us 100% control over our assets. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't use the banking sector; we still need it in order to complete a few transactions. No matter how massive Bitcoin adoption has reached, there are still sectors where we need to pay bills that don't accept crypto payments. For those reasons, we need the banks for such transactions.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on April 29, 2023, 08:21:45 AMQuote from: 348Judah on April 29, 2023, 08:03:38 AM~snip~Point of correction, banks can't go down completely, this is not the first time the banking sector would be stressed and the government always come to rescue them.

Majority of us are not ready for this conversation honestly. The way some people are waiting for any slight opportunity to rubbish the banking system is alarming and dangerous. Yes, I believe the banking system is full of lapses and crypto is not absolutely perfect too but making it sound as if the banks will run away with one's money is one thing I don't understand. It's important to know that banks are strictly out there for business and you shouldn't expect them to keep your money for free. They have staffs to pay, tax to pay and undergo physical and technical maintenance too. QuoteBank is not generally bad and I will still advise against keeping all your money in crypto, have some Fiat in your bank account and have some in crypto, the future remains uncertain as anything can happen between this two currency solutions in the future. Despite my belief in crypto and the fact that I encourage people to crypto doesn't make banking systems useless to me at all. I have never been to bank and was told money is not available before while in crypto there's a time you can not actually be able to sell part of your coin unless you are ready to sell at depreciate price. My investment in Luna is now absolutely worthless. You can not tell me such things happen in banking systems. Despite my faith in crypto, particularly the Bitcoin, I will not or advise anyone to rely solely and invest heavily on it because we don't know what the future holds.Conclusively, I'm not in support of banking exploitation but tarnishing their image for Bitcoin support is what I am against here. They are also running business and have a role playing in every nation economy too. Crypto should not make us to abandon banks because both have role playing.",

      "body": "Whether to adopt Bitcoin or stick with traditional banking depends on your personal preferences and circumstances.Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing for fast and secure transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. Some people choose to adopt Bitcoin because they believe it offers more control over their money and more privacy. Others are drawn to its potential as an investment or a way to conduct international transactions without currency exchange fees.However, it's important to note that Bitcoin comes with its own set of challenges and risks. Its value can be volatile and unpredictable, and its adoption is not yet universal, so it may not be widely accepted as a form of payment in some places. There are also concerns around the security of Bitcoin wallets and the potential for fraud or hacking.On the other hand, traditional banking offers a range of services, including savings accounts, loans, and credit cards, that are not yet fully available through Bitcoin. Banks are also subject to regulations and government oversight, which can offer a layer of protection and security for your funds.Ultimately, whether to adopt Bitcoin or stick with traditional banking is a personal decision that depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall preferences. It may be worth considering both options and assessing their benefits and drawbacks before making a decision.",

More security and complete control over our money were granted by Bitcoin, but only for those who knew how to utilize it. There are advantages and disadvantages to employing each one, but my main priority is maintaining complete control over my money while attempting to reduce any potential sources of loss while implementing a decentralized system. Quote from: Call_Me_Guru on April 29, 2023, 12:16:44 PMBanks are rippers, I don't like them, my wish is that there is a strong alternative that will compete with them, the one better than bitcoin. When we look at banks and their operating mode, they are cheating us, no one has to support their system but no financial system has the bad without the good. Money are restored when I have failed transaction in banks and my money is accountable for in banks (pros). In other aspect, bitcoin is better than banks for what I need for my financial transactions.Banks are rippers, as many other people believe, but some people still find comfort and confidence in them and will use them continuously.  Others may not view utilizing bitcoin the same way that you do, and you can't hold them responsible for it. Those that are unable to accept bitcoin are typically unable to secure their own funds, which is a significant risk in the cryptocurrency world. Therefore, it would be better for them not to join than to join and spread false information about bitcoin when they fall victim to loss of assets due to their own negligence.",

From the information that I got from this news,it was clearly stated that US government will pump in funds to stop whatever damage that huge withdrawal could cause to the bank. It is good that we should have two savings,in bitcoin and also in fiat,so that we will be on the save side. We need these banks to help the circulation of money,to monitor and regulate it,for easy transactions of citizens. I don't think that we can live without the banks in this world.",

Bitcoin will prove to be more important as the years pass and more and more people awake to what the fractional reserve banking system really is. We're watching it LIVE right now.
