  "content": "I've come across several Bitcoin news channels and groups talking about whales accumulating more bitcoin and small holders panic selling, the recent one that got me curious is a news from (Crypto Insider) a Cryptocurrency news channels on telegram that's said, in August alone about 283 or more wallets surpassed the 100 $BTC mark. It further stated there that in total, over the past 30 days wallets with the balance 10 to 10,000 $BTC have accumulated over 100k $BTC worth about $7.6b and that has got me curious as to why the small scale holders do panic and sale instead of holding whereas those who got more than enough are seriously accumulating more. My thought is that, why can't they emulate those whales in holding or accumulating more , is it that they lack the funds to accumulate more, or they don't trust Bitcoin, or they went into the market without any idea of how Bitcoin operates, what do you think could be the reason why shrimps panic sale instead of accumulating like whales?",

The big whales or huge holders are probably institutions, government or individual that are very Bouyant financially. For them, thier Bitcoin holdings serves as a reserve that stores thier wealth and so they can afford to keep holding and not sell it too soon regardless of being in profit. The small scale Bitcoin holders are mostly into trading and takes out profit at any slight opportunity but still reinvest it into Bitcoin again. They are the reason for the daily buys and sells of Bitcoin that makes it volatile. Also, Bitcoin is not just a store of value but is also a medium of exchange. People still make use of it for transactions and for making payment. A typical case is what's happening in the forum where campign managers moves Bitcoin week after week into different wallets of participant of a particular campaign. The block will record it as a sell and you might think the holders of the escrew isn't wise for not holding the Bitcoin. The purpose in that context is for payment of campaigners and that also happens in different areas and form. This is just my thought on this.",

Big investors hire sound crypto analysts who give them all the information they need to make decisions. While those who see Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme feed themselves with information from social media. Some hodlers don't have emergency funds, so they panic sell to cover expenses even when they are not in profit. While big investors have the financial strength to accumulate as much as possible without problems.Most of these big businesses have insiders in the government, so they are always the first to get hints about the policy direction of the government. But not all small hodlers panic or sell their coins prematurely. Many of them have been brave enough to keep their coins regardless of FUD going around. Only the weak hands sell because of a price drop.",

We are different people, with so many different things including ages, experience, knowledge, social and economical status and more. By having different backgrounds, most of us don't think the same.In investment, newbie and experience investors have big difference as well as big and small investors. Asking small, retail investors to react similarly to whales is very tough call. Some can do it but most of them can not do it but it's natural in the market that is made by many components, from whale, institutional investors to small, retail investors, experienced and newbie investors.If you can invest money in Bitcoin with right method, for example Dollar Cost Averaging, you will have good chance to get profit. It's the bottom line for your investment success.",

In fact, panicking newbies is the profit scheme traders. When someone loses, someone else wins.But usually the newbies learn their lesson. I remember when I was a newbie and panic sold every so often during volatile, scary market moments.I like to view the losses as \"education fees\". So if anyone panic sells, don't feel bad, just learn something out of it.",

It takes knowledge and experience of how Bitcoin works not to panic and sale when because they will think that the their BTC will soon vanish. Proper knowledge will make a hodler to understand about pump and dump that after dip price will recover and increase.Another reason why small scale Bitcoin holders will panic to sale is because of lack of money, somebody who depends on the profits of Bitcoin investment to survive will naturally panic and sale when it begins to dip. Unlike the whales who are very rich and are not bothered about dip because they are holding for long term until they are prepared to offload their bags. Lack of money can make people to take rational decisions to sale and survive, not that they don't know that it's better to keep holding their Bitcoin for long term.",

My explanation is that these big investors are not like inexperienced small investors whose main aim for investing is to make quick profit.

Some process collection and analysis of data for these assumptions are not reliable. Most of these estimations come from observations and the process could be faulty.",

Those amount they currently spend for bitcoin investment is what they have that's the reason why they get panic when there's dumping condition happen since they can't afford to see the value of their accumulated bitcoin is decreasing and what these people usually think that doing cut loss is always the best decision they could do. This also shows lack of experience since if they have long exposure with bitcoin and now this scene which price dumping of bitcoin happen for sure they will never get panic an let those events happen since they know that bitcoin will recover.",

Small Bitcoin holders can be people who are new to Bitcoin and starting their investment. without a good understanding of the market, of course, seeing the value of their assets drop in large numbers creates panic. the worry is that the value will not be able to return.Another reason is the need that forces investors to sell some of the Bitcoin they own even though the value is falling. we never know the difficult times that each person is going through.Actually, novice investors must know that long-term Bitcoin investment will be more profitable. but for those who are less experienced, panic is natural in investing. you can plan your investment well, but when you are inexperienced, everything can mess up your plans.",

This is why it is really that important for you to have that awareness and experience at least for you to have that kind of sustain on the time that you would really be dealing up with this crypto space. You would definitely make yourself having that kind of panic selling on the time that you dont know on what you would gonna do and this is why its really that important that self awareness on what are the things you are doing is the key for you to have that kind of good handling towards self because once you do missed out on doing so then you would really be that impulsive on the things on what you should gonna do.This is why its really that important that you should really be wary on the actions that you are taking. It would be always recommended that you should really be assessing out different market conditionsand since you are already wary on the possible actions that you would be taking then the best approach is to make yourself act according into your own knowledge.",
