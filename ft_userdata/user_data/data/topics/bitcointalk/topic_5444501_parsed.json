No, but life on earth compared to eternity is statistically less than a nanosecond in comparison with \"eternity\". Just like the way you feel how fast the time had passed when you think about the past that we sometimes refer to it as it was like yesterday.Things get really interesting when you look at the life as a test, at this stage you realize you'd need to study first, and at this second stage, you realize there are too many paradoxes/contradictions and you'd feel that you need guidance, this is the third stage where you need to be careful, ask directly from the source, and God shall provide.The story of life is not pre-dictated, however it is prewritten but we will never know it while we living it, that's why we can do whatever we want, and the point of the test is exactly that, \"we can do whatever we want\"  in the face of it all, what are we going to do with that freedom?",

God sent us to earth to worship Him.  We all have to leave this beautiful world one day when we will not have the balance between the rich and the poor. God will consider all the sins and merits of all. The world we live in now is like a beautiful dream for us and this dream can be broken at any time. Once this beautiful dream of ours is broken, we will respond to the call of the creator and go to the other side. So everyone should respect their own religion and follow the complete rules of their religion to the fullest.",

I believe that this world is like a dream and that when we die we will wake up from this dream and know all the facts.There is a hadith of the Prophet of Islam that says: “People are asleep, and when they die, they wake up.”",

      "body": "If I found out that my current life is a lie and in fact it was all a dream or an illusion, it would be quite an amazing experience. In that case, I would probably have experienced mixed feelings, since the reality that I knew would turn out to be non-existent.However, as with any unexpected situation, I would try to adjust and adapt. Rather than just abandon the idea of reality and forget about the previous life, I would look for ways to understand what happened and how to move on.Perhaps I would have questioned the nature of this new reality and explored it more deeply. Maybe I would look for other people who also realized that it was all an illusion, and together we would try to solve the mystery and find a way to the true reality.However, it is important to remember that we all create meaning in our lives based on what we experience and believe. Even if my previous life turned out to be a lie, the experience and lessons I learned from it would still be important and useful. I would strive to use these lessons and my new experiences to build a meaningful life in the new reality that I discovered.",

But what you are saying is also a dream of is own.   It is the selfishness of man that making things difficult for his fellow man. God made everything easy for man to enjoy but the wickedness of man is the cause of all these things. And this world like this will never be a dream world. It is the real life which God created for all. But if really I noticed that this a fantasy world then the real world will be a world of happiness and success. All these nonsense will not be found in that place.",

If I discover that this life I'm living is a lie and not real I'll also be happy to leave the other life that I wake up into with the experience that I have gathered from this life. When things seem not to be going well for you, you just have to understand that that is how life is, and that things are not always rosy. I know probably your life situation has made you think about this that maybe this life is not real but whatever it is you're going through it is temporary and with a little hard work you will do better.",

I, I totally believe the fact that reincarnations exist because the Bible made us to understand that when Christ died bodies were resurrected from the dead and humans were also given freedom.",
