It should include links to the social platform and information about the team behind the project which are used to identify the team. In order to make announcement threads more appealing and interesting, the OP should engage some people to prepare them. The service is not free, however",

You seem to be on the right track and please do not hesitate to do more as a new member of the forum. It seems like there is more announcement threads and new projects coming into the forum as CZ binance acknowledges this forum and people cease to trust twitter leadership, which could have an impact on cryptocurrencies.",
