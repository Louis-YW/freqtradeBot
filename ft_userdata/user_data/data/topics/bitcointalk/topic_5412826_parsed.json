  "content": "Unfortunately, my experience at this casino turned out to be very unsuccessful, although I read positive reviews about MBit and trusted this casino. On July 12, I won 4,719 LTC. I played mostly Panda fortune 2, North guardians, 100 zombies, 7 bonus up, Ancient Troy, and Aus dem Tal. I, as expected, following all the rules and requirements, sent a selfie with a piece of paper and a passport, a passport, and a bank statement. I wrote to the chat and to the mail, but I did not receive any response. It's a pity. I've already seen several complaints about MBit here, but I still don't understand how they ended. Do you think I have any chance of getting my money back?",

What makes your case different from other complaints they are all ignored so your chances are slim unless Mbit changed its way and resolves these complaints.",

Indeed, the representative of MBit Casino has not been on this forum for a long time, which means that complaints are not being considered. However, not so long ago another user wanted to file a complaint against the license provider and after that the thread was closed. I'm not sure if something worked out for him, but you can read this thread. Here it is",

So you have done all the necessary procedures to make a withdrawal? can you recheck the email, is it true that until now there has been no reply from support?if looking at your explanation without any evidence, I don't think you have received a ban on accessing your account. it should be easy to contact support. add some of your evidence. but anyone on this forum, I'm not sure anyone can help with your money.looking at the current situation, I am quite concerned, you have to admit that it will be difficult to get your money back.",

No, you did not do everything right, your accusation did not have weight because there is no proof that you provided us for us to see if you're really telling the right thing, we don't know if you're cheating the casino that is why they did not let you withdraw, you can make a difference by providing proofs to help us verified and strengthen the other accusations that MBIT is indeed a scam casino and the complaints are not isolated and they have intentions to scam people.",

It looks very familiar.you are probably thinking about the LTC casino issue. the OP there had a complaint about not being able to withdraw his 1496LTC and was being accused of abusing a bug or something but the issue between the user and LTC casino has now been resolved. that being said, If I remember correctly the OP has a 300LTC withdrawal limit so I don't think he has withdrawn all his remaining funds from the casino.",
