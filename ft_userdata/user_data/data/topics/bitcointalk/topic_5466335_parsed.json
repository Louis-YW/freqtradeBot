I wonder how come they restrict NFT games before while it just same with other games that has a built-it in payment method or an in-app purchase.I doubt that there’s still a new demand for NFT games unlike before during Axie Infinity become popular but this update is still good in preparation for upcoming bull market. NFT games or new trend will have a good exposure on playstore.PS: Please use normal font size because it’s too big to read using hand held device. It’s not really helping if your aim is better readability.",

The demand for NFTs may have reduced because it was just a hype era and as such it won't take long before the wave resides.",
