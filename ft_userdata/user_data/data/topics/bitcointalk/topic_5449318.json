  "content": "Hi,There is this situation that happened to me where a transaction gets included in a block, then there are four additional blocks that get added while the number of confirmations for my transaction remains unchanged (as shown by btcrpcexplorer), until a sixth block gets added, which caused the number of confirmations for my transaction to  jump to 5. Would this occur if there are parallel chains that develop? If it is the case, how do the transactions that were included in a shorter chain get introduced back in the main chain? Do they just get back in the mempool with the same priority as any other mempool trnasaction? Does it mean my transaction could have been easily overridden while there was only a single confirmation by spending any input utxo using a higher fee?Thanks!",

The counting is done completely in the wallet/explorer.If your explorer showed additional blocks but did not change the confirmation count, then the problem was in the explorer. If you saw the additional blocks in a different explorer, then the problem was probably that your explorer was behind for some reason.",
