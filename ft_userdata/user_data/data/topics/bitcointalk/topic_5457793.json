  "content": "So I thought I'd try and gauge sentiment over how another Bitcoin ETF will affect price in the immediate term if approved, as well as offer my own personal opinion.I understand it's considered bullish for Bitcoin long-term, but in the short-term, I'm not so convinced it will be good for price. As many of you may remember, when CME/CBOE launched futures trading for Bitcoin in December 2017 this was very much at the peak of the bull-run before a -83% correction in price. Then there was the Bakkt futures launch in September 2019 prior to a further price decline of -50%+. Finally there was the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF that was (again) launched at the very peak of the bull market in November 2021 prior to a 75% price decline. Is anyone else noticing a pattern here???I realise that previous futures launches are different than the current proposed ETFs, as far as I understand, but the facts remains the same. Each time a traditional form of investment product based on Bitcoin has been launched, price has corrected significantly, between 50% and 83% basically. What's as concerning is that price is currently at a resistance level which could now become a local peak...Ideally any new product won't be launched until price reaches $40K to $50K levels at a minimum, so that a correction doesn't threaten recent lows. But otherwise I imagine it will be the same old story of \"buy the rumour sell the news\", with a potential long-term bullish effect on Bitcoin but only after a short-term negative effect that becomes the catalyst for a considerable correction in price.Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong if there were Bitcoin Futures/ETF launches that didn't negatively effect price in the short-term, as based on my current knowledge, this has been the only outcome so far.Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Do you really think another ETF launch would cause an immediate price increase, or is it more like to have an immediate negative effect on price?",

      "body": "I think that ETFs will be a positive effect on the price for many reasons. As banks see ETFs getting approved they will rush to purchase their own Bitcoin, as it will enable them to launch their own fund and collect fees. This will lead to a feedback loop of growing ETFs bringing higher BTC prices and thus generating more revenue for their fund managers. Scary, but it shows the potential for seemingly endless gains.",

This is as a result of it being an old move, and the first one may have created positive news on the market that attracted enough investors to rush into the market, which was what just happened a few days ago. Another ETF news might just sustain the market for the main time but won't create any further bullish move since there might be only a few people trying to enter the market again.The first ETF news is still fresh.",

Do you really think another ETF launch would cause an immediate price increase, or is it more like to have an immediate negative effect on price?ETFs can impact bitcoin prices. The positive impact can be expected in the long term, but I also tend to doubt the impact in the short term. At least a price correction is still very likely to occur in July until the end of the year, but afterwards prices can be higher.The good and bad effects of ETFs on prices in the past may be called fluke by some, but I believe the same pattern could repeat itself ahead of the 2024 bitcoin halving. I wouldn't worry too much about another big correction in the next 6 months, but it should be considered as an opportunity to collect more bitcoin.",

I wouldn't worry too much about another big correction in the next 6 months, but it should be considered as an opportunity to collect more bitcoin.Maybe this will be the last opportunity before the Halving is reached, so there is still a chance to get Bitcoin at a cheap price. The current price is still stable above $30k and if the price corrects then the opportunity to buy again. There is a possibility that the same pattern will repeat itself, but of course, there are changes in each pattern following the development of current prices and market conditions. Hoping that the new ATH will be reached in Halving 2024 and that is everyone's hope of course.",

Whether this will be the beginning of a bullish trend is hard to say. If all factors converge, then ETF could be the catalyst for the next bullrun. It is not easy to predict, because this is a cryptomarket in which there are many players-BTC-buyers/sellers and it is impossible to predict the actions of everyone. There is more chaos than order, sequence and regularity. In one thing, I am sure that this event should not have a negative impact, because, after all, this is positive news.",

Because since it’s a spot etf, it means that the issuer needs actual physical bitcoins, and these are scarse on exchanges pretty much in large quantities. So there will be a bubble of some sort but a mini bubble.Then when it launches most likely it will peak like it did the prior 2 times and start to head down wards. Unless we think that this time it will be different.",

      "body": "I don't think that previous events were crucial for price correction, because if we start from the end of 2017 then it is easy to conclude that the bubble simply had to burst after many investors completely misunderstood what futures contracts are and how they will affect the price of BTC - and the same thing happened at the peak of 2021.As for Bakkt, that story has been pumped for months as something big, when in fact the pandemic was already knocking on the door even though mere mortals didn't know it. In addition, the 50% drop occurred only in March when a pandemic was declared, but then a lot of bad things happened and Bitcoin was no exception.The story around BlackRock and Fidelity (Grayscale) can have positive effects, especially if the SEC accepts their request and this acceptance is closely correlated with halving. If we take into account the time limit within which the SEC has to make a final decision (240 days) then this brings us to January 2024, just a little more than 2 months before halving.Given that BR&F are big players and companies with over $10 trillion under management, and that it is a spot ETF, I believe that a positive decision would have a significant impact on the price of BTC. The real question is whether the average investor understands what this is really about or thinks it's just a repeat of another old story with a failed BTC ETFs.",

I think so -- but not so much a cause-effect. I think ETFs try to time when they believe sentiment is right (so less about a bear/dip but a great entry before the rally they're predicting). And whoever's advising them to make their bets doesn't seem to understand that rallies don't come so soon after a fall.Another massive drop after another ETF launch won't be terrible news for me though",

Then I agree with you on the fact that, If eventually, ETF approval happens at the same time as the halving period, It is going to trigger the next bull run, but my concern here is that we may experience selling the news event may first play out. , meaning a slight dump first, then the main event, the Bull market kickstart.",
