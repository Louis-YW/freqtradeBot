  "content": "Taiwan’s Defense Minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, has responded to US Congressman Seth Moulton’s proposal, stating that the Taiwanese armed forces would not stand for the destruction of any of their facilities. Congressman Moulton recently suggested that the US should warn China by threatening to target Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) if China were to attack Taiwan.During a conference hosted by the Milken Institute, a California-based think tank, US Congressman Seth Moulton was asked about the potential deterrent impact of US chip policy on China. In response, Moulton suggested that the US should explicitly warn China that targeting Taiwan could destroy Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). “The US should make it very clear to the Chinese that if you invade Taiwan, we’re going to blow up TSMC,” he said. https://eurasiantimes.com/us-threatens-to-blow-up-taiwans-semiconductor-manufacturing/videohttps://t.me/HomishTG/5187TSMC market share over 50%.There will be a huge shortage of components around the world.",
