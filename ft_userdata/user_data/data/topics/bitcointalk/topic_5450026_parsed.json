  "content": "After price increased by 10% this month from the opening price of around $28.K, the monthly candle is now down around 4%. Do you think it will now end in the red, if so by how much?Personally I think reclaiming $28.5K within a week remains possible, given the lack of bearish pressure to push prices below $27K, but also unlikely to see a particularly green candle above $31K. Price is otherwise between the 20 & 50 Month Moving Averages, currently priced at $32.2K and $24.5K respectively. The former is currently trending downwards in bearish formation, the latter is trending upwards in bearish formation.Price is otherwise re-testing the 50 Day MA at $27.1K, that failed to act as support last month, after the \"golden cross\" that occurred with the 200 Day MA back in February:FYI This is just intended as a short-term topic/poll, will lock the thread at the end of the month once the result has been confirmed.",

Reason being that there were always a strong buying pressure whenever its around the bitcoin halving, although there may be an occurrence that would like effects or affect the market either positively or negatively. When i look at the bitcoin history around a year getting to halving it doesn't always ends the same with other years, although i am not good with candlestick predictions.",

Do you think it will now end in the red, if so by how much?I've read about Bitcoin price predictions and speculation aimed at 2023, especially talking about Bitcoin prices mid-year and end of this year, the phenomenon of the Bitcoin decline in the middle of this month, is not dramatic: the decline is meaningless, meaning Bitcoin stays above $ 20k and never drops below $ 20k.From the data that I have read and speculated that Bitcoin is currently entering its lowest era, there will be no sharper decline for the next few months, but speculation and predictions never produce 100% accurate data, the crypto market can change unexpectedly, anything can happen, but at least we can think logically now to continue Bitcoin.",

I think the price won't go above $30k until the end of this month, it may just go around $27k - $29k. However, it is not impossible to retest to $32k if there is big news about BTC or crypto, but it should be positive news/issues. Since I don't hear any significant issues/rumors on Bitcoin/crypto, I guess we only see the price to move slowly.",

Do you think it will now end in the red, if so by how much?Yes, considering that April is coming to an end in less than a week, it is quite possible to think that the red candle won't turn green in just 5 days. I may not know how much to expect, but the market only looks to be going sideways between $27k to $29k.I would not expect prices to fall any deeper than they have now for the rest of April. So bitcoin price I might expect to hold above $27k for the rest of April. But then, I would expect the green candle to form again in May, but if it fails then this correction is likely to continue.",

Well, that's very possible, but that trend is looking like that of last month, where it almost kissed $30k but still did not, was this month before it saw some green movement to $30,000. Although one week is still too long for it to reclaim $28k or even $29k, I think the candle can still go green before the month ends.I like how that chart looks.

And a red month is not bad if its a small correction and not a massive dump.Actually you are on point but the problem is that Bitcoin decrement when it starts it's difficult before it could regained it's ground of increment, because what triggers the increment is demand rate of investors, while when Bitcoin began to fall it's speculation that made it to continue falling, while all our mindset will be on correction. So in summary, their is every tendency that since the red has surface all throughout next month will be red or it changes to be Green, the increment of Bitcoin and falling is not measurable, from my perspective.",

Do you think it will now end in the red, if so by how much?If you look at the price movement from the current market information BTC is still at $27,300 BTC and is struggling back towards the price of $31K, it seems that the market is experiencing some bearish pressure, which is shown by the downward trend in recent months. . Moreover, the lack of bullish momentum above $31K suggests that a significant price increase may be unlikely.I think, Nonetheless there is a possibility that the market may recover and end April on a green note if it manages to reclaim the $28.5K level within a week. Is it possible but it's a bit difficult let alone predict how far the market will move in both directions, because there are many factors that can affect price movements.",

Have never seen that website before, is the data available to see the historic accuracy of these predictions? I only see forecasts, not past performance. It otherwise looks like very bearish predictions with a general range between roughly $15K and $30K until 2026, including new lows in 2024 and a high of $44K by 2026? Seems unlikely to me personally. Either way it seems the forecasts are based on very recent data, like 1 year, rather than a decade worth of data that confirms Bitcoin remains in a long-term uptrend, so there's not much reason to be forecasting sideways for the next 4 years...If I also had to guess, I'd imagine the forecasts at the start of the year was targeting much lower prices in years to come, but now these uber-bearish forecasts have been reduced a bit?*Edit: I found archives of that website's predictions from 2017-2019 which were completely wrong  Then notably by end of 2017 these mildly bullish forecasts changed to ultra-bullish, predicting $45K by end of 2018. The predictions in 2021 weren't much better either *Was totally right about this statement, the forecast from February this year was for sub $10K",

Bitcoin drop below $30k means the market doesn't have the demand to keep the price trading above $30k and we'll need some more news but at the moment we aren't getting anything positive.The only reason the market pump before which was last month was because the market was oversold and was due for some pump. Bitcoin has been finding it difficult to retest $30k and I don't think we can do that before the month ends, we're just 5 days away and things aren't looking that positive.",

So we might see the price trading sideways at $27k up until the end of this month. This will be like in the last week of March, wherein as I have said, $28,500 is the price and even if we go down, it's just minor and we will reclaim and go back to that price. So the same thing is going to happen at $27,500. It will be remain at this price until we will have a big news that will push the price in May.",

So with that, I will say that April will be red month unfortunately. And if I'm not mistaken, CME Bitcoin future contracts expires every last Friday of the month, so that will be April 28. And usually the price goes down before the contract expirations. And then we might see another sideways, it doesn't mean that it will be bad next month though. So another consolidation phase for all of us, and it's either breakout or breakdown validation next. So overall, this bearish month might be good overall for the long run.",
