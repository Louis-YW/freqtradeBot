  "content": "Hi Everyone,Since I just recently joined this Bitcoin forum, I would like to start with sharing my trading strategy and custom Tradingview indicators and settings that I use, so that you can also improve your crypto trading skills and profits. I will reveal all in a round of 2 live crypto masterclasses that you can attend for free in return for a review about why these masterclasses were so valuable to you. After you have posted the review I will also give you trust on your forum profile, and a merit once someone explained to me how to do that in the comments below .I believe that it’s better to teach someone how to fish (trade), then to just give them fish (signals). That's why I want to invite 40 people of this forum to attend a round of 2 live crypto masterclasses for free (in return for a review about why these masterclasses were so valuable to you), so that you can increase your knowledge and crypto trading skills, so that you know exactly when to buy or sell Bitcoin and/or altcoins, analyze Bitcoin market cycles and trends, spot bullish altcoins, and do your own in-depth analysis of altcoins after attending these masterclasses with me, a crypto trader and on-chain analyst with 5 years of experience. I like to keep things simple, as you can see in the example screenshot below where you can see the custom indicators in action, and when they indicated recent trend reversals for Bitcoin for example. I exclusively look at a favorable combination of the profit zone, the profit squeeze, the strength snapshot, and the money flow.You can find the exact dates and times, and more detailed information about the masterclasses by signing up here > https://masterclass.cryptoanalysis.live/lp/132086/lp132086?track=btc < you will then receive an email with all the details. If the dates and times work for you, simply leave a comment below with why you would like to attend, and I will pick 40 people (based on their comments that I think I can really help and make an impact on) to attend the masterclasses for free.Let's go!",

This is why I believe that we wouldn't be able to do something wrong if we get it free, but be careful just in case.We do not know OP and we do not know if he is a great trader or not, and if he is a great one then he will teach you something amazing, but if he is not a great one then it is going to be a terrible situation to be in. So, just focus on getting better yourself if you can, but if you are getting a free thing, just check what type of deal it is and if it would work or not.",

      "body": "before making wrong judgments about you, i suggest you first post your trading results in this thread, do this so people will feel safer, i think it costs you nothing to be constantly posting your trading results, you can also post about what price direction do you think it holds. for example: we are at $29400 (today the 29th) could you tell us what the next price would be? Will he go up or will he fall or will he be sideways?other point:After you choose these 40 people and teach them, what's your next step?",
