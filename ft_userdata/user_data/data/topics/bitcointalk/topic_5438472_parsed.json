A statement from the ICPC disclosed that its operatives arrested the Regional and Service Managers of the financial institution last Friday for hoarding N258 million in the bank’s vault. The new Naira notes were given to Sterling Bank by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to disbursement to customers to ease the tension caused by Naira scarcity.Source: https://businesspost.ng/banking/icpc-arrests-sterling-bank-managers-for-hoarding-n258m-new-notes/Good job to these guys. These managers don't even have conscience, N258 million naira is a huge amount of money. How can someone hoard such an amount of money while a lot of persons are suffering? God help us in this country. I just hope they would be made to face the full wrath of the law.",

They prefer to see you suffering and making profit from your sorrow or hardship. Make EFCC visit all the banks nation wide by sending their squads to different places make e no be only for Abuja because for my side here na the same thing we dey pass through.

Instead, they are allowing people to suffer and stand in long queues at the ATM; some even fight and abuse themselves there. I see on social media lots of incidents of violence that have taken place due to this Nigerian new naira note stuff. Let them just throw the manager in jail and charge him for a theft attempt.Some crack up Videos I came across, is just so funny but, dem... this is so serious with Nigeria and this Naira stuff.https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY6mH23f/https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY6mX5JE/",

Maybe they did not print enough of the new notes because they want to promote cashless economy or it is the bank managers that are giving priorities to politicians for their own selfish gain, who would receive the money and keep it for the forthcoming elections, thus not getting to the ordinary man on the street... Well these are all speculations.",

What was the effect of the arrest? Are they taking the bank managers to court or is it all for show? The banks that were caught withholding cash, have they started disbursing the money to their customers? The answer is NO.",
