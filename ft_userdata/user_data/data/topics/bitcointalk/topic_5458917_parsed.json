That way it will be easier for DT members to analyze your post properly and do the needful if indeed your claims are true.I haven't check the profile you presented but for now all I see is you highlighting the same wallet address of two users you believe to be operated by the same users, no additional information.",

If @OP just wait a little longer after the distribution begin, maybe we might see if both accounts is really a cheater or not. Now they would be more careful since someone have busted them.",
