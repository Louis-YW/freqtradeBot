  "content": "Good morning everyone. I write this post to share an unpleasant experience with you. I'll start by saying that I've never had any problems with Coinbase, which I consider a serious and reliable platform. I have always carried out my operations with the utmost tranquility and confidence, and nothing has ever gone wrong. But yesterday, here is the wet blanket. I go to withdraw my funds using PayPal (which I always do) and I get this error:QuoteAn error has occurredPayPal withdrawals are currently disabled. Use another payment method to withdraw funds.The fact is that I can't use any other payment method because, after entering my bank details, it tells me that this function is also disabled. I have no debit card.So I thought about buying Bitcoins and sending them to an external address, but I can't make purchases and I can't send cryptocurrencies. In short, everything is blocked!I contacted support via chat, but bots responded telling me that my problem was taken care of and that they would contact me via email. I am very worried because I am afraid that my funds will be blocked in the account without being able to withdraw them in any way.I ask you: has something similar ever happened to you?",

I would imagine they at least sent you an email explaining why your account got blocked and the steps to follow to unlock it. Usually, when an exchange does that, it's because they detected suspicious activity with your transactions or account.  Have you tried calling them?",

That is if the issue is not specific to you, and everyone has the same issue.Another problem might be kyc/identity. If the name on your PayPal account doesn't match, or the amount was large, that'd make sense too.",

In short, everything is blocked!Maybe they disabled PayPal withdrawal for everyone as they didn't mention that only you have been disabled. Another question is why you can't buy buy and send them to other wallets. Maybe only you are restricted for withdrawal. That's why I don't suggest to store funds in any custodial wallets. We should keep as much as we can afford to lose or should withdraw immediately after closing trading positions.And don't worry about this because sometimes if custodial wallets detect suspicious activities then they disabled withdrawal temporarily. And hope support team will resolve your issu asap as Coinbase is a well-known, trusted and reputated exchange so far.",

It is possible that Coinbase will ask you for sme additional verification in order to regain full control over your account but once again its proven that keeping your money on CEX is risky, even if its one of the most reputable exchanges like Coinbase.",

But I can't figure out what, since I've apparently never violated the regulation.However, I have received some emails from Coinbase support where they have asked me a lot of questions, which I have answered.In the last email they told me that I have to wait 5-7 working days for the problem to be resolved. I hope it's like that. The fact is that I needed the money now, not in 7 days.They tell me that if I can't withdraw via PayPal in 7 days I can do it using another method. But at the moment everything is blocked: I can neither buy nor choose another payment method, nor send cryptocurrencies to an external Bitcoin address. In short, I can only deposit and convert cryptocurrencies into Euros. But I can't withdraw.I keep you updated. I hope everything works out but I'm not very hopeful.",

Yes I am. I did some research and found that Coinbase had an account on Reddit where they provided support. So I signed up and filed the issue.In the meantime, this progressed and I was emailed my case ID number. Now I'm waiting for everything to unlock or, at least, to be given the opportunity to withdraw. I understand that a website should take appropriate measures to avoid fraud or anything else, but blocking your account without notifying you or at least informing you of the reasons, I don't find it very fair. I've always used Coinbase without problems, made a lot of transactions, deposits, withdrawals, exchanges. We'll see. I wish you all a happy Sunday, and thanks again for your support.",

Some speculation suggests that some accounts are closed because the users live in the states that sues Coinbase, although the proof is thin IMO. There is a long thread that basically claims the user account was closed because he uses VPN. It doesn't help that there is no clarity from the Coinbase side either. I guess you can only wait at this point, and consider moving to other platforms/P2P if they are not being helpful.",
