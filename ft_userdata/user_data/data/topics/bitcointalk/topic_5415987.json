  "content": "The number 13 tattoo is thought to represent bad luck, pain, and death. As a lucky charm and omen of impending misfortune, some people get the number 13 tattooed on their bodies. It suggests that when typical bad luck comes your way, it will avoid you after realising that you have already experienced plenty of tragedy.According to superstition, getting a tattoo with the number 13 is a sign of bad luck, trials, suffering, and even death. Due to a few religious components, this is also regarded as such in the west.ThanksSend your feedback at BTC, What do you think about Tattoo of 13?You can visit this article Tattoo of 13 for more info!",

      "body": "I actually hate the number 13. Frankly, I always avoid the number 3 in all ways so that’s the number 3, 13, 23, 33 & so on. It’s just some weird, OCD thing. I dunno why but I always feel 3 is bad luck. It’s kind of the same with leaving the volume on an odd number is a big no for me. I certainly would not be getting any number with a 3 in it tattooed on my body.",

      "body": "Well although I do have a couple of tattoos on my body, I would never get a number 13 tattooed. One of the reasons is that the number 13 represents bad luck in many different cultures. It represents rebellion which usually also starts at the age of 13 years old. And I don’t agree with having any numbers whatsoever tattooed on my body. I think that anyone that tattooed themselves with this number must be a gang member or former prisoner.",

      "body": "Tattoos are not good for your health. Your body is constantly trying to expel the ink from your skin, but since the particles are too large they are \"stuck\". This causes inflammation and other toxicity problems on a microscopic level.Best to avoid tattoos altogether.",

      "body": "Note that there were 13 colonies that started the United States. They became the first 13 States. This was both lucky and unlucky.How was it lucky? US citizens seem to have more general freedoms that almost any other nation.How was it unlucky. Government people have these same freedoms, which they often use to make wars, like the one in Ukraine that the US is making.In general, wouldn't get a tattoo. But if I did, I wouldn't get a 13 tattoo, because of the ambiguity in the number.",
