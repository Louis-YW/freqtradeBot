A race condition is a situation where two or more threads are trying to access the same data at the same time. In your case, it is possible that two or more threads were trying to give away merit at the same time, and this caused the error.",

Of course, I opened the page that got the error again and it all went smoothly.Now that I look at the time, I am quite surprised I was doing it that fast on a 10\" touchscreen with 3 seconds between actions, I was quite sure I had way more than 5 seconds between taps so that's probably the cause.Quote from: LoyceV on July 31, 2023, 09:09:58 AMI've seen \"An Error Has Occurred\" many times while Meriting many posts. I don't remember any error number, but just click back, and it works again.I kind of guessed people who merit far more often than me would have encountered it a few times but I was curious why I never saw the issue discussed, maybe I just missed the topic.--Anyhow, it has something to do with merits and it just fixes itself, I don't think I've found a vulnerability to exploit the merit system Â  so unless proven wrong I guess I'll lock the topic in 12 hours or so.",

I think the ones who give merits very often can have such errors because users like me with limited sendable merits won't face such errors. Although, I try my best to send all my sendable merits as soon as I find good posts, but still I think such error can occur only for those who have a lot of merits to send.",

If so: Cloudflare blocks certain keywords, chances are you wrote something it didn't like. When that happens, try to isolate the word/code that triggers it, and report it to theymos.
