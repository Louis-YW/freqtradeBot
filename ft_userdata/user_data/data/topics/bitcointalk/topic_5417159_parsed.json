  "content": "We are in a time of crisis and I have to say that inflation is so high, it affects everything. A lot of people have been expecting bitcoin to exert its anti-inflation properties, and then things didn't go as expected, assets like bitcoin are not immune to short-term negative effects. I see that many people are starting to be negative and skeptical about bitcoin's ability to fight inflation.But if we don't just look at the short term but look at the long term, looking to the future. We'll see what bitcoin can do.+ In 2010: with 10,000BTC we will buy 2 pizzas.+ In 2016: with 100BTC we can buy a car.+ In 2022: with only 10BTC we will buy a house, maybe many countries will not need 10BTC to own a house, sometimes only 3BTC to 5BTC.Just looking at these things, I can tell you that, if BTC is not the best anti-inflation asset, you won't find a second asset that is more inflation-resistant than BTC.Let's feel for ourselves what is going on in our daily life, is this true? I believe you will have your own final answer.QuoteFiat ðŸ’µ is designed to lose value over time, punishing savers.#Bitcoin #BTC offers an alternative savings technology, free of debasement. source pic: https://www.facebook.com/BitcoinBlueWhale.eth/ Fiat is designed to die slowly.QuoteA short history on the slow and constant death of the dollar. ðŸ’€This is why Iâ€™m in #Bitcoin #BTCsource pic: https://www.facebook.com/BitcoinBlueWhale.eth/This is always true if we zoom out and look at the history of bitcoin.Buy bitcoins before it's too late.Quote7 years ago 55,000 Turkish Lira got you a Volkswagen.

      "body": "Inflation's built into fiat currencies by the central banks which seems like a bizarre stipulation that most fiat users don't even think about. It's targeted at 2% yearly under stable currencies. Unstable currencies/economies would only dream of a 2% inflation rate. Losing 2% of your purchasing power year over year is massive, and that's in the best case scenario when the central banks can keep a balance on the economy. If they choose to ramp up the money printer, it'll reach a large multiple of 2%.For folks that think Bitcoin's fluctuation in price is too much to handle, I'd argue that a guaranteed yearly loss on your purchasing power is worse.",

I think the idea of an unregulated currency is very attractive, especially as it goes against how our economy is used to running.For me, there are two reasons why bitcoin has the potential to succeed in the future1) because new users want to invest and use the currency;2) because one day it will be adopted by someone or a group of people who have a lot of money.The first reason seems more likely because I believe that if more people start using the currency, then others will want to get in on the action although I don't expect this to happen quickly, especially in current conditions it could take a few years. one thing, I feel it's possible.",

You are correct in focusing on the fact that BTC was worth nothing 10 years ago, and that is what needs to be taken into account when revaluing it. Most people compare the last peak value of bitcoin to the current price (which is now low) and draw conclusions from this, which I consider to be the wrong approach. From this position, it seems that bitcoin is a bad tool to fight inflation. In part, this is true if we evaluate it purely in a short period of time. But you need to scale your attention and make assessments considering the whole picture of what is happening, and not a piece of the puzzle, that is, in the long term. In this case, it immediately becomes clear that BTC does an excellent job of compensating for inflation and even more, due to the large profitability in case of holding for a long time (at least several years).",

Its easier to store, easier to transfer, easier to use, easier to divide even to cents and has better stock/flow ratio which will not change after price pump (gold supply will pump after 10x price pump because it will be profitable to mine gold from sources that were unprofitable before) . That's why it may work as good inflation hedge but not for those who bought the top. And we don't know where real long term value is. It may be at 50k$ and we are way undervalued. It may be at 1k$ and we are way overvalued.",

The value of Bitcoin does increase over time, but you should also note that the increase in the price of Bitcoin is also based on the amount of demand in the market, so it will not always increase if one day the demand for Bitcoin decreases. Close examples like last year and now where the price of Bitcoin is still rotating at $19K to $20K, while for the highest price last year it was $60K although the price didn't last that long for a unit of Bitcoin, but at least Bitcoin was at that price. So is that also called an increase in value over time for Bitcoin?",
