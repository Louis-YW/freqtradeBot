It normally happen when we aren't gambling for entertainment only and we do risk money more than our budget, I would not use \"money you can affor to lose\", as there are times you can afford to lose the money you are gambling but it's already out of your budge, so in the end, it will have a big effect on your emotion.",

I think you're an honourable man to take regular inventories of yourself and access your attitude towards your household, observe where you're getting it wrong and I believe you're working on it and that's why you've come out here to straighten us all up peradventure we're behaving badly too. Sometimes our emotions just cloud our judgements momentarily and we act in ways we are not proud of, but I believe in making up. If that your son is of reasoning age, possibly up to four(4) years of age, it's important you still let him understand you after you let loose and shout at him that you are not like that and you were not really happy. You've to go back and apologize to him and tell him reassuring words like \"I'm sorry for shouting at you, daddy was not happy\" so that he doesn't see that behavior as part of you and grow up being irritable occasionally. This will make him very sensitive and love you more because he will understand you don't shout because you hate him, rather you were unhappy. It will surprise you that when next you shout or get impatient with him, he might ask if you're unhappy and that will help you regain consciousness and straighten up your attitude towards your child. While you work on your emotions and your gambling addiction, your child shouldn't be a victim of your bad habit and mind you, the child is growing up and if you don't slow down on your addictions to gambling, you might end up having more addicts at home and mess up your household.",

Apart from that, winning and losing in gambling is normal so I am not surprised and do not have excessive expressions when I win or lose.Under certain circumstances I might get angry when I lose a large amount of money, but I never take that anger out on my family, neither my wife nor my children. I am always ready to take risks in gambling because gambling is a choice that I make fully consciously.",

A person who gambles all the time suffers losses and actually talks angrily to family and neighbors. Always depressed and quarreling with the family is a behavior that is not tolerable.When a person gains from gambling he always gets better food, clothing, and environmental changes. Such behavior can only be observed among gamblers, such as the behavior of my neighbor. So, without becoming addicted to gambling, one should take a break from time to time, it will also improve the mental state and reduce the chances of gambling losses.",

If we gamble to make money when we lose, we will definitely get emotional easily and vice versa, but if we use gambling as a form of entertainment, we won't cause big problems let alone looking for an outlet for our family who haven't done anything wrong.It was your mistake in gambling and your loss was a risk you had to take so don't take it out on other people. We must be able to control ourselves and position ourselves to be responsible figures as heads of the family because our attitude reflects a person's self. Don't let your children imitate your temperament. Your temperament affects your children psychology. So use gambling as a form of entertainment and face the risks when experiencing it. If you don't want to lose and don't want your emotions to control you, you should avoid gambling or avoid things that cause you to get emotional easily.",

I don't think the results are important because sometimes I always assume in my mind that I don't want to win and would rather make money in this field. Although in history I have had some very impressive but not too important wins, I can also understand the behavior of someone who easily loses control of their psychology when they place more importance on their possessions than on their finances.",

It involves money, so the stress and the effect are greater, but the thing is, you should not involve your family or people around you because you are the one who's playing, so you should only be the one who's affected, but it can't be blamed on. It is a common phenomenon for gamblers and also a sign that you are addicted and can't control your emotions, so you should always have a way to ease your feelings or a way to divert your attention to other things so you can be calm, or if you really can't contain your emotions, then better stop and divert your anger to something that is not alive.",

I'm addicted, and I want fellow gamblers to make a self analysis at regular interval and be on the safer side.Money is powerful but I must say that this behavioural change doesn't happen to me in gambling, and I believe the reason is that I do not have so much trust in gambling, and hence the need that my mind is not so attached to it as I do not view it as a means at which I will be rich in life. This alone is helping me not to be emotional in gambling, everyone can try it too. But I feel this way so much in trading. I feel the joy and excitement in me when I win or in a winning position, but the opposite goes to when I am losing. Perhaps, it could be for the fact that I am used to trading far more than gambling which makes me feel less of such in gambling, as trading is all that I have that feeling and attachment to when it comes to passive income.Besides, let me advice you just the way I do. I never let my negative emotions show around the people I love. My wife and children deserve the best of me all the time, so I always hide it when I feel bad and it has been part of me as no one would even know how I feel unless I tell them. This is far more reasonable than passing aggression on them for something they know nothing of.It might be difficult at first but with a very strong mind, you will realize you don't act based on emotion any longer if you wish to change.",

The last 2 days I also throw my mobile phone because I did lost on roulette games and my mood changes as all. So what I do is to sleep it out and calm myself.So just be careful for everyone, we all know that losing has also a effect on us mentally that's why what the OP describe is real and we are very angry with people around us. Control is the key here, and just like in my case, I try to do it by just shutting down my self from everyone until I was able to get control of my emotions and apologizes to the people around.",
