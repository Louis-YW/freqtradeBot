From examples, an example from a private conversation. On Twitter, the system divides people by interests and political views and shows each audience the right fragments from the speeches of the right politicians.If you are interested in cryptocurrencies, then you will constantly see beautiful speeches of candidates about the legalization of cryptocurrencies and maximum freedom in the development of these ecosystems.____Trump will not go to jail, and if he is elected president, all charges will be dropped.",

They are simply looking for Trump admitting to doing something. If he admits to doing the things they are indicting him for, even though he did nothing wrong, they will convict him... even though he is convicted of doing right things. Then they will try to punish him for getting convicted.The other side of this is the advertising. If there were any angry Trump people Jan 6, there are going to be a bunch more and angrier now. Even your standard Dem realizes that this is stupidity on the part of the Biden team.Mike Lindell developed a device that can track if voting machines are hooking to the Internet during the voting. Three-hundred-thousand of his people are taking these devices around the country to all the major voting places. And this time (2024) the Reps will be watching the voting places a lot more closely.If Trump is both elected and found guilty, he will be under White House arrest, and out to the Capitol under Huber laws (work release). If he appeals, he might not have any trouble until after his next presidential term, 2024.",

If he wasn't, he would have found a reason to NOT turn himself in.At the same time you totally ignore the fact that Biden is trying to destroy America. Fact? You can see it in what is happening to America... slum size increase, more drugs and fentanyl, illegals being welcomed in, creations of new money for Ukraine while places in America that have need are ignored.But I can understand why you are like this.

Everybody who knows you knows it by now.After all, Democrats questioned all kinds of elections in the past, and nobody indicted a Democrat former president the way they are going after Trump. It's all to keep Trump out of office, a totally unconscionable thing that Trump isn't doing, himself.Trump Campaign Releases Video Supercut Of Democrats Disputing Republican Election Victorieshttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/trump-campaign-releases-video-supercut-democrats-disputing-republican-election-victories\"Republican supporters and President Trump are being ridiculed, persecuted, and even prosecuted by Biden, congressional democrats, and their radical prosecutors for raising questions about the accuracy of the 2020 victory,\" the video begins.\"This may be one of the most hypocritical acts in history considering the Democrats have violently claimed that the last three Republican Presidential wins were stolen, rigged, and illegitimate, and it was Democrats who tried to stop the certification of a Republican President,\" it continues.The video goes on to cite a number of occasions in which Democrats have challenged election results, including during the 2000 presidential election when former Vice President Al Gore lost in a close-call race against President George W. Bush.Mr. Gore ultimately challenged the results in the U.S. Supreme Court amid a clash over which candidate had received Florida's 25 electoral votes.The Supreme Court subsequently ruled that a previous Florida Supreme Court order for an elective manual recount of that state's presidential election ballots was unconstitutional and Mr. Gore eventually conceded the race.In the video, multiple Democrats—including President Biden, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—can be seen questioning the 2000 election results, with President Biden stating outright that he believes Mr. Gore won the race....EDIT: Gore might have won the race against Bush in 2000. The reason why SCOTUS couldn't vote in favor of Gore in the case where Gore brought the election to court, has to do with what the Supreme Court is all about.Justice Scalia explained that Gore didn't have even one man or woman who identified one of the hanging chads as his, and that he was harmed by this. The rest of the voting apparatus is up to the States. In other words, hanging chads is a State issue until there is a man or woman testifying how he has been harmed, with evidence and witness.",

Trump did all kinds of things that are not illegal. But he didn't do D.The election was stolen. The method used to do it was to make unconscionable election laws that were not illegal to make... election laws that if the people understood what they were, the people would be abhorred that their State officials were like this.D is the correct answer!And yes, Trump did call election officials and lied about thousands of dead voters and dominion hacking and workers stealing ballots and other stupid stuff that he claimed to know was true but was actually false.  And then he said find me ~11,000 votes. QuoteThe election was stolen. The method used to do it was to make unconscionable election laws that were not illegal to make... election laws that if the people understood what they were, the people would be abhorred that their State officials were like this.What about dominion, and dead people voting, and Ruby Freeman passing USB drives with vote stealing software, and stuffing ballots into suitcases?  What happened to all that?Trump didn't lie. Find his words in context and see that he was questioning, or that he was quoting others who supposedly were knowledgeable.What happened to all that? It didn't go away. It's still there. Total dishonesty of election officials in front of the general populace. If not illegal, it was because they had the authority to make unconscionable laws.",

She’s a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler.”Quote“They weren’t in an official voter box, but they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases but they weren’t in voter boxes.”There's plenty more, let me know if I should keep going.Like, literally....I could keep going for pages.  He lied a shitload.Full audio: https://youtu.be/AW_Bdf_jGaA",
