Litecoin begs to differ.It only made some relatively meaningless tweaks to Bitcoin (or to the now forgotten Tenebrix to be precise), and its much-touted ASIC-resistance proved to be extremely short-lived (its PoW now just takes a needlessly long time to verify), yet it went on to be rather successful in terms of marketcap.Doge itself launched as a Litecoin clone with a few more meaningless tweaks.It did make a very meaningful change later though, when it introduced Tail Emission.",

People are valuing shiba based on speculation and not from fundamental of token.it's quite clear that as a meme token and this has no utility value. That means if this is a security token that has no any usability. You can tell those who are still buying this token but they will ignore your awareness as they wanna only speculating this token.",

Yes, but Elon Musk's pump and dump is not a positive thing for the market.Quote from: Pterosaur on August 22, 2022, 03:32:01 PMThis can only come from a newbie   Stop laughing so dumb and learn some facts before buying a coin without underlying knowledge. Quote from: Pterosaur on August 22, 2022, 03:32:01 PM1. For all those saying that Shiba inu was only shill on Youtube to get peoples attention, go to Youtube right now and search for your favourite altcoin, you will see many Youtubers shilling them, is there any coin or token that's not been mentioned on Youtube?.It is still massively shilled on YouTube and even massively shilled on Twitter from Elon Musk. And it is a big problem because Shiba Inu is just hot air and hype. It will die quickly when all shills are letting it down. Better get out ASAP to prevent a big loss and exchange Shiba Inu into real, useful coins, be it for innovative tech or store of value (Bitcoin). Shiba Inu is a very weak coin, dude! Get real! Quote from: Pterosaur on August 22, 2022, 03:32:01 PM2. Some people will keep ranting till another bull market gets here, all they would ever do is fantasizing how cruel bear market can be, fear filled in their gut and by the time they wake up its 2024.It is not rating, it is exposing Shiba Inu, a very weak shitcoin. Because over time, only valuable coins, where a good tech is implemented, will win. Shiba Inu can't offer good tech. It's a fact, dude. Quote from: Pterosaur on August 22, 2022, 03:32:01 PMThis is the time for accumulation not making some.complains, before Shiba inu surge so high do you know how many people said it's a shit coin? Of course it is shitcoin because its based on a very weak foundation. Bad rech and Elon Musk still comments, kekw. Shiba Inu will cause huge loss and grief, dude. It's not time for accumulation it is time for a very quick sell to prevent more loss. Quote from: Pterosaur on August 22, 2022, 03:32:01 PMThis is a land of opportunity, learn to make money off them.Shiba Inu is a land of big LOSS, learn to do a good research about coins, dude.Quote from: GEMIN_M4 on August 22, 2022, 04:39:13 PMThose who are complaining are those who bought when the market is already take a new turn into bear market, they bought high and are now trapped for a long-term hold they aren't mentally prepared for. OFC.  Everyone who complains about shitcoins and warns people about the risks must have bought them during the ath. I would also like to have such a simple world view.",

It should be sold. Another strategy though is a very short term trading with this token. As long as there are people who believes in it's fake rise in the future, the movements will be pretty restless. This ain't like BTC or Ethereum, there's nothing behind it. Take advantage of what it offers now and claim it as soon as possible.",

There are many copy cat coins in the market but guess what some coins are changing it's path to avoid being called as copy cat. I expect meme coins to be devaluate in long term but it isn't guaranteed. We can see the hot support from the community on bringing life to this coins and I can see many hardcore fans who are buying meme coins non-stop hoping for a greater profit in the future. As long as there is a demand, Even meme coins won't die.",

If i should buy altcoins i will buy Shiba inuWhat’s good about SHIB aside from its hype? Though it has a value but I think we should not overhyped it because many are still trap on this token. There’s a potential if there’s a good usage for this token and it’s supply will be limited, but the case right now is too impossible to reach a new peak let’s just see of SHIB will still improve, for now I won’t buy this token again because I can’t see any good development with the meme tokens right now.",
