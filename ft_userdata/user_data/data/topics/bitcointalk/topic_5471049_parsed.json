In my perspective of the best exchanges i see decentralized exchanges as the best, because with them your privacy and anonymity is intact not compared to centralized exchanges where most of them request for KYC before you can do perform P2P. So if you’re looking for non KYC then visit kycnot.me, but if it is KYC exchanges then there are exchanges like KuCoin, OKX, MEXC and more. You can read Ratimov’s threads non KYC exchanges",

Also OP might be from a country where binance is restricted to use because of regulatory issues like the binance US and as such could seek another centralized exchange as an alternative",

I was going to write Binance, but other than Binance, I will say, the answer will be based on your location, but if you can use Binance in your country, then I think you can use any other exchange in your country too (which is also not very true in some cases like Binance works in my country and probit and wazir don't). Well, you solely mentioned a centralized exchange, so I will say you can try any of the following: But you have to find the one that works in your country, as if they don't, then your KYC will be rejected.

Binance is by far the best exchange for p2p transactions but in this case you want another exchange that's a good alternative of Binance. Since you're trying to find an alternative of Binance P2P so I decided to share the one that's the best one after Binance p2p. The exchange is named as OKX and it's by far the best alternative of Binance p2p. You can easily trade p2p on this exchange and surely there will be many sellers and buyer that accept the fiat currency of your country.",

Those who aren't asking now might ask very soon. So you have to find a decentralised p2p cryptocurrency exchange. You may find some exchanges that've been mentioned by other users. Better share your concern here, so we may prefer a suitable solution for you. Besides that, you may use the forum currency exchange section for P2P sales. Just make sure to use an escrow service if the buyer or seller isn't trusted enough.",

Do you have positive experiences using them?Yes, I trade with a lot of the same people that were on LB and Pax. Similar concept as LocalBitcoins, but the site never holds the funds. You deposit into your own wallet, and send the funds to seller's wallet, which is monitored by the site. You have to pay extra for the transaction fees, and it takes a little longer, but it's secure and safe.",

I find that if we use P2P of centralized exchanges, it will be more convenient than P2P of decentralized exchanges. In my opinion, liquidity on decentralized exchanges is still not high, I tried once with bisq but finding currency buyers and sellers in my country is quite inconvenient. There aren't too many options for me, whereas on Binance, I can easily choose traders with many different prices. To be fair, CEX offers a better experience but the issue is privacy and people who don't care about that should stay at CEX. For those who value privacy and identity, DEX is definitely the choice but will be quite more inconvenient than CEX.",
