  "content": "WHAT IS SAFFRON CoinSaffron coin is a saffron-backed digital currency, and we intend to exchange saffron for saffron coin, which makes it a common currency in everyday transactions.The use of blockchain technology in sending saffron can improve the performance of this supply chain in turn, and improving the transparency and ensuring the performance of the producer is one of the goals of using this technology.The main way to use blockchain in business is to use it in the saffron supply chain for the consumer.Blockchain technology helps food suppliers to improve the way saffron is sent and received worldwide.Why Choose SAFFRON CoinThe most important technical part of the project is setting up a sales department. Due to sanctions and special conditions of the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is not possible to send and settle products to all parts of the world. Lack of trust between users and buyers will be one of the problems. Appropriate in the blockchain platform to solve the above problems and is listed in the White Paper *. Token saffron initially aims to gain only 5% of the domestic saffron market, which is a very simple and accessible goal, but with the same conditions in less than three years with a gentle slope with minimum capital and activity to 20% market share of domestic production We find that the profit is more than five hundred million dollars a year. The aim of this project is to deliver saffron directly from the producer to global consumers. At present, Iran's share of the $ 8 billion saffron market (with 90% of world production It is only 286 million dollars, only 5% of the production of Khorasan province is enough to reach the consumer through this platform, which will result in a financial transaction of four hundred million dollars and a profit of two hundred million dollars annually. Due to the speed and power of investing more profit, more market development is possible in less time. Due to the special conditions of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the world, it is not possible to send, deliver and settle this volume of saffron. Â»Delivery and settlement of Iranian saffron to any part of the world without any intermediaries has been provided by the blockchain system (* White paper (Whitpaper) which in the Persian dictionary\" white papers or white letters \"and in English this word for\" accurate report and \"Comprehensive\" or \"official report\" is used; it is also widely used these days in the world of digital currency and coin offering (ICO). \" White papers are sales and marketing documents used to attract potential customers. They also contain information about the product, service, technology, or methodology associated with it, for pre-sale marketing tools or product design Saffron white paper is being updated And will be available soon.Saffron blockchain technologyThe farmer prepares the conditions for harvesting saffron by irrigating and protecting the saffron bulbs. At this stage, the stigma is carefully separated from the flowers and the other parts of the flower are prevented from merging. This stage is usually done at sunrise.After extracting the stigmas, they are dried on paper sheets and sold, so for saffron of valid quality, there must be constant information about the conditions and production path, because fraud and deception can occur at any stage.Most saffron scams take place at one stage of the supply chain, so the data must always be kept intact, and this is where the saffron token comes in:Understanding the global saffron scenario, the saffron token launches a saffron supply chain monitoring platform.Saffron token provides traceability by introducing transparency in the supply chain.It is a purchasing platform implemented with blockchain technology that ensures complete transparency in supply chain management for various industries to gain its previous trust and efficiency. Saffron tokens are very useful in such an industry because every step of the chain From harvest to packaging can be recorded in the blockchain and the trend of saffron from producer to retailer can be observed by the consumer, which proves more accuracy.Advantages of saffron tokens in saffron production and sales industryInformation from the production to the place of delivery can be traced.IoT integration for live tracking helps analyze and plan activities and transactions based on total supply chain information.Provides complete visibility for all parties involved. Any side of the system can access the data at any time.Saffron token is a solution that aims to simplify the supply chain and address the major issues facing the industry.Â Saffron token has the potential to create a good opportunity for both consumers and businesses.Product performanceRequirements concerning product characteristics and performance are sometimes outlined within regulations or contained within standards referenced by regulations.These requirements cover aspects such as product purity, chemical and physical parameters, and sensory and visual characteristics.Specialized laboratories are equipped to test for these characteristics.Colour, aroma and flavour are vital to saffron quality.The three components that create these distinct qualities are crocin, which gives saffron its deep red colour: picrocrocin, which provides its flavour; and safranal, which gives saffron its distinct aroma.During quality testing, the presence of these important components is carefully measured, usually using spectrophotometric methods.For example, the higher the absorbance of crocin during testing, the higher the colouring strength of the saffron.It is important to note that buyers may have different quality requirements that go beyond what is legally mandated.Grading the saffron in a laboratory gives buyers certainty that the saffron meets their desired level of quality.Grades are assigned based on the level of each component, and market prices of saffron are often dictated by grade.The advantage of having recognizable grades for saffron is that consumers have some guarantee of quality without having to buy and taste the saffron first.The most commonly requested standard for saffron and saffron powder worldwide is ISO 3632:2011, which establishes three grades (l, II and Ill) based on a collection of quality characteristics.Some buyers may go beyond this standard.PackagingPackaging systems are a vital component of export success.Packaging systems include not only the materials used to package the product, but also all of the packaging-related processes along the supply chain.Packaging machines and equipment, transportation and storage, whether at a production centre, distribution centre or at the point of sale, all influence the success of a packaging system.Moreover, the disposal of packaging material after final use or consumption of the product must also be considered.In terms of packaging materials, the primary aims are twofold: to ensure the integrity of the product until sale and to entice consumers to purchase the product over other options.Packaging protects its contents from external threats including spoilage, breakage and damage from external environmental conditions until the product reaches the end user.Noncompliance with regulations such as those pertaining to food contact materials can result in outright rejection of goods at the port of entry in the destination market. There are generally three layers of packaging that need to be considered for most products: primary, secondary and tertiary.Primary packaging is that which comes into immediate contact with the product and is the smallest unit of distribution.Secondary packaging envelops the primary packages and serves as an added layer of protection, such as a case or carton.Tertiary packaging is the third layer of packaging, which is generally used during transportation or shipping, such as a palletized load of secondary packages.Different packaging materials offer different resistance levels to different elements.Saffron is very hydroscopic â€” that is, it absorbs moisture easily.If not packed properly using materials with very low permeation to moisture and oxygen, there is a risk of mould growth that can cause mycotoxin contamination or spoilage.Due to the unique properties of saffron, general bulk packaging guidance offered for other spices may not be ideal.For example, if plastic or polyethylene bags or pouches are used in bulk packaging, there are some potential material weaknesses that need to be considered: they may be porous, which allows saffron aroma to escape; they may allow I-JV light to reach the saffron, which degrades its quality; and they provide little physical protection for the delicate threads, which are prone to breaking.ðŸ”—WEBSITE: https://QAENATsaffron.com/QuoteðŸ’¬WHITEPAPER https://qaenatsaffron.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SAFFRONcoinWHITPAPER.pdfâœ…AUDIThttps://cointool.app/audit/Contract?chainId=56&address=0x65c86985cDE08C46E8CA99321bC5083A6Eb30ee9âœ…CONTRACT0x65c86985cDE08C46E8CA99321bC5083A6Eb30ee9Email :Â  Info@QAENATsaffron.com",
