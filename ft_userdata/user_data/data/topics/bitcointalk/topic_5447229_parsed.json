  "content": "Hello to all of you!My name is Dylan, I'm 25 years old, I'm a UI Designer and I just spent 5 years in a company that uses blockchain.From now on I intend to start my own business and solve problems in the Crypto/Blockchain atmosphere.That's why I present you my project : Ctravel (C for crypto / Travel for travel)Brief description of my projectCtravel is a platform for renting accommodations between individuals with cryptocurrencies as a payment method.What problem are you trying to solve?Ctravel answers a simple problem. Today if I have crypto-currency and I want to spend this crypto-currency for accommodation I have two solutions available to me:1 - The service Travala.com allows you to book hotel rooms around the world2 - Use a crypto.com or binance type of cryptocurrency card (what about decentralization which is the main argument of cryptocurrency)How do you want to solve it?If the user wants a more atypical property or simply to have his little comfort like at home. He will certainly go through Airbnb the leader of the C to C (consumer to consumer) market.And currently no actor of the market proposes the reservation of private individual to private individual with for means of payment the cryptocurrencies.That's how the idea of Ctravel was born!What is your market? What is its potential?- 18/ 35 years old- Digital native- Passionate about crypto- The user who wants to spend their cryptocurrency because they own more bitcoin than euros.Number of people holding cryptocurrency in the month of December 2022: 425 million(119 million more users joined the crypto world in 2022)This is a number that is exponential over time, depending on the forecast by the end of 2023 there would be between 600 and 800 million users.Potential:Today as you have seen there are more and more people who are interested in cryptocurrencies. Not for the lure of easy gain, but for that decentralization! In an era where the financial markets are increasingly dilluting the fiat currencies thanks to the money printing of the FED or the ECB. The users of crypto-currencies want to own a currency that was created to avoid the big stock market crashes. And this behave as a store of value such as gold.The Ctravel project is therefore in this niche where the adoption of crypto-currencies begins to see the light of day from year to year!As for the competition (Airbnb), I have foreseen this eventuality. I have an arsenal of features I plan to put in place to get ahead of the gameThe project doesn't just stop at the cryptocurrency payment part otherwise the added value is not enough.I plan to create an ecosystem of features around this project.- Ctravel Token: Creation of a token to make the project ecosystem work.- Cashback: Each time a user makes a reservation, he/she will get a % of the transaction back in Ctravel.- Wallet: The cashback will be transferred to your Ctravel hot wallet- Swap: You will have the possibility to exchange your Ctravel for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.- Exchanger: You will have the possibility to trade the different cryptocurrencies that will be voted by our users- Stacking & Earn: By depositing your Ctravel tokens you will benefit from an annual % APY payout.- Lending: We offer crypto lending with collateral- Subscription: We offer a Premium service with specific benefits ( + cashback, 10% discount on all transactions...)- Dao: Let users vote for decisions made within Ctravel. Translated with And if tomorrow Airbnb starts to make payments in crypto?Today it is complicated for the gafa, to set up financial services and create their own cryptocurrency. We have the example of Facebook which has tried several times. The various states around the world are against a major power to create its own currency and come to shade the fiduciary currencies.Nevertheless, let's say that Airbnb manages to offer a service that allows payment in crypto. What about Ctravel?Through the differences service proposed above. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts will probably prefer to stay on Ctravel and in the manner of browser Brave.Supporting blockchain projects rather than feeding this giant that finally doesn't have the same values...Here is an overview of my project, I would like to have your feedback on this idea.Would you personally spend your cryptocurrency to travel or would you use fiat currency on airbnb?Feel free to leave negative or positive comments as long as it is argued that is no problem!Have a good day and above all, don't forget to travel!",

Why the need for a token? What does it contribute to the platform other than giving extra initial funds for the development and probably won't see any usage sooner or later?2. Why is there a stacking, lending, dao program if your goal is to solve crypto rental market? I doubt any traveler would look at a traveling app and say \"damn, this lending proposal is good, I should buy it\".3. Don't you think creating a third-party lending platform that allows users to pay their Airbnb or something similar with crypto is more valuable compared to this new, ground-up renting platform? If no, why? Is there any law that prohibits you to do this? I assume it would work like how people can buy gift cards with Bitcoin, even though the platform where they use the cards doesn't support Bitcoin payment directly.4. I don't believe that people will willingly support and stay on your platform if it is not competitive. This \"us vs them\" mentality is not going to work if your platform is terrible, has no control over the rental house, doesn't offer protection, etc. How will you compete with Airbnb in its customer service department other than being friendly toward crypto? 5. I've seen similar projects in the past, with more or less the same proposal. They do an ICO and then close their business without ever producing anything. What is the guarantee that you will at least deliver some beta apps if you plan to do the same?",

      "body": "Hi !1. The Ctravel token is there to represent the company on the cryptocurrency market and also to reward the user when he rents an accommodation he receives a % in travel which is similar to cashback.2/3 This is part of the secondary features I thought it was good to offer a panel of features but the main idea will remain the payment of housing between individuals in cryptocurrencies.4. the idea is to offer the same guarantee of protection as with Airbnb with a deposit system if damage has been caused to the property! But it is certain in terms of customer service it seems more complicated than what I had imagined!5. I really intend to solve a problem related to cryptocurrency, whether it is this one or another, it is not a problem.My topic is here to face the reality and see if there are people interested in such a solution.

The Ctravel token is there to represent the company on the cryptocurrency market and also to reward the user when he rents an accommodation he receives a % in travel which is similar to cashback.I more or less understand it. But is there a need for a token other than to get more funds for your initial funding? I mean, if we look at projects like Bitrefill, the existence of tokens is unnecessary. You can provide ETH or BTC or something similar if you want to provide a loyalty program. You can address the issue of funding with crowdfunding and something similar I guess. Even if you don't have a token, as long as your platform is good enough, I bet it will still be popular.Quote from: Ctravel on April 02, 2023, 07:29:39 PM5. I really intend to solve a problem related to cryptocurrency, whether it is this one or another, it is not a problem.Not to say that you'll scam people, but I doubt you can assure them your project will last with just a promise. I guess if you can provide an MVP or something similar, more people will take your project seriously. If not, and you start asking for funding without anything to prove your capability, I guess it won't go anywhere.",

If the project makes enough profit with a % on each transaction and the project is profitable, it is not necessary to have its own currency!And then providing Btc or Eth as a reward seems more attractive for the user!Yes you are right about providing an MVP with a working system to prove my intentions and determination! Thanks a lot anyway, it's very motivating for me to talk about my subject and to confront myself with everyone's opinion!",

I think it could be very interesting for the Bitcoin community and it could highlight the Lightning network service which is very underrated.I see it's a very interesting idea! The platform could very well offer both use cases one for medium/short term rentals like Airbnb. And also propose long term rentals like 6 months / 1 year without having to make several reservations. It's relatively easy to set up thanks for your idea!",

Their growth prospects are too low due to the fact that it is positioned as a CMS for booking accommodation. The customer has to manage to find these customers so I don't see much interest in it As for Beetoken I did not know, they seem to have wanted to ride the wave of green hype \"a tree planted for each transaction on the blockchain\" In any case this kind of marketing promise is pure scam.My coming here is simply to get feedback on this idea, I think there is a market and I want to meet a market need. I'm clearly not here to hurt Blockchain / Crypto projects on the contrary! I sincerely believe that this is the payment of tomorrow.",

      "body": "An interesting issue that I worry about in a crypto-Airbnb setup is how chargebacks will be handled. People are pretty hesitant to list their house on Airbnb, and Airbnb has learned that they need to go to great lengths to make everyone feel financially safe with using the site, i.e requiring damage deposits, offering their own Airbnb insurance, etc.If a guest trashes a house, the owner doesn't know until they pop in after the guest has left. On Airbnb, they can presumably file a claim with Airbnb, and Airbnb could charge the guests credit card or bank account. That can't happen in crypto. On the other hand, guests pay on Airbnb when they book, and they won't know for sure that they are getting what they paid for until they arrive. There are loads of scams of people listing fake houses or houses that they don't own to get paid today and then disappear with the funds. This isn't very successful with Airbnb being able to moderate payouts and handle chargebacks, but how could a crypto Airbnb handle that problem? I suppose an escrow would help there, but there is still the issue of handling disputes that arise after a stay ends (like house damages).I don't think it's an insurmountable issue, but it certainly is something to think over.",

      "body": "Quote from: nioctib_100 on April 06, 2023, 11:47:43 PMAn interesting issue that I worry about in a crypto-Airbnb setup is how chargebacks will be handled. People are pretty hesitant to list their house on Airbnb, and Airbnb has learned that they need to go to great lengths to make everyone feel financially safe with using the site, i.e requiring damage deposits, offering their own Airbnb insurance, etc.If a guest trashes a house, the owner doesn't know until they pop in after the guest has left. On Airbnb, they can presumably file a claim with Airbnb, and Airbnb could charge the guests credit card or bank account. That can't happen in crypto. On the other hand, guests pay on Airbnb when they book, and they won't know for sure that they are getting what they paid for until they arrive. There are loads of scams of people listing fake houses or houses that they don't own to get paid today and then disappear with the funds. This isn't very successful with Airbnb being able to moderate payouts and handle chargebacks, but how could a crypto Airbnb handle that problem? I suppose an escrow would help there, but there is still the issue of handling disputes that arise after a stay ends (like house damages).I don't think it's an insurmountable issue, but it certainly is something to think over.I understand well this problem and I have a beginning of answer to that:- First of all, in case of dispute, depending on the country where it happens, you have to make a complaint to the police station and explain the situation in the most serious situations!- In a second time Ctravel puts in place different points to penalize the person at fault:1 - It will be necessary that the person who will receive prejudice it can be the tenant (Housing not in conformity with the photographs etc...) or the host (For degradations of furniture for example).Document the dispute with a descriptive text of the problem in question with different photos to support these words.2 - Ctravel users participating in the DAO will have the mission to resolve these disputes via a vote that will be in favor or against the complainant. And in return, the participants will share the amount of the fund allocated to the DAO, which is supplied to the value of 2% of taxes on each reservation.3 - What will happen if, for example, the offender does not wish to pay the amount of the property he has damaged voted by the DAO to the tune of $1000?The user will be banned from the platform and will never be able to register again. And Ctravel will compensate the host with its own funds. Later on, the idea is to partner with an insurance company that covers these costs, but at first Ctravel will take care of these costs.4 - How do you plan to ban someone from the platform if the Ctravel system is decentralized? It is necessary to be able to find an in-between between securing your property and decentralization for a more open world! One thing is sure, there will be no KYC! We think that the good solution is to pass by an identification by telephone to constrain to the maximum the malicious persons.5 - We can also think about a deposit system but I don't think it's a good idea. It can be a brake for the users who want to rent an apartment. This can be solved by a community vote in DAO to know if the community wants such a feature or not.The idea with this project is to solidify the blockchain project and to shadow the giant centralizers.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",

To the delight of the various countries/banks.Thank you very much this is an essential point for me to meet the needs of the market. The idea is to deliver a 0.1 version and that little by little the community via the DAO takes ownership of the project and that it meets their needs better and better.  The user is at the center of my interests and this will not change.",

Today if I have crypto-currency and I want to spend this crypto-currency for accommodation I have two solutions available to me:1 - The service Travala.com allows you to book hotel rooms around the world2 - Use a crypto.com or binance type of cryptocurrency card (what about decentralization which is the main argument of cryptocurrency)",
