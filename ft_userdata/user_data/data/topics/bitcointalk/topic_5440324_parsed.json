Why do you need a wallet password phrase?",

This means that all existing key pairs and addresses will remain the same, but any new ones you generated with the encrypted wallet file will be different to those generated by the non-encrypted wallet file. You can use the non-encrypted file to spend any coins from addresses which are common to the two wallet files, but any addresses you generated in the encrypted wallet will not be reproducible in the non-encrypted wallet. Your only solution for any such addresses will be to bruteforce your password.",

In the very old versions of bitcoin core, you had to back up your wallet again, once you generated the 101st address.Versions prior to 0.13.0 of bitcoin generated 100 random addresses and once they were all used, it generated anther 100 addresses. In the case OP has used a version prior to 0.13.0 and has generated more than 100 addresses, it's possible that the first backup doesn't include all the addresses.",

I have never had to worry about it because I have never used an unencrypted wallet, but that seems like a problem.I feel you didn't understand o_e_l_e_o correctly. You don't lose your bitcoin just because you encrypted your wallet. Let's say you have an unencrypted wallet and have generated n addresses till now. You just backed up your wallet and now you want to encrypt your wallet. You encrypt your wallet and you have two backups now. One is the backup of the unencrypted wallet and the other one is the backup of the encrypted wallet.The encrypted wallet will include all the n addresses generated by the unencrypted wallet, but the (n+1)th address generated by the encrypted wallet will be different from the (n+1)th address generated by unencrypted wallet. So, if you have bitcoin on each of the first n addresses, you can use each of the backups for recovering your fund. If you have bitcoin on the (n+1)th address of the encrypted wallet, you can't use the backup of the unencrypted wallet for recovering your fund. o_e_l_e_o, correct me if I am wrong, please.",

For a legacy wallet it simply saves any previously generated key pairs as it normally would, but changes the hdseed for all future key pairs. For descriptor wallets your old descriptors (along with their xprvs) are still stored in the now encrypted wallet and simply marked as inactive, so they are still there and can be used to regenerate any addresses they previously generated.Encrypting a wallet still saves everything the wallet has done up until that point. It is only from the point of encryption forward that all future keys will be different to an unencrypted back up. Although obviously it is better to just encrypt a wallet right from the start and not run in to this problem at all (or the problem of some of your keys being stored in unencrypted back ups).Quote from: hosseinimr93 on February 21, 2023, 09:18:32 PMo_e_l_e_o, correct me if I am wrong, please.

That is quite different from a typical HD wallet where the mnemonic phrase is the backup.Technically, it offers some \"extra\" protection in that if one of your older backups is compromised, only keys (and their attached coins) generated prior to the passphrase change are at risk. Which could, theoretically, minimise your losses if you tend to move coins to newer addresses on a regular basis and you regularly change your passphrase.I suspect for most people, it isn't really of much use and just causes extra work because they then have to refresh all their offline/offsite backups whenever they change the passphrase or they face the prospect of losing coins attached to newly generated keys if the in use wallet file is corrupted/lost etc.",

Not that many people rotate passwords just for the sake of it. And so if you are changing the password, then you presumably want all future keys to not be able to be generated from any old back ups using the old password, since they are at risk of compromise.But perhaps this would encourage people not to just create a new wallet if they think their wallet may be compromised, which is of course the best option.",
