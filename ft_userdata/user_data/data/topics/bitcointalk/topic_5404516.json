  "content": "OverviewZenland is a smart contract platform that solves real-world problems using smart contracts. Our smart contract escrow service is the first step on the journey to complete our mission. Its goal is to ensure secure transaction of digital goods and services sold or bought over the internet through simple programmable agreements published and stored on the public blockchain. A user-friendly interface integrated with the EVM and 4 other major EMV-compatible networks quickly connects the end-user to the selected blockchain network allowing to create, deploy (publish), and execute smart contracts realtime.  A set of specific built-in smart contract functions allows easy and risk-free transfer into and release of token funds (stablecoins) from the contract directly to the wallet address specified in the contract. Key Benefits & DifferentiationAs the first smart contract platform enabling smart contracts for general public, Zenland is different from all other existing smart contract platforms in its application and focus.End-user ready platformWhile other smart contract platforms are mostly used for DeFi application development or enterprise use, Zenland is designed to address specific needs of the end user. One of many concerns of the online user today is trust. Even some of the most popular peer-to-peer marketplaces are full of fake reviews and profiles, recognizing which is becoming harder and more timeconsuming. This creates the need for a new way how we do business online to ensure a safe and secure financial transaction between random people on the internet.Smart contract escrow A simple one-page programmable contract published and stored on the public blockchain is the solution for trustless transactions online. Anonymous and transparent, it offers a guarantee of a formal agreement without any third party involved. Unlike traditional escrow services, Zenland escrow contracts are decentralized, does not require KYC, and time-lock contract funds in the blockchain (and not in someone's account or private server). Common good over personal gainsAs much as we want it to turn into profit (and who doesn't?), we are driven by the idea of bringing smart contracts to daily life through simple full-service solution to peer-to-peer commerce and beyond. As such, unlike other one-off crypto projects Zenland will not push you to \"buy our token\" but rather encorages new users to invest their time by exploring user documentation and testing the platform. Stablecoin integrationIt's no secret that the whole cryptocurrency thing is volatile and hardly anyone would buy a pizza with bitcoin, or other  altcoin today. To make a transaction fair for both sides entering into a smart contract agreement Zenland has 4 major stablecoins integrated - USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI (1 unit is roughly $1 equivalent). This not only ensures that the payable amount is easy to calculate, but brings stability to digital asset holders. We believe this stablecoin integration with the simple escrow contracts would finally bridge the gap between DeFi and regular people.Development & MissionThe Zenland platform has just been released with its first smart contract type - default escrow contracts [June 2022].This release marks the end of a 10-month test-driven development of the platform's interface and its smart contract logic. That being said, Zenland is a continuously evolving platform that will incorporate user feedback throughout the beta testing phase and in the upcoming releases. All important updates and new features added to the platform will be listed here in this announcement thread along the way.As of today, the following features have been enabled:- anonymous and secure web3 login (via MetaMask extension) without email or password;- decentralized escrow with the default escrow contracts integrated with 5 major public blockchains;- autonomous (no third-party access) and programmable time-locked access to funds kept by the contract;- it supports only trusted major use cryptocurrency tokens, such as USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI;- built-in logic for unsettled cases — on-call dispute resolution by a Zenland agent;- real-time execution and control of Zenland contracts (via a user-friendly “Contract Control” interface);- in-app contract chat displays associated blockchain transaction logs and contract states);- automatic recording of transaction logs and contract states in the chat associated with the specific contract;- internal wallet for a service fee [testers and early adopters are given a trial fund to use Zenland at no cost];Our vision for it as a full-service smart contract platform that simplifies financial transactions between individuals leveraging smart contracts would eventually lead Zenland to expand beyondthe scope of escrow smart contracts. Application & UseAs of now with the first smart contract type being built,  Zenland is finally ready to test and prove its smart contract escrow service to the world. The contracts are one-page long programmable agreements intended for safe trustless peer-to-peer transaction of goods (primarily digital) and services. See how Zenland escrow contracts work in detail [a brief video guide]Unlike traditional escrow services or payment processors, our default escrow contracts are:- easy-to-use: built-in default escrow contract template, contract chat displaying contract log messages, control page to regulate the contract progression, contract notification system, etc.- decentralized: Zenland escrow contracts will only come into effect once deployed (published) to the public blockchain network and can never be controlled or executed by any third party or central authority (including the Zenland team).- anonymous: no personal data that directly identifies a user (no KYC), other than standard browser data, is collected or stored on our server before, during, or after the contract execution. - trustless: neither you nor the other contract participant have to trust any third party including us with the contract amount. It is stored inside the contract on the public blockchain and is only released by direct participants. of the contract.- affordable: no minimum service fee (pay as little as $0.017 per contract), service fee regression with the increase of the contract amount (up to 0.5%), no upfront arbitrage comission (dispute resolution only per request), no bank or wire transfer fees.Specifications & Tech (based on alpha tests)- Smart contracts written in Solidity 0.8.x;- Allow real-time execution of smart contracts on both sides (Contractor and Contractee);- The platform is fully functional in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave desktop browsers;- \"Create\", \"Deploy\", \"Transfer\", \"Complete\", and \"Release\" are consecutive user actions for contract execution.- \"Draft\", \"Deployed\", \"Active\", \"Fulfilled\" and \"Executed\" are the contract states of any contract lifecycle.;- Smart contracts can be deployed to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and Fantom networks;- MetaMask login (with Coinbase and a few other trusted web3 wallet logins in development);- 19.7  seconds is the longest time for contract deployment (vary from network to network);- Total gas fees for all contract transactions and calls is between $0.5 and $1 dollar;- Zenland service fee from $0.01 per escrow contract (vary depending on the contract amount).Milestones & RoadmapQ3 - Q4 2021September - October - idea and concept development.November - December - product design development and approval.Q1 - Q2 2022January - April - product development (desktop version, official website).May - June - alpha testing (individual volunteers and team members).June 22, 2022 - beta release announcement and the start of beta testing.Q3 - Q4 2022July - August - beta-testing of the desktop version and mobile version development.September 2022 (proposed) - Public launch of Zenland escrow contracts;October - November - Feature and accessibility expansion (undisclosed).Q1 - Q2 2023January - March - ZENF token mint, whitepaper v1.0, presale I, II.April - June - Zenland marketplace phase II tests, official release.Q3 - Q4 2023July - September - profile security, fraud report system, whitepaper v.2.0, niche ads.October - December - full EVM compatibility, web3 marketplace, multichannel marketing.Roadmap can be found in more detail here.",

      "body": "Full disclosure: This is a paid review, at Zenland's request, Nevertheless, I will be as fair and objective as possible.I was given some test funds to experiment with the Zenland service and report back my findings here. It was a quite interesting experience - if you are reading this then I'll assume you already know what smart contracts are (they are like real contracts, but on a blockchain, and the actual funds are sent after the contract is made, just like in a real contract).DAY 1:Anyway, when you go to the Zenland website, you will be asked to log in using Metamask wallet. I like that they don't collect user names and passwords, because smart contract platforms are a favorite target for hackers. Metamask will prompt you to sign a message from Zenland using your ETH address each time you log in, but this signing is absolutely free and doesn't expose private keys.You will be greeted with a very simple interface, showing you your wallet address, and a side panel showing you \"Contracts\" and \"Create New Contract\". The Create New Contract pane is open by default. If you have used smart contracts before, filling in the form should be quite easy - buyer address, sender address, an optional description, due date [it is NOT the smart contract expiration date], amount, and buyer protection length (so that the buyer can evaluate the product or service to see if it is the quality as stated in the description).Also, once the smart contract request is created on Zenland, you gain access to a chat feature where you can chat with the owner of the other address that is buying or selling. Additionally, on mobile screens, you are also able to see the \"Settings\", \"Notifications\", and \"Wallet\" tabls which are self-explanatory (except perhaps for \"Wallet\", which I discuss below).Being a Web3 website, Zenland defers the actual transaction handling, smart contract pushing, disputes, agreements, etc to MetaMask - although there is a funds counter at the top right which you should top up, for the purposes of paying the small administrative fee that Zenland charges.For depositing account fees in the \"Wallet\" tab, the coins Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and USDT (since TRON is not supported, I believe it's ERC-20) are supported. These are not used to pay the fees and prices in the smart contract - again, Metamask is responsible for sending and receiving those.For paying the smart contract itself, you are strictly restricted to stablecoins (USDT, BUSD, DAI etc. etc...) I had to learn this the hard way when trying to make a smart contract. See below for my full experience with that.Also, take care that you are on the correct network when making a smart contract. The following blockchains are supported: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalance, Fantom, Polygon, BSC Testnet and Rinkeby Testnet. (to be honest, I have only heard of ETH and Binance smart chain).Zenland suggested to me in a PM that I should try a transaction using testnet funds, but I wanted to see how the experience goes for real funds. So I collected $10 Ethereum from a dust wallet of mine, and placed it in Metamask.For this test I created two Chrome profiles, each of them with their own Metamask wallet. I have conveniently named them \"Pink Seller\" and \"Blue Buyer\".So, I created the smart contract on the ETH blockchain for 5 USDT (or DAI, I have to check again), and all went good. As the docs say, first both parties must agree to the contract, then you have to deploy to the smart contract using Metamask, and then the smart contract is published on the blockchain.Well, at this point I got stuck at the deployment state. Metamask said that in order for me to deploy the contract, I had to pay a huge fee between about $25 and $100. The fee was changing based on network gas rates, I guess. At any rate, attempting to lower the fees to something reasonable (such as $0.5), did manage to get the transaction through - though obviously it would not get deployed very quickly. But after several seconds I got an error message:Quote\"Transaction was not mined within 50 blocks, please make sure your transaction was properly sent. Be aware that it might still be mined!\"It means that Zenland expects the transaction to be mined very quickly, recording the current block in the process for time tracking. Unfortunately, the smart contract could not be mined that fast at the small fees I chose [as of now, the transaction is still pending in Metamask]. I did not want to deplete my small live funds just for mining.At this point, the ETH transaction was off, so I tried to make a smart contract on BSC testnet. But I screwed up while using the Binance faucet, claiming BSC instead of stablecoin tokens, and now I have to wait for 24 hours before I can claim again. So that is the end of the operational report of day 1.And Rinkeby testnet? Well, I went to its testnet faucet, and it apparently wants your social media link with this address somewhere inside it. So I decided against polluting my social media with addresses just to make a demo transaction. That means Rinkeby was off the table.At any point, if you leave the tab inactive, Metamask will log you out of the session, and then you have to log in and sign a message once again. But don't worry, Metamask creates a window with the message and just places a \"Sign\" button under it. So it's not complicated.DAY 2:Finally managed to get testnet funds for BSC DAI onto the Pink Seller wallet. Now I created a second contract, between Blue Seller and Pink Buyer (I always change the names to reflect whose buying and whose selling). Blue Seller sells nothing, for the cost of 5 BSCT DAI from Pink Buyer.The contract from yesterday had already expired (from a business point of view, not a technical one), but there is no status change when acontract expires in Zenland.My first attempt at deploying the contract from Pink Buyer failed, apparently because I was lacking Testnet BSC. So I sent the BSC from Blue Seller to Pink Buyer using Metamask (outside the Zenland app), and I was able to deploy the contract.This time, it was at transferring the actual funds where I got stuck. Every single attempt I made to transfer the 5 DAI failed, Metamask was always failing to send the transaction. I went to the Testnet BSCscan to see what was going on. 10 solved captchas later, I was finally able to see that the reason for the transaction failure was:Quote\"Fail with error 'BEP20: transfer amount exceeds balance'\"Despite my transaction clearly having both enough BSC and enough DAI tokens. [I am not a smart contract expert, but I assume that these are what the error is referring to.]So that that point, I gave up my testing. there was no way so scale this obstacle if I wasn't able to create a transaction.DAY 3:I had planned to test the Dispute and buyer protection features, but the transaction bug above put an early end to my testing.CONCLUSIONS:Zenland is a quite promising smart contract solution if only because I trust it not to exit scam (trust is a rarity in this space), but there are serious problems in deploying the smart contract and sending the funds which must be fixed.When using mainnet funds e.g. Ethereum, even the smart contract is too expensive to push. Testnet BSC was a bit better, I was at least able to deploy the smart contract, but despite my repeated efforts to adjust the gas fee, the transaction failures ground my beta testing to a halt. I hope Zenland fixes these problems soon because it pretty much prevents contracts from being settled.SCREENSHOTS:The main interface on desktop.Creating a new contract.Deploying the smart contract.

In which country will your project operate?Zenland is indeed built around the concept of using smart contracts to secure transactions in a decentralized way. We accommodate different types of transactions, including those related to digital goods, services, NFTs, and other online assets. Our key aim is to ensure an environment that's transparent and trustless for transactions, without the need for central entities. When it comes to delivery of physical goods, our main focus is on the financial side of transactions, so we don't partner directly with any delivery services. Zenland operates globally, as the nature of blockchain technology allows us to serve users from around the world.Quote from: swiftxi on May 02, 2023, 08:07:41 PMI believe they fascilitate online escrow for users that operate online, buying and selling random goods.Still I dont know of any online market, or online buy/sell website that doasent already have a well functioning implemented payment and escrow services.Swiftxi, you're absolutely right. Zenland provides online escrow services for users dealing with various kinds of online transactions. While many online marketplaces already have payment and escrow services in place, Zenland brings the benefits of blockchain technology into the mix, such as transparency, security, and decentralization. We're offering an alternative to the traditional escrow services that exist, giving our users more autonomy and flexibility in their transactions. Zenland is not limited to a specific website marketplace (Flippa 10% fee) or freelance platform (Upwork 20% fee) - we aim to facilitate secure transactions of any kind, with a fee that's substantially lower (1.75% fee) than what you'd find on many platform-specific services.Quote from: swiftxi on May 02, 2023, 08:07:41 PMPhase II of sales is listed to happen @March2023 , and now its May.. No allocation of funds for 300,000$ if raised.Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It seems there might be some confusion around the schedule for our Phase II sales. For clarification, we concluded the presale on the 1st of May. You can verify this by reviewing the contract 0x8425cb559f0a186d26a6a01cd41f4d486a9c32bb on the BSC network, where the allocation is locked.It's possible that the information on certain websites or platforms hasn't been updated accordingly, and we appreciate your patience as we work to ensure all information about Zenland is current across all channels.",
