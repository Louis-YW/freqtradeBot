So along the line agbero snatch my phone from me unknowingly and everything dey inside the phone and I get ATM card with me. I been wan comot without ATM, but I just say make I carry am along. So as the phone lost I just use my ATM card to withdraw and continue with my activities plus my TP, if not how I for do am?

ATM has its own risks ooo, Even the POS wey you shook the card for, come withdraw dey very much risky cos boys dey clone card now, before you know wetin dey happen, them don drain your account. The best way of withdrawal now na to transfer to the POS agent, collect your money go peacefully.In response to your question, you suppose carry one or two of your family members number off heart in case of any emergency. I have that of my elder sister and parents off heart, so in case of emergency, I'll simply borrow the POS person's phone, call them and funds will be sent across to my rescue.
