  "content": "As the new monetary policy of the apex bank in Nigeria CBN get to it take off level, there are a lot of new development that many Nigerians are not yet aware of, and for that I decided to start this discussion thread where we can update and educate ourselves as the policies unfolds. Notably in recent discussion is the rebranding of the Naira notes followed by new transactions limits on individual and cooperate accounts. But our point of discussion is mainly on the newly established new National domestic card,  that will replace other cards such as master cards, visa card and all other credits/debits cards in the country. As it is the roll out of the card will begin from the 16th of January, and a lot of awareness need to be made about this development so at that I decided to bring it up here let us examine and explore it advantages against the other privately own card services around the world and what to look out for in all this development. Quote from: https://techcabal.com/2023/01/26/nigerias-central-bank-launches-afrigo-a-national-domestic-card-scheme/The apex bank's governor, Godwin Emefiele, is optimistic about the card scheme prospects in Africa. Image Source: LegitNigeria’s central bank has today made good on its intentions to launch a national domestic card scheme, AfriGo. The scheme, which was initially announced at a Bankers’ Committee press briefing in October 2022, introduces the central bank into the triopoly of card payment schemes in Nigeria’s card payments market. According to the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, this move will drive financial inclusion and concentrate card financial data in Nigeria, even as it serves as a symbol of national pride for its adopters. “The national domestic card avails us the sovereignty of our data. Secondly, it comes at lower costs, ” he said.With the annual value of card transactions in the Nigeria cards and payments market capped at $18.2 billion in 2021, Nigeria remains a huge market for players in the card payments market, which is largely dominated by global players like Mastercard and Visa, with Verve by Interswitch following behind. These global companies provide central payment networks which they link to debit and credit cards to enable and facilitate cash transactions with the card. The cards can then be issued to customers by banks, financial institutions, or even shopping malls.By breaking the triopoly and establishing a national card payment scheme, the CBN, in partnership with the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), is positioning itself to disrupt and possibly dominate a fast-growing market. The CBN cites reduced operating costs and optimised foreign exchange usage as the hallmarks of its latest fintech foray. “At this time when foreign exchange challenges persist globally, it is important for me to say that we have come up with this card to ensure that all online card transactions will now, effective immediately, begin to go on the nigerian national domestic system,” Emefiele said.“NIBSS and CBN will work together to make sure foreign exchange is charged for only international transactions made on Visa and Mastercards as we have it now. This is so because many of the cards we use currently charge in foreign currency. However, with the launch of the national domestic card, all domestic transactions are to be carried out on the national domestic card scheme,” he added, speaking further on the payment of forex.Notably, this “homegrown” scheme is the first of its kind in Africa, but it’s a route common to some top economies like China, India, Brazil, and Turkey. In India, Rupay, the government-backed card payment scheme, dominates the card market, owing to its efficiency, relatively low cost, and policy backing. To date, more than 600 million Rupay cards have been issued.Mr. Premier Oiwoh, the managing director/CEO of the NIBSS, noted that the scheme was developed to address the specific pain points of Nigeria’s payment industry and provide customised innovative offerings.If this scheme records the successes of Rupay, then Nigerians will be able to pay lesser amounts for debit cards and the likes. But the question of reliability and interoperability can only be truly answered when the cards enter circulation. Speaking on how this move could stifle competition from global players, Emefiele said, “The Nigerian market is vast and the current participants have done so much in the last 12 years to transform the ecosystem. Yet there is much ground to cover as millions of Nigerians are still without cards to consummate transactions.”“I am convinced that the national domestic card scheme will make this a reality in the coming months. We can no longer neglect the vast majority of Nigerians,” he added.AfriGOpay Financial Services Limited (AFSL), a NIBSS-affiliated organisation, is responsible for deploying and overseeing the adoption of the national domestic card scheme.",

Regardless domestic card goes well. Do understand say the CBN dey find every opportunity to make careless policy achievable and this na one of those positive more towards achieving that. Maybe dem fit introduced credit cards instead of just debits, who knows. As for the new note wahala, no worry na small small we go dey use to am, also do note that the CBN are trying to make the Naira scarce so make we not expect to see am plenty for street, na cashless Nigeria we dey enter so.",

But one important question I will love to ask is, can this card be used outside Nigeria? Or is it only in Nigeria, because looking at statement made in the article that this new card is meant to rival with big industry players such as Mastercard and Visa that has been in the business for year's and used in more than over 100 countries around the globe. Can this new card work efficiently on international online stores (i.e Amazon)",

E better we use indigenous own make the money dey remain for Nigeria.@CryptopreneurBrainboss you made a good point and you hit the point I was waiting to read from members here in the local board, the domestication of payment system will allow for inclusiveness of the financial sector, as we know the problem with our current financial systems is over dependence on international firm this over dependence have leaf to a lot of weaknesses that hackers are now taking advantage of to access Nigerians account from any where in the word, e.g MasterCard scam that is popular among yahoo boiz in Nigeria. The new central bank monetary policy will change a lot of things in our financial sector let Nigerians not focus only on a few segment of the policy but to try to read through the entire white paper of the new monetary policy and like I side before, this policy is not a new policy but is something that have began since 2012 but the current CBN governor is serious at implementing it which to me is a good idea, that need every possible support from Nigerains if truly we want to have a good economy that will meet up with the current International standard.  I perceive a good price control in Nigeria micro economy pretty soon and what make this policy make more sense is the fact that, the policy is being implemented now that the election is around the corner so the next phase for Nigeria after the general election will be that of financial stability and economic viability.

Agbe, I been want make this thread self moderated so that I can delete off topic replies to avoid non substantial comments that doesn't add anything to the discussion, comments that are basically full with blame game of previous financial policy somersaults. What I want to see on this thread is printable information as related to the new CBN domestic card and all other information and enlightenment on the various aspects of the new CBN monetary policy implementation and how to build our knowledge around them. Baba I don tire to dey read all the bad things about our 9ja for here, so now make we dey discuss and analyze with provable datass and not just speculations. God bless🇳🇬 Nigeria",

This policy will give room for financial inclusion of the unbanked. -I updated the first page with new and recent development on the domestic cards, do have a look through.                        Surest regards!",
