Generally, Dubai real estate market is too rapid to provide any specific locations. Potential buyers refer to us and specify the type and details of real estate they want to buy. And then we refer to our databases and our partners to provide with properties. In other words, we add properties this morning and by todays evening majority might be sold out. Regarding cryptocurrencies in UAE, hundreds of people pay for properties and they might not even be aware of legal difficulties cause it is a job of an Agent to make customers life as easy as possible.If you live in Dubai you are probably aware. This is a very interesting and rapid business, as previously stated.",
