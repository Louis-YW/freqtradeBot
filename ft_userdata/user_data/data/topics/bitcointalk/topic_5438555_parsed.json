The Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot is a community-driven program. It’s designed to spread the benefits of economic immigration to smaller communities by creating a path to permanent residence for skilled foreign workers who want to work and live in one of the pilot’s participating North Okanagan and Shuswap communities.This region was recognized as an area that could benefit from this pilot. Community Futures has entered into a partnership with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to offer this pilot in the North Okanagan and Shuswap areas.The community will use this pilot to strengthen our local economy and support the development of our workforce.  The 11 communities across the country participating in a pilot are each adapting the program to their needs and economic development goals.For more information on the benefits of immigration, please go to Immigration Matters.To learn more about this program, please click on the two buttons below:",
