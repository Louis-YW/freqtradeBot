A thread creation will just result into more spamming and possibly this member you called out might missed this topic. Since you’re finding it hard to use this search engine of the forum I would suggest you read through this thread to effectively use the search engine properly.QuoteSome of the informations some people passed to other people is not authentic and they misleads people, because if i should have in mind that before i achieve anything I most make a mistake, another newbies might come up with same idea that making a mistake in anything you are doing is real factor or a manner to get what you want.

I would have brought the place i saw the content but I can't fish it out. Learning is a continuous process The idea of having to make a mistake before been a pro doesn’t apply all the time. But it is just something that has been used to encourage people so that when they fall they they shouldn’t stay down. Although that member might be quoted out of context by you but what he means is experience is actually the best fit of knowledge and who has made a mistake before will certainly not commit same again because he might have to use a different strategy.",

I agree that it's not a must to make a mistake to learn something, or while learning something. They say experience is the best teacher, true, but experience is not the only teacher. I will have to disagree with you on the quoted part.So you're saying if I want to achieve something and I work consistently and diligently to achieve that thing I won't get it because it's not the will of the \"almighty\"? C'mon! That sound like a whole load of bullshit. Saying that already contradicts the part where you said \"What we need is concentration and a proper information to achieve what we want.\"You've got to take your life into your own hands. You can achieve whatever you set out to achieve. That you failed in a certain area doesn't mean it's not God's will for you to achieve it, it means something went wrong, or you didn't do something right. In fact, it's not even God's will for you to fail. God doesn't have a laid-out plan for anybody. You've got to forge your own way. God didn't make some people poor and some people rich. A lot of people stay poor because they are waiting for God's will in their life or God's time. Well brother, you gon keep waiting because God is not coming specifically to help you. You've got to do that for yourself. And there's nothing like God's time, whenever you want something, that is God's time.",

Mistake is uninvitable therefore is abide to happen at anytime. If there is no mistake there will be no correction.

      "body": "There was this story of a rich man and his two sons, where the man asked one of his sons how he could manage his wealth, and the son was so unknowable in his answers, but the Dad asked the second son the same question about how he could manage his wealth, and he replied and said, \"I will learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others to make better management and archive more success.\" That man was astonished by the answer he got from his son. So, what I am saying in essence is that you don't necessarily need to make a mistake before you can learn something, because you will still get the insight of people who have tried the same thing that you want to do but made several mistakes. If you learn from the experience of others, you will likely not make the same mistake. But there is this saying that \"nobody is above mistakes.\" If you can't learn without making mistakes, then your experience will teach you.",

I believe every writer and motivator speaks based on their own personal experience, and they believe it will also work for others in the same way it works for them.There are a lot of us who learn from others mistakes; there are also people who learn from their own mistakes. While we have those who don't want to see mistakes either from themselves or others, they just like doing their own research and avoiding mistakes from occurring from whatever they get themselves involved in, but no matter how hard we try, there are errors that are inevitable. We might think the track we are taking is the right thing to do until we do it that way and realize there was an error by someone else.To me, I don't blame or judge anyone for whatever part they take that gives them a positive return at the end. If learning from the mistakes of others is what works for them, fine; if it's from their own mistakes, good too. What matters most is that after the mistake, the ability to not allow it to happen again is what I actually regard as learning.",

Remember this when Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, famously said, \"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\"  That statement reflects the mindset of many successful people who view mistakes as stepping stones to success, they understand that setbacks and failures are inevitable on the path to achieving their objectives the same on trading.  Because in trading isn't all about earning, sometimes mistakes make us learn to avoid them in the future. IMO, mistakes are often considered a part of the process of achieving success and mistakes provide opportunities for learning, growth, and improvement.  They can help you identify what doesn't work in trading (technically or fundamental analysis) that needs to be adjusted in order to reach your goals, it can also provide valuable insights and new perspectives that contribute to innovation and creativity.",

The purpose of learning is to avoid mistakes, not to make mistakes and then learn, that's a wrong perception in my opinion. It's normal for Newbies to make small mistakes during the learning process, seniors will direct you to the right path to prevent the same mistakes from happening. Mistakes made by other users need to be used as a lesson for yourself, character building does not only start from desire, reading from other people's writings can also make you a better user.",
