The new Comer's who doesn't know their way into the industry may likely fall prey, whatever that concerns investment is what we should be taking adequate care of because the risk factors is what you may not thoroughly figure out, there are people who had lost their investment due to a higher speculation whereby force hope were given to them on the performance of those currencies but never played smart or to outsmart the information by making use of the right time to have sold out. Yet we know the industry are luck based place were lot of opportunities are there for people but we hardly forgotten that those luck and chances were also an error and fault of others failure. To make my statement clear about this is that, you get chances by enriching yourself with others failures. That's to say when others fails to utilize the opportunity those who utilizes it at the right time are always making fortune from those who came investing late because those who invested earlier may decide to take profit leaving empty project for newly investors. At this point you see people lamenting on their various media for their lost because they aren't careful knowing too well that market is highly speculative.",

      "body": "Sure, forecasting future prices of cryptos like Chainlink is no picnic. But this doesnt erase the indomitable strength of blockchain and the radical potential of cryptocurrencies. Despite their volatility and complexity, they're profoundly inventive. In this realm of ambiguity, tech-centric cryptos like Chainlink display exceptional fortitude and growth potential. Its oracle network is redefining smart contracts with secure, real-time data feeds. While respecting analysts' insights, I contend that mainstream finance often undervalues crypto tech. We recall similar scepticism towards Bitcoin, and its current status is a rebuttal. Use it wisely, and the volatile of crypto will not seem so daunting",

      "body": "history shows that only a few stars of the previous bull run shine during the next one. out of the hundreds of popular altcoins in 2017, only a few gave better returns than bitcoin in 2020-2022. The rest are slowly dying (NEO, NEM, EOS, LISK, DASH, ZIL) taking lower and lower places in the top 100 CMC. In my opinion, the same awaits chainlink, because it failed to build a user base, adequate traffic or a convincing vision of further development that would justify a valuation of $ 3 billion. There's also the fear of the SEC that would limit potential profits.All in all, I wouldn't invest a cent in a link. Even if a short-term recovery is possible, in the long-term bitcoin will give better returns while being a safer investment (better risk/reward ratio).",

Have they taken good steps in development over the past years, and how is the expectation of future demand compared to similar currency pairs and in what number of platforms has it been included, as the currency is of continuous development, which has been included in many platforms and has programming It gains scalability with all variables. It is a suitable currency for investment. It remains for you to determine when to buy to achieve an appropriate profit.I also have to remember that you should not be greedy when you buy altcoins.",

I think unless there is more development it will just keep creeping down.Alts are not like stocks. There are some stocks which can be dogs but if the company exists and makes money then itâ€™ll have a certain value.

We can do competitor analysis for the chainlink.Rule 2: You have to check if it is a token or coin. That is why it's called predicting because we are not sure about our calls but this is not wrong. There are no laws that restrict predicting an asset. In fact it was encouraged, as this makes the game exciting. Comparing is also allowed. I'm not only familiar to Chainlink so I don't know if which cryptos are great to compare with it. Checking if it's a coin or token are I think not really that important.Coins seem bigger than tokens but There are coins who don't perform well while there are tokens who are doing better than them. If that is the case, I'll better go with that token. So, I did a quick search and found out that Chainlink is a token but I find it hard to rate its performance. Maybe I'll be neutral with this one.",

When there is no hype around a coin, that means community has given up on it. I remember a period when people flooded twitter and reddit with Link, they all talked about it like it was the newest bitcoin defeater and all that, but we have seen that it wasn't that and people just gave up because of it.I understand the logic, and I can see why it could be a bit different, but that doesn't mean that we are going to end up any different on the long run neither, we are going to end up with a good return one way or another.
