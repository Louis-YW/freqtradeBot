      "body": "It's fairly simple really: you click on \"Buy\" button on ATM, choose the amount you wanna buy (in fiat) and then BATM asks you to show QR code of your mobile wallet (BATM scans it) to they know eher to send bitcoin. After that is done, you insert the bills and that's about it. Once you come home you move bitcoin somewhere safer, preferably to a hardware wallet.Quote from: Nwada001 on March 21, 2023, 01:13:11 PMI would never advise you to make use of a Bitcoin ATM to purchase bitcoin. The charges are extremely high, however. Why not make use of other means of purchase like ? Hodlhodl  if what you are after is protecting your privacy.While its true that BATM fees are generally higher than the other means, you don't know OP's situation so maybe for him that's the most convenient option. Or maybe he just wants to know how those machines operate.",

It is very simple to use.Quote from: Nwada001 on March 21, 2023, 01:13:11 PMWhy not make use of other means of purchase like ? Hodlhodl  if what you are after is protecting your privacy.It depends on the ATM operator and regulatory rules to follow where the bitcoin ATM is located. Also nearly all ATMS will require phone number verification, if not all. Crypto ATMs privacy is becoming more impossible because of AML and CTF policies. The most common of the two bitcoin ATMs in my country Nigeria according to Coinatmradar required phone number verification for transactions below $100 while ID document verification for transactions above $100. Just like you have posted already, for privacy, it is good to use a decentralized exchange like Bisq.",

So this implies that purchasing bitcoin via atm is very expensive. Its better to use p2p then. Its been safe so far. Most centralised exchanges support p2p for every country and even buying with credit cards.",

Most centralised exchanges support p2p for every country and even buying with credit cards. Centralized exchanges can also be relatively expensive to use, considering that most of them use a fixed fee to avoid having tanssctions stuck in the mempool due to feerate changes after the transaction was made, or to make some profits from the fees in addition to charges.OP might be on the lookout for a privacy option, in which case P2P on centralized exchanges would not cut it.",
