  "content": "I have a colleague that's into cryptocurrency trading before I got to know about it, much of what I know about crypto I owe to him as he devote almost 70% of each day in cryptocurrency as it is a major source of income for him. Always online be it midnight or daytime you hardly see him offline. which makes me wonder at times does this guy ever sleep at night! Now him being online busy with his cryto business, this replicate into his social media accounts such as Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook that he's online as far as his data is on. Unknowingly to his friends, other colleagues and even relatives they go on dropping messages upon messages for him without getting back any response from him even at different interval, cause his focus all through the period online is in cryto with the aim of trying to make a living out but these other persons not having a clue feels he is deliberately ignoring their messages. Although he seldom reply to a very limited few important ones, to the extent I know though.Now, we all know that feeling when you keep on dropping messages severally to a person whose status indicates online but no response. Very awful right!This days people chase online money so much that they forget the place of giving or spending time with friends and family. And that's a very bad habit. Yes it's good to chase money but keeping a thin line by creating time for friends and family and business should be a thing of concern to everyone.Else you might wake up one day only to discover you  have lost the company of all goods persons around you. Cause in this life people matters!",

You're not going to like this but this is reality, becoming poor will also make you lose a lot of company, and forget motivational quotes or sob stories about how human beings care for each other, the reality is that once you're poor nearly everyone will toss you aside.So you can have your choice work and try to achieve something or tweet all day lying to yourself about what real life is.",

Although he seldom reply to a very limited few important ones, to the extent I know though.You know, social media messages have a way of drawing one's attention away from the task one was originally doing. And it occurs more often than not. In your colleague's case, he is trying not to get distracted. Getting distracted affects performance.  Ignoring these messages is one of the strategies your colleague is using to handle social media distractions. Your colleague has a goal and does not want to get distracted by unwanted social media messages that may not be crypto-related. Trust me, he replies to messages of those in his crypto WhatsApp, Facebook, or Discord group. You could try giving him a phone call if you have an urgent message for him that requires his attention. In my opinion, spending quality time with friends and family offline is way better than spending the whole day replying to social media messages that eat into your profitable time.",

Its hard not to have friends, but maybe he really just wanted to focus on whats he is doing now.

Your friend is a scalper or hourly trader.I say this because that's common with traders. I had such moments always facing screens in the past but it's not so any more. I multitask while online and always find time to unwind with friends. There's reality outside there. Online life isn't real. Yes, I know making money is real life situation whether online or offline. However, it's good to make out quality time for friends and family. Without them, how else do we spend the money we make? Your friend should find a reason to respond to his messages, except they're spamming or bugging him unnecessarily for help and he's intentionally avoiding them. People do that a whole lot of time when they think or assume that you've more to give and that's a wrong mindset. Otherwise, I don't see how much time it takes to respond to one's messages. It takes little or no time at all.",

And that's a very bad habit.People spend far too much time on online platforms whether they're chasing money, play games or just spend time they find \"quality time\", The world has change. Spamming them never helps. Why don't you pay him a visit? Are you also staying too much online to get out a little, even risking you get there and you don't get in (like in the old times)?All in all, you have some good advice, but you're also doing it wrong, not only your friend/colleague.",

Unknowingly to his friends, other colleagues and even relatives they go on dropping messages upon messages for him without getting back any response from him even at different interval,whether this is a parameter for anything? are social networks so important for the quality of life?First big question is, are they really real friends? I saw some social media accounts from acquaintances who died where various friends continue to wish them happy birthdays and send wishes for happiness and good health.   they do it persistently even though they don't get any answer. I also know a lot of people who are so active in real life and that is why they have neglected social networks. do they also need to stop all that and dedicate themselves to Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook or whatever?note. crypto or trading has nothing to do with this issue.",
