I genuinely appreciate your input, and I apologize if my request came across as inappropriate for this community.I want to assure you that I am actively seeking ways to improve my financial situation, and I am not solely relying on the generosity of others. Your suggestion to explore the bounty and services sections is valuable, and I will certainly consider these opportunities as I continue my efforts to overcome these challenges.Again, thank you for taking the time to offer guidance and for your well-wishes. I am grateful for your support, and I hope to contribute positively to this community as I learn and grow in the world of cryptocurrency.Best regards,Avokiwi",
