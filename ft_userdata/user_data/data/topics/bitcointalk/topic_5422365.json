  "content": "We have entered the second year of a Bear Market. The market moment we're in has found its support at the peak of 2017's Bull market. There are those who think that it can still go lower, but the majority agree we have reached a bottom as the selling pressure is losing momentum. Theoretically, if Bitcoin is able to hold the support at the peak of 2017's bull run, we may see a reverse in the bearish momentum and the start of a new accumulation phase. I say this phase has already begun. So, what do you guys have to say?",

But to tell if the bear market is over, I do not know, but it is getting closer to bull time.Totally agree. And I even add that the altcoin meltdown money is fleeing into Bitcoin as we speak. The capitulation of many altcoins is nothing new, it has happened several times before. In fact, I believe that this happens because smart investors are on top of investing in the early stages of tokens\\ altcoins launch and end up dumping their stash as soon as the coin hits an exchange. In the process, shitcoins get wrecked and the average joe believing in it gets smashed. The money gathered from the blow is then channelled in for the next blow while they channel part of it back to Bitcoin.",

At least it will break the panic situations for the people around us and we can get back to the normal life. Lolz. For me bitcoin price do not matter as long as we can have it circulated for its current value. Moreover, I am happy with the bearish market as we can keep buying more and more for time being. Anyways, halving is also coming next year and we can’t deny the fact that it’s gonna have severe affect as well.",

We're not that worried much because we're looking at the great turn around of the market for which the possible lowest at these times was the ATH on 2017.I'd say that if this is going to continue for at least a year or two, we will definitely see a different bull run again by the time it comes again.

The market bear trend seems slowly becoming week, but due to the panic of negative news, bear tends to stay for a while. After the panic and fud, I believe the market will start to get its momentum going up, so preparing right now is really good.",

There are those who think that it can still go lower, but the majority agree we have reached a bottom as the selling pressure is losing momentum. It is the second year of the bear market alright but, its hard to agree the market has reached its low just yet. Not so long ago, we established the low to have been reached at $17k and watched the market gradually rally up to $19k and $21k. The market continued to circle around there for a while, giving investors hope that, it might continue and then go up and in the event of a fall, the market would meet resistance at $17k but, it broke that and went lower.It could still repeat and until a bull market begins to materialise, you never can say.Mean while, you accumulate when you can and not make a season about it. What is most important is, trying not to sell unnecessarily.",

If I wanted to be generous I'd say the bottom was $20k (bu I believe it is higher) so the current price is an unnatural level exactly like a couple of years ago when price entered $3k range and that too was extremely undervalued.As for accumulation phase, right now it could happen at a discount. People who have fiat to dump, are enjoying this time since they can now buy more bitcoin with the same amount of money.The reversal however is going to start only when the Western economical crash starts slowing down and the recession stops growing. Until then, each time another industry shuts down or fires its employees we will see its effects (even small ones) in bitcoin price.",
