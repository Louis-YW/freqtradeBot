I'd say 4 GB RAM is quite low for such a system.QuoteDescription of Problem: I am using Biotcoind -Bitcoin Core IDB seems to and gets stuck at Block Height-372235 then constantly shows peers stalling.I have rebooted and changed db_cache-1024.I found some testnet references related to stalling on big blocks, but block 372235 isn't big. The testnet solution suggested to increase BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT, and even though that wasn't the solution, it sounds reasonable. Especially if your system is low on RAM I can imagine it's just slow.",

Maybe use SFTP and download a large file from the container. If the connection breaks off for some reason, you can be sure that's the problem.",
