I'm a fool for making such a big request from people who don't know me, my friend, I hope everyone here will one day be rich enough to stop judging others, most of you don't even have half of my bitcoin because you don't have the mentality, but friends who They answered me respectfully, I apologize, it's true that everyone has problems, but I'm drowning and trying to breathe, I'm not a beggar, I work hard, but you're right, this is not a charity.It doesn't matter if I am active in the forum or not, but one day I will come back with a new topic about humanity, then I will help the real needy people as much as I can. Nothing and no one is higher than God",

      "body": "Like most people pointed out in your previous thread, it’s very strange for a newbie account to just come to the forum and fees minutes later create such type of thread. It’s wasn’t a matter of how much they have or how many bitcoin they owe it was a matter of past experience a lot of users have been here for a long time and they have seen users come and go with this exact type of thread, some might even sound more convincing than the one you created and because of that the moment they saw your thread the referred to it as bs, I’m not sure if I responded to your previous thread but if I were to reply my comment would have revealed that I didn’t believe a single thing you wrote there since I’ve seen similar posts before.

Nothing and no one is higher than GodYou really don’t have to come to the forum and prove to anyone her or do anything to protect yourself, if God bless you and you become financially stable you can do your charity work off the forum, you don’t have to do it here in the forum I’m sure there are a lot of people that lives in your community that would need it more than forum members.",

I wanted to share my heart with other people beyond the borders of countries. Maybe I expressed my meaning wrongly. Dear friend, 10 people send messages every day. Congratulations, you have won 5 ethereum or something like this. You have to deposit $20 to receive a gift. Totally scam messages. But I just wanted to talk to you, thank you for making me sorry",

You must have a thick skin when you interact on the forums, otherwise it is better to focus on real life.What skills can you do? Teaching me fishing is better than giving you a fish. Developing your skills and asking others to help you find a job may give your life a push forward. If you develop your posts, you may join signature campaigns one day.",

Nothing and no one is higher than God       -   In the first place, you don't really have anything to prove to the community here on the forum. I hope you can help a lot of other people in the future. Now, regarding the Bitcoin that we are talking about here, people's lives can really be changed with Bitcoin, but it depends on the dedication of a person entering this type of business industry.Because if you don't have the passion to learn and believe in Bitcoin, it won't change your life or that of anyone who tries it for real.",
