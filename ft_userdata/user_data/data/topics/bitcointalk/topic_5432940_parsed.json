But I don't know what this CEO or those entity behind the projects chooses to gamble the investors money in hope to double it or at least pay them. There were reports that SBF did gamble too the money of his investors and look at what happen to his FTX.Yes, we should be very very careful on investing on some project right now because they are turning into a outright scam.",

With Investors money, it fueled his addiction more and gave him more means to gamble, a reason why core gamblers cannot be trusted with holding money for any purpose. In the wake of Sam's case, maybe he has thought it wise to come clean to the public on his own terms, that is he is reporting himself before someone who knows about it exposes him and it becomes more serious.

Damn, if this news is public and we already know who is he then a lawsuit can be lodged against him. Its fact which he himself agreed. There is no next crypto project or plans for this guy because simply he is done for his profile. Anyone hiring this guy will have their own projects failed in the first place due to trust issues. You know that you are touching the investors funds for foul play which is itself a crime and the serious one. No one can defend that statement, I just hope peeps who were involved in the project will take proper lawful advice to get the money back.",

And apparently way before this reveal there was someone in discord calling founder out and asking hard questions and he only got banned for FUDOne thing most communities does wrong is not being able to seperate critique from fud. I've been kicked out from many failed projects just by pointing flaws in their tokenomic game theory or just pointing out math errors, if they don't know that their marketing tactics are illegal or other red flags. I've been screwed over so many times that at least i want basics to be watertight before investing.",

Lesson here is not to trust every other new altcoin. Only invest in solid projects. Well first of all i have to say that i have never heard of Clucoin before and after checking your coinmarketcap link it seems it always was a pretty small project that never really had a big trading volume. Of course this does not automatically mean that it also was a bad project because nowadays there are appearing so many new crypto projects that it is very easy to miss a new one that is actually good and promising.That the founder of this project used investor funds in order to win back his gambling losses is a really bad move from him. I would guess that he already lost everything that he owned personally and then there was only his investor funds left and then he used that. This just proves again that a gambling addiction can easily destroy your whole life and in this case maybe even the life of others.",

Lesson here is not to trust every other new altcoin. Only invest in solid projects. So, it was a coin? I thought it was some kind of an exchange because its name sounds like kucoin (a well known crypto exchange ) I didn't check the link yet so idk but maybe one of their plans later on is also to build an exchange however its great that they have been busted out too early. If not then a lot of people are going to invest on them and this could be the next big thing after the FTX because there are stories that the founder of FTX do also got involved in gambling.This could be one of the reason on why they use the money of their customer and losses it all. They aren't an old project either so let's not only judge the new coins here shall we.",

It would not surprise me that in order to keep their development working the founder creates yet another project with ridiculous promises of giving a huge ROI per year, but since now everyone knows what kind of person he is I doubt he will get any money out of such project.",

They run IDO on the decentralized Launchpad and add it with Auto Liquidity. So, two to three days after the launch, investors gamble and then die. Nobody traded later. So be cautious when deciding to invest in a brand new project. It's as if you're gambling with your money.",

It has been the norm for quite a long time now, new altcoin projects are more often than not up to no good, these days people just create one altcoin or the other to enrich themselves and nothing else. These project owners/founders are mostly scammers/impersonators who basically promise investors a lot, but none of such promises ever come to fruition, they just gather investors money, put it into their own pockets and disappear, it is a clear pattern that people should be conversant with now.Having said that, this is definitely not going to be last scenario or occurrence on this, scammers are still going to create new projects and investors would definitely fall victim to it and lose their funds, rinse and repeat, i think no matter the losses people incure on altcoin projects, new ones would allure victims.",
