If you haven't done it yet: backup your wallet.dat (on a USB-stick). Then make another backup, just to be sure.I'm not sure what the current best option for a wallet rescan is.For what it's worth: hiding a part of the txid doesn't make it hard to find.",

What is the exact error message you get when you try to broadcast the transaction, does it say: \"Status: 0/unconfirmed, not in memory pool\"?Tell us if bitcoin core will show the same balance after you restart it with the _rescan option (it may take some time to finish rescanning). A faster alternative would be to export your funded addresees' private keys and import them into an SPV wallet such as Electrum.",
