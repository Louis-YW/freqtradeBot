  "content": "Source: https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/solana-dapps-blocked-in-the-uk/Due to the FCA regulations, both of these Solana Dapps Marinade Finance and Orca Finance are no longer accessible to the UK residents because of compliance concerns. It seems that the UK is strengthening their crypto regulations and that involves these Dapps running on the Solana blockchain. Because of this, we could see most likely other Dapps under Solana blockchain may follow suit due to their need to oblige in the compliance. But I am not sure if they could bypass restrictions by using VPNs to continue accessing these Dapps being mentioned. To the UK users here in this forum using either of these Dapps mentioned, what are your thoughts and insights of this decision by Marinade and Orca? Thank you in advance.",

There's that point of centralization which doesn't really make these DEFI protocols decentralized.Quote from: cheezcarls on October 26, 2023, 10:29:14 PM[...]But I am not sure if they could bypass restrictions by using VPNs to continue accessing these Dapps being mentioned. I bet users can do that and the devs would not mind. They would be fine as long as they do not encourage using VPN openly.",

      "body": "The way of how the platform enforces block is to block UK IPs on the front-end level. The platform's system itself won't be able to block or filter based on an IP addresses. Given that, how would a censored user be able to access the platform? They will be able to access the platform if they use, of course, non-UK IP or directly use the SDK to interact with the platform.
