I believe him fit even pm their manager self for that comment.The bottom line be say settle down read post, comprehend wetin the body of the message dey take before you rush go comment on something I think I been talk something like this before but them reply say e no mean, say no be everybody get time to read the whole op before commenting. Before me been dey do am but when I noticed say I no dey too flow with the whole things I begin reduce the way I do things here then I come bring mind to dey read post before commenting.",

When they say effortless post,  what that simply means is that you did not put in any extra work to give the discussion your own views and rather you just ride on repetition of what others already said. I believe is easy to become a quality poster and the only way to do that is to read more than you write, sometimes separate the time for reading from the time for writing let say if you spend 10 hours in the forum and other online things,  you should allocate 6 hours into reading and let say the remaining 4 hours could go into writing,  that way you already have a mental integration with the various topics that are being discussed here in the forum.",

Well this has been argued here sometimes ago where they are saying of one must not read everything to give their own judgement..Sincerely speaking this is what changes me because if I don't read I wouldn't know how to be creative in terms of creating my own topic and comments. Actually I wouldn't like to capitalized on this mistake rather everyone should learn their lesson from here to avoid some limitation from get accepted in most of the campaign or even sees us non quality posters.",

Actually I wouldn't like to capitalized on this mistake rather everyone should learn their lesson from here to avoid some limitation from get accepted in most of the campaign or even sees us non quality posters.I believe we still have a few newbies or even other rank members who will find the comments and read them some days,  sincerely speaking there is no way you can be on topics without reading other members' contributions and sometimes what makes you a quality poster is your ability to bring something new to the discussions and the only way to bring a new content is to first of all know the old ones so you must read others comment,  it will help you mental alertness while constructing your own comments,  we should know better how and when to apply this when surfing through the forum. On the issue of campaign acceptance due to low-quality posts,  well I must say that our countrymen are doing well in the forum but few have assumed everything due to the number of merits being criteria for quality posting even though merits are significant factors being considered by managers but on the long run I don't think that will be sustainable and at that point, managers will have to rely more on the quality of posts,  and glad a lot of managers are changing this day with some even rating us every week which have helped us to improve a lot. But more still need to be done to improve the quality in here and the best possible and easy way is to engage more in reading while also writing because it becomes easy to write when you have something interesting to write about.",

No be government work wey be say you don start and nothing fit commot you from the work only death. If the OP drop link on the topic, do well to read the link, and if other forum members wey comment drop link also go through the link, this go help you know or get many things to talk for your own comment.

The painful one be that so make we try we best to read, I for don lock this topic I say make i leave make those people wey say read the whole body of content no good so make them read see wetin them dey encourage people.",
