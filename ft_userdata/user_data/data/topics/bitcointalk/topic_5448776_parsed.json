When you first registered, you did a lot of stupid things, starting from ridiculous questions and spamming, which caused many posts to be deleted by Mod.Now that you are an adult with the highest rating on the forum, there are still many positive things you can do to guide Juniors with constructive education. Five years later.!! Who can guess, I hope you stay consistent here with higher quality posts. The next challenge is for you for 5 years and then you can enter the 10k merit club.",

Anyway, that dedicated thread was created not that long ago under the guise of reducing spam and/or reducing announcements that we remade in the hope of receiving merits but personally I would not bother posting in it if I wanted to announce anything and many others have continued to ignore it by posting their announcements in their own newly created threads. The situation changes of-course if the forum admins create a dedicated thread for members to make their personal announcements.If they did then it is fine we all should post our milestones and rank-up and other announcements in that admin created dedicated thread but since that did not happen there is definitely no obligation for members to post in any thread that any member creates and states it is for this reason or it is for that reason.
