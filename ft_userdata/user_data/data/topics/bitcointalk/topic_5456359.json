I see nothing wrong in giving kids intro to cryptocurrency. Would be a shame if an individual who is a fan of bitcoin and has invested in it, doesn't have kids who have the slightest idea of cryptocurrency. Anyone who is ashamed to have their kids know at least the basics of what it is must be using cryptocurrency for fraud or something illegal. QuoteJust as my topic reads, we should stop stressing  kids with wanting them do things we didn't meet up doing and at some points getting them mentally stressed.I do not know how you define stress in the situation but I feel that kids from 10 years of age should learn about cryptocurrency. It is digital money and even more. The do not need to start reading charts or those complicated stuff they just need to know. QuoteI will suggest that, rather than bore them with the history of bitcoin,  why not get a portfolio for them and keep investing in it and watch it grow with them and when they're of age, then you can practically  show them the needful.This is basically the summary of my response. You hit the nail on the head with this last paragraph.",

What does having money has to do with owning bitcoin? You don't need money to get it and this forum is a perfect example to support this claim. What age children are we talking about? I have a little girl that cares about going for a walk in the woods, playing with her dolls, chasing our cats around the house and things of this sort. I'm not going to teach her about bitcoin yet. When she's 10, I'll be trying to get her to know bitcoin, that's for sure. I don't think she'll be stressed by that any more than playing chess or reading a book would stress her. Bottom line, if your kid is smart enough to learn how to use a phone and use the Internet, he or she isn't going to be stressed by bitcoin.",

      "body": "Some say the earlier the better, but I say that age should decide. There is nothing bad in giving children Bitcoin education, but I believe that giving children Bitcoin education at a very tender age, like 10 years old (below), is not wise because there is really enough time for the child to learn about Bitcoin, so why the rush? I think 11 years is partially good, but there are some kids at that age whose level of understanding is still very poor to introduce something like Bitcoin to them. 13 years and above is much better, which some children will not even find very funny.I once took this initiative to teach my nephew, Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on November 19, 2022, 12:37:46 PM I would feel sorry for your nephew. Give him a ball and let him go play football with his friends. Knowledge about bitcoin does not take much time; you can explain everything to him when he gets older.but after I created the thread and gone through my first comment, yea, it really did make sense to me that indeed, Bitcoin knowledge doesn't take like a year to learn, so why burden the child with Bitcoin knowledge at a very tender age, while they can learn it when they are older, and it wouldn't even take that much time to grasp the idea.",

      "body": "To me, there is nothing wrong with teaching a child about Bitcoin, provided that the child is old enough to read and is not seen as forcing them to learn about the currency. I see that as giving those children an opportunity we never have the chance to grab. Teaching them the basics of Bitcoin at an early age is enough to direct their knowledge into the currency; if they pick up an interest in it, then better for them, they will start early by learning more about it. Learning about Bitcoin is not just all about giving them money and showing them how to invest in Bitcoin.Quote from: Obari on June 14, 2023, 07:08:40 PMIf we don't have the money to buy, then we'll  certainly  miss out, and judging from this, I don't think it's wise teaching them or wanting to force it on them when we know that they can't afford it.Bitcoin is far more than that; they can also be a great help to Bitcoin development if they grow up to be more of the technical part. They can build and develop things that can support the network. They can set up their own mining firm, etc. I see that giving early knowledge of Bitcoin to children who are off-age as a really great idea. I don't mean the children who are still supposed to be playing video games and watching cartoons on TV.",

There's a particular in life on which they would be asking out about on whats money? for sure they would really be that get curious and what it is and on this time then i would say that it would be the sweetest spot on teaching them about fiat and at the same timeyou would really be making out some introductions when it comes to cryptospace or Bitcoin itself.As a parent then you wouldnt really be that so dumb on being that forceful because we know that doing so would really be rather giving out that other effectthan on what you had assumed.",

There's no need to make it a sacred subject for children, or something too serious.If BTC is part of their normal, basic, lambda environment, adoption will be there in the future. You don't stress children about credit or debit cards, do you? Why do it any differently with BTC? If it's just normal for them, there's no need to stress it. There's no need to lecture about it for hours. Information by information, little by little, day by day, without forcing it, and they'll remember BTC when they're adults. That's all that matters.",

If you have a child or children you will understand that they are your treasure. If you have a successful child, you will become a fulfilled father or mother. I cherish everything that will make me raise my child the proper way and make them sound both in character and learning.

Introducing Bitcoin to children is not a bad idea but we must take note of the following:Age: introducing a seven to thirteen years old to Bitcoin as a currency or investment might make little or no impact. But some children are gifted or special. Some of them can understand many things about Bitcoin, those can be introduced. But children should be allowed to enjoy their plays, toys, and friends and shouldn't be burdened with strange concepts. After all some school subject covers money and investment and academics is even enough burden for kids. Interest:  Bitcoin attracts only the interested. You don't force people to learn or adopt Bitcoin because it is not everybody that will join the Bitcoin space. You should only introduce them to Bitcoin and allow them to make thier decisions. Some children will pick interest in Bitcoin while others might be interested in other fields or business. QuoteI will suggest that, rather than bore them with the history of bitcoin,  why not get a portfolio for them and keep investing in it and watch it grow with them and when they're of age, then you can practically  show them the needful.I want to know if there are people who also share same opinion with me and please lets just discuss rather than argue This is not a bad idea mate.
