  "content": "Introduction: Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, brought a revolutionary concept to the world of finance - anonymous, secure, and irreversible transactions through a blockchain confirmation mechanism. However, many potential aspects of this contraption remain unseen by the public, and its initial idea of unknown transactions got deviated by enterprises and governments. The brilliant minds of the industry, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood, were inspired by Satoshi's original idea and developed the Ethereum blockchain, which allowed for the emergence of smart contracts. These self-executing agreements opened up new possibilities for automated transactions, making blockchain technology even more valuable. This article aims to discuss the unused potentials in Bitcoin's white paper, as well as the potentials that the advances in blockchain technology have presented to the society. It is the beginning of a series of articles that will be published by EdEE Ecosystem, leading to the introduction of blockchain-based solutions that will unlock Blockchain features beyond Satoshi Nakamoto's vision. We invite you to engage in this discussion and share your thoughts and opinions in the comments section, as EdEE Ecosystem prepares to launch its public presentation at the end of these series of articles.The next part of this article (The future of anonymity in Cryptocurrency: The Inevitable End or a New Beginning) will be published by 4/21/2023.",
