Did you get into debt from the poker you played here? and you didn't recover your loss here first? I think you will have a hard time finding someone to fund you here on this forum, believe me.I believe it is clear to many posters of this gambling board if how addicted I was to gambling until I left gambling for over a year, started it again and stopped it until I was able to have control over it. What OP is experiencing has been what I have experienced before, it is not new to me again. I remember I wanted to borrow large amount of money from a cousing, I was happy today because he did not borrowed me, I was angry at the time, thinking he can borrow me and use it to gamble. I borrowed from my brother a huge amount, used it to gamble and I lost it. I sold my home theater and I used it to gamble. I even sold my laptop and used it to gamble. I borrow from people and I was in dept, I used the money I supposed to use for other things to gamble. Some of my father's money that was with me was lost into gambling that I was unable to repay him, if I am not his child, maybe I would be in jail by now. I hope his family will know that he is gambling, his family taking action will help him because he is definitely an addict, I can smell he is an addict.",

For newbies who may fall in this trap, a bid good luck before you get drained in debt too.

I don't know if an escrow could be used for that kind of transaction, but it would make really transparent your activity.",

That also involves cheating or partnering up with someone in order to cheat. In other words, if there was a foolproof system to always win and beat the house, that particular game would be quickly banned or have its rules changed so the house wins long-term. You might have some tricks to increase your chances of winning, but nothing significant.   Poker is somewhat different because you are playing against other players and not against the house, but there are systems in place to detect cheating patterns.",

Why need a partnership that other party will just need to share you funds for your bank roll. A gambler with debt is considered as problematic when it comes to partnership. No one in the right mind here that can do this offer considering how messy is your background.You said that you are earning small then why just keep continue on this phase until you save huge funds for your bankroll?",
