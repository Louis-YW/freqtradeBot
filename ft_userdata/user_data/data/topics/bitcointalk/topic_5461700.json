My personal explanation is as simple as following. Bitcoin was invented at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Consequently, 21 was chosen by Satoshi just as symbolic number to emphasize that BTC is the money for the 21st century.",

The reason Satoshi Nakamoto chose 21 million coins to be the total supply can not be known, only him can answer that. But the best answer people can have about it is because he wants bitcoin to have limited supply so that the coin can have value.",

      "body": "I also was a bit curious why he actually choose that exact number and I did some little findings and some articles reported that satoshi’s choice was just a guess but an educated one Here is a quote of his I sawQuote from: [url=https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshi-reply-to-mike-hearn/https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshi-reply-to-mike-hearn/[/url]]My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it’s locked in and we’re stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There’s plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it’s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.And some on  https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/8439/why-was-21-million-picked-as-the-number-of-bitcoins-to-be-createddid the mathematical calculations as Quote Calculate the number of blocks per four year cycle:6 blocks per hour* 24 hours per day* 365 days per year* 4 years per cycle= 210,240~= 210,000Sum all the block reward sizes:50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + … = 100Multiply the two:210,000 * 100 = 21 million.Should note that the 6 blocks per hour was as a result of 10 minutes set as time for mining of each block",

      "body": "Well, the question is quite interesting and i never came to think about it because i thought its just a random number. Because, there are more than 20 thousands tokens available in the market and all of them have different numbers of supply. Which to some projects have some meaning and to some projects they are just random. Well, after reading the mentioned topic by Upgrade00, i found some answers which are mostly the same. So here is what most of the people think about why the supply is set to 21 million. Quote from: teukon on June 15, 2015, 04:37:52 PMSatoshi Nakamoto settled on a target time of 10 minutes per block with an initial subsidy of 50 BTC set to halve once every 4 years.4 years / 10 minutes ≈ 210 00050 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + ... = 100210 000 * 100 = 21 millionNow, if we look at the calculations, why the number of 4 years is kept 4. as why halving is always after 4 years, well, i assume if we would change the halving years then the block numbers of 210 000 will also be different. So, overall, one thing i am seeing here is, Satoshi kept the supply according to halving periods not according to some random shit. Means, he must have some plans for future too, maybe he could be online again.",

As the supply is fixed and not subject to inflation, some proponents argue that it could encourage saving and long-term investment in Bitcoin. However, it also has its criticisms, as deflationary assets might lead to hoarding behavior, hindering the currency's use in daily transactions.The true reason behind the selection of 21 million Bitcoins may never be known, as Satoshi Nakamoto's identity and intentions remain a mystery to this day.  The decision has undoubtedly contributed to Bitcoin's unique properties and its status as the first and most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.",

I believe that the people who have faith in numerology knows better that some numbers can make projects far more luckier than the other numbers, and that can also be a reason to set the limit of Bitcoin to 21 million only.Another important factor that might have been considered while limiting the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million would be that the amount is quite a reliable amount to make a currency worth grow over time when it receives more purchases. The value of Bitcoin should be far lower if Satoshi has set its supply to something 100 million, and it would also require a lot more time to mine those 100 million Bitcoin. While setting the value to 10 million would be a good thing to some extent but the total Bitcoin's should have already be mined till this date and the miners won't be getting incentivize for their effort of mining. I think Satoshi set that number according to a strategy that only he knew, and because of that Bitcoin is still working in its best way, and it's growing in value after each halving event.",

I just went through the thread to which you referred us. It seems there are number of justification for the 21 million number and thus lot of theories behind it. However, I see that every one is trying to add up and substract the numbers, years, time in minutes, and much more! I think math's is funny language for this very reason. There is one problem and you can have N-number of solutions for the same. It's but obvious that we will never be able to look at the correct answer. The closest one seems that it's just random number with block reward process as described by @Upgrade00Some of the quotes from earlier discussion: It gets as interesting as you keep on digging more. QuoteStart with a block reward of a nice simple number of 50 BTC per block.Then every 210000 block (approximately every 4 years if blocks are generated on average every 10 minutes), cut the block reward in half and throw away any decimals after the 8th decimal place.So after 210000 blocks you will have generated 50 * 210000 = 10500000 BTCThen after another 210000 blocks you will have generated another 25 * 210000 = 5250000 BTC for a total of 10500000 + 5250000 = 15750000 BTCThen after another 210000 blocks you will have generated another 12.5 * 210000 = 2625000 BTC for a total of 10500000 + 5250000 + 2625000 = 18375000 BTCQuote4 years / 10 minutes ≈ 210 00050 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + ... = 100210 000 * 100 = 21 millionQuoteA double precision floating point has 52 significant bits so is capable of describing every number between 0 - 4503599627370496 exactly.Or converting that number of satoshi's in Bitcoins this gives45,035,996. 27370496So whilst he could have use 45 million my guess is that the maths of starting with 50BTC and halving came to ~21 million which is high enough to use the full range while giving some room for error such as someone doing( coins in circulation + satoshi's stash ) / 2  and not worrying about overflow errors.",

Since Satoshi created the revolution Bitcoin , his purpose was to create a new economic system to protect privacy and avoid the ongoing fiat currency inflation etc. Satoshi is a very intelligent man, there must be a reason behind it, maybe it is a secret just like he is hidden from us.",
