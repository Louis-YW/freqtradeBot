But at the moment ETH Mining would be the best profit right now , til it will be changing to POS , but then you can also mine other Coins .If you have already the Asic just turn it on , if you thinking to buy one just for Mining if you are new dont do it , GPUs would be better and you can sell them laters again.",

      "body": "I don't know if you already have something to start, like a PC with free PCIe slots, but considering the moment of ETH POS, I suggest you to look for Nvidia cards.You can mine ETH right now and them you will have a better option to mine another coins, Nvidias are better than AMD on another algos.500w you can run 3x RTX 3070 for example, or 1x RTX 3080 and 1 RTX 3070, there's a lot of great combinationsRight now I don't think it's a good idea to go with AMDsIf you want more info about BTC mining and Asics, it's better to ask in: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=14.0",

Also what about your backup? How will you charge if you use all available power.",
