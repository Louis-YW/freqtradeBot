      "body": "The answer here may be obvious, but that doesn't mean that it's not worth mentioning. There is no set amount of money one needs to earn, and there's no real amount of money one can earn that means that he or she has enough money. Some people will always want more money, and others will always be satisfied having enough. It largely depends upon the person and what he or she values in life. I think for many of us, as long as we can make ends meet, we will be content having enough money to maintain a home, raise a family if we choose, and have plenty of food on the table at all times. For these reasons and more, it's likely not something we will stop worrying about anyway.",

If you can answer this on your own, or write it down, you can have it.  Perhaps you discovered you needed more after you have gotten this, what's next?Man's desire is insatiable. Enough money I believe is just more money to fulfill this desire/urge/hunger/thirst. Adding value to oneself by upgrading, learning, and growing, is sure to secure one has enough and more money.",

It's like cocaine  Maslow's hierarchy of needs can well explain how humans are motivated to make decisions based on the needs.",

Ever wondered why some company top brass still engage in illegal schemes to make money even though they're already fuckin rich?Me personally I just want my basic needs met and have enough for saving to make sure I live comfortably till I die. But even then I know that people's \"needs\" change over time. Like for now I'm content with my 3 y/o phone that I got at around $140 at the time, who knows in the future if I'd consider buying a new iPhone every year a \"basic need\".  Humans are perplexing sometimes.",

There is no limit for acquiring of money but when you have enough even though people did not say you yourself it that you enough money to spend. Like if you have 10 BTC, you will know by yourself that you have enough money. People are not satisfy on money because of greed. Even 1 btc is a enough for me.",

The rest are just bonuses because when you have nothing to eat, you can farm your land with enough food that you need to survive. everyone is just deluded when they want everything in this world, the truth is, you cannot have everything rather be contented with whatever you have, and you will be the richest man alive. People often say they have no money but in reality, they have, it's just they have a future plan with it and they continue to say \"no\" until they save enough money to buy what they want.",

I can also say that I have had enough money if the money I have for my savings is enough to get me all the good things I will ever desire to have till am no longer alive and my next generation will also be comfortable with the savings I have at this point I will also say that I have had enough.",

Do not live above your means. Do not see it as diminishing to accept that you can't afford it when you truly can't. Above all, do not wish to be like someone else, you'll be amazed at how many people wishing to be like you. Just be you and be kind.Ciao.",
