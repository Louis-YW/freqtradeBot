Such users can easily be tagged by DT because so far the casino has proven to be a scam.If a new campaign takes place and it attracts a large number of participants, then a total of 125 participants will promote it in the forum. This will be a good start to stop the campaign forever as spammers of their signature campaign will increase.",

He's been with us for quite some time (almost  a year). I remember reading a couple of his threads. Clearly, this guy is not your average spammer who signs up for 1xbit campaigns. I really don't know what he was thinking.I am considering putting at least a neutral tag on his account since he was willing to promote a scam for a few bucks.But I will wait for his explanation, since he changed his mind after we brought this to his attention.
