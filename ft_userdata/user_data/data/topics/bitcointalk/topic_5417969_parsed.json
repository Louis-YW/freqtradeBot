And those who truly utilized and seek privacy won't bother about the price action. Heck, why should they care about the price? Except, it is those who generally thought of cryptocurrencies as a whole categorized as an investment, not a utility. The demand is there, and that is the reason why Litecoin implements MimbleWimble. Privacy is essential in the long run, thus privacy coins will continue to exist.",

Also privacy coins have bad performance compared to other altcoins, what is going on? Can privacy coins survive on the long run? I don't have any further views on privacy coins, but of course these coins are currently limited by regulations in various countries. As one example is our local Exchange (Tokocrypto), they decided to remove $TORN, $XMR and $ZEC trading starting on November 3rd. Having these restrictions will more or less affect adoption, although people in restricted areas can buy them through the P2P marketplace. Long ago I also saw this will happen to privacy coins, hopefully we get good news on these privacy coins in the near future.Reference:[1] https://support.tokocrypto.com/hc/id/articles/9627386688781-Tokocrypto-Akan-Menghapus-Token-TORN-XMR-ZEC-pada-03-November-2022 (Bahasa Indonesia Language)",

Or a link to press articles?If we go back, the news about Bitcoin from 2013 to the end of 2016 was related to the fact that Bitcoin is a Ponzi model or used for fraud and drugs dealers, did this lead to a loss of interest in Bitcoin?What will survive any privacy coin in the long run is that it be continuous development and really be a decentralized private currency.",

Yes of course they have suffered some heavy losses in the last few months or maybe even years but this is just the typical behaviour of the crypto market. The whole crypto scene is still based very much about hype and trends and therefore stuff like Defi, NFT's, Play2Earn and Metaverse were just way more present in the last 2 years than privacy focused projects, but this can change again in the future. At the moment almost every type of crypto project is having a hard time because we are in a full bear market now for at least 1 year now but in the future i am sure that privacy coins will also rise again.",

They will survive but they aren't trendy.  Unfortunately this market is run by greed so people jump on what's trendy.  Masternode coins in 2017, meet coins in 2020/21, etc.  In the end they always die but boring coins end up sticking around.",

Nowadays, people enter the market mainly looking for profit and they will only be interested in things that can bring them profit, technology or anonymity is hardly a concern for them anymore.

It's just that not everyone understands the benefits of privacy yet. When regulation affects the entire cryptocurrency industry and people start having problems with blocking funds and censorship, then it will be the finest hour for private coins. I don't exclude that there could be strict regulation or a digital concentration camp where private coins will be necessary.",

I believe that apart from Monero, which has managed to form a large user base, no coins will survive long. You can also forget about new projects of privacy coins, they won't take their niche on the market in such conditions, because they are not welcomed on large trading platforms. The destiny of privacy coins is to hide in darknet and be used to pay for dubious services and goods.",

A lot of people are opting for coins that can post them quick profits and are 'flashy,' and topics like privacy doesn't really come to their minds as evidenced by a lot of people giving out their personal information on bounties and airdrops in exchange for some of those new coins to be had for free. If there would be a privacy coin that is trendy, and can literally keep up with the ads that other big crypto names are putting out, perhaps there is a fighting chance. But I still wouldn't bank on it heavily, though. Also, privacy is a niche that not everyone is really interested in given how excessively showy a lot of us are nowadays.",

We can't say the regulations directly affected the privacy coins and it will completely kill the future of it because the next level of decentralisation is complete anonymous coins which still has the user base if I am not wrong but the most preferred privacy coin faced some technical issues in the past later governments made regulations which completed delisted the privacy coins from exchanges so price went down and volume but it doesn't mean it will be forgotten...In future we may have better developed privacy coins and government may support cryptocurrencies with no regulations will make them to exist.",

People have no choice… The exchanges are dropping their support for those coins and delisting them because it is impossible to track the movements of the coins for the government and they hate them for this.When the exchanges don’t list them anymore people can’t trade them and convert their coins to FIAT… The loss of huge trade volume reflects on the price of these coins.It is very sad to see that no coin can survive if the big exchanges don’t support them.

The majority of market participants focus on the market trend which is bearish now, after the bull market sign it is possible the investors will take care of privacy coins. Just HODL the altcoins and let's hope it will be the end of the bear market season soon so we will be able to harvest profit during the bull market season.In a bull market or a bear market, I think a privacy coin will have a hard time capturing the attention of investors if it doesn't have any notable hype.It is clear that in this market, what people need is profit, but not privacy, so those who are privacy aficionados will turn to Bitcoin. Although bitcoin will not be completely anonymous like XMR but I think people will choose BTC that is both anonymous and profitable. Nowadays, privacy coins are only used for certain purposes, it is no longer suitable as a profitable investment, IMO.",
