The one that takes the cake is this latest one, which has not yet gained any merit but does not stand up to basic mathematical analysis:Bitcoin Has Taken Me To Perfection, Houses And Cars Have I Reached?For the analysis, see my comments.In the end, all you get is a bunch of people in the comments congratulating him on a made-up story. I'm not saying that all stories like this are made up, but it seems to me that somehow between the congratulatory comments and the merits, it encourages people to make up these stories. Thoughts?",

It's nothing new, it's a trend that's been around for years and I rarely engage in such discussions because it's very difficult or almost impossible to judge whether a story is true or made up. There are cases where some evidence (photographs) is also posted, but I noticed that such \"evidence\" often reveals much more than it should, especially if it contains the faces of persons (often minors).Quote from: Cuenta Alternativa on March 28, 2023, 12:21:52 PMIn the end, all you get is a bunch of people in the comments congratulating him on a made-up story. I'm not saying that all stories like this are made up, but it seems to me that somehow between the congratulatory comments and the merits, it encourages people to make up these stories. Thoughts?There are also honest comments, but most of them are signature spam, and there is also no doubt that such stories encourage others to share (or even invent) their own stories. Bitcoin discussion generally covers even such topics, but I think such topics would be more appropriate for Off topic or possibly in the Reputation board.In my opinion, what is even more controversial in the whole story are the members who open a new topic for each personal success, even if it is a continuation of their past success. Let's see how it looks on the following example ->Early bitcoin investment for my baby (14 March 2023)Evidence that I actually invested for my baby (27 March 2023)I reported another thread, so far it is unhandled.",

You can say or write anything you want, and therefore I trust only the facts. And the facts, in most cases, are not provided by these happy owners of yachts, palaces and villas bought for bitcoin.In particular, the endless congratulations of these \"lucky ones\" even annoy me a little, and therefore, I don't read such posts in which congratulations. Their content is of little interest. Better to spend your time better.",

I think that's a free for any idea, but if you really don't like it then you certainly have a choice between ignoring the user or maybe reporting the post as useless.

On sight most of the stories look flat out made up, and just a bait to prolly get merits or recognition of some sort, sometimes it works for some users, most times it doesn't, i guess that's just how the forum works.But if you ask me, i don't think we need to know what you acquired with your Bitcoin (it's even pretty bad for your security) or if Bitcoin is now accepted as part of ways to make payments in your private business, there are much better things to discuss on the forum than that, but like i said, it is all a subjective matter.",
