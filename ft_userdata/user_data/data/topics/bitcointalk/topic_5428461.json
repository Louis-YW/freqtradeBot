Quote from: alastantiger on December 14, 2022, 06:59:41 AMShould crypto exchanges have their own native token?Having a token of their own gives us an idea about the performance of the exchange overall and customer satisfaction. You should also know that whether a big exchange has its own native token or not doesnt matter, it'll still affect BTC (only for short term), if they go bankrupt but then again BTC will go on its own.Do you know BNB (Binance exchange token), had a decent bull run during 2018 in terms of sats., while BTC went into bear mode? It didn't help btc to go up those days.In short, everything is just noise for BTC. It'll do what it wants to.",

Should crypto exchanges have their own native token?Centralized crypto exchanges create their native tokens for many reasons that help to promote their exchange and help their business, exchanges native tokens isn't the cause of the numerous collapse of centralized services in the industry, it is caused by the owners of these services who are involved in shady activities with the funds of creditors, it has nothing to do with an exchange having its own token.Though it goes without saying that an investor should not hold an exchange token for too long, it is the same mistake as leaving your money on an exchange, if the exchange falls, those who have their funds in the fallen exchange and the holders of their native tokens anywhere are going to lose their money, because the value of the native token will drop to nothing.",

Should crypto exchanges have their own native token?Not all exchange platforms have their native token, but most of the famous exchange platforms create their native token in order to promote and use it by platform users in paying service fees, settling transaction fees, or in paying staking rewards, providing liquidity, and others, which will help increase the adoption and investment of the token and increase its popularity, which will It helps to increase the demand for it and its price increases, which will benefit its creators, who are the exchange platform team. To be honest, I do not like the native token for exchanges, because investing in them is very risky if the platform is exposed to bankruptcy, hacking, or otherwise, the native token will collapse, as happened to the FTX platform and its currency, so Bitcoin is the safest currency, and there are many altcoins that suffice us and keep us away from the native token of the exchange platforms.",

And I'll go with the no first, it's because that it's been oversaturated and every new exchange right now starts to make one for themselves and it's no longer about the use case and utility but more like a crowdfunding to them.While it's a yes, since it's seen that it's part of those exchanges success when they've launched it and managed to reach the peak that they're experiencing right now.",

As you mentioned, Terra Luna and FTX are examples of how things can go wrong with exchange tokens.It's important to remember that Bitcoin is a completely different beast. It's decentralized, and no one can control its price or supply. It's independent, and no one can freeze your coins. On the other hand, exchange tokens are centralized, and the developers have a lot of control over the price and supply. Plus, you need to use centralized exchanges to trade them, which goes against the decentralized ethos of the crypto space.Personally, I don't use centralized exchanges, so I don't have much use for exchange tokens. But for those who do, it's important to be aware of the risks involved. While the tokens may have some utility for users of the exchange, they ultimately do more harm than good to the overall health of the crypto space.",

As you mentioned, these tokens contributed to the prolonged bear market and caused a lot of FUD. And there are other risks involved too, like the centralization of these tokens and the fact that they can be manipulated by the exchange developers.I think it would be better if crypto exchanges focused on providing a good user experience and offering fair trading fees instead of trying to create their own native tokens.
