  "content": "I would like to build a list of P2P and DEX-style exchanges which offer direct trades between fiat (no stablecoins) and altcoins. This does not include platforms where fiat trades are limited to BTC, and also no CEX platforms.As there seem to be not many options currently, I also integrate P2P platforms with KYC, although of course KYC-less platforms are preferred (Already checked kycnot.me website).If you know another service, post it in this thread, it is much appreciated!WARNING: I don't know all exchanges in this list, please do your own research about trustworthyness. This is for now only a plain link list, not a reviewed/curated list. If you know about one of the listed options being untrustworthy, please post your reasons and I'll investigate - if I find reasons I will remove the service or add a warning, depending on the severeness of the accusations. Also, if you used a service you can write a post about your experiences.LocalMonero / AgoraDesk- Offered fiat/altcoin pairs: XMR with >20 currencies- Type: Website-based P2P exchange- KYC: No- URL: https://localmonero.co, https://agoradesk.com- Notes: Service both accessible by LocalMonero and AgoraDesk platform. AgoraDesk also offers Bitcoin trades. Has a long tradition and seems to be trustworthy.LitecoinLocal- Offered fiat/altcoin pairs: LTC with several currencies- Type: Website-based P2P exchange- URL: https://www.litecoinlocal.net/- KYC: ??- Notes/WARNING: Seems to have very low activity: when checked, the last trade was 4 months ago, also the prices seem completely off. Possibly not maintained properly, which means there's a high vulnerability to all kinds of attacks!LocalCoinSwap- Offered fiat/altcoin pairs: ETH, Tron, stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens to several currencies- Type: Website-based P2P exchange- URL: https://localcoinswap.com- KYC: No (not confirmed)- Note: Bitcointalk thread has low activity.Bitcoin.de- Offered fiat/altcoin pairs: LTC/EUR, ETH/EUR, BCH/EUR, BTG/EUR, DOGE/EUR, XRP/EUR, SOL/EUR, TRX/EUR- Type: Website-based P2P exchange- KYC: Yes- URL: https://bitcoin.de- Notes: Requires SEPA bank account and residence in European Union.

Worse still, I can see some instant exchange services appear in the list when I search up an offer.OP is looking for p2p exchanges that support direct fiat to altcoin or vise versa trades.",

Thanks anyway.P2P exchanges \"allowed\" in my list areÂ those where people can post announcements to sell or buy cryptocurrencies where the trade is carried out directly between the trade partners, not via an intermediary. While the difference to CEXes and instant exchanges is a bit blurry because some P2P exchanges use a custodial wallet where you have to deposit your cryptocurrencies before you can trade, the crucial difference to instant exchanges is that in P2P exchanges the trade partners set the rates, and the main difference to CEXes is that the fiat transaction happens directly between the parties.The exchanges for my list should have also some kind of escrow, they should not be simple message boards.",
