      "body": "It probably depends on the board. If you're asking for opinions and want to know what people do, are you going to be after a majority or do you just want individual opinions (I've seen topics where I think it's worth mentioning something I've done similar to what's already been said as it gives it a vote in favour of it).I've done the opposite in a lot of threads and quoted 5+ posts and wondered whether it's going to be too much to read.Some people in a rush to make posts - particularly those in the gambling campaigns that pay for a certain number of posts in the gambling section - often do just post in response to the OP and sometimes it's fine and other times you can watch a thread grow to be 5 pages in the first day - a lot of the times the OP is asking a question that's been asked before. I'd say from my time as a newbie, I liked it when my threads grew and people mentioned things and discussed what others had said. You don't need everyone to discuss the same things either, for example, you don't normally go 8 posts without someone discussing what's been mentioned previously/in them.",

Same way with continuity on the forum, if a person researched thoroughly before making a thread they'll definitely stick around to discuss with people on that topic. That's how I know if a person did research their post before sharing. That doesn't mean the OP don't come to check the responses on his post, Its clear that they don't have other things to add, which is not wrong.",

If the OP asks a question then of course he will get a lot of user responses and opinions. For example, your thread. You have two questions, and of course people will give their opinion. Maybe you need to look at a particular subject of thread to determine if it's a topic of discussion or one expecting a lot of user opinion. The two topic categories are distinguishable, so of course you will get differences.On the topic of discussion, you have to present the data for discussion and usually the OP doesn't ask questions for readers. And one more thing, you may need to specify your thread title like so:[Discussion] Most users just state their opinion on a topic rather than discuss it",

You have been on the forum for a long time, and you know that, basically, many are interested in the number of their posts, so you will see repeated answers from time to time, only in different wording. To be honest, it's quite difficult to keep the discussion going when the answers go to page two, as basically the whole topic is already exhausted after a few replies.",

Tell me what else you want to discuss 😉Full disclosure: I spend my time on the forum for fun. I like poking people, pissing them off, sometimes being gentle and sometimes being rude. But no, I am not here for serious discussion or showing how intellectual I am.

Or if they're really making a point that could revive a discussion? Or if they're making any points at all? ... These questions Don't seem to bother them; all they need is their Post-count, simple.Yunno we have alot of less oriented peeps in here, that operates in a very lowwww perception based on their inexperience ... you'll be surprised to quote someone on a very important question, on their Post, based on their statement earlier but they'll not a make any reply to that ever again!!Sandra 🧑‍🦰",
