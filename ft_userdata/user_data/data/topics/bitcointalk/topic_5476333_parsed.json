  "content": "Imagine a situation where you own a house and a piece of land it's built on. You estimated the value of the whole thing to be $500k. One day someone knocks on your door and offers you $2m all of a sudden. Will you sell or suspect they know more than you? Maybe there's an oil deposit underneath your house? Maybe there's geothermal energy source? Maybe an international company has plans to build a facility nearby and will need your land for whatever price?I'm asking this because if the funds get approved all at once there will be a large pressure on bitcoin's price and supply is, as we all know, limited. Nobody buys bitcoin to sell it cheaper, so if they offer you $100k, they think it will go higher. If they offer $1m it's again going to go higher according to them. Will you simply give it away once someone hands you $100k, or decide that it's cheap and they know more than they're willing to share?",

If yes then I will sell to them and immediately buy  another. But if No then won't sell because surely nobody buys any thing to loss it always for profit reasons hence for that same reason wouldn't sell.",

Some opportunities come once but again what if I don’t sell now and I don’t get or expect this type of offer again, I will just quickly sell it and make use of the profit. If he’s paying me a money that is two times bigger than the worth of bitcoin he needs from me, I will sell it, buy that same quantity and then use the profit for something else. But why will someone even offer to pay you a big amount that what you want to sell is not worth, bitcoin does not fit into this example but maybe a piece of land.",

The market could come crashing down.  So Id be cautious about selling to them at such lofty sums without deeper insight into their rationale and risk tolerance and  at these dizzying heights, bitcoin feels more unpredictable than ever.",

I might as well just do whatever I can in my power to make sure that the industry I am in is alive and kicking, and that of course, I’m making money in the process.

Their feet up comfortably.I think people shouldn’t be so detested by the idea of a new player from the outside market involving themselves in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. That’s part of our growth and development as a technology and economy and so we must embrace it wholly, and take the good with the bad sometimes.",

Imagine if today you sold it at $100K and you could buy 2x as much in 2 or 3 years later at a lower price - isn't that a possibility we shouldn't ignore?Let me just remind you one thing - bitcoin is a very volatile asset and its price can move in any direction. ETFs won't be able to keep prices high forever without a correction - that's simply impossible to expect. The price could drop at any time for any reason - so I would be less afraid to part with bitcoin if I had found a clear target for returns that was in my favor.",

Like you pointed out, there can be reasons why a house could be worth many times more than the house next door. But bitcoins are worth the same as any other bitcoin, if you ignore that ordinals nonsense. There is no way anyone will offer to buy coins for higher than the market prices. They will just go on the market and buy as much as they want there.And I will say some portion of my coins if the price will rise high enough. I will always hold some Bitcoin in my portfolio, but I don't plan for it to be the largest share of my portfolio - that's an unnecessary risk that in my book is not worth the potential outcomes.",

If they offer $1m it's again going to go higher according to them. the main question is... how do you know who is bidding. Perhaps it is blackrock or perhaps it is a group of small investors excited about ETFs because the media has been promoting it for years? In the allegory to home you described in your post. How do you know that the person who offers you these $2 million for your house knows more than you while he might be a weak-minded person manipulated by media propaganda, that the plot of land on which you have your house is the best in the world? What do you think is the case now? is bitcoin now quiet, no one is talking about ETF and we are dealing with \"someone knows better\", or maybe everyone knows perfectly well that bitcoin ETF is about to be accepted in next month of two and  media is exaggerating it to the limit to push small investors to buy? Back to blackrock. they don't need an ETF to invest in bitcoin. They need bitcoin ETF to earn a fees from people who will buy their ETFs. Blackrock doesn't care whether they make money or lose money. They earn fees, so launching an ETF at $60,000, at the top of the local bull market, when retail is eager to buy, just before the correction to $30,000 is an ideal scenario for them.",

Meanwhile, you can buy bitcoin on any exchange. Buying bitcoin has never been difficult, why would someone be willing to pay a higher price to buy your bitcoin when they can buy it on exchanges at the real price? Furthermore, bitcoin is also an investment, so as long as you are profitable and satisfied with it then you should sell it, there is nothing wrong with us selling bitcoin to make profit. Bitcoin is a financial market, buying and selling is also a way to make profits, not just holding for profit.",

You see, bitcoin supply is limited but the there is enough liquidity in the market that can not prevent you from making that trade.A better question would have been whether people were willing to buy the Blockrock nonsense instead of buying bitcoin directly in first place. The answer to that is unfortunate because a lot of people are still preferring the custodial and centralized option rather than the decentralized and correct way of acquiring bitcoin.",

To me even if its not the ATH as long as its almost right up there, I may even sell. But you may really have to look at the chart because they are saying that the ATH may hit $200K.

We know its impossible for bitcoin to go up since there's should be a correction that provably will happen and also for sure that Blackrock itself will sell if they see something good figures to sell and take some profit. But if you can't sell it at what they offer as you believe much on bitcoin future then its really fine.
