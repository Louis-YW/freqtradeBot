  "content": "It's quite alarming a rate at which people cheat in relationships. A friend of mine was complaining how her boyfriend was playing with her close friend even while he was with her. When confronted, he denied at first but later admitted that he did such because she wasn't giving him enough attention. Is a relationship supposed to be flexible to the point where either participant is free to \"look outside\" while in because they are not married? What do you guys think?",

A person is restrained by his standards of morality, decency, and the ability to be faithful to his partner. And all this is a personal choice. And personal responsibility. Everyone must adhere to the contract concluded between him and the partner (and this may already include polygamy, or insist on monogamy). Yes, no one can protect us from cheating, except for a reasonable choice of partner.",

If you are angry while unmarried it makes you a hypocrite because you are actually cheating on your future spouse and violating the rules against sexual affairs outside marriage. In continuation from my previous post quoted above:...Relationships such as sexual relationships outside of marriage like Fornication and Adultery actually breed insecurity in any society that allows or encourages them. A society is endowed with GOD-given or natural rules that act as Strong Boundary or Wall if fully obeyed. But once any part of the rule is broken, a section of the wall/boundary is broken or weakened and this makes the society vulnerable to attacks or invasion from foreign bodies. Breaking the natural rules create loopholes that can attract more of the \"spiritual energy\" or evil spirit that successfully caused the rule to be broken. For example, sexual affairs outside of marriage will typically attract Spirit of Lust/whoredom. That spirit will begin to corrupt and takeover the whole society like a gradual decay. And that will weaken the society and attract other kinds of spirits. Fornication and adultery are serious problems that must be tackled for a society to be well shielded or protected from attacks and general insecurity. Those who promote or encourage them can be qualified as criminals because it's a crime to break the natural rules that keep a society secure. Violators should be constantly reminded to stop or be destroyed. Obey the commandments and have faith in the CREATOR. and HE will help you do what is good or right always. Anyone who understands why and how a society gets corrupted and sick can cure many diseases that afflict mankind. Cells in the body operate in similar manner, like micro societies or bodies. Once a cell violate it rules, the cell wall is weakened and harmful viruses/microbes successfully invade it.Obey the good rules.Post Edit History:Last edited: 18:11 GMT, Dec 9 2022Post before the edit can be found here: https://archive.vn/L7Qe8",
