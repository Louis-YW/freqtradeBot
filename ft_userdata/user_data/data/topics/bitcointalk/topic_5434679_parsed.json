  "content": "I found HostVDS on Lowendtalk.com and thought I'd share it because I've seen people in need of cheap servers.Note: I'm not endorsing the service and from the reviews I know they've had quite a lot of downtime. It also was impossible to register with a Protonmail email address, and after I registered with my Gmail, I couldn't create a New Instance until a day later (customer support said there was a problem and they fixed it). So it's definitely not recommended for any production environment, and I wouldn't trust them with any sensitive data nor send them anything more than a dollar. Also, it looks like they charge 20% more on crypto payments.It's not even a real Virtual Dedicated Server, it's just a VPS:Quote from: https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/182860/no-discount-just-0-99-mo-all-the-time-for-1-vcpu-1gb-ram-10gb-nvme-and-hourly-billing/p1This is burst VPS, we guarantee 1/4 of CPU~Usually, you can use all 100%, but if you will run some high CPU usage things, like miners, you will be dropped to 50% for these plans, but after a few days only...Now the good part, and the reason why I posted this: the value for money is amazing! $0.99/month gets you 1 vCPU Core, 1 GB RAM, 10 GB NVMe storage and 50 Mbps bandwidth. Usually, you'd only get these specs at this price when you buy an annual subscription on Black Friday and pay for the year. Now, you pay $0.001333 per hour for this, and can turn it off (wipe it) when you're done!So I deposited $1 with a low-fee altcoin.To test, I've setup Ubuntu 18.04 in Dallas. It's been 56 minutes since I created the VPS Instance, and after some testing I started syncing the latest version of Bitcoin Core (pruned). It has downloaded 6.4 GB already, while CPU steal mostly around 1-2%.After another 8 minutes, it downloaded 7.6 GB. That's 9 GB per hour, and if it keeps going like this, it will be synced in 2.5 days. I'll update this thread on my progress. At a cost of $0.032 per day (about the same price range as the energy consumption of a Raspberry Pi), I'm impressed No spamSelf-moderated against spam.",

      "body": "Quote from: ETFbitcoin on January 14, 2023, 12:26:51 PMWill you have enough storage space? Bitcoin Core blocks directory take at least 550MB and size of chainstate directory will be about 4.7GB after you done sync.Yes. The OS takes only 2 GB.I noticed something else: kswapd0 is eating CPU:Quote from: Mikko Rantalainen on Ask Ubuntuif kswapd0 is taking any CPU and you do not have swap, the system is nearly out of RAM and is trying to deal with the situation by (in practise) swapping pages from executables. The correct fix is to reduce workload, add swap or (preferably) install more RAM. Adding swap will improve performance because kernel will have more options about what to swap to disk. Without swap the kernel is practically forced to swap application code.So 1 GB RAM is a bit low  I knew that, just never tried.So far, it downloaded 22 GB, so it's slowing down significantly. One solution would be to create a VPS with more RAM for the IBD (Initial Block Download). Doubling RAM to 2 GB also gives a higher bandwidth, and at 4 GB RAM it adds another vCPU too (for only $0.00536/hour).For now, I'll let it run. It still downloaded another 0.3 GB while typing this.Update: I've started another VPS, this time in Silicon Valley. This one has 2 GB RAM, 20 GB disk (only 10 needed), faster internet and the same CPU. Let's see how they compare, I expect much better performance. I'm now paying a total of $0.004 per hour Update: I killed that second VPS. It was actually slower. It had a low system load, so maybe it's internet isn't as fast as expected.Update: I started a new VPS (also in Dallas), with 2 GB RAM. I copied the incomplete and pruned Bitcoin Core data to that one, and continued syncing on both. By the time the first one (with 1 GB RAM) had downloaded 0.6 GB, the other had downloaded 3.6 GB. That's 6 times faster for double the RAM (and hourly rate). The second one doesn't have kswapd0 eating CPU, so I'll kill the first one now.Update: The CPU-load got quite low, so I restarted bitcoind with --dbcache=1536 to see if that speeds things up.After setting up the VPS, it sends the root password by email, but it doesn't work. From the Dashboard I can manually change the root password, and then it works.",

I'll probably use them for scraping in the future, when I need a new IP address for a couple of months and downtime is not a problem.Update on my 2 GB RAM VPS: it downloaded 43 GB in 15 hours. At the moment, the CPU is idle, RAM is not full, but the download speed dropped significantly and it barely syncs new blocks. Downloading a Linux ISO (always a good test) gets me 30 kB/s, and if I start another one, both drop to 15 kB/s. Maybe they're throttling the server after downloading a lot. That wouldn't even be a problem, but it should be documented. Now I can only guess.Progress: 15%.",

I often don't want to install/compile something on my own system when I'm only testing it shortly, and I'd gladly pay $0.01 for a VPS for a few hours. I already did it today. The alternative would be a VM (and often VPN).QuoteAnd honestly, it's freaking good for $1 per month.Hence my post QuoteThe second plan though is very interesting. Double ram, double storage, and 4x Internet speed? Okay, that's soon to be sold out.It's a cloud service, I don't expect one of them to sell out until they're all gone at once.Quotehave you checked if they accept LN-BTCThey don't. They use plisio.net for crypto payments. It accepts BTC/LTC/XMR and more, I usually use a low-fee altcoin to avoid Bitcoin dust.Quoteand if you pay once per month or annually?It's prepaid, just pay what you need. I don't think credit expires, but there's no need to send a large amount.I got tired of waiting, so I copied the pruned directory to my dedicated server. They both continued from 2016-08-31, and even before the VPS finished that day, the big server finished the entire next month. All in all I reached 19% for less than $0.07. It could still finish, but takes longer than I hoped for this little experiment.",

They have no idea where I am.QuoteLast time i tried cheap VPN (i don't remember name of the website) which mentioned on lowendtalk.com, their third-party system discriminate me based on my country.I've seen many hosting providers that don't like Tor-registrations. I wouldn't call it discrimination, they're probably trying to avoid abuse. I even saw one that asks for a selfie with ID, so I just avoid those.For VPN, I like Mullvad.net. Since it's also pay-per-hour, it nicely fits this topic. Pay them as little as you want and you'll get the minutes you paid for.When trying to increase my balance at HostVDS, Plisio now shows:Code:error.Internal server error occurred, please, try again laterI'll chat with them Update: their answer is useless:QuotePlease, try again later. If this issue persists, please, provide us a screenshot with detailsUpdate: It works without Tor (using a VPN). So I guess I didn't use Tor the first time I paid either.",

It continued syncing from 2023-01-18T18:04:37Z (just 9 days ago). It has 500 MB disk space remaining.This gets you 3% more available disk space by reducing the reserved space from 5% to 2%:Code:tune2fs -m2 /dev/sda1It took about 2 hours to catch up on the last 9 days of transactions, which is 100 times faster than real-time. That also means just 1% of the CPU power is enough to keep it up to date, which means it shouldn't trigger the 95% CPU steal again.To conclude my topic: a $1/month VPS with 1 GB RAM and 10 GB disk can indeed be used to run a pruned node, although it's better to do the initial block download on a more powerful system. Once synced, you can use a cheap VPS with 1 GB RAM for normal Bitcoin Core tasks through bitcoin-cli.",
