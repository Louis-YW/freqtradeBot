Will Russia continue to suffer like Libya or is there a \"Moses\" in sight? https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-type-of-government-does-russia-have.htmlOh gosh no, Russia never operated under a truly democratic rule. It's not in their political nature going all the way back to the Mongolian rule. I'm not saying this as a bash on the Russian people themselves, it's just the way it is. We can argue that the western world as well is not truly democratic, rather just a bit higher democratic percentage, but that's not the issue right now. Moses? No, there won't be a savior of any sorts. What can be is that someone from Putin's clique (like Shoigu or Medvedev) that would replace Putin in a more moderate apologetic way.",

May he be more restrained and mentally fortified than Putin.He doesn't look too good the past few weeks, at least that's what the media shows, but the videos I've seen do show that he's feeling a little off and unwell.  I even read that he has blood cancer and is extremely ill, however, how could we possibly confirm this? Could it be another propaganda to make him look weak and vulnerable? Could he be doing it on purpose too? Who knows. If that's all true, I wouldn't be surprised if he's removed from governance, murdered, or even have a military coup against him.",

The outcome of said elections is predetermined. Putin derives his power from his security forces, the KGB. Putin can be described as a mob boss in Russia. The only way to oust Putin is to get those who are loyal to him in his security forces to no longer be loyal to him.",

I can't imagine any way that the West can force him to step down, other than by assassinating him, which could have quite dramatic repercussions... and creating a power vacuum in Russia is probably not a great idea.But if Russia struggles long enough, his allies are weakened, the population turns against him... then someone in Russia will likely step up to mount a coup. Not sure that any sort of democratic transition would be at all likely.",
