I dropped it in urlscan and same result: https://urlscan.io/result/b330c5e3-2bea-4fa2-94cf-9b7324abc04e/This is why you should stay away with new and obscure exchanges, they are likely to scam their users. If you whois wolebit, it's only 13 days old so it's likely that no one has ever heard of it therefore it has zero rep. I'd consider the documents compromised, I suggest reaching out to relevant authorities/companies.How to attach images: you can upload it to hosting websites like https://imgur.com/ and drop the links in your post.",

When I deposited and after some time when I want to withdraw he says you have to wait 7 days. And when I got back after er 7 days this website was gone. And that's why I avoid such kind of websites or exchanges. If you want to know which exchange could be better than you should got to https://coinmarketcap.com/exchangesThis wills how you which exchange is more trustable.",
