  "content": "Scarce ResourceOne of the main reasons for Bitcoin's value is that the supply of Bitcoin is limited.  21 million bitcoins will be supplied over 18 million bitcoins have already been mined.  Because the value of Bitcoin is determined by the ratio of supply and demand.  Day by day the demand for BTC is increasing and the number of Bitcoin holders is increasing due to the growing population and the price is likely to increase in the future.  Experts believe that competition between holders will increase the value of BTC in the future when the supply of Bitcoin reaches 21 million while mining Bitcoin will not. Decentralised Network Another important reason for BTC's value is that BTC is a fully decentralized networking system.  Centralized network systems could be controlled by governments like traditional currencies or controlled by one or more institutions, individuals and groups.  But since Bitcoin is a completely decentralized system, it cannot be controlled by the government, so Bitcoin is completely Freedom.Store of Value/Not to be InflationBitcoin works completely against inflation, especially since governments can't regulate it and cannot print it in a printing press like traditional paper money and therefore cannot increase its supply.  So it doesn't get inflation like normal currency. Due to lack of inflation common people can't keep in purchasing power thus Bitcoin's value is maintained.Bitcoin's Utility & Growing Globally Adoption Bitcoin's value is maintained as it is exchangeable with various products and day by day various circles, famous people, institutions, countries are recognizing Bitcoin around the world.  Moreover, various business organizations are accepting Bitcoin as a payment system for their business.  Because Bitcoin is such a global revolution, its value will always remain.",

      "body": "You make some really valid comments about how Bitcoin's restricted quantity, decentralization, and invulnerability to inflation all contribute to its value. And because of that, the one thing that matters most - faith - has grown stronger. People's belief in technology's potential to radically alter the financial system is the primary force behind the market's valuation of its products. This confidence becomes stronger and stronger as more people, businesses, and governments adopt and acknowledge Bitcoin's value. Remember that Bitcoin's value is supported by the faith and confidence of its users in the currency's potential.Being alive during so many technological upheavals and able to participate in them is an exciting adventure.",

Its not the same ice in the North pole than in Sahara, its not the same selling it to an ice manufacturer than a tourist, its not the same in the middle of the day than the middle of the night, or in winter vs summer...Limited emission is a reality, doesn't matter the exact amount, it is limited and that's what matters. Also the rate that the remaining coins will be minted at, all of that is fixed in the code and cannot be changed trivially like politicians or banksters do with fiat. If the market price goes too high, the satoshi may start to become impractical, in that case could be proposed a further increase to the number of decimals. Yes, the bitcoin is only a unit of reference that means a 100 million satoshis but nothing changes except the way you end expressing your wealth.There are the other features of Bitcoin, and every individual learns about them and decides if its valuable or not and how much, for how long and where. Are you fleeing a war and can't simply carry bags of gold with you across the border?Or maybe you live in America or Europe where the USD and EUR don't seem to be going anywhere (yet) and can even use that money digitally in most parts of the world unrestricted. Some of those people see little value or even think its more cumbersome than \"just cash\" or credit/debit card.The correlation of pro/cons is reflected in the market price. And of course the amount that doesn't reach the market because people don't want to part with it or is lost forever, so technically its even less than the so called 21 million. Like the million and so from Satoshi...",
