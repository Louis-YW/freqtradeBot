I mean there's no real life correlation. You walk into a public space and hands your head to a stranger and the stranger listens and heard bitcoin and immediately fell in love  OP, where did you bring in the story of bull run or something else. If you are stocked in your computer, you wouldn't have the opportunity to travel and meet a girl to listen your head set. Maybe another line of story would have been better.",

That relationship will not end with a happy ending because life is never smooth and even you continue to be rich, a person who comes to you not because of love, will not stay with you forever.This is one of a most weird and in my opinion, stupid idea.",

I thought this ad might be consists of some platform where girls and boys who are crypto enthusiastic will come together and can ping each other and can make friends with each other.But this was totally unexpected, and what make you think we can make friends by watching this ad? Or you were also kidding in a serious way! (i mean are you being sarcastic). Well, I will say I really have lost my charm and interest in how to talk with girls because few days back a girl messages me on messenger and after few words she said send me your pic and I top level skeptical and not falling to sentiments, and the one who always gives a  thought to the acts that I am making, said to that girl why would I send you a pic.I have many pics on my profile while you don't have any so why don't you send me your pics. Well, this led our chat to an end. The point is, I realized at that time, I am being so optimistic about my career and investments that I have losing oe not gaining any skills in getting a girl. I hope my parents never read this reply hehehe (they are not on BTT).",

Investing in Bitcoin doesn't mean to torturing us. We don't need to be trapped in our apartment, we can hang out or take vacation although we invest in Bitcoin. We should take a loot at the price chart the whole day, or we update information about Bitcoin every minute. Those are too much behavior of a Bitcoiner.If we want to get a girlfriend, it is a must to socialize with others. We must go out from our apartment, we have to meet a lot of people. Living in an apartment only, shouldn't be a good life, we must be easy to feel bored with very limited activities. So, although we are heading the bullrun season, we must have time to socialize with other people.",

This is not enough to make you get a girlfriend because if she is not interested in bitcoin, she can’t be compelled with those persuasive words she was listening to through the headphones.

To see a pro Bitcoin girlfriend to date in real life is hard but boys are full every corner in the world. And even at that I don't think it is possible to see a girl here to date. Unless the admin create women board for it before you can see more women in the forum. If not we tag everyone here as guys. I know only few girls and one woman in the forum.

I was glad because we have few females in the Bitcoin space and it would have been interesting to connect with some of them But it turned out to be a mere advertisement. The advert had a nice concept but I was expecting to hear an instrumental and the sound of the voice of the young man. But I was disappointed to hear just a few words without melody. However, nobody should lose his or her emotional relationship because of Bitcoin. We should go out and catch some fun because so many things in life are far precious than money. I am always pleased with any event or activity that is designed to promote Bitcoin, so kudos to the producers of the ads.",
