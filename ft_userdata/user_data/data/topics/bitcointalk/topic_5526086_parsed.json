  "content": "Yeah! Where exactly the Moon is if not at $100k?. We have been using this slang for quite a time and I understand that it carries a symbolism, but still I think it is high time that we should come up with some updated slang . I mean, it has been one whole year since BTC has literally reached the moon. Yeah! Exactly one year back, a private key engraved on a 43 gram physical coin with a public address — 1MoonBTCixFH3XTrWRCbMpK23o74nQrA1Q — has already reached the moon as a first ever extraterritorial financial asset.So now IMO when we have achieved both figurative and literal essence of, 'BTC to MOON' I think we should come up with a new slang. Like Bitcoin to the Andromeda !  Let me know what you think of it and suggest some new slang.Edit: After reading replies to this post, I realized that BTC has not reached the moon yet, as the Peregrin 1 lander suffered what ground controllers call ''a failure within the propulsion system''.",

So, if Bitcoin can reach Mars, maybe we can too, and we’ll be enjoying our Bitcoin up there.. lol!From my perspective, “to Mars” feels like hitting $200k. Since the $100k milestone is behind us, the next logical target would be that. But let’s not rush it as it’s still early, and we have the whole year ahead, even if there’s a correction along the way.",

Let me know what you think of it and suggest some new slang.The term \"to the moon\" seems more comfortable to say, and I see this term more often in various crypto communities. Basically, this term is used when a coin experiences an increase and with the hope that it will experience a further increase, so this term is used. For me Personally, I still prefer on this term, that's why I still say and stand by \"Bitcoin to the Moon!\".",

The moon represents a target. If it's reached, another target comes up. That's the moon. $100,000 has retired from being the moon. It's already here. It isn't up there anymore. $1 million is indeed the new moon. We're on our way there. $200,000, $350,000, $600,000, and the rest of them 6 figures are small celestial bodies we'll just pass by.
