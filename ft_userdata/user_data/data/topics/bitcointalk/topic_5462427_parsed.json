Thus, those who comment can provide deeper explanations, shedding light on their viewpoints and potential frustrations. I posit that the comment may stem from Bitcoin's considerable price fluctuations, leading to unease. If your investment in Bitcoin results in a fifty percent reduction, contentment might elude you. This illustrates that Bitcoin's ability to bring joy is contingent upon substantial profits rather than constant assurance.",

This can be exciting because you might make a lot of money, but it can also be a bit scary because you might lose a lot. So, it's a good idea to be ready for these ups and downs and only invest money you're okay with not having.Also, something to keep in mind is that different places have different rules about Bitcoin. It's like how different schools might have different rules for uniforms. So, it's smart to know what the rules are in your area because they can affect how you use Bitcoin. Staying updated on these rules will help you make smart choices and use Bitcoin safely.",

But if one follow the rules carefully, practice proper risk management and only invest with the money you can afford to lose. You will be less disappointed.",

Bitcoin is not all about happiness.Bitcoin isn't just about happiness - that means it can also disappoint you. I mean - from a trading and investing perspective you will face risks where losses are the most feared. While you can also lose your bitcoin due to misuse or something else like hacking - so bitcoin not only bring you happiness but also lose money because of the risk.",

Can you please share the link of the thread here? Anyway, I guess the user who said that means \"Bitcoin will always not give you happiness, but there are times where you feel the opposite of it\" meaning not every time is profit time. There will be times where you will be losing money especially when you are trading. You can prevent losing money though by not selling your holdings even though you are on an impermanent loss, but bottom line is, Bitcoin might give you huge profits, but it can give you huge losses as well.I might be wrong though, but that's what I think about that phrase. Is there anybody who thinks different on that phrase.",

We are also free to send anywhere without recognizing borders between countries as applied to the Central Bank system which has certain restrictions on sending money abroad.

As you gain more experience on these boards, you will learn how to filter the information, and what types of threads are worth reading and which aren't. Talking about Bitcoin and happiness isn't something I would pay too much attention to. Happiness is a subjective feeling you can experience with or without bitcoin. So discussing if your BTC bag makes you happy or not is, in my opinion, a waste of time. I would suggest you move on to topics that you can actually learn from. How bitcoin makes you feel doesn't belong to that category.",
