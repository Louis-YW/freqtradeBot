Many investors in the market also know very well that it was released as a joke and is in the market. Even before Elon Musk became interested in the doge, he used it for transfers between exchanges due to its fastness and cheap shipping fees. Until elon musk blows the Doge, of course. Later, shib and babydoge were released. That's why I don't want to do much with memecoins because your money can go bankrupt. Frankly, I don't recommend it to anyone.",

Let's review their charts in detail.Sorry to say OP but is pretty obvious that your post is just another shill attempt for your favorite meme-coin which you probably have invested in or are even part of the team; Babydoge. This is ok because everyone wants to make money but i doubt that many will fall for that easy scheme. I just searched for Babydoge on coinmarketcap and i had 14 results. I think this alone stands for itself. I am pretty sure that 10 of those 14 meme-coins are already dead and the other 4 will probably be dead withing the next few months. Meme-coins are totally useless and they also did harm the crypto market as a hole in my opinion as they took away attention and money from real projects. I am happy when they are all gone pretty soon. Except for Dogecoin and probably Shiba Inu, which i dislike two but i think the market can handle 2 useless projects.",

I mean if you started a topic named \"BabyDoge is the best meme project ever in crypto!\" and just list all the things you liked about babydoge, nobody would be able to stop you from doing it, you know that right? You do not need to put doge and shib into this and act as if babydoge would be more profitable than them. I mean maybe it would be, maybe it won't be, who cares. How you approach matters though, it means that you are going to be pretty horrible when you \"hide\" your shill and people will see this as a low effort and will cause you to lose a lot of investors.",

These coins are for gamblers cause we cant really know how much hype can be seen within these type of projects. If users can totally accept a huge risk their money at meme then good for them and uf ever their money blooms or worse lose a lot.I myself didnt try to play hard on memecoin but I also degen some sometimes but only for a quick profits. Of course there are losses too. So its only boils down to your risk appetite.Not bad to ape with these memecoin as long ad your not doing an all in compared to massive projects.",

      "body": "Dogecoin and Shiba Inu got huge support from the community, that is what I only see. In fact, even without Elon Musk Doge will still exist and that is because people see this valuable than the other meme coins. However, people had thought and made it general that they are useless and are just shitcoins which gives less attraction to the market. But despite the negativity, they still survive and compete in the market. I won't stop people from investing in Doge and Shiba, that was their choice as well nor to urge others to think they are good projects. QuoteMeme coins are meme-inspired cryptocurrencies. They tend to be highly volatile compared to major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). This is likely because meme coins are heavily community-driven tokens. Their prices are usually influenced by social media and online community sentiments. This often brings a lot of hype but also FOMO and financial risk. While it’s true that some traders became rich with meme coins, many lost money due to market volatility.source: https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-meme-coins",

Even for those who have been here for a long time as well, it's not a guarantee that can you make profit or get out in time before the pumpers dump their coins. I guess that's the nature, make money out of those noobs for this whales. So it's either we really don't invest on this meme coins and ignore them or try to get our hands and see how it goes.
