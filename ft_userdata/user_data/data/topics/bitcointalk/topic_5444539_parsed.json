You obviously didn't understand how the trust system works here.I guess you didn't think that you would gain a reputation through a couple of small loans so that you could take a larger sum based on that.",

Maybe you spending your time on wrong things. Try to find a job, look around google for stuff you can do. Try to learn something that can bring money in.Sitting on a forum and hope somebody gonna give you a loan that you definitely not going to be able to pay back wont solve anything, it would just give you air a little bit longer. Try instead to solve the problem instead of some quick fix. Your focus should be to get an income, not a loan.Good luck.",

You would still have to think about money because you'd have to pay the loan back. I suppose this comment goes to show that repayment was certainly your intention if you were (by some miracle) able to get a loan.",
