As far as I know the New testament which is the story of Jesus Christ himself actually tried to teach in many of his sermons that money is not supposed to be the answer to everything and it should not be adored, because it only makes people to stay away from God. I actually recall one part of the Bible which told the story of a rich man who asked to Jesus what he was supposed to do to enter the Kingdom, and Jesus told him he was supposed to give away his fortune and follow him, which made the rich man to feel sad, since he liked his money.",

Absolutely nothing! That's the reality that everyone needs money while a very few people that are beating that fact and living on their own, still I've seen them grow their own food but they still need money for their other resources like energy so they buy which means again, the money is there needed for them to live comfortably.Quote from: Peter Faith on November 02, 2023, 09:01:52 PMSo have come to a conclusion that one need to double up your hustle aside the normal government or private work ...add a trade ...learn hand work or something that will make you to be stable in your finances.Just mix it up with other source of income that you can do and you'll live well on this time. However, others are too hard working and still what they earn aren't enough to make a living and that's why they're struggling. And with the mentioning of Bible. Do not forget about that when you start to get focused more with money, it's possible that you will love it. I don't know how to distinguish that when in fact we need money but you shouldn't love it.Maybe, that's all about being greedy and as we earn from our sources of income. We shouldn't be greedy but if it's not enough and we are not content. Don't love the money because if you do, that's what the bible says about it being the root of all evil. 1 Timothy 6:10.",

But no doubt that money helps to make things which are suppose to be naturally difficult to be easy from family, to relationship, to helping others like the needy. Even in service to God, you need alot of money, evangelism need money and every other thing we can think of has element of money except we choose to play down on it.

First your thread should belong to economic discurssion not politics. Secondly I think you are contradicting your statement with the Bible. If you bring up Bible in this context I think that same Bible also said that the love of money is the roots of all evil.

And unfufilled dream. I think most successful people were not dependent on government only few are civil servant like %30 while the rest are%70 that is to show you that majority of people are self employed or self dependant.",

Everyone needs to strive for it by doing some work and get paid for it. Without money, your life will be meaningless and won’t be valued among people that have money. Having multiple source of income is the best and with that you can attain financial stability quicker. Too much money should not be referred to as financial stability, but rather having the contentment of yourself with the little you’ve been provided with is financial stability.",

Some people have died due to some health issues and their inability to raise money for their treatment; some parents who had the zeal to train their children in higher institutions dropped that dream because they had little money that wasn't enough to fund their children's future careers; some people have a lot of business strategies running through their minds but there is no money to extinguish their plans. So, yeah, everyone needs to be financially stable, but in a society, everyone can never be equal because we don't have the same ability or the same sense of reasoning. Some people might choose to eat just a square meal today that they may eat in abundance tomorrow, but some will eat all they have today with the hope that they can take credit tomorrow or that they have hope in someone.",

Then the point is clear that financially stable people don't rely on just one single income and they make sure that they are involved in lucrative business and not just any business. Most of the highly paying businesses are owned by them because they invest hugely not minding the risk involved. They are risk takers who never procrastinate on investment that they have investigated to be genuine and lucrative. The future is always important to be financially stable not to only focuse on today or the short time.",

That is a worldly say and not of God. So what you are trying to say that with money everything is possible, a big NO. It is only God that can do everything and not fiat that is made by man. Can money raise the dead or give you internal peace and happiness. Pls don't misquote the word of God especially when it comes to money. It is good to have money so that you can get whatever investment and business that you want to venture into and use exotics cars but let it be gotten in a right way. This is when you will be very happy and peaceful with your wealth.You don't need to look for money to start up any business, you can easily learn a skill and look for a second means of income for yourself do that you can have enough for yourself and if possible also invest into bitcoin.",

A few verses before and after:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/ecclesiastes/10.htm18Through laziness, the rafters sag;because of idle hands, the house leaks.19A feast is made for laughter,wine makes life merry,and money is the answer for everything.20Do not revile the king even in your thoughts,or curse the rich in your bedroom,because a bird in the sky may carry your words,and a bird on the wing may report what you say.Ecclesiastes is all about the uselessness of life. People die, and all their hopes and dreams are gone... at least for them, even if their children get some benefit.After a few years, a dead person is forgotten. The name might be remembered for a while. There might be pictures. But in a generation or two after he dies, the kind of person that a person is in life will be forgotten.In America, many people have heard of Thomas Jefferson. Many people have seen pictures (paintings) of him. But if we didn't have some of his writings and books, we wouldn't have a clue what he really was like. And even the writings and books aren't as clear as we would have if he were alive and present.The point is, verse 19 is a tongue-in-cheek saying. It means almost the opposite of what it says, because people in life find out that money isn't the answer for everything.

Too much work at once can have a negative impact on your health, thus it is best to prioritise your health before looking for a way to be financially stable.

It will probably never be derogated and replaced with other kind of system to conduct transactions. Also, it is interesting how many people and priests out there talk about the love of money and how to be aware of it, but in the end they manage to collect millions or dollars from gullible people who are willing to make donations in exchange of prayers and divine favors. Jesus himself told us that many wolves in sheep clothing would come and use his name falsely. Anyways, it is a very complex topic and we could debate about it for days and days ...",

It is important to learn additional skills or get another job as your expenses increase. But life is not all about money. If one can be able to provide for his basic needs, I think he is financially stable. You don't need to work like a machine because you want to satisfy maybe a want or luxury. Ensure you work within your strength and ability and spend quality time resting. Also ensure that you take care of your health by eating healthy food, going for exercise, and medical checkups. Learn how to live below your means and be contented with what you have at the time. Spend quality time on activities that are not expensive but bring joy and satisfaction. Spending time with my family is worth more than expensive vacations. I want to also add that there will be no time you can conclude that one is financially stable because the more money we come across the more expenses we get. So there is a need to be content at all times regardless of how much you own. Quote from: Peter Faith on November 06, 2023, 11:57:18 AMso you mean we should sit-down fold our hands and do nothing because Jesus asked someone to sell off all he has to enter into kingdom of God? But same Bible said that God will bless the works of our hands so what are you sayingJesus never told us not to work because He knows that we need money to survive in this present world. The parable about the rich man that Jesus told to sell all he has was a lesson that teaches us not love or trust in earthly possessions.",
