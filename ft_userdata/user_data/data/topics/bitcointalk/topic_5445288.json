You got a catchy UI and your website is good with a touch of excellence.It is nice you already have a license to operate but where is your casino operating from because there have been a case where a casino got a Curacao license and was operating from Canada.  I did go through your kyc policy is it that you do not have specific amount of withdrawal that would attract kyc for gamblers or any withdrawal would require gamblers to do kyc as I am curious to know that. It does not augur well with gamblers. As a matter of fact you would have strong competitors to contend with here and for that being said, advertisement and publicity is the option which you can contact @Royse777 for a promotional campaign which he has the capability and reputation to handle onboard this platform.Once again, you are welcome onboard.",

      "body": "What does it mean when you say in your Terms & Conditions that the no-wagering welcome bonus is not withdrawable and remains sticky? When the player requests a withdrawal, the bonus will be forfeited. I am talking about point 2.5 of your Bonus T&C.As an example: I deposit $100, claim the no-wagering bonus and have a total of $475. I wager my deposits 5x (or whatever you deem fit), and then when I want to withdraw, you remove the matched bonus ($375) from my account. Can you explain this in more details? If I understood correctly, you can apply any wagering requirement you feel like for any deposits to the casino? That seems a bit weird. Quotewe reserve the right to apply a wagering requirement of at least 5 (five) times the deposit amount at our sole discretion  https://www.royalstarscasino.com/en/info/bonus-termsIf it's \"at least 5 times\", then what is the standard norm?",

That makes it sound that the rollover requirements are up to 5x with 5 being the maximum. 5x is the minimum, meaning it's at least five and can be 6, 10, 20, or what the casino deems appropriate. Here is the thing though. Their main T&C mention that the wagering requirements are 1x. QuotePlease note that you have to wager deposited funds in a 1:1 ratio.https://www.royalstarscasino.com/en/info/terms-and-conditionsBut a few sentences later, they say the same thing as in their Bonus T&C.QuoteWe reserve the right to apply a wagering requirement of at least 5 (five) times the deposit amount at our sole discretion...I would like to know why that is and what it depends on?
