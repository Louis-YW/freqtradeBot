The problem is the developer, if you buy from him you will get a platform that looks good but has a lot of bugs and is nowhere near ready to be used as a finished product, he will try to upsell you bug fixes, new features, promotional casino videos etc...I highly advise you or anyone else to not buy from him, I'm actually thinking of leaking all 3 of his versions or find a developer that can take his work up and fix it if he continues to behave like that.",

I think the guy on telegram is only a salesperson (he also speaks russian) the platform has probably been made by some underpaid russian developers and the guy on telegram made a website and sells it for 2.000$ (it was 1800$ for the basic versione and 3500$ for the pro version before).",

It's a good and cheap code to get if you want to build on top of it. Thanks for the answer, at this point I'm convinced there was a 3rd party who made this and seems like there's no way to reach out to them.",

And I also think that it will be huge too.",

I guess it's just ideas and the buyers are the ones who have to spend money to experiment for the seller",
