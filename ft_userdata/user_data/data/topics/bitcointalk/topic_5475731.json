As at the year 2021 zugacoin was the most expensive coin in the history of Crypto currency, which worth beyond the price of bitcoin at about $285,677 clamouring for $450k then. I was thinking that how possible is it that a coin could be over expensive compeard to the first Crypto currency?

It's only listed on one exchange and the volume now was completely dead together with its price. I think this was all done by the developers that made them attracted a lot of fools that have rode the hype that they've made. When it's projects like this that goes as high as they can, it's just a crazy pump and dump scheme made by the devs. Look now, it's almost dead.",

As you have tried explaining Bitcoin cannot be compared to any other coins and moreover these coins which are pumped just to be rug pulled, this is not the first such coins and there are other coins with good marketcap and listed on exchanges like Binance couldn't sustain then how come Zuga coin even had a chance. I am talking ab out YFI which touched $95000 during it's peak in May 2021 is trending at $9k now even after being a coin which was adopted by users had a good volume. It's upto people that they should learn from the past and shouldn't jump into suspective coins.",

Reason is that it was an obvious scam that no one had heard of. Reason why it was \"expensive\" is an easy trick. Anyone can make a token with price movenent like that. Just distribute token you are making to your own walelts, trade them in dex from wallet to wallet to create fake volume. If you want more volume, choose a chain that has cheap tx fees. Keep doing that and some newbs see it as a real legit token they buy into. Remove any of your own liquidity if you had any and and start selling. If people panic sell their tokens to you in dirt price, you can do it once again. After you get bored, just slowly leave the project.",

Well, it wasn't meant to be up there in the first place. The ATH you saw was a glitch. Sam Zuga cleverly scammed church-believing and ignorant investors with his Zugacoin. Most of those who invested weren't even interested in researching what was in the white paper of the shitcoin. I knew it was going to end as a scam from the beginning. The signs were glaring. For one, people should steer clear of any crypto project that oozes religion. Cryptocurrencies and religion don't go hand in hand. Anyone who tries to market a project to you and highlights or tells you the developers/creators/teams are christians or Muslims, know it's a scam waiting to happen.BTW, it's abominable to compare Bitcoin with Zugacoin.",

I went ahead and checked this coin listing on coinmarketcap and found out that in 2021 it did pump. I guess it was because in 2021 we were having a bull run and at that time Bitcoin was creating a new ATH. That might be the reason this coin pumped to 200k level in the month of June. For now, I do not see good volume so it looks like this coin was used to trap innocent investors with the belief that it would pump more. In all probable scenarios looking at the present price, the founders have sold their coins and left it.",

Seems like it was artificially pumped and rug-pulled at some point, it had that huge price just for a few months. The rest is just a low red line.I have never heard of it as well. It is an artificial pump and this is common in the altcoins market wherein the project owners do something like this to get the attention of other investors that are looking for quick cash grab. Those that have been victimized by this will have hard time in recovering their money and it will be stuck on this token. People should just stop comparing Bitcoin with any random altcoin that don't have a name yet. Having a high price doesn't mean that it can beat Bitcoin. Comparing it to the stability and influence of Bitcoin in the market, there is no doubt that no matter how many times it's been compared to many altcoins because of their prices, it is still the most preferred cryptocurrency of the majority.So, if you see the same coin as zugacoin, there could be other developers that might try to do this to get easy money from fool and gullible investors.",

I thought, this is the coin I heard about at the time. Well, this proves that a large price is not a benchmark for beating bitcoin. Additionally, I think this coin is overpriced, even for an unknown coin. I assume that not many will be interested in such a coin, and we can see that its very high price in the past has become a waste. in fact, it may just be a bubble created to attract new investors.",

The Seller and the Buyer are the same person and they are just making this scenario to make the newbie investors that their coin is expensive but in reality, they are just sugar-coating their coins and it is not really expensive because it has no liquidity to start with.

YFI got so much hype at that time that its price shot up above bitcoin and stayed there for sometimes. Actually the price of a crypto can not determine its value as a project that has 10 times lower supply than bitcoin and still has a massive community and investors. Its price can shoot up above bitcoin's price easily. It doesn't even need a massive community to shoot the price, a low-supply coin can easily be manipulated by the team and a few whales. A project's value depends on its long term performance.",

It was clear from the onset that the Zugacoin team was simply going to rugpull in the end. Zugacoin gave me the Billion Coin (TBC) vibes. TBC was hyped to be worth more than 8 Bitcoin's (1 TBC == 8 BTC) but local sellers were selling it for less than $0.3 each so it didn't add up. That's why I didn't own any of them at any point in time.People simply forget: If 1 zugacoin is $450k like OP mentioned, who is going to be at the other end to buy a $450k shitcoin? Projects like Zugacoin simply targets new and unsuspecting crypto users and it's just unfortunate that these scammers always get away with it.",
