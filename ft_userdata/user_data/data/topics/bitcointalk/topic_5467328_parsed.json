  "content": "So..For the past 2 months I've played on xfun.bet. I won some, I lost some money but I experienced a lot of trouble off swapping xfun to fun. It took 2-3 days every time while it should be instant.In the telegram group of funtoken, they even told me to wait, because its weekend... On the live chat of xfun.bet they told me its not xfun its dplay casino.... I didn't know what to do. Also the layer on the xfun website didn't had any funds left, so I decided to cashout all my funds.But now I am waiting.. and waiting, and I had a contact named Shyla on Telegram. She promised me yesterday it would be processed, and then it was today... and now she says there is a issue with the bridge???It's all excuses, to not pay me. I just try to understand why Funtoken holds my money every time for 2-3 days, and now I try to cashout al my xfun, they just tell me there is a issue? And not pay me?That's not legal.I don't want to file a police report, or spread all the information with tx hash online... I could do that, but I rather have this solved since I loved playing on xfun.bet and my funds where (late) but credited in the past.This transactions should be instant, but somehow.. swapping the other way around (fun-> xfun) never brought up any problems.Now it feels like a exit scam... because I told them I don't want to play there anymore.They even blocked me from the funtoken channel.... that ain't normal. I did not say anything bad.Can somebody help me ??",

      "body": "I have added correct links to the images the OP posted. The chat can be seen inside the thread now without the need for visiting external links and they should provide clarity over what was being communicated via the chat.It is important for them to have chatted with the OP in a timely manner even if they sent messages to update stating \"we are still waiting for news and will update you as soon as we can\". I think for the chat operators to go in to total silence-mode will be seen as unprofessional . If you read through, you will notice the OP was getting frustrated towards the end but when it comes to $25,000 that was bound to happen when he was not even being told something simple such as an estimated time.I hope they manage to resolve this as soon as possible because it is not nice to be in limbo, not even knowing if will see any of that money.==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================",

Although i would advice to share all screenshots the OP made, from platform/in-app chats, platform transactions. Also, i would suggest you to file a police report for them to alarm and make you prioritize. Filing a report doesn't mean you're defaming them or what, it's your right after having a bad experience for days and obviously feel like you scammed.",
