I just try to buy at the bottom and waiting until my sell orders will be eaten once the pump will be coming out. The day for trading signal has gone and i never used the trading signal. I just do it by myself. Mostly of trading signals were scam but i have a question about that. Was it a mandatory mentioning your trading signal here? It's better if you can do it by yourself but it seems like that you are not feeling worried to be scammed by the trading signal caused by mostly of trading signal was foolowing their followers by giving opposite signal. I thought that if trading signal already gone lol.",

Take the time out of your day to look over charts and analyze the market so you can develop a strategy, but then go back to your normal job. You don't have to trade every day, but at least set aside a few minutes each day to keep an eye on the market and make sure you're not missing out on a big opportunity. It all depends on how much time you have and how much money you want to put into it. Start with small amounts of money and work up to larger amounts.",

Or you can become an investor who holds coins in the long term that will be very helpful in my opinion. Because it is not easy to divide your time when you have obligations to the company where you work. Do not let things like this make your obligations neglected. I'm sure if you can manage your time well, then you can trade without having to disturb your work and rest time. If you get 2 days off a week you can use a day off to start trading. And I must remind you, you also have to set the time for how long you will trade, don't let your rest time be disturbed too.",

I have not used any indicators that much except from what Binance provided us like Bollinger Band and RSI. Not sure if people still use those but yeah. Turned out to be shit since I was too focused to what the tutorial wanted me to do and not entirely my own decision and yes, it is entirely my fault from what happened from that.Just sharing my experience so yeah!",

For example, you can work at your main job and trade during one of the sessions that happens outside of working hours, such as the Asian or American trading sessions. If you try to trade during working hours, it will have a negative effect on your work and your deposit, because trading requires a lot of attention and cold-bloodedness.",

I think that over time you will increase the trading interval, because it is very tiring. Sometimes a simple hodling brings much more profit than various trading strategies, but most people do not have the patience to buy and do nothing.",

If there is anyone able to do that, it must be that his/her job is not very demanding, in other words, he/she has a lot of free time to burn on the job, and he might as well utilize that time trading.I think for you to be really successful in trading, it is better to be fully committed, that is making it a full-time job with no distractions.",

Therefore, the return from daily trading will be easy because you collect 100 dollars a month, and it is impossible to collect it daily (in the normal situation).",

I just put pending orders and leave the screen and go back to my job. You just have to organize your time and to develop your trading plan and the currency pairs that you will trade and your strategy and allocate some of your rest time to monitoring your trades. The matter only takes a few minutes of certainty that you will not spend the whole day looking at the screen or searching for opportunities and looking at the chart and your orders and deals. For me, it did not take long, and of course, the situation of each person differs from the other and differs from one job to another, only with time you will adapt between your full job and your daily trading. You should know that a good trader does not exaggerate in trading and entering deals. He waits and waits.",

But yes, it still doing well. As we are in this situation, we have to manage our time wisely as trading needs focus and I would suggest just trading if you have ample of time to set in front of your computer, during a break, or on a day off. The longer time you spend on the market can give you a way to analyze the movement of the market which is a huge advantage.",
