  "content": "Fortunejack humiliated me greatly today!This is the behavior of the latest scammers!I'll describe everything now:I registered at the Fortunejack office. Made a deposit of $1,500. Bookmaker with a very high rating and history.I bet on the total over in the German championship. I won. After which I wanted to withdraw part of the winnings.On October 30, I made a withdrawal request.That same day I received a mailstating that I needed to undergo their identity verification. I passed this.On October 31, I received a mail \"We ask you to confirm that it was you who requested the withdrawal.\"i confirmed and my funds were withdrawn. I logged into my account, realized that I wouldn’t place any bets today and logout.because I like to bet only on top leagues; there were no top matches in the middle of the week. I didn't place any bets. Moreover, I didn’t even log into my account.Today, November 3rd, I was unable to log into my account!In the support chat they wrote to me that your account is linked to some other account, so it was blocked!I also asked a question - when my account was blocked - they answered that on November 3 at 05-00.  https://prnt.sc/X3y73O3BPn9uThe most important thing is that my money in my account was stolen silently! I didn't receive any letters. Even now I have not received a single letter with an explanation!!!All I received in response was a response from technical support - your account is recognized as a multi-account and this is the last solution!!! ALL!!!No dialogue! Nothing!I checked my spam folder, nothing!Fortunejack! Have YOU gone completely crazy! What kind of behavior is this???in the support chat and in the only response letter, support uses the phrase “this is the last decision”Why do you say that if you didn’t even send any notifications about your decision?To be honest, I'm 99% sure that they have some kind of confusion there. And my account was blocked by mistake! It is highly likely that my account was blocked by mistake! But at the moment there is nothing that can be done. Support is ignoring me! They quietly stole my $1,500 and remain silent!I see that a company representative is answering questions here and I hope for his help! What happened? Why are you doing this to me? No notifications! They quietly stole my money! And they don't answer anything else...",

If you've broken some kind of their rules it will be also clarified here.You've registered today, which shows that you're using the forum to elaborate on this case and as the last option to get funds back.",

Use a public Wi-Fi service or used the same device with your family members to access fortunejack?There could be a reason they are suggesting you have multiple accounts and we are trying to find out why.VPN always works on my computer to bypass censorship within the country.As I already wrote, my account passed the security check and I didn’t use it anymore for 4 days! I refuse to believe that someone registered an account with the same IP as mine in the middle of the week! This coincidence is simply impossible!What frightens me even more is the speed with which my money was stolen. I am sure that there are various methods of identity verification on the Fortunejack website. The IP address cannot in any way indicate a multi-account, for example, many public restaurants with the same Wi-Fi. In this case, there would be constant blocking.But why did Fortunjack act this way???Normal behavior when blocking an account is a sequential procedure:1. the bookmaker must send a letter of suspicion2. should offer to explain such coincidences3. investigation that compares accounts4. announcement of the resultBut they treated me without all this!The bookmaker just stole my money! I have a large account balance of $1,500, but they don’t even want to talk to me!Today I received a letter in which Fortunejack wrote for the first time the reason for blocking my account (the day after it was blocked) - That there is a \"Knightonhorseback\" account and that they saw its connection with my account, so they blocked all my money on the account! And since I had already withdrawn some of the money earlier, they don’t owe me anything anymore!Fortunejack, why weren't these accounts checked?because This is 100% not my account, I am sure that there simply could not be any connection with my account! Why was my money stolen so quickly?I ask users with a great reputation on this forum to write a private message to the Fortunejack representative on this forum. Let him join our conversation. This is my only chance to figure this issue out!",

Since my account was blocked, I have been simply ignored.

Why does it work this way?I was fully verified on my first withdrawal! What happened then???No comments!It's just that your account is blocked due to communication with someone else! What about the investigation?I'm sitting in shock! I got kicked in the ass. And what are the options for an honest investigation???",

It gives a chance to make someone else access the site with the same IP, though usually gambling platform uses several data point to determine multi-acc abuse.I read that you've passed KYC. If \"knightonhorseback\" was also KYCed and proven to be different people, it might help your case. Let me try to contact FJ's representative to hear more from them. Meanwhile, I'd like to know more from your side. You're using VPN to bypass your country's restriction, where are you accessing the site from? And second, I don't quite understand, have you withdrawn all of the fund from your account or are there some fund left on it?",

Following the win, OP completed the Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and withdrew the initial deposit amount from the winnings, leaving the rest in the account balance.Up to this point, there was nothing unusual about the account activity.

And passed the verification again?I would like to ask a question - what is the activity on the second account? What is the deposit? What are the bets?But the most important question is that when I went through verification, it included photographing documents with a camera + photographing myself. Fortunejack, could you please post these photos??? + post the photos that were taken to verify my account, this is important!I give permission to publish these photos!Can you do it?I think Fortunejack is a very decent bookmaker. But now he wants to convince me that I'm an idiot! I simply could not and did not verify the second account!Can I ask Fortunejack to compare photos of these two accounts? Is there a possibility that there was some kind of glitch in your system and my documents were copied to someone else’s account folder? That would explain everything! I also wonder what behavior the owner of that second account has. Is he trying to argue with you? Something tells me that that person also suffered due to a technical glitch in your security system!",
