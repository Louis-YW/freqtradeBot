P2P exchange is only valid when people are actually in a community which has well established Bitcoin ecosystem and are also keen on communicating as well, but at the end of the day one might understand the fact that these exchanges does provide not only competitive exchange but they also offer trading into other cryptocurrencies as well which makes the whole situation much better for the majority of people. Ofcourse undoubtedly with p2p exchange you can not only keep you Bitcoins more private but you can also get better value sometimes since you won't have to pay extra fee everywhere.",

Especially if you are trading with newbies in peer to peer, risk will be higher.Peer to peer trading by Bitcoin is safe also because of risk of reverse transactions is small and impossible. Cost to reverse blocks and reverse transactions that have more than 3 confirmations is very high. So it is not realistic to bet with attack and reverse transactions on the network.https://www.crypto51.app/https://howmanyconfs.com/",

If you Advice everyone to switch to P2P, how about the professional day traders?, trading on a P2P market can never be fast and liquid as trading on spot, margin/features market on exchanges, A significant change in price of Bitcoin can be experienced in the one minute or two you spend waiting for the other party to transfer funds, and this can lead to some unwarranted loss. It is true what you said that P2P was the original vision Satoshi had in terms of Bitcoin transactions, But also do not forget that Satoshi did not expect that Bitcoin to be this successful as it is today, and i also believe that if Satoshi was still with the Community, he or they would have updated the whitepaper by now.",

If you read how the technology works, you will understand both (though bisq more so) are basically completely safe against scam attempts from either side of the trade.P2P is indeed the way to go, the way satoshi intended Bitcoin to be used* and the most secure, private and anonymous way to acquire or sell Bitcoin.*The whitepaper talks about Bitcoin as P2P money, and doesn't mention exchanges at all. That's why I say he envisioned people using Bitcoin peer to peer. For me, that includes selling or buying it. Also keep in mind satoshi is not a god and not everything he said or claimed must (forever) hold true. Even if we disregard 'what his vision was', it still stands that objectively, a good anonymous, no-KYC peer to peer platform like the two I recommend, is the most secure, private and anonymous way to acquire or sell Bitcoin.",
