Like it's gonna pop when you visit them and there goes the icons in front of me like walletconnect, Metamask, etc. Aside from that red flag, the duration of its existence is obviously made just to phish unaware users.Quote from: TravelMug on October 17, 2023, 03:54:19 AMAlso report here: https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/?hl=en.

And if one sites goes down because of crypto enthusiast reporting it, another one will pop up.And maybe the problem lies to this domain registrar though as they are very relax in accepting anyone.So everyone, we need to just be on the look out. And then report it right away if we find some phishing sites. And don't trust Google if we wanted to search about crypto related things.",

One hard wallet for just holding purpose and never connecting with online dapps. The other one I used for airdrops which needed wallet connect but I am holding only small fee in some chains. I connect only to those site I remembered that I did airdrop. The third one is empty wallet used to check new sites for connecting wallet. If we doesn't connect our main wallet then no worry about these phising sites.",

I havent checked the same myself though, being an extension it still works both the roles of a Ethereum wallet and a Security guard.It might be difficult for a newbie to understand this type of scam because its new and seems benign and they might connect their wallet to this website. So anybody reading this should be warned from doing the same.Websites which look like/sound like popular websites should be double-triple checked for legitimacy.",

Hence, they search for sites that provide the correct guessed words daily or ask for help from strangers to be eligible to win the game after five wins, and so that they become among the participants who will get a reward for a share of 500K Binance Points. Hence, scammers take advantage of their interest in collecting these words and create phishing sites like the one mentioned by the OP. I do not see that even a game reward with hundreds of thousands of participants would be of great importance and value for these Binance customers to put their accounts and wallets at significant risk.",

Usually, you can come across these phishing links if you simply search them through Google. Google is known for not filtering these scam and phishing websites and that's why if you just search for some keywords that they're using for their SEO, they're going to appear in the first result. I've come across with many of these from search engines and as well as in social medias and that's why they will never stop no matter how we keep up and monitor these. The problem is the platform itself is allowing these to exist because they are getting paid and that's the thing for them and not for the welfare of many of their users that can be potentially a victim of these scams. Anyway, they have come across as well with a solution but we need to cooperate with them by reporting these scam/phishing links.",
