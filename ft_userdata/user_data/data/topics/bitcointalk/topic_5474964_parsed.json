  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk Community,I'm reaching out to gather insights on the most reliable and efficient firmware options for Whatsminer mining machines. My primary goal is to optimize performance and stability.Could anyone share their experiences or recommendations regarding:Firmware Versions: Which firmware versions have you found most effective for models like M3x, M5x, or the M30 series?Performance Improvements: Have you noticed significant improvements in hash rate, efficiency, or stability with certain firmware?Sources: Are there any specific sources or websites you trust for downloading firmware updates?Overclocking: For those who have tried overclocking with custom firmware, what has been your experience in terms of benefits and risks?Troubleshooting: Any common issues or tips for a smooth firmware update process?I appreciate any guidance or personal experiences you can share. This information will be extremely helpful  to maximize the potential of our Whatsminer rigs.Thank you in advance!",

      "body": "To optimize firmware for these units always use the latest firmware from whatsminer and I don't think there is a modded firmware for these units.About the performance you can use miner tools to change the performance mode from low to high, it would improve the hashrate if you set it high but it requires 230v and power efficiency for low performance.Please check the link below on how to use the miner tools.- https://www.zeusbtc.com/articles/asic-miner-troubleshooting/2154-whatsminer-tool-remote-ctrl-button-function-and-purposeAbout the source where to download firmware for Whatsminer download it directly on the Whatsminer link below- https://www.whatsminer.com/src/views/firmware-download.html",

That is why stock firmware is recommend you can find it from the link that I provided above but make sure to check the current version of your unit before flashing to the latest version.",

Is this a common problem? How can I solve this it’s happening with two of my m30s+ whatsminers.Why are doing the sdcard flashing in the first place? use the latest Whatsminer Tool version 9.x , download the latest firmware version which is 2024xxx, and add your miner IP or IP range, the miner will show in the tool GUI, select it and then hit the \"upgrade\" button, select the firmware while which you have downloaded, then hit \"start upgrade\", it would take a few minutes, the miner status will display \"transferrin\" then \"upgrading\" after 3-5 minutes, the miner will be loaded with the new firmware, it may reboot a few times in the process, do not cut the power.",

You can only find the terminals when you disassemble the unit the SD card slot can be found under the control board check the image belowFocus on that part resolder it or clean it with isopropyl alcohol also check the slot for any possible dirt inside clean it and then try to plug and replug the SD card multiple times to help remove a bit of rust from the terminal inside the SD slot then reflash it again.",
