I am very disappointed with Team Fox.Do not talk like a fool hunters. We all work as bounty hunters and this is true when a project get scammed , we feel bad and blame the bounty manager. But bounty manager has nothing to do. If we talk about rebaseapy bounty , this project was ran from two bounty mananger . And both of the bounty manager get scammed because the Rebaseapy team is a scammer and they run away before the distribution time comes. So where is the bounty manager fault? If you talk about Metakiller bounty , the FOX campaign run that for one weeks because after one weeks the team tried to contact with the metakiller team , but they did not answer them. This is why fox team stopped the campaign and everything were mentioned in the FOX group, so why you are complaining here now? Cryptocowboy payment? That will be paid too as there everyone accept the issue, why do you goes against the rule? In fact, you are not respecting the bounty manager. I don''t know who you are but being a bounty manager is not easy. If you think this is easy to be a bounty¬† and bounty manager earn a lot money. Just go and try to be a bounty manager. You will give up within a weeks.",

I don't understand what kind of mentality you faced last time when you said 8k USD big to the manager.¬† Did the manager even said they will take the 8k USD and fade away? They create poll and heard¬† review from participants to run or not. But you are putting opinion to the BM that they will stole 8k USD. This is funny! I can see you are doing a signature campaign under a BM.¬† So if you think 8k usd nothing to you, why do you do signature?¬† Use your billion USD to do business.I believe you are now in this position from a newbies account to legendary account now. Please respect everyone and remember your past position!",
