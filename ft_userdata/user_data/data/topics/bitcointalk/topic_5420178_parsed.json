  "content": "I use to almost never ever ever see this, but I swear since they been hating on crypto I see it more, begging for donations. After the 6th time I felt compelled to share my experience here. Shame on Wiki. Shame on Molly White.https://mashable.com/article/wikipedia-wikimedia-cryptocurrency-donations\"Molly White\" really hates crypto and claims to be a developer. But really she is just the daughter of a book writer charlotte's web and just lives on wikipedia.So they are so against crypto they don't even want to accept it as payment.Wiki is great, seems like they should be a platform that DOES accept this type of money. Makes 0 sense. https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/12/wikipedia-faces-pressure-to-stop-accepting-crypto-donations-on-environmental-grounds/But now I see this stupid banner asking me to donate a lot more, and to be honest I haven't seen that thing in well over a year until recently it keeps coming up on a lot of my searches when I click wiki links.",

      "body": "It's weird that Molly White is skeptical of cryptocurrency but runs a website about Web 3.0. Isn't that already a conflict? Or is she just funding the site or something? But it's okay to have critics like her to be eye-ing on cryptocurrency. Since the donations of cryptocurrency are just 0.08%, according to your sources, it just doesn't make enough, and Wikipedia is probably receiving backlash if they continue to accept it or something.",

      "body": "I don't think it has anything to do with not accepting bitcoin donations. If I'm not mistaken the amount of donations in bitcoin weren't the biggest percentage in the total donations they'd received.That may be because of the inflation + recession that most of the world has been facing after the pandemic and mostly over the past year, even more so after the invasion of Ukraine. On one hand the costs are rising for Wikipedia owners so they need more money; on the other hand cost of living is rising for people so they have no money to \"donate\" to a website they rarely visit or buy their product; ergo Wikipedia's income is decreasing and they are forced to beg for more donations.",
