  "content": "They started journey of their project with bridge testing and give a false statement they will paid early testers!Ok all ok they started with all and got participants list and they stated a statement they will launch on 20th and give payment to early tester! After that in 20th 11 pm Est they said there need a verification for tester and give a opportunity to complete kyc and claim in 24hours!! Who the hell project give claiming task complete kyc and claim in one days where participants was like 50000 or less. If kyc start with even a bot is it easy to take this pressure in one days and claim in 1 days? Ok its as usual on their website too much traffic and kyc reject in for every users normally and its takes pending even after 7-8 hours after that reject! On their tdx kyc platform!!  Ok when you complete your kyc you need to go a poor claim link where is also more than too much traffic in loadin and failed ok in this situation they promise their claim period will last 24 hours but afte 7-8 hours they block their contract and they stopped talking with anyone and started lots of ban on their discord. Also they mute their telegram even this claiming conception start!! On after deactivate their contract they comes with a false statement after 10 hours :Some of spammers spamming using same email and go through direct contract for claim!! Is it possible? I dont think their is only one gmail can claim one address with kyc. If it is not then whose falut is that its their system falut or they are not able to develop a claiming function how people can claim their money. And they suddenly stop their claim contrat and they come back in two to three hours before ending of claiming period all faults to scammers!! Lol if it is that then how they works we already can guess may be they are first project who give tester a claiming option of token!! Lol all credit goes for them scammers!! Ok  if scammers can scammed them in only simple claiming option is there any sureity where scammers cant scamm on their bridge thats my point/?After all of them they started their telgram and discord with their own people!Last statement and comes after long time end lol not even activated contract or solutionsError claimHow they deactivated contract! After 8 hours they decativated when some of people done kyc!Their coinmarketcap situation nowAt last i am saying if you cant control a caliming function how you control this hard process where need trust and security? Also if scammer started scamm and what real people done? If a project started with lie and fake promise and a drama what can they do in future? They wanted to do like others popular dex or bridge and using a hidden trick of scamme as people dont know or understand anything!! In this whole method they took people trust, people kyc, and insist to login their webstie again and again for start claim function!!",
