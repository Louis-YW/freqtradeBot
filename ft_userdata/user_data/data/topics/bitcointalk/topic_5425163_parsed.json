Surely, The trend might not happen again but I believe Star atlas will still rise given that they have a lot of following and their current releases is outstanding. I believe that they are the best right now in terms of graphics quality in play to earn game. I've seen their game and yes it is not finished yet but the graphics is on par on triple A non-crypto games. Maybe some big investors bought Atlas and Polis that's why their prices is soaring now.",

When i read the title of this thread i was expecting to see that Polis did a x5 or so within a very short amount of time or something. I just checked and it \"only\" went up like 22% in the last 24 hours. Of course this is still a great development, because we are in a deep bear market at the moment, but i still expected more.I also thought about investing into Polis a few weeks ago and so far i didn't do it because i invested in another project but i think just because it went up 20% now does not mean that it is too late to invest into Polis now. It's ATH was at more than 10 $ per token so we are still in a very good buy range in my opinion. Maybe i buy a few myself too.",

I think that you shall aware with overall chart and it has been dumping so hard from 30 cents to the 003 which has been proving that this project was bad. This was short term pump. As far as i know if this project didn't have good development result. The minigame that already made was only a way for the team to fool people. There are some rumours about partnership and game that will be rolling out. that might become the main reasons that triggering the price to be pumped",

      "body": "There are other Altcoins pumping not just Star Atlas. Part of the reason is that Bitcoin is basically moving sideways and market cap dominance is still very very low. So many tokens that have reached all time lows in November are bouncing back furiously, and Star Atlas is of course one of these. The thing is once a project starts going up and up FOMO spreads and fans of the project ( such as myself ) that had a small stake on it get optimistic and jump in. Outsiders follow and this creates an avalanche of new investors into the project, which in this case was very good to begin with. So unlike Shiba, this project is arguably the best game we've seen in crypto so far and we get regular updates on what is happening with the ecosystem and it's development. So the transparency is one thing that is driving people away from DeFi now and into GameFi. I see the same thing happening with Illuvium with regular updates and lots of fan engagement so even though at the bottom of the bear market people still want to buy into a project that may be huge in 2024 - 2025.",

If some project is solely dependent on an investor or player who is mainly on the project because of the money, it won't be long last. The way for GameFi to thrive is to build a playful game with a long-term concept in mind. And that project must have a thorough game design to make the player stays in the game. If we talk about longevity, transparency within GameFi has lesser significance compared to the entertainment of the game itself. What is the point of the game being trustful, but it's not having and attracting any player.",

I am 99.99% sure that you are not a shill because why would star atlas need a shiller on bitcointalk, they are much bigger than that, they got funded millions and millions of dollars so they don't need it. However, it is also true that the people at the helm are geeks and nothing more, which means there is a chance they could build a great game one day, if they can afford to build it with the right people, which costs a lot of money, but at the same time we are talking about nobody that understands about marketing. That is why there are these increases in price time to time, because they see a drop, and remember marketing could help, do it once, go up in price, then forget about it again.",

This is just like a normal scenario for a hyped project, this will be good for short term because whales will start to play with it and dump it later on. If you are able to enter and have the opportunity to buy at a cheaper price then grab some, just do profit talking once you already have the opportunity to do so. There’s a lot of money with this project, i wonder what would be the next trend after this big pump, so lets see if they can keep this momentum up.",

Many people got out, and they are in cash and they could do whatever they please with it. And as we all can guess, it is not an easy thing to just keep it in control forever, it could cause a lot of trouble for many people if it goes directly to one project for a pump and dump. This doesn't mean that Star Atlas had a pump and dump, but it also means that it wasn't one neither, it could be anything and any project.

If atlas was sustailable enough and it will never have a horrible chart like that. It goes from above 15 cents to the 0.003 USD. This is pretty much the same like a soft rugpull token lol. The same problem faced by SLP as it was being minted without any limit. The price has been crashing so hard. I didn't know why those scammy developers were getting bunch of money while they can't even think a proper tokenomic mechanism that will not be triggering the inflation. It seems like the game being made by developers just for money. The team behind atlas were not even making a proper game. People over reacted with alpha drop. It 's slowly dumping again now.",
