      "body": "Yes, absolutely.Bitcoin's goal from the beginning was to create a means of online transacting for people who could not use an ordinary bank. Before Bitcoin there were credit cards, wire transfers, PayPal, and so forth. Bitcoin was not designed to replace those things, as it's design is necessarily more expensive, slower, and more cumbersome to use.Instead Bitcoin was design for the very specific need of allowing transactions that could not be subpoenaed by a government, and/or modified or intercepted by a government.That's it. That's all Bitcoin--and the blockchain architecture--was originally designed to solve.Subsequently, people did three things:1. They imagined Bitcoin would be used for other things, e.g. replacing mainstream transactions, which it has not and cannot.2. They used Bitcoin as an investment instrument, which today is the primary use of Bitcoin. 3. They learned that Bitcoin by itself is a poor system for evading the government because of it's public ledger, and follow-on products like Monera have now filled that role.Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptos will remain investment instruments, and the technology works perfectly fine for that.Centralized, non-blockchain-based digital currencies will be the future of mainstream transactions, as this architecture will actually scale to the level necessary to replace worldwide everyday transactions.",

Some reports claim that even 93 million Americans now own cryptocurrencies, which is around 40% of all US adults. This is insane and is way more than anyone in the early years would expect.Sadly, the vast majority of all those investors are in it only for profit and often don't have a basic understanding of the technology and their activity is limited to transacting on centralised exchanges. They also don't tend to care too much about anything other than the price, so there's not much discussion about making Bitcoin more usable etc.",

Projects such as DeFi, NFT and many more are just another way of helping other people's lives it only proves that bitcoin technology can be implemented in various kinds of earning.",

We should understand that so many people are after transparency especially where their money is. I think this is why the OP thinks Bitcoin was introduced to fight banks, which is not true. But due to the difference in their attributes you've mentioned, financial institutions (banks) are now feeling less important.

Of course the answer is no; maybe it won't have a high value if that was the purpose of Satoshi Nakamoto's creation.In fact, there are some banks that recognize Bitcoin or include it in their business because of the pros it can contribute to their business concept. It's just that there are others who, when they start looking at Bitcoin in an ugly way, everyone's image will be ugly, even though there are really good benefits to be gained from it.",

The inventor of Bitcoin created it as a peer to peer electronic cash system. I don't see it has deviated from that path! Yes a lot of people also use it as an investment because of its historical price Trend. Bitcoin has out performed every single investment asset out there in the world. So a lot of people prefer Bitcoin to keep as an investment rather than using it as a cash system. That is the beauty of a free market. An asset based on the free market analogy, can become whatever the market decides for it. It is still a cash system if you are willing to use it as one.",

Bitcoin has always been as it still is: a decentralized payment system. It is designed to be an alternative option for anybody who wants to adopt it and improve their financial sovereignty. Quoteand I think it has now moved towards a commodity project for example (DeFi, NFT and etc)That is wrong as well.Bitcoin protocol does not support creating tokens. However, there is an ongoing scam where they lie to people by telling them the arbitrary data they injected in a bitcoin transaction is a \"token\".That doesn't mean Bitcoin has moved in that direction. That just means there is an attack on Bitcoin taking place by exploiting the protocol.Quote~and other cryptocurrencies have changed from their original goals?That's too broad a question to answer. Which cryptocurrency?You see almost all cryptocurrencies aka altcoins had one goal: to get pumped and dumped. And they are useless. Which means they didn't really have a goal to change. They were created to be used as a way for \"gamblers\" to make a profit by playing the market and they did exactly that.But if we define that goal as creating payment systems then yes, altcoins deviated from that path from early days (that is 14 to 15 years ago) and nobody has innovated anything worthy of the name cryptocurrency.",

It was created shortly after the global economic crisis, so the reputation of banks suffered greatly at that point, but people had no choice but to use them (or rely solely on cash, which could be difficult even then in some countries). Bitcoin came in as a way to be your own bank, to manage your own funds which also happen to be independent of any authorities because Bitcoin isn't like fiat. Bitcoin still offers this alternative, even if a lot of people use it differently.",
