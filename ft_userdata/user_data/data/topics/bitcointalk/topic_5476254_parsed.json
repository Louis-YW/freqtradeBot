  "content": "I conveyed my gambling problem/addiction mutiple times, I exhibited clear and obvious signs of problem gambling and BC ignored their responsibilities, license requirements, and laws governing their operation.I contacted my VIP host at BC.game and told him my gambling was out of control, and asked if there was a point to self exclude due to the fact the account was anonymous and couldn’t I just make a new account to get around the exclusion. At this point I had already performed many deposits and withdrawals and my account was still completely anonymous.   He informed me that yes it would be pretty easy to circumvent a self exclusion due to this, he gave me a bonus and no other action was taken, not even to KYC my account or give me a self exclusion.https://imgur.com/a/gz54Mgehttps://imgur.com/a/UfEfjsk   2nd link is for BC to be able to cross reference the amounts and dates since this host has since deleted his accountOn another occasion I contacted my VIP host asking for a free bonus to wager with, and explained I was dealing with the death of 2 people very close to me and that gambling was the only thing that distracted my mind from the grief.  No actions were taken despite this being a clear and obvious sign of problem gambling. https://imgur.com/a/GvuSepOAnother occasion I was conversing with my VIP host at BC.game,  harassing him for a free bonus, as I did numerous times when I ran out of available funds to gamble with.  I explained I was out of funds for a few days and he suggested that I should “chill” and that a little break is always good.  I replied “asking me to take a break from gambling is like asking a meth head to stop smoking meth”   The host replied with a smiley emoji.   No actions were taken.https://imgur.com/a/pInnDliHere is BC.Game (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3592321) stating the hosts have a responibility to pick up on the clues and act.  https://imgur.com/a/DWz9dloAlso of note, is I am in a prohibited location not allowed by the casino (Costa Rica).  I was completely unaware of this until recently when I noticed on AskGamblers and CasinoGuru when viewing BC.Game complaints and error message on their pages said my country is not allowed at this casino.  I am not geo blocked on BC, I have never used a VPN. My IP logs on the site are from Costa Ricahttps://imgur.com/a/G5mR2a2My phone number registered is from Costa Ricahttps://imgur.com/a/2hKmkxgBC.Game stating Costa Rica is a prohibited locationhttps://imgur.com/a/WxvYKrII am not using this as a reason for the claim, or for a reason they should be held liable,   I believe it points to a pattern of behavior.  They had to overlook a lot of things to keep me gambling on their site.They overlooked my clear statements about my gambling problem.  They over looked my general behavior, for example,  the last 60 days my account was open,  I made over 330 different deposits.  They overlooked their license requirement and Curacao AML laws by never asking me to KYC.  Not only did they not KYC me, despite hundreds of millions of dollars in wagers, and millions of dollars passing in and out of my account,  they never even asked me to register my name or birthdate.  All they have is my email.  Not even a date of birth to know that I am of legal age. They overlooked my prohibited location.  Maybe one of these things alone could be an oversight,  but all of them together,  show it was likely intentional.There were numerious times I had thoughts of stopping, but I was constantly losing all my available money, that I became reliant on all the bonuses (daily reloads, weekly, monthly, loss back)  to pay rent and food, etc.  Problem gamblers only consider stopping when they bottom out and lose everything,  but when that happened I always had thousands of dollars of upcoming bonuses coming that I was going to need to pay bills or gamble to get what I needed to pay bills and the cycle would repeat over and over.I tried resolving this directly with the casino.  Only recently after weeks of being ignored, with their renewed effort of transparency and resolving outstanding issues their PR person reached out, and eventually forwarded me to the head of their legal/compliance department.  When they provided the contact info (TG name)  I recognized it from a complaint thread here that I read.  He made a post shilling for BC without disclosing his affiliation with the casino.  His remarks in the post didn't encourage me at all that there would be a resolution due to him referring to \"salty degens crying about losing\"    BC confirmed it was his post and admitted it was a bad look.  I don't think this is nefarious or anything like that but it didn't give me a lot of hopepost:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5467886.msg62958581#msg62958581BC.Game admitting it was their complaince/legal officerhttps://imgur.com/a/bOhOsjbI also reached out to @efialtis  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2597426   In attempt to resolve this due to his relationship with BC.Game, he fought for me and a resolution to no avail.  I appreciate his efforts and I think it says a lot about him that he fights for players regardless of his financial relationship with the casinos.  His reputation is well earned.Finally,  my account is now self excluded/closed due to \"problem gambling\".   I did not explicitly request this.  Only when shown my complaint (no demand or threat)  my host self excluded my account for problem gambling.   Why now? Why not any one of the other times I conveyed my problem?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2503677 BC.game $550,000  (this is the estimated amount lost after the first time I clearly conveyed my gambling problem: Various cryptos:",

      "body": "I know some of you will state this is my fault, and I made the choice to gamble. You are lucky that addiction has never gotten ahold of you.  I believe it's far easier for a casino to act on clear signs than it is for a problem gambler to use self control or restraint.  I really don’t think its fair to say a casino has absolutely no responsibility to make a reasonable effort to stop this sort of thing.You may also claim that even if they intervened, I would have just gambled somewhere else.  This is a reasonable thought.  But that doesn’t absolve responsibility.  If a bar or pub overserves someone showing clear signs of intoxication and harm occurs, I do not think a valid defense would be  “well if we didn’t serve him, he just would have drank somewhere else”You may also likely ask,  if I would have won, would I be complaining ?   My reply would be, I was never going to win.  You don’t win when you’re wagering over $250 Million dollars on games with built in house edges. I just want to add, I am not seeking all of my deposits back, or even all of my losses after I conveyed my gambling problems.  I told the casino I believe both parties made mistakes and exhibited poor judgment and that there should be a shared responsibility.  I made a proposal to the casino for a % of my losses after I communicated my problems.  I was told there was a near 0% chance for any portion of my losses back.  Even if they agreed to my proposal, they would still be profiting hundreds of thousands of dollars off my account, but they have been completely unwilling and uninterested.",

Most crypto casinos let you gamble from countries they ban in their ToS, only to require KYC and say you have broken the rules if they see you have won a lot of money and try to withdraw it. For this and other reasons is why I was saying recently on the mixer ban topic that casinos are going to be next in line. Regarding the OP, what you have to do is find a solution to your problem because whether BC.GAME has responsible gambling options or not, you will always find a place to continue gambling. If you don't solve the basic problem you're going to get worse and worse. Seek help from a professional specialised in this type of addiction and if you don't know any, consult a psychiatrist.",

I think you need to seriously seek help if you have that bad of a problem and take responsibility for that problem.A lot of your questions seem to presume someone going through what I was going through, should be thinking clearly.  In the midst of my out of control gambling,  I was not assessing the casinos actions or non actions.  That happened later.  I'm not going to spend much time addressing what I would or wouldn't do if I had reached a resolution with the casino.  It's really not relevant.  The only relevant thing is if the casino took advantage of my addiction and/or failed to act and that they benefited from it greatly.  Who gives out bonuses when a player comes to you and says their gambling is out of control ?  or that they can't take a break from gambling ?BC.Game stated everyone is required to complete both levels of KYC to withdrawal.  https://imgur.com/a/KkMTQjvIt is required by their license,  it is required by KYC/AML laws where they operate from.  Do they KYC everyone? I'm guessing not.   They certainly did not with me.  Why ? Could it be due to our conversation where I asked if self exclusion was pointless without KYC?   The amounts of money I was depositing and withdrawing seem to absolutely demand KYC.   But they let it slide.  Why ?They let the prohibited location slide.  Why ?     They ignored all my statements about my problem gambling.   Why?It's sure a lot of coincidences to happen to 1 player that enabled me to keep playing there.   This is what gives me belief they took advantage of the situation.  They will never admit it,  and I can't definitively prove it, but what other logical explanation is there?   If they are going to claim that they are so incredibly inept that they missed all of this,  then they should accept some responsibility in this matter and not let 100% of the harm fall on me.  Or, let them come in here and say we did nothing wrong and tell me to get lost.",

Several platforms explained their situation regarding this \"selective\" KYC across many threads, that they always strive to keep their customer anonymous, understand that it's something their customer prefer, yet they still have to be compliant to govt. rules. Thus they'll prolong KYC/AML as long as they can; if their customer didn't do anything that require further check, like depositing without wagering [in line with AML compliance] or cheating the system, they'll quite likely won't ask that.Sadly, sometimes these leniency also backfired, where they later caught multi-acc abuser only when they crosschecked the data, or people bypassing their georestriction. If you didn't do anything that's against their rule, then them not asking you to perform KYC actually come in tone with crypto casino's wish to keep their customer free from privy eyes.Plus, voluntary KYC are always available, if you want to perform KYC, you don't have to wait for it to be asked, the page are always there, minutes away from being completed.",

The player even mentions he went through KYC \"with support\"BC can verify when they added the upload section,  I am nearly certain it was more recent and not there in 2021.Also regarding your comments about my phone number.   I registered it this year,  here you can see my host in September of this year noticing I verified it and gave me a bonus.  It became a recent requirement for their contests.https://imgur.com/a/cqD6W2Kdate I registered the phone number and verified ithttps://imgur.com/a/b3UjZs7",
