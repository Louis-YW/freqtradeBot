      "body": "Did you not backup this wallet data? I meant the phrase or private key to any external place earlier before now. And the data you are trying to recover was the wallet backed up inside the Samsung phone, or you just have everything about the wallet kept inside without making a copy of the wallet data.  If the phone has been wiped out, I don't know if there is any possibility of getting your files back. If there is a small opportunity, I will suggest you visit a data recovery specialist; they might be able to help.  There was a time sometimes in 2019 or 2020 when my relative mistakenly wiped my PC, and I had important data on it. I was able to recover some using some free tools like Easy File Recovery and its alternatives. I don't know if it still works or if it could be of help to you, and at the same time, even if it will, I don't know how secure it is, so you should be careful with whatever tool you plan to use.",

      "body": "I've heard more than a couple of times that it's possible to recover some data from a wiped device, whether it be a personal computer or a mobile phone, but even though I've in previous times and on several occasions, wiped my mobile phone, and a few times wiped my personal computer due to some issues, I've never tried to recover back any of the wiped data to see if recovering data lost in such manner actually works, since I've always backed up my important files before embarking on such venture.What I did advice op to do is possibly search on YouTube to see if there have been some sort of tutorial videos done by someone on the process of recovering back bitcoin lost in such manner, though I will still blame you (@op) for not keeping an external backup file of your wallet, as this a very important approach to the accessibility of our funds in the wallet in times like this.And I am also curious to know why you started this search now, is it that you've been off crypto, and coming back now, you just remembered you had a wallet with 0.73 btc balance on it?",

So your only option is to hire a professional for a data service.Another option I think is by rooting the unit and use some recovery app to recover deleted data I do not know if it will work on formatted units and also not all units are can able to rooted so it depends on what unit model you have.",

I suggest you to make a thread of a bounty on the service page, as a little reward for the expert will do the work for you.If you are OK with it, besides it, recovering data by yourself, while having no technical skills might cost you the least chance that you had if you would have chosen to hire an expert. I hope you got my point, I can understand you must be under some pressure and excitement too, so in these feelings don't give your seed phrase or keys, etc. to anyone, which means don't do anything dumb.",

I did that in the past with 0.01BTC or so fractions.Regarding the recovery. I don’t think you can recover it since it was wiped. If this was a regular hard drive then you could recover because the files are still there just the files are hidden. With the space of a phone it’s completely different.Like someone mentioned before, see if you can get a recovery expert and maybe they can help you out.",

All of your comments were strawman or just pure ad hominem...What is it about forums and the way they attract such self-righteous morons? Why can't someone just have a discussion without having a superiority complex? I was not making reference that mining is the diver of price, it was just a turn of phrase that both the price and the hash rate are both going to the moon!  No one has yet given an expliantion any how over 700kwh for a transaction is in any way justifiable???So what happens in the future.....We just continue down this path until we need more hash power than there is available electricity in the world, sure exponential growth in price is exciting but exponential growth of energy use is not... Btw, is it the same wallet as the one you posted about in 2020?

The i7 has always been a multi-core processor.But anyway, you are more then likely wasting your time. The odds of finding the file with any kind of good data are just about zero.After all this time, and an older phone like that with limited storage vs. today's phones with tons of storage the data was more then likely overwritten more then once.Even a quick wipe and re-install of most early android phones made data recovery just about impossible.-Dave",
