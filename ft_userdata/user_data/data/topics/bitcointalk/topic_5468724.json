The transaction fees suggested by mempool.space are based on network congestion and it is just an estimation not so accurate, by default mining pools prioritize transactions with high fees to give incentives to their miners.Only mining pools have full control of what transactions they would like to add on the block they mine not their miners(except for individual or solo miner with big mining farms.)",

They put a very high estimate on the exchange dashboard, but send the transaction with something much lower than that and pocket the rest of the fees paid In many exchanges you cannot ascertain when they actually send the Bitcoin out and do not get any txid to monitor it on.Quote from: albert0bsd on October 01, 2023, 02:12:35 AMThe miner actually don't care how much fee you pay they are going to mine at their same speed proof of that is that the ~19.82 Bitcoin fee stay almost 7 minutes on mempool before being mined:Miners do care.This happened probably because the next block took 7 minutes to be confirmed.Bitcoin transactions are calculated in blocks and not time, so when you pay a higher feerate you are asking for it to be confirmed in the next block or next 2 blocks and not in the next minute.",

Send a transaction that I was in a hurry to get confirmed, a couple of hours at most, and instead of sending it with an adjusted fee to make RBF if necessary later, I simply overpaid for the fee and had it confirmed in the next block. But as you rightly say, companies should minimise costs and one aspect where they can do that easily is this. What I don't understand, though, is that you are giving as an example a transaction that was clearly by mistake that the miner returned and you yourself echoed it.",

Basically, estimations are not exact numbers for actual things and with instinct of mempools which can be changed very quickly by on-chain demands, you have to consider carefully from estimations and recommended fee rates, then decide what is a fee rate you want to use.If fee rate recommended is small different than what best fee rate you check manually, I think it is good enough.QuoteBut in any case, if you need to make a RBF or a FullRBF Transaction you only need to increment your Fee by 1 sat/vBYou can still maximize your transaction chance to get confirmation but with increments like 1.1 sat/vbyte or 2.1 sat/vbyte which can make bigger difference than 1 sat/vbyte or 2 sat/vbyte as chance will be bigger and you can still save more satoshi.",

There is a popular BRC-20 token called \"SATS\" that just recently minted out, meaning there is no more of them to be claimed. And after that happened we witnessed a sharp dropoff in transaction fees:Whats ridiculous is the vast, vast majority of BRC-20 transaction have been mints. People just mint the token into existence and then sit on it, never transferring it anywhere. The real winner here is the inscription services that people pay to mint the tokens on their behalf (otherwise you need your own full node to do inscriptions).",
