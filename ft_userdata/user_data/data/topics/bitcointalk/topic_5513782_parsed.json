Plus, if you have a magic idea to make a coin more expensive, I am sure that quite some altcoins would want to test  your idea (at least to get them worth more than nothing).Quote from: D4NK on October 19, 2024, 07:38:34 PMI know that if you put it more difficult is going to slow down all the blockchain but it will whort it Actually every 2 weeks be blockchain difficulty is adjusting itself, so if at that point it's high and the blocks come too slow, it will be decreased automatically to stay in the \"one block about every 10 minutes\" area.Plus, the difficulty is supposed to rise only if there are many new miners.So please, tell more details (hopefully something clearer) about your idea because as it is:* it makes little sense* it is unclear what you will achieve technically* it is unclear how you will achieve that technicallyQuote from: D4NK on October 19, 2024, 07:38:34 PMTell Me What you think and its my personal vision if you dissagre tell me that too  For now you said pretty much nothing, hence nothing to agree or disagree with.",

      "body": "So it sounds like what you are really saying is that you want longer block times?  That is the result of a higher difficulty target that it sounds like you're trying to explain.  Given that there is already a blocksize limit in place, you're talking about reducing the amount of transactions that Bitcoin can process per second.  I think that would be a horrible thing actually.  A better idea would be to increase the blocksize and reduce the difficulty so that more blocks are found, thus increasing the number of transactions that could be processed.  This would spur economic activity, lower fees, and reduce wait times for confirmations.  The downside (or upside in reality) is that Blockstream wouldn't be able to force their patented layer 2 on us.",

This is going to do more bad than good for Bitcoin and its network as a whole because price is a secondary aspect, the most important thing is the fluency of the network and how quickly transactions are getting confirmed.If you are making Bitcoin transactions daily and having to wait for hours for them to get confirmed, you will be pissed off and you wouldn't care about the price anymore, I'm sure.Quote from: D4NK on October 19, 2024, 07:38:34 PMI know that if you put it more difficult is going to slow down all the blockchain but it will whort it How is it worth it if it's going to slow down the network? Is it better to have $100k as the price and normal transaction confirmation times or $200k and a congested network? I would go with the former.Quote from: D4NK on October 19, 2024, 07:38:34 PMTell Me What you think and its my personal vision if you dissagre tell me that too  No offense, but I disagree with your vision.",

And since you said it won't slow down the blockchain, do you also suggest block size increase?Quote from: D4NK on October 19, 2024, 07:38:34 PMTell Me What you think and its my personal vision if you dissagre tell me that too  Assuming i understand your proposition correctly, i disagree since it'll mess with Bitcoin protocol in many ways. You better hope for government stop banning Bitcoin or allow Bitcoin to be used as payment method if you want Bitcoin price keep increasing.",

      "body": "Making the block system more difficult could indeed increase scarcity, which might theoretically pump Bitcoin's price. However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. Slowing down the blockchain could affect its usability and scalability, both of which are crucial for widespread adoption. I don’t see this as a solution that would benefit Bitcoin's long-term growth, as it compromises its core principles.",
