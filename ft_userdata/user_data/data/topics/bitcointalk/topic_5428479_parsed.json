The word from your post makes me think you get infected by this virus, but the fact that you posted the link makes me think that you want to spread the virus. So, let's hope you are here for the first option.If your machine got infected you should import your private keys to a new wallet and move the coins before it's too late. Then you can format your server/pc to have a clean install but this time with the right software.",

You should only download from official sources, and verify it always. Not enough users here verify before installing something. As soon as you execute the program you can probably consider yourself compromised, and since it wouldn't be easy to identify to what extent. It's recommended to take the complete wipe, and isolate approach. What wallet file were you trying to download?",
