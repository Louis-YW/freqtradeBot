From then I strongly suggest I can't do it for anyone, I can suggest and send you guidelines, it needs to be your responsibility to buy/sell or whatever.",

I found out that people love personal anecdotes and I have a lot of it because it always drives my point home. How do I do this?I take the time to explain to them my mistakes. How initially, FOMO and FUDs almost drove my sell my bitcoins. I tell them about the time I almost got scammed and the clipboard malware that almost wiped my wallet. I give them personal use cases of bitcoin. How I paid for my laptop in bitcoin. The speed, thee convivence the transactions with bitcoin are. I also share with them the time I took profits to solve a need, get something nice for myself and what I plan to do in the future the next time I take profit.

They can invest a set amount weekly, bimonthly etc. I tell them also the benefits inherent in these strategies.",

Over the years, I learned a lot, and giving all the knowledge in a 2-3 hours meeting is not even possible.Also, there are various posts like the Bitcoin Pizza every once in a while which says that this person bought a pizza for 10 bitcoin which is now worth millions, and people really love these types of things. They want to gamble out their money in shitcoins like Dogecoin which was initially created as a meme. In 2021, it was an actual investment for many around the globe and you can still see people like Elon Musk with such a large influence pumping and dumping that shitcoin.",

So let it be, it's not our fault if they have the wrong understanding of bitcoin and their minds are already close about investing on it.",

Over the years, I learned a lot, and giving all the knowledge in a 2-3 hours meeting is not even possible.Sometimes very relative success, well, it all depends on what we are talking about. But indeed, whether it is intellectual laziness or lack of time, it is true that people would like to be served everything on a platter, things that have taken years to understand. That's why the road to widespread use of Bitcoin is still long. This is also why scams are common: people are willing to entrust their funds to unknown people who assure them that they will manage them for them.

Bitcoin does not have to be bought with fiat currency: you can earn bitcoins for goods, work or services, for example. You can also give bitcoins as a gift on a birthday or other occasion. Again, the point of Bitcoin is not to speculate, the point of Bitcoin goes far beyond that.

It didn't help that it was around the big dip from the ATH to around $40k I think? I might consider talking about it again if they ever ask, but I wouldn't really willingly tell them to go in again.
