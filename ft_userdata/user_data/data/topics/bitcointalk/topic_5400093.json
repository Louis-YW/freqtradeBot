  "content": "In the page where you can buy a Copper Membership it says:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promoteWe are commonly asked how we know that you sent a payment. The address above was newly generated just for you, so when any BTC is sent to it, we will know to credit it to your account. It is all automatic.I'm wondering if the code used to generate that address on the fly for the current user is open source(php code I guess?). It seems quite useful since it creates a new address per each user, and also apparently it executes some action whenever the payment is made. It seems to be a simple Bitcoin checkout, which could be great in certain use cases.It's fine if it's not open source, but it would be great to know if it is.",

Not sure.It looks like a modified library that was used to generate addresses but I think most of the modifications come from https://btcpayserver.org/ ?!In general, I think that the above project is open source and provides an option for everyone who does not want to strive to write code from scratch, and therefore @theymos is the one who can confirm the nature of the code.",

      "body": "There's nothing fancy going on. The Bitcoin-specific part of the payments handling code is only 94 lines, and most of this deals with interfacing with bitcointalk.org. It uses Bitcoin Core via JSON-RPC; specifically, the only two JSON-RPC commands bitcointalk.org uses are listreceivedbyaddress and getnewaddress.You could create a page which displays a user-unique address and says how much that address has received in like 10 lines of PHP if you use a JSON-RPC library. However, in reality you need to handle a large number of edge cases (eg. overpayment, underpayment, very-late payment, etc.), so I recommend using BTCPay Server, which tries to handle all such edge cases in reasonable ways.",
