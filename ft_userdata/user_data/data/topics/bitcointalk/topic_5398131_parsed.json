  "content": "Introducing the ACTA wrapped NFTsWays to make a profit are rapidly evolving in the cryptocurrency industry. For some, it is the tested method of buying and hodling an asset long-term. For others, it is short-term trading that capitalizes on price fluctuations. If someone possesses substantial holdings, another way to earn a profit is staking and contributing to the stability of a network. The mission of Acta Finance is to offer multiple ways of earning profit so that our users can decide for themselves which way suits best for each individual situation and market condition.Acta Finance has big plans for 2022. The next step on our roadmap is the official launch, the Token Generation Event or TGE. Simultaneously to our TGE we will be launching a DeFi industry-first concept of wrapped NFTs with a built-in staking functionality that the early adopters of ACTA will have a chance to acquire. These wNFT serve as TGE incentives or collateral and will be only available at the time of the TGE.Overview ACTA wNFT stakinghttps://i.imgur.com/XX0DpI9.pngüíõStaking Pool 1Max Volume 2,000,000 ACTA8-month lock25% APYüíõStaking Pool 2Max Volume 1,500,000 ACTA12-month lock35% APYTo reiterate:A limited amount of wNFTs are available on the Acta Finance launchThe wNFTs will be distributed on a first-come-first-served basisThe set-in-stone launch date will be announced in the coming monthThe wNFT staking APYs are higher (25% or 35%) than the normal staking APYs which are up to15%There will be no deposit or withdrawal fee for the wNFTs‚≠êWhy wNFTs?‚≠êWrapped NFTs give users the opportunity to engage with the platform as early as possible with full flexibility. Acta Finance provides the owner full control over their assets.When a user buys ACTA wNFTs, the deposit and reward immediately get allocated in a time-locked staking contract and wrapped in an NFT, hence wNFT. The wNFT can be sold at any time and the wallet address that holds the wNFT when the timer hits 0, will be able to unwrap the initial stake deposit and rewards directly to his wallet address.This means that the liquid ACTA (deposit) is made illiquid by locking them into a staking contract. However, the locked stake (and rewards) is made liquid through the wNFT. Owners can sell their wNFT, which holds the assets and staking rewards, at any time. Then, if the wNFT gets sold, the new owner can unwrap the NFT into his wallet after the initially committed locking period is over and take full custody.----üü°About Acta Financeüü°Acta Finance is a cross-chain DeFi platform governed by smart contracts that innovates the Avalanche and Cardano ecosystem with the ActaFi Swap and a referral system. Acta Finance introduces a Referral Program, Address Milestone Rewards, and a DAO Program to maximize platform growth and user activity-based rewards. By offering derivatives in a decentralized way, through ActaFi Swap, Acta Finance aims to counter the manipulated liquidation events on centralized entities by using a decentralized price feed.---[size=16pt]Acta Finance wNFT #airdrop registrations are open![/size]100x50 $ACTA 35% APR wNFT and 100x50 $ACTA 25% APR wNFT will be rewarded to the winners!Instructions to participate: https://cutt.ly/0GVAhiO",
