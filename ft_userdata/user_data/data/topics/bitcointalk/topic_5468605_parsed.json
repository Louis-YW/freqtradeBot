I don dey see am for social media as people don dey chuck their mouth for Africa matter. D one wey pain me pass na when I come across one video wey some oyinbo dey analyze say, Africa poverty naim dey bring them prosperity, say them need work on the constancyÂ  of the poverty so dat Dem go fit dey rich. Even when all this video dey fly up and down for social media, Africa government no wise up, them still dey call outsider for help.Some wise piple don analyze am say, na the same people wey we dey try call still dey organize wahala and chaochao for our land , make Dem fit carry our resources. Una no how e take happen for Libya, as Dem kpa their president, since then dem don dey suffer.Na we get all resources for hand , and we still dey suffer because we submit ourselves n resources give wrong hand. Make we wake to reality.",
