We life in a world where must connect to a network which can be connected if have the internet. I know we can use the satellite, but must have a lot of settings that can't we do if are not tech savvy.Quote from: kunliwenxin on July 12, 2023, 11:43:29 PMI saw a guy who said that his Bitcoin account had dozens of Bitcoins that he could never find because he forgot his password.

Education is the best solution to this, people should be educated on what to do and not to do online, especially with their wallets",
