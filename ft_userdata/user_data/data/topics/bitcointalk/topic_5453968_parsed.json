I think it is best trading with the trend. If the trend is bear then let most of your entry spot for bear and likewise for bull too.",

Most professional traders prefer the bear season, which, in my opinion, is the best period to conduct critical study on crypto projects, uncover ethical road maps, and invest in them for a possible solid future.Because of bigger risk in bear market, it is not a more favorite season than with bull market. In bull market, you hardly see project collapses like Luna, FTX. In bear market, any project can fall like that and even professional traders can not know what will happen with a project.QuoteThe bull season is most likely harvest time; we reap what we sow in the market. Which season is better for trading, the bull or the bear?Bull season is better as it has less risk of collapses when new capital flows in and helps price to rise more. With newbies, it is easier to get profit with trading in bull market with a condition that they don't pick scam projects. If they pick top projects, they will not lose in bull market.",

If you do this, you will get this, but there are many variables that make the possibility of profit in both seasons possible, but it is much easier in the event of a price collapse as everyone sells, but provided that you have the luxury to You sell after several years and have a plan so as not to be greedy and continue not to sell until the price collapses.You can also make a reasonable profit in both  the bull or the bear, even in a short-term trading but this requires great experience, adventure and a little luck, which may not be achieved in many cases.",

And in my opinion, you can trade whenever you want and the important thing is that you can analyze when you can enter the market because your goal in trading is to find and make a profit.So it will not depend on the season, whether bear or bull season. Maybe you mean when is the best time to invest so the bear season is the right time to start. But maybe people have different opinions because we have to determine it and not follow what people say.And as long as you can analyze well, you can get coins to trade and make a profit. With that analysis, you can survive the bear season, which is difficult to analyze and predict.",

I said that because I noticed that everytime the market turns to bullish fake mentors will show up and provide their good PnL for that bullish season but when the market back again to bearish they will disappear like a bubble just like what's happening now. I think investors are prefer bearish market because that's the best time to invest and when bullish comes that's the time to sell.",

Most professional traders prefer the bear season, which, in my opinion, is the best period to conduct critical study on crypto projects, uncover ethical road maps, and invest in them for a possible solid future. You are wrong, trader's don't prefer to trade during bear, even professional trader's are always finding it difficult to make profit during bear market. Only investors prefer to accumulate more coins in bear market, because most coins always end up crashing during the bear market, only strong coins will survive the bear market, so investors always see bear market as opptunity to identify and accumulate strong coins and wait for bull run before selling it.

Which season is better for trading, the bull or the bear?Trader's always prefer to trade in bull run because it's always kind of difficult to lose in trade during bull run, and if you are going to lose, then the amount will be minimal. even if you are a beginner you will really be making money during the bull run, any coin you enter during the bull run, you are likely going to make profit in the trade.",

A good trader will not restrict themselves to trading only at a certain period or time, but will be able to make profit trading either during the bull season or the bear season. Trading is a skill that when you become very good at it, you will be able to make your analysis in any season and get it correctly. This should be the target of any new or not so professional trader. They need to be able to trade in any season and still make profit instead of onlt trading during a season.",

Your question is wrong mate, no season is better but both times have their own significance to trading.Bear market - the prices are down and the trader's mindset is on the selling perspective even if at a loss. This is the time you buy at a discounted price.Bull market - the prices are up and the trader's mindset is on the buying perspective. This is the time to sell at inflated prices.What the market thinks is usually what you should move against. Then only you can profit. What whales do is they try to manipulate the market to move in one direction so they can move the opposite in the background.",

If you understand the market, it is possible to profit by trading at any time of the year. Maybe in the first six months of the year the price of bitcoin increased a lot but the price of bitcoin only decreased in the next six months so will we follow this trend in the next year. we will trade for the first six months of the next year and we will refrain from trading for the remaining six months?  The market is always changing.  As the market is now it may turn worse or better after a few days so why should we depend on the season for trading.",

During a bull market, cryptocurrency prices tend to rise steadily or experience significant upward trends, allowing traders to benefit from price appreciation and potentially earn substantial profits. Another benefit of a bull market is the positive market attitude. More investors are attracted by positive mood, which increases trading volumes and starts a spiraling cycle of rising prices. A trading atmosphere that is lively and energizing may be produced by this positive psychology.",

As for a short-term investor, your targeting is for points of support and resistance within each cycle, and therefore it is always bull or the bear without the great meaning of this word.Better to follow technical analysis indicators instead of these terms.",

It often feels easier for newbies to trade during a bull market since predicting the next moves or targets can seem not that hard. On the other hand, trading in a bear market can be a bit difficult, Most of crypto experience frequent fluctuations which making it difficult to accurately predict when prices will rise or fall.
