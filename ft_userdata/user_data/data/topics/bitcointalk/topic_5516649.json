  "content": "Fellow plebs, I am searching for the following historical data and wondering if anyone has any tips to help me on my journey. I have over 100 block numbers, and I am looking for a site where I can search for the data via the actual block number as it needs to be accurate to specific blocks: Data I need: BTC Price   Circulating Supply   Market Cap   Number of Addresses   Blocksize   Hash RateIdeally, there would be a site (or sites) I could search the block number for and find the data above, but all the sites I have found do not show all the data/some data. Any help is greatly appreciated! BH",

You can use some Bitcoin block explorers for it.For example, for block #100,000https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/100000It gives you almost all information you want, exceptCode:Circulating Supply Market Cap Number of AddressesAnother block explorer https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/100000",

As you already know, you can't find the needed data through the use of a single block explorer, but for the missing circulating supply and market cap data that @dzungmobile referred to the other day, you can use \"TimeChainCalendar [just click on the big block height number to easily change its number]\".- I already checked all of the \"explorers from this thread\", so your best bet would probably be to rely on some API [not sure which one supports all of the above data].",
