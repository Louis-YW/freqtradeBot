  "content": "Hi,I bought part of BTC a long time ago, back when it was a pocket change, and I'm holding it ever since. I got it from a first guy I found locally on localbitcoins, and we did a face to face transaction. Back then were simpler times, the amount was small, and I planned to get familiar with Bitcoin and blockchain, so I never thought to ask him where he got them. Then, a year or two after that, I heard he was arrested, but I have no idea what for.I sent it to a hardware wallet and never touched them except once a couple of years ago when I was curious how Wasabi wallet mixing (if that's how it was called) works, so I sent the part of it to see, and now it's there on a separate wallet. Fast-forward to this date. As the price raised significantly, I would like to cash out and take some profit, but I'm afraid they might be somehow flagged with the guy I bought them from. I saw a lot of posts online where people saying their funds were frozen on centralized exchanges for being linked to a mixer.My question is, is there any way I can swap my existing funds in a way so they won't be linked to the previous guy anymore, which doesn't include any additional mixing? I know I could sell them locally, but most of the sellers are using accounts on centralized exchanges, so if those mentioned posts are true, they might freeze them and I will stay both without funds and money.",

One way to do this is through a decentralized exchange (DEX), which is a platform that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for a third-party intermediary. These exchanges typically use smart contracts to facilitate the trades. Another option is to use a centralized exchange (CEX), which is a platform that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers of cryptocurrency. CEXs typically charge a fee for each trade. Whichever method you choose, make sure you understand the risks and apply wisdom on it ok..",

Anyway, that is another topic, currently OP wants to have assistance with a person who gave him some Bitcoins face-to-face, and back in time he was arrested for what he's unaware of it.Buddy, you can better investigate first for what he got arrested back in time because you may be fearing for nothing. If there was really some kind of case related to Bitcoins, you should make a P2P trade or a cash trade with a retailer nearby you. hehe Am I doing right by recommending anything, anyway whatever OP posted in the context of that I think if there was a serious case about Bitcoin and OP's post is legitimate he's the victim and he has the right to get out of this trouble.

Bitcoin is a great asset especially now that the market is going well and preparing for the bull trend we had been waiting for a long time before now. He can indulge I'm P2P transactions and sell it off the market which is a fast way to dispose the Bitcoin rather than going to an exchange to sell it.

Monero is a protocol built for privacy and in a situation like this, it might help you to find some additional privacy than just using the services with the coins you have.

I could probably find a transaction id, but I really don't want to share it publicly online. Regarding the guy, I mentioned above, I have no idea why he got arrested, could be also something unrelated to Bitcoins.

Isn't coinjoin basically mixing? I see some people on reddit stating their accounts got banned/blacklisted when CEXs saw their coins came from coinjoin. Trying coinjoin and then selling P2P, the same way I bought back then, I guess can possibly lead to losing funds, as the most, if not all buyers are using CEX, so their CEX might seize the funds.

This is true, the fear could be unjustified. I have no idea why he got arrested in the first place (and have no way to check it), it might or might not be related to Bitcoins. I'm asking simply because I wouldn't want to risk it and would rather be safe than sorry. The problem with P2P trade I see is, if the other side uses CEX (which is highly likely), so once I send them the funds, they might seize them.Quote from: Mate2237 on December 07, 2023, 07:03:32 PMSend the Bitcoin to another non custodial wallet then from the non custodial wallet you can send to an exchange like Agoradesk, Bisq and Centralized Exchange like Binance and sell off your Bitcoin.
