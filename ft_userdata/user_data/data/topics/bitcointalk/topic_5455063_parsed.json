  "content": "I discovered a few years ago that by ordering gold from a mine in Ghana you are able to earn 20-30% per transaction just by buying gold in Africa, transporting it and selling it on the local market in the UAE / Europe / USA. Ghana as a serious gold exporting country is interested in crypto payments.The only problem is that you have to find a buyer who is interested in buying 1kg+ gold in bulk. Seeing such an opportunity to bring crypto into real trading, I decided to build a decentralized marketplace on the Arbitrum rollup for trading jewelry and gold. I need to get feedback from you guys on what you think about such a project and what for you is crucial to even be interested in supporting such a venture? Alternatively, what would you like to add/change from yourselves.Below is the link to the site and to the whitepaper I created https://cotle.cohttps://docs.cotle.co",
