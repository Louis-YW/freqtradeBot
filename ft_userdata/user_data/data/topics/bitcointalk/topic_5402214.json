  "content": "The CEO of global investment manager VanEck, Jan van Eck, is reportedly expressing optimism that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) will rise to stratospheric heights.The VanEck CEO says that Bitcoin could rally by around 732% from current levels to reach $250,000, according to a report by business publication Barron’s.Van Eck says that at the six-figure price, which he believes could take decades to materialize – Bitcoin’s market capitalization will be about 50% of gold’s market cap.“Investors see it as a complement to gold. That’s the short version. Bitcoin has limited supply; the supply is visible. And it’s very hard, almost impossible, to change that. Bitcoin will go to half the market cap of gold, or $250,000 a Bitcoin, but that could take decades. It’s hard to put a timeframe on it.”Source: https://dailyhodl.com/2022/06/11/bitcoin-btc-will-explode-by-over-700-according-to-ceo-of-80000000000-asset-manager-report/",

No.So it's, again, a 100% biased and 100% worthless speculation in order to get his company in the news and also show that he does believe in Bitcoin. Indeed, Bitcoin has the potential to get to those levels... eventually. It will take a month, a year, a decade or more? Hard to tell.",
