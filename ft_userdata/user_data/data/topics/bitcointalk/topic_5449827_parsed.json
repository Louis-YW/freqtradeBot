One of the major privacy concerns with Ethereum staking is the potential exposure of personal information and counterparty risks. To address these issues, a new mixer called Beacon.Cash has been developed using Tornado Cash core contracts. The protocol was created by Alexey Pertsev, who also developed Tornado Cash. While it is primarily used as a way to tumble crypto, it may also face sanctions for its potential use in staking.",

Is their mixing process reliable to begin with? I'm not familiar with how they work, not to mention they mention some RPC blocking can hinder their service if they do still run it right now. At the end of the day though, I would be surprised if the government just stay still and do nothing to decrypt/analyze the transactions made through them. Would be a weird move since they can use that as a basis to sue others. CMIIW.",
