  "content": "This article: $23,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Prediction Changed by Analyst Benjamin Cowen is a proof that no one knows the future.  Benjamin Cowen is a prominent analyst that states that Bitcoin will be hitting 23k at the end of September.QuoteArman ShirinyanAnalyst Benjamin Cowen's bearish prediction for Bitcoin hitting $23,000 in September proved to be off mark Since his prediction is out of line he admitted that he was wrong in his prediction:The article also stated that instead of Bitcoin plummeting to $23k, Bitcoin market instead shows a more stable outlook.This simply shows that even veterans and seasoned analyst with their accumulated market experience cannot predict the future price of Bitcoin.  It is not because of unpredictable Bitcoin market volatility but because they are just human who has no power to see the future.  Imagine if an investor shorts his trade to buy at lower price because he believe on the prediction of Cowen that price will go down to $23k at the end of September, this person could have been in a loss.So this is a great reminder to us investors to not just believe anything that a person, no matter how popular or knowledgeable they are, stated without doing any researches to verify their statement.  After all it was out money that is on line.",

His failed speculation is another pointer that Bitcoin goes beyond any whales or an influencer who may think that Bitcoin could easily be manipulated or predicted at whatever point.",

We must update ourselves regularly and be onlook for big news, this way through our own reasoning and knowledge, we can make our move toward Bitcoin trading.",

If Benjamin Cowen tells you that he's 100% accurate, then let us know.I don't think any wise trader would say that, so you don't expect perfection from him as a human being. The best traders will have their losing and gaining moment, and those with track success records would not have all their analyses hit the target but they would still know how to manage the situation effectively to their advantage so that they will either not lose in the long run or not lose all their initial gains depending on the situation.You would have been more constructive if you added the price at which Benjamin Cowen gave the analysis, after all, Bitcoin still breached below $24,900 last month, so he's right with the prediction but the target was missed, and he might have closed his position earlier than now if I sensed right. This is normal in trading as we are all speculating, no one truly can predict 100%, and that is where trading management steps in for us.It's only the blind followers who suffer the brunt.",

No, they remain just like anybody else, guessing. And it's not just because they are humans. It's because the price of Bitcoin is highly unpredictable. Humans have been accurately predicting many other things. But that won't include Bitcoin. The most that we can say about Bitcoin is that it will create a new ATH. That's almost 100% guaranteed.

Those who predict the price of Bitcoin are only spreading fear to the public, especially if they say that the price of Bitcoin will fall to its lowest price as said by Cowen.So we don't need to worry about anything that happens to Bitcoin, especially if we want to store Bitcoin for the long term. Just let the market move wherever it wants. We have to wait until our investment is reached and then we sell the Bitcoin or we want to wait even longer.Maybe in the future, we will see more people making predictions on Bitcoin's movements. And as Bitcoin investors, we must have a strong hand in holding Bitcoin until the time we determine comes. And don't blindly believe what other people say about their predictions for Bitcoin.",

The person needs to know the future, to be sure of the direction of the price, or that the price can be manipulated, but without these two reasons, it is all an expectation, and it differs from the prediction of a random person in that it is coupled with evidence and analysis, so the percentage of its occurrence is still high, but they are not facts.Always try to have a range when you want to predict the price of Bitcoin or write orders based on that, because in many cases the price moves randomly, and here your alternative plan must be ready.",

Hence we can’t exactly predict the movement of the coin. All we know is that Bitcoins are fixed in numbers, that is no more Bitcoins can be created, hence it made Bitcoins very valuable. So on a long run, the price of Bitcoins will definitely be very high. So to yield the maximum profit, we can just hold the coins for a longer period of time.",

But at the moment bitcoin has broken that benchmark and has touched the 28k price today as mentioned in this comment as I haven't checked the price for so long,  since I am not a day trader and don't care about the daily price chart. Let's hope we see a 29k price soon and if that happens,  it will be a breaking point and a determinant factor to where we can speculate the price to be at the next bull run after bitcoin halving.",
