Now if the governments are not cracking down on this, how would ETF companies like Blackrock sell their ETFs? This about this - you have two options to buy. One is Bitcoin which is taxed at 30% and another is Bitcoin ETF which is taxed at a normal rate. What would you choose?",

Or is the government planning to deduct taxes from crypto assets even if I do not make the decision to sell?Your question makes no sense because no one is sure that the laws will not change. Once you declare your coins, you may be caught by your government.___“Did you really think we want those laws observed?\" said Dr. Ferris. \"We want them to be broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against... We're after power and we mean it... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Reardon, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with.”― Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged(C)https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/319903-did-you-really-think-we-want-those-laws-observed-saidJohn Galt Quotes, Dagny Taggart Quotes, and More from Atlas Shruggedhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5314967.msg56276238#msg56276238",

This behaviour of the government is going to be increased in coming years. The correct opinion is that if Bitcoin is difficult to ban, then it is not difficult to control it. Now we need to collect as much data as possible about the owners of cryptocurrencies, and then smart algorithms will carry out the necessary analysis and learn about all the owner’s transactions.",

With regard to this in particular, it seems that there is a legal loophole and it could be considered that if you have cryptocurrencies in self-custody in a hardware wallet, for example, you would be exempt from declaring them. The latest development on this is that the Spanish tax authorities are sending out notices reminding certain taxpayers that they are obliged to declare cryptocurrencies held abroad if they exceed €50,000, and one local forum member has claimed that she has received such a notice.",

Those who store their assets in self-custodied wallets must report their holdings through the standard wealth tax form 714.Presumably this also means you don't need to report crypto assets in self-custody as long as your overall wealth including crypto is below the requirement limit (from a quick google search this seems to be at EUR 2,000,000,- total).",

Wealth tax is devolved to the autonomous communities (regions with regional governments if you prefer), but yes, the obligation to declare wealth tax starts from 2 million euros of wealth. What happens is that some regions like Madrid apply a 100% rebate, so you don't have to pay anything, and others, the majority, do make you pay, but you have the obligation to declare from 2 million euros onwards anyway. This means that more 99% of Spaniards who have cryptocurrencies in self-custody will not have to declare their cryptoassets because there are about 47.5 million people living in Spain and the wealth tax affects about 200,000 taxpayers, which is only 0.42% of Spaniards and not all of them have cryptocurrencies, there is a very small percentage of Spaniards who will be obliged to declare them in the wealth tax if they have them in self-custody.The local forum, however, sees this as the beginning of a series of measures that will become increasingly tougher in this respect.",

I also had a similar view about mixers some time ago, very little shared, and look what has happened. And what you say about quantities is what is going to happen. In the same way that cash payment limits have been imposed and have been lowered lower and lower (with the recent exception of Italy, which will change downward again as soon as the government changes), the same thing is going to happen with this. The goal is total control of the population, first financial and then in general, with the help of CBDCs and European digital identity.",
