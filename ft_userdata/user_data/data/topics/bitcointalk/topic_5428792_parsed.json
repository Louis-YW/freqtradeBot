      "body": "Well, this is, of course, good. Saudi Telecom is a big and influential player in the country. It plays a big role in the day-to-day lives of Saudis. However, it seems there are too many players in the middle. There's Binance Pay. There's Eazy Pay. There will certainly be banks as well because, for sure, the company won't probably be receiving the payments in Bitcoin itself. But, yeah, this is still adoption. Anyway, I wonder why, except for Binance's tweet, I haven't encountered this in the news.",

I am not so familiar with Saudi Telecom since I am not based in the Middle East but am assuming that this is a big business organization with lost of revenues and is now looking its good share in the booming (especially in this region) cryptocurrency market. As what I am saying in the past, I am hoping those accepting crypto to plan a marketing campaign by including incentives for people to be using crypto so they can go into the hassles of entering the crypto option and using it to pay. No incentives can be a dry thing especially for people who are speculators.",

It's a good news to see as every Crypto and Bitcoin user wants to see adoptions like this going round.But what I really feel like is a scheme for lobbying for the usage of Binance more than the main purpose which was the adoption in that country.For Big Telecom in that region accepting Bitcoin and making daily usage of Crypto is a massive win for the adoption process, the message sent across is ckewr crypto has come to stay but if it's a mean to promote Binance, then I think they can do better by having full custody of their own crypto",

Well this is good news cause when more and more companies will accept Bitcoin and other crypto as a source of payment than a lot of people will know it's future and it could be very bright too. And that's why When PayPal integrated with crypto it made history. Saudi Arab and Dubai are leading in crypto as they want to open Their countries for whole world.

The de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud is really globalizing and revolutionizing the economy of Saudi Arabia. The Gulf region use to be a closed society that always repel innovation and change. But this young ruler has been a trailblazer in the course of opening the region to innovation and modern technological advancement. That's why it is good to have young and visionary leaders and not old and backward political leaders.Saudi Telecom's acceptance of bitcoin is good news. Saudi is a major player in the Gulf economy and this development might influence other nations in that region to take the same step. This bold step might even attract more crypto investors to Saudi Arabia.",

I was also surprised that the service was launched in Bahrain, which is a small island with a limited population, although the company has branches in other countries .",

I like the fact that a tele com organization have recognized the blockchain and started accepting cryptocurrency. It is a nice one they took that step. As a giant in the industry, they have set the pace and others would gradually follow their step to accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payment. Gradually, the adoption of bitcoin is coming to reality world wide which would definitely spread like wide fire when as time goes on.",
