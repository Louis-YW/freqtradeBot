  "content": "The time has finally come to fulfil my plan to give daily Bitcoin signals on the Bitcointalk forum. If my track record in the past is considered, my monthly winning rate is over 85%, and I hope this will add more value to this forum. \"But note that past results are not indicative of the present and future results.\"I will start by providing the entry, stop loss and take profit levels on Bitcoin daily, and will add more explanations to it later if the program gains more popularity and acceptance. That would be after I have permission to directly post images. Please, be sure to test the signal with a demo account or use a ridiculous amount on your live spot or futures account to test it before you grant your trust to the speculation. Don't forget to give me kudos for this effort if it is helpful.How to use my trading signal:1. The daily signal comes with specific entry, stop loss and take profit levels.2. The signal valid till the end of the day that it is issued.3. The time used to formulate the signal is defined in GMT+2, so be aware that it expires at 24:00 GMT+24. I will only give signals with full confirmations, which was why it is a daily signal, not everyday signals. It is better we wait for total confirmation than to lose cheaply.5. There is no specific time to give a signal as I wait for total confirmation. Nevertheless, you might want to check within the first two hours of Asian, London and US sessions.6. I will be adding the results of the signals in front of it after expirations (the next day). Please, note that it reads success if Bitcoin hit the take profit, or is at least 1 point in favour of the signal on expiration, and provided the stop loss is not hit.7. It will however read failed if the stop loss is hit or Bitcoin closed negatively against the entry-level.I hope my readers benefit from this free service!",

The signal valid till the end of the day that it is issued.Why should it be valid to the end of the day? There should be a specified time to close position the trade or sell, like telling everyone to close trade after making some profit, or you tell them to turn on notification for this thread so you can tell them the right time to close the trade which would be when you post about the closing and bot will notify users about it immediately.About posting images, you will soon rank up to junior member and you will be able to post image. But you can try and post link to your images if you want to start now, people would still understand.",

So how can we see his trading signals and tell how good (or bad?) it is.Yeah maybe in the beginning it will be free signal, but who knows, maybe if his signal is well followed and maybe hearing some success stories, maybe he will offer it for some money.",

I hope your signal can work perfectly, although I realize it is hard to follow the signal since the price can go anywhere. But still, the price now is $23,700 according to CMC, so I guess it needs more time to see the price rally to $25k. But it is good if people can use stop loss in this matter so they can avoid a big loss. But if they doubt your signal, they can analyze further to find more info about the market movements and I hope they do not just use your signal without analyzing for more.
