  "content": "Slabber is partially described in a post about the Calcium network, but there is little information there to fully understand the service. Today we will tell you what it is, how it works and why it is needed at all.There are a lot of blog platforms on the web, and they all have both pros and cons. The main disadvantage of most of them is the lack of monetization, that is, it is very difficult for the author to earn money on the site. And if monetization is envisaged, then this is some very small money. Also, services sin by blocking accounts, which leads to the blocking of user funds.The most popular platform in the CIS is Yandex.Dzen. There have even been cases when funds were debited from user accounts to pay traffic police fines, accounts are blocked in batches, and restricted in views, and sometimes you don't even know the reasons for this blocking. You will be written simply \"You have a clickbait\", and in which post, why it is blocked and what to do at all is unclear. You can have 1000 posts on your channel, months of work, and because of some incomprehensible trifle, all these works can sink into the abyss. There are also Steemit, Medium and Telegraph:Steemit was captured by bots;Medium does not provide for monetization, and is gradually turning into a bureaucratic machine;Telegraph is not a blog platform at all, it's more like a notepad on the Internet.Some platforms do not allow anonymity, some do not have monetization, some do not have comments, and so on. The idea of Slabber was born back in 2018, but strong employment did not allow the project to be fully implemented. At the beginning of 2021, the technical specification for the service was greatly changed, and closer to the middle it was necessary to give up some desires for the benefit of convenience, and the development plan was redesigned again. It turned out that by tearing a lot of elements from the concept, we made the platform as versatile and convenient as possible. The UFO blockchain coin, which the team has been working on since 2018, has been chosen as a means of exchanging value.Monetization.For authors, Slabber offers 4 ways of monetization. At the same time, the service does not interfere in mutual settlements between users. Only a small commission of 1% of each transaction goes to the platform development fund. Each transaction within the network is a separate transaction in the blockchain.1)Subscriptions.You can subscribe to any author for any amount. For example, you have subscribed to John for 180 days and will send him 1000 coins per day. In this case, John will receive 180,000 coins in 180 days, but you will spend 180,000 coins + 1% + payment of the network commission for 180 transactions. Your account will be debited:180,000 UFO for the author of 1800 UFO service commission0.5 UFO (approximately) blockchain commission for 180 transactions.But even here, not everything is so banal. These funds are not completely debited from your wallet. They are transferred to the \"shadow\" wallet, that is, they are reserved. You can unsubscribe at any time and unspent UFOs will be returned to your wallet.Your main wallet is always exclusively under your control. The \"Shadow\" is managed by Slabber, and every day it signs transactions according to the model that you have chosen to encourage the author.2) Thank you.One-time translation to the author for the text he likes.3) Pay-per-views.20,000,000 UFOs are reserved on the UdLXdt3UhdZL5uUzxQv5Tk5MbzfzFd7aNR wallet to encourage the first authors.https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ufo/address.dws?UdLXdt3UhdZL5uUzxQv5Tk5MbzfzFd7aNR.htmEvery day, the authors of the channels will be sent a number of coins equal to the number of views of all the posts of the channel in aggregate. 1 view = 1 UFO egardless of the current rate. Today, 20,000,000 coins is about $10,000 dollars. But tomorrow the rate may fall 10 times or grow by the same order. Even if 1 UFO costs $1, the funds will be paid according to the same model. One view is always equal to one coin. As soon as 20,000,000 coins run out, the pay-per-views will end by that time. Slabber will already be filled with both coins and content. Maybe this wallet will still be replenished, anyone can replenish its balance to support the authors of the slabber.4) Advertisers.We are for freedom, so any author can place any advertising post in his channel.In general, monetization in Slabber is a very flexible thing. You can create an account and invite readers to donate funds for something, such as an orthopedic bed, or maybe for animals in your shelter, or for the construction of a house for ducks. We are not against any way to interact within the site.Data protection and functionality.The most difficult stage of development is the non-custodiality of wallets. Neither the administrators of the service nor the malicious users should be able to get to the user's coins. Therefore, the process of registering and storing user data turned out to be very interesting and innovative.In addition to the standard data (e-mail and password), you will need to save the SEED phrase and create a PIN code. You can log in to your account using your username and password, but to unlock your wallet, you will need to enter a PIN. The PIN is needed so that the user does not have to use the SEED phrase to unlock the wallet. With this approach, you can always change/restore the password and PIN code from the account, but it is impossible to restore the SEED. If you lose PIN and SEED or password and SEED, you will forever lose the ability to use the funds on your account balance. But if you only lost the PIN, you always have a SEED. Probably it is not too easy to understand, but in use it is as simple and reliable as possible.A non-custodial wallet in the Slabber service implies that critical data (such as private keys for accessing funds) can exist in open form only for a limited time and exclusively on the user's side.There is a technical possibility to store such data directly in the browser in encrypted form, and decrypt them if necessary. However, this approach imposes a number of limitations.Firstly, it would not allow you to use the wallet on different devices at once. The keys will be missing on the new device and the procedure for restoring the wallet from the SEED phrase will be required. Which in itself is inconvenient for everyday use, and unsafe - especially when using someone else's computer.Secondly, if the device is compromised (someone else's computer, loss, data theft, etc.) —  there would be an opportunity for an unlimited number of attempts to select the encryption key by an attacker. Because the data, even if encrypted, would remain stored in the browser.To improve the security of the user's keys, a model was chosen for storing client-encrypted data in the Slabber server storage.In this case, on the user's side, the data is present exclusively during the active session when working with the site. To store data in a pre-encrypted form, a Slabber server is used, and data encryption and decryption itself takes place on the client side. A combination of a PIN code and a long account salt is used for encryption.Thus, the Slabber server itself does not know anything about the content stored for a specific user — it is all encrypted by the client itself. Even if an attacker gains access to the stored data, decryption will require considerable effort, directly proportional to the size of the salt of each account.In addition, when the client requests its encrypted data from the server storage, additional authorization is applied based on the active session. Using authorization allows you to protect yourself on the server side from attempts to access data by brute force.In general, the design of the Slabber security system aims to ensure the security of the user's keys. It is assumed that any other party (including Slabber itself) does not have sufficient data to gain access to the private keys of any of the users.Only the user himself (and his software), knowing the full set of data, can reproduce his private keys to manage funds.A full-fledged wallet is linked to your account, you can transfer UFO to the exchange at any time, send it to a friend or to your cold wallet. The service will never be able to use your funds or deprive the user of the ability to manage their wallet. There may be situations when the author violates the rules of the site (for example, places information prohibited by law for distribution), we will block such. But only the user's account is blocked. The wallet also remains under his full control no matter what. Wallet and account are different things. Roughly speaking, two accounts are created for you at once: a service user account and a wallet user account. We can't block the second one in any way, even if we really want to.There's just a little bit left.Try Slabber",
