  "content": "Please I want someone to explain this to me as am showing in the picture. I made a transaction yesterday night and it delivered few minutes later. Receiver got it. But 10 hours later am still seeing the part I marked 1 in black on the left, that is the small rectangular box beneath the circle. I used to think that the sign was to show that a transaction was not fully confirmed. How come after 10 hours that sign is still showing for a transaction that got completely confirmed in less than 20mins last night? At the time I took that picture this morning, it has 72 confirmations. But why is that still showing?Moderator can move this post if here is not the appropriate board for it.",

So, the following thread will answer your question: https://www.reddit.com/r/COINOMI/comments/t6e6oi/coinomi_showing_a_received_transaction/Also, please note that Coinomi wallet is closed-source https://walletscrutiny.com/android/com.coinomi.wallet/ which means you have to trust the claims the developers of the wallet make regarding its functionality and other aspects such as how it handles the keys to your funds and how the wallet generates randomness. Moreover, if you aren't running your own Electrum server to receive transaction data, you are trusting Coinomi node, which in some cases may be dangerous since a third-party node may lie about the state of the blockchain and transactions. In this case, a trusted node is clearly lying because it shows a confirmed transaction as unconfirmed.",
