  "content": "Dear Bitcointalk Community,After nearly a decade working on other people's projects, I'm thrilled to announce Hemis, a new layer 1 blockchain platform set to launch in January 2024. Bitcointalk is where my blockchain career began so it only felt natural to announce our project here first.Community-Powered, Innovation-LedDecentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Hemis has a community-driven leadership model. Every decision and advancement within Hemis will be ratified by its most valuable stakeholders – our users. This ensures a platform that truly reflects the needs and aspirations of its community.Intuitive Game Creation Tools: Say goodbye to the complexities of coding and Solidity. Hemis provides user-friendly tools, making it easy for anyone to create their favorite games of chance, from card games to board games and dice games.Platform-Agnostic API: Our API, along with browser plugin wallets and dedicated iOS and Android apps, will ensure that your games are accessible to a global audience, regardless of the platform.Rewarding Game Development: Hemis is not just about playing games – it's about rewarding the creative and managerial efforts of game developers and Gamemaster node operators. Our platform makes it possible for your creativity and management skills to yield tangible rewards.Hemis Utility Token: The backbone of our ecosystem is the Hemis utility token. We're kicking off with a free airdrop this January – the primary way to acquire Hemis tokens. Additionally, token staking will play a crucial role in securely launching the chain. A mere <5% of the total utility supply will be airdropped in February 2024, with the remaining tokens being minted over the next ten years.Provably Fair Gaming: Fairness is paramount at Hemis. Our platform offers provably fair random number generation and secure transactions for both fungible and non-fungible tokens, all without the need for any coding or contract creation.As we approach the launch of Hemis, we invite developers, gamers, and blockchain enthusiasts to join our journey in reshaping the world of online gaming. Stay tuned for more details and updates by following us on Twitter (https://twitter.com/hemisblockchain/) and visiting https://hemis.tech.We will also post all of our major updates in this thread.Thank you for your interest and support.Best regards,Dan Ames & The Hemis Project Team",

In short, we want to make sure that the community hold more tokens than the core team otherwise the DAO and blockchain will be centralised and relatively meaningless.",
