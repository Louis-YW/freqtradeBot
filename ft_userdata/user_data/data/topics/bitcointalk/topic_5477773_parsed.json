I don't know what exchange gonna be hit next after Kucoin it just kinda crazy for an exchange to deal with Uncle SAM.The best idea right now for all exchanges is to not accept US citizen until they have license to operate there.",

I think that in the USA there are no longer any large crypto exchanges that can be fined a large amount. Coinbase has gotten rid of all major competitors and, thanks to the support of Blackrock and a good lobby, will occupy the bulk of the market. That’s why FTX in the USA still has problems",

I do believe there is a lot of people that have money or are registered on a platform like OKX or Bybit right?Yeah, most of the ETF applications right now including the BlackRock choose Coinbase as the main platform to deal with Bitcoin and the Ethereum, no space for others at least for now.",

The US market is the biggest crypto market in the world but some competitors are making flexible policies to attract more crypto investors. Singapore and Hong Kong are offering some of the most clear and flexible regulations that create an enabling environment for crypto firms. We might see more digital asset businesses leaving the US and moving to more friendly countries in the Asia Pacific region. If Coinbase becomes the only major exchange in the US, it will enjoy a monopoly and other businesses will suffer. This will give the US crypto community fewer options which is not a good feature of the free market the US claims it is. Other exchanges should be allowed to operate to make the market more competitive.",
