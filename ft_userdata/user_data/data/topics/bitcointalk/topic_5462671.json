      "body": "To ensure greater transparency, it would be a good idea to share with us one of your bitcoin addresses or to share it with a trusted member if you care about your privacy. And I do not think that there is a problem in telling us about the total amount in the wallet that you would like to recover.Nor do I advise you to accept support in private. There are many scammers out there who will try to make you believe that there is a solution in exchange for sensitive information about your wallet.It is a little bit strange how you can't recover your btc using the PK of the address containing funds. I'm not a technical expert but I thought this suggestion might help you find a solution. Have you thought about using the file with an older version of Electrum? Or use the same old version on the same laptop that you found. In this case, it is not important that the wallet connects to the Internet. All we want is that you can be able to sign a transaction that includes the entire amount on the wallet to a new address. Broadcasting the transaction can be done using a new Electrum wallet connected to the Internet on another device.",

And when opening wallet dat with these errors, it’s different, in wallet dat I have 104 addresses, and in seed and xprv xpub I see 82 addresses and no balance, with old transactions, the last time on an old laptop that has already been sold, I used the wallet in 2017-2019 and it never gave me these errors. To be honest, I already agree to anything just to restore access to my wallet, maybe opening wallet dat with notepad will help me somehow? The wallet dat file itself is also large in size.Quote from: Minase on August 10, 2023, 12:37:57 PMif the wallet is not password protected just open it with notepador use this command to display the xprv in console getmasterprivate()WARNING!! do not share your xprv with nobodyhttps://ibb.co/LSq2vnBhttps://ibb.co/CzQzBkB",
