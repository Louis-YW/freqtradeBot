  "content": "If y'all can tell, I don't really make 'em posts except there is actually a substantial reason for that... It could be based on my prerogative atimes but, this is it;Lightlord left the forum for a very long time and nobody fuckin' gave a shit about it.... The speculations behind that was pretty vague; some said he' was very sick and his health was deteriorating slowly, some said he actually disappeared just about the time he was supposed to remit the monthly funds to his then campaign manager, cryptopreneurbrainboss who's still his manager today...some weren't even able to reachout to him and they all bitterly complained about how his silence meant \"treachery\" to them.I mean, no one was just gonna assume he's dead over the time he wasn't active... I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS TO ALL THIS.. I WASN'T A PARTICIPANT IN ANY OF HIS CAMPAIGNS BUT I'M WORRIED.* Has lightlord made any post of reconcilation/acknowledgement on what exactly happened within the space of time he's been inactive?? * What's it with all this one-liner posting pattern of the participants in BITVEST signature CAMPAIGN??* Has anyone noticed that most accounts on those campaigns were inactive during the period the campaign collapsed? * Has anyone also noticed that they all suddenly became active from the very day the campaign was re-announced?... If these accounts aren't possible Alts, how were they pre-informed when they weren't active themselves??... Does it make any sense?..lolSandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

      "body": "This thread is more suited in the reputation board not meta, I'm not Lightlord so I can't speak for him but as the campaign manager, you should note that just because accounts are becoming active again doesn't mean they'll be accepted into the campaign. Obviously alts might make their way into the campaign but that's not a crime when they're not abusing the campaign with two accounts. Having alts isn't a crime on the forum but abusing a campaign with them (based on the campaign rules) that's when it's a crime.The campaign has some rules that'll help combat spam like Quote6. Constructive Posts, 150 characters minimum, and quality ranking will occur base upon the quality of your posting, and the better you post the higher the tier you may achieve, users can be promote or demote base upon the quality of their postingQuote2. Signature Spamming that is detrimental to the discussions in threads will not count as payment. If you're reported or caught for spamming you'll be removed from this campaign after 2 strikeThis means those writing just one line spam posts will be rejected at the end of the week and if your write up don't have up to 150 characters it won't be eligible for payment (spams not included as they'll be rejected). Those found guilty will be kickout of the campaign as well. Additional rules for accepting of participants says; üëâ If you have a red tag, neutral tag for spamming don't bother applying.üëâ If you have an inactive account don't bother applying (first page of post history still has posts from previous months).I can boldly say no participants accepted is known to be a spammer as all those that applied with such tag were ignored and those doing so are putting their account at risk of been removed because immediately any tag is put on your account for spamming, you'll be removed. Those reported or caught have two strikes and so on. Funds for the campaign are escrowed now unlike how it was unescrowed previously that brought about delay in payment and I have been in possession of the funds for over one year . Lightlord paid for his actions, his account has been ruined but I haven't seen an accusation of him scamming although there were delay in payments that has been handled by escrowing campaign funds.",

Spreadsheet has been handled over to lightlord for payment.A total of 10 rounds is now been owed and that have to be address before continuing campaign. Information reaching me is that, lightlord is sick which is the reason behind his absence on the forum. Since I can't guarantee participants of been rewarded for other rounds, campaign has been paused until further notice.After that announcement most participants still wanted me to continue the campaign even though they haven't been paid because they believed Lightlord will pay and for some other reasons I won't say. Lightlord did pay when he came back online but I wasn't happy with the delays and his absence as it was hurting the brand, I was also been owed as well like others. The campaign was paused indefinitely and it stayed that way until its return few days back but all participants were cared of outstanding debts. The whole situation was somehow complicated then and since he had a history of delayed payment everyone thought he was doing it on purpose meanwhile he was ill and did pay eventually when he got better and escrow funds to continue campaign (I receive funds for the newly launched campaign over a year ago) Bitvest Escrow Address: Current balance:",

He took a break to get healthy, or maybe he dies and a relative took over, or maybe he wasn't sick at all who knows. What I do know is he didn't pop on asking anyone for any money. He came on for the same reason he was here in the past which was to hire people to do marketing for his site. He asked people to hold money for the campaign to not fall victim to any criticism from his past. All the trust he received in the past was valid as they were actions he could have avoided but didn't. It wasn't a 1 time thing either, he did it a load. Now he has filled the wallets of the manager and it's up to CryptoprenuerBrainboss to make sure they don't run dry. If lightlord doesn't fill them, he can pause the campaign until that issue is resolved assuming it even happens. All your other questions were answered by others replying.",

I don't know about your other questions but on this one I think it was expected going by the campaign pay rate that many quality posters would not be interested in participating in the campaign except for low quality posters which is an opportunity for them since they can't find their way into high pay rate campaigns with a high competition that beats their standard.I think some members even raised questions on their ANN thread about the payrate why it was of little or no difference from the previous rates before the collapse ¬†to which lightlord gave his reply on that. However, if the posts weren't deleted by mods been a one liner post then it's left for the campaign manager to decide if those one liner posting pattern as OP puts it do meet his campaign rules criteria or not, for it's at his discretion to determine that for payment and not ours.",

Decrease the total posts from 60 to 30 and decrease the total participants, it's not make you need to pay more, but you will get a better quality.

In the past, I should have escrowed many weeks in advance and considered another campaign manager like CryptopreneurBrainboss.A smooth shutdown can occur if the escrow funds run within 2 weeks of running out.So if there isn't a top-off that occurs before it has around 2 weeks remaining, a message can be given that the campaign will shut down in 1-2 weeks, giving the participants enough time to change to another campaign.Going forward, this is how campaigns will be done to ensure that there are no more delays.I can't change the past, and it could have been managed better with something like the above, but perhaps a reconsideration to at least neutral, or perhaps even the removal of the tag, but any delayed payments issues that occur like in the past of in the future you can always add the tag once again.",

The pausing of the campaign was just a precaution step.Starting from this month, the refilled will be requested every third week so we have one week funds left incase there's a delay in response (refilling the wallet then pausing the campaign) but we hope that won't be the case in the future.",
