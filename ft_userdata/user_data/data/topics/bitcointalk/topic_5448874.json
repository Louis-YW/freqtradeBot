Notwithstanding the number of users here, there is no financial gain for the forum. Bitcoin is quite popular around the world, and for the most people who find out about Bitcoin, it does not take long before they discover Bitcointalk and register on the forum. There are old users who have left the forum, but new users register everyday, though what we miss is the knowledge of some of the old users, and not the number they added to the overall traffic.Having said that, because of Bitcoin, businesses like exchanges, mixers, gambling websites (that accept crypto), etc, have all sprung up, and there is no better place for them to advertise their business than in the biggest Bitcoin community, thus the users here can earn money through posting in the forum, and that is an added incentive and a reason why the traffic remains pretty high. I think if there is ever an end to paid signature campaigns, that's when the traffic in the forum would really go down, and we'll experience shortage of users.",

Like me there are hundreds of users. And every day dozens of users sign up, some will stay for a short time others for longer, it all depends on how they get involved in the community and the goals with which they sign up.So what's really the point of spending money on advertising elsewhere?

But bitcointalk remains the most recommended discussion forum when you start to realize what bitcoin is. Bitcointalk doesn't need any kind of promotion or advertisement in various places, but believe me this forum will continue to get interest from new users every day.Without advertising, bitcointalk has 3,548,069 registered profiles. But only 55,423 profiles are still active, at least in the last 3 months.",

You mean, a waste of money aside from time. Making advertisement to social media giant platform have benefits even for a forum, many forum or site usually do that on its early stage. But since this forum is as old as Bitcoin, and serves as the history book then making ads on other platform isnt necessary. Besides this forum do just like other socmed platforms for accepting ads that can generate more money, but since it was stop for many reasons so forget about that.Also, bitcointalk links are something like prohibited to be shared on other social media platforms because of malicious definition it has on wiki sites and other ill description of other news outlet like tolerating scams and letting or advertising mixers which are known for ML, well, that's i what know.",

It seems I forgot to include about wasting money which I am sure you know that ads cost money. Maybe the reason why I didn't include it is because we all know that most ads cost money unless you are in partner to someone or in a group that makes it free. I said it that it's a waste of time because the time spend to find a platform for ads should be spend for the forum.",

The casinos, mixers, and exchanges you see that’s being advertised on the forum all have the link to their bitcointalk Ann thread on their website, that also promotes the forum and at the same time gives the company legitimacy and the trust of the crypto community. Based on data from bpip.org site, we currently have about 3,548,098 profiles registered on the forum with only 55,458 profiles classified as active profiles and the rest are inactive, deleted and archived profiles.

It will attract a whole range of people that might not have any interest in bitcoin. There will be a high rate of shitposters, scammers, and spammers. So it will have to take extra effort to clean up the forum because most of these new members will treat the forum like social media. The majority of people that register currently in this forum are either referred to the forum or found it through research. The above two mediums will help to reduce the influx of uninterested members.I don't think members will reduce drastically because Bitcoin awareness is spreading speedily. And Bitcoin price is not doing badly recently which means that more people will be attracted to the sector and the forum.",

Someone mentioned the forum to me, and I have mentioned it to many other people as well, so the network continues.
