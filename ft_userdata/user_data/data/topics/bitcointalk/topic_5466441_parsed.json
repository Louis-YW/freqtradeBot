  "content": "I promise myself that I will hold my coins till the price of BTC reach $100k before I will think of releasing the coins to the market to make some millions, but over one year and some months now the price don't want to reach $70k or $100k, and I feel like selling the coins to solve some issues in this current price $25k so that my neighbors will not laugh at me and my family because, I hat begging people to borrow money to solve problems than to use what I have at the moment to solve it. Well, if I sell the BTC now I will not regret because I bought the BTC when the price was $20k last year, and if I sell now at least I have little profits to make to solve the problem because there will surely be another bear to buy and hold again. I was told that some people have been holding BTC over 7 or 8 years for the price of BTC to reach a particular price of their choice before they can sell, does it mean they don't have issues to solve by selling their BTC? Or they have other way to get the money to solve the issues without selling their BTC? because it hard me to hold long like one year when there are some important things to buy. Not that I don't make profits when I hold, but to hold for that particular price to come to pass is the major challenge to me, can you share your idea on how to make it real in the future for that your target price to come to pass, so that people that are facing the same problem like me will learn.",

All-time-high would be after halving. It will not occur immediately, it would be some months after halving.

Issues to solve is inevitable to all human beings, and as such that doesn't mean those who had invested in Bitcoin for more that 7 to 8years don't have issues to solved, but it only mean that those people understood the principle of investing than ordinary newbies who to some borrow money to invest in Bitcoin or invest their life savings with little or no knowledge knowing how the scheme works. Because if you have been conversant with crypto/investment forum thread, I'm sure you might have come across where people say \"Invest an amount you can always afford to lose\" or \"invest an amount you won't be in need for over a period of time\"",

I feel two things on your scenero. It is either you had yourself a too much \"high target\" or you only relied your source of income at one. But I can say to you that if you have bought a BTC at $20K and was expecting to resell at $100K but later sold at $25K, you didn't lost at least you made a profit of $5K. Depending on your nature of financial issues if not you can reinvest with some of this money realized else you are doomed to your financial independency.Besides, if you as an Investor has many in stock with a higher level of demands, it is wise to sell out in such quantity despites the lower interests with your thoughts of restocking.The market places doesn't always goes as expected at times as the goal is a make very high rate of interests but better you gain w little than you lost it or even lost to your capitals.",

Not that I don't make profits when I hold, but to hold for that particular price to come to pass is the major challenge to me, This is because you are not following the rules of bitcoin investment, which says invest in a long term,like in four years or more and only use the money that you can afford to lose to invest so that you wouldn't worry about your investment or depend on it. From what you said,I can see it that you invested in a short time and you  are using the money made for important thing to invest or you don't have a steady cash inflow that is making you to go back and sell your investment without achieving your bitcoin price target.Quote from: Zanab247 on September 11, 2023, 04:36:06 PMcan you share your idea on how to make it real in the future for that your target price to come to pass, so that people that are facing the same problem like me will learn.Only use money that you can afford to lose and have patient with your investment because you need to invest in a long term. Get a job,if you don't have one. And if you already have then it isn't OK,you should look for a second means of income to make it two sources.You should sell your bitcoin if you are broke,so that you can use it to take good care of your family and hope to re-invest again with a prepared mind.",

No body knows his end point. Death might be knocking at one's gate while expecting high. When it's hard, you  sell but not all. Sell what you can afford to buy not selling entirely.And mean while dont starve to buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin should be accumulated when you have extra cash on you just like profit. I was made to know from this forum that in as much as we investing Bitcoin, we should do other mini jobs to be backing up the Bitcoin potfolio.. not just depending on Bitcoin future and become less concerned of other hustle. Otherwise you will end up withdrawing it.You should sell some of your Bitcoin and start a business that yeiled you money to support your crypto journey or dream. Example>>(1) car for bolts.(2) Pig 🐖 farming (3) poultry farming (4)pos business or restaurant. Maybe profit made can be used to assist your Bitcoin journey.",

That is why people often say, only invest money you can afford to lose, money you can afford to risk, and money you won't need for several years until you reach your goal. I am aware that people earn differently and are wealthier than one another. What I can invest for a long time cannot be the same as what my neighbour can do because we do not earn the same amount or have the same personal issue that requires money to be resolved. The greatest thing you can do is sell your Bitcoin and utilise the money earned to solve your problem. Only a healthy and steady individual can stay in bitcoin to watch their assets develop; a distressed or weak individual cannot. At the very least, you haven't lost any money because you purchased at a cheaper price than this. Simply take care of your finances and plan accordingly how to invest it, even if it is little by little, rather than pouring everything into it and then withdrawing part to deal with personal problems.",

      "body": "Quote from: Zanab247 on September 11, 2023, 04:36:06 PMI was told that some people have been holding BTC over 7 or 8 years for the price of BTC to reach a particular price of their choice before they can sell, does it mean they don't have issues to solve by selling their BTC? Or they have other way to get the money to solve the issues without selling their BTC? because it hard me to hold long like one year when there are some important things to buy. Not that I don't make profits when I hold, but to hold for that particular price to come to pass is the major challenge to me, can you share your idea on how to make it real in the future for that your target price to come to pass, so that people that are facing the same problem like me will learn.How are we sure say some people dey hodl their btc for that long? Even if there people who hodl that long, na how many percent of people? Moreover no be individuals wey still dey find wetin dem go eat dey try that. Most hodlers for that long na institutions, big boys like Elon musk dem and that level of people wey no need money for anything but you wey need money, abeg sell your coins take solve your problem except no be pressing need after all you buy am for profit and if you don already make profit den you no dey lose . However, na bull run dey come so, e depends on your neeed.",
