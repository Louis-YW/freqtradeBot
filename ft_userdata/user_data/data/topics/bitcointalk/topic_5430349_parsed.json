Yeah this is literally the first time I ever did this and I been using Bitcoin since 2013 TBH I mostly started off always just checking the first few, then I later in life I decided I would USUALLY check the last few as well.Never had an issue until someone decided its a good idea to have addresses created with the same first few charatcers.Like who the hell actually thought that was a good idea? Cmon I'm not the only one who would do this.Its whatever it still looks stupid to me, having a bunch of Bitcoin addresses having the same first few characters? Jesus man that is dumb.I'm dumb too and thats the point.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on December 20, 2022, 04:14:09 AMWhen I was a kid I used to have the first generation Nintendo DS.The Pokemon Diamond game was the one I had, and I also had an Action Replay.The Pokemon cartridge would go in the female part, and the male part would go into the Nintendo DS.If I wanted say:x999 Rare CandiesorLvl 99 Arceus on next wild grass encounterthen that cheat had a specific line of code you had to enter into the Action Replay software on your computer before putting it into the DS.the cheat codes looked like this, and they could easily be found online back then.Now,If I entered a code, and it didn't work when I booted up the game, almost 99% of the time it's because I made a typo in the line.All it takes is one character to fuck up.Before I send btc, before I receive btc, usually anything that has to do with verifying addresses...I scan the fuck out of the address with my eyeballs sometimes until they start to hurt or I'm certain malware hasn't changed the address on me.
