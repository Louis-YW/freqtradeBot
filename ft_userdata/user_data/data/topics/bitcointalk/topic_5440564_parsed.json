  "content": "This list is to share and discuss services that offer P2P lending/borrowing functionality for lenders who provide loans to borrowers who provide bitcoin collateral without KYC requirements. The purpose of P2P lending services is to allow the borrower to use the value of their Bitcoin without having to sell it. For example, a lender is offering loans at 10% APR and 50% LTV Ratio (Loan to Value) for one year. A borrower can lock $10,000 USD worth of Bitcoin (say, 0.5 BTC) to borrow $5,000 USD. The 0.5 BTC will remain locked and can be unlocked at any time as long as the amount loaned and interest is repaid before the end of the loan period (one year).There are many solutions right now that offer this functionality, however most of them require KYC. As far as my research goes, HodlHodl is the only P2P Lending Platform which has no KYC requirements. Do you know of any other platforms? If so, share and discuss! Valid platforms/services will be listed here in the OP.P2P Lending Platforms without KYC requirements1. lend.HodlHodl.com2.

The same way p2p markeplaces are following (latest exemple with localbitcoins)Thank you for those two resources, added them both to the OP. I'm assuming you meant Sovryn.app instead of Sovryn.com.It is true that when platforms gain too much attention or grow too fast, the laws catch up. It's up to them to either be vigilant and move to a friendly jurisdiction or find a way around it...most of the time they abide as it's usually a \"cornered\" situation, similar to the LocalBitcoins case. If you aren't aware of the sad news already, Local bitcoins recently announced that they were shutting down  There are some great alternatives out there though.",

Valid platforms/services will be listed here in the OP.I do not see that lending and borrowing platforms that do not require KYC from their customers will live long, so how will they prevent abuse such as money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing and others if they do not adhere to and apply these standards while fighting fraud and financial crimes, I see that the important thing is to determine the appropriate platform that provides an excellent return to lenders from the currency that they will lend it and that this platform is legitimate, safe, and long-lived. Borrowers also need a platform to obtain bitcoins or other assets at a low and reasonable interest rate. I like the CoinRabbit platform, as it is the most popular on your list and does not require KYC, and other platforms require KYC, like Spectrocoin.com and Moneytoken.EU, I haven't found more platforms that don't require KYC. There will be a risk if we put an unpopular platform that doesn't require KYC and it turns out to be a scam in the end.",
