  "content": "When I fooled around with the BTC value at msg date demo, I implemented a simple API to get the BTC price in dollars at a specific date, as an image.For dates between 2010-10-17 and 2023-01-27, I'm using the closing quotes from a static list, downloaded from https://coincodex.com.From 2023-01-28, I'm appending this list daily, with the XBX average from https://www.coindesk.com.Queries specifying dates before 2010-10-17 yield 0. Queries with dates in the future yield the latest known quote (this limitation will be removed in a future version ).I store each quote in whole dollars - queries with large quantities (specified with nof) may suffer from rounding errors.Because of time zones and daily volatility, the quotes should be considered approximate; in any case, I take no responsibility for the accuracy, performance or longevity of this service.Syntax examples [img]https://ztt.se/btc:quote[/img]  ¬†=> ¬†   ¬† ¬†No date equals today.  [img]https://ztt.se/btc:quote?date=2013-06-09[/img]  ¬†=> ¬†   ¬† ¬†Specific date.  [img]https://ztt.se/btc:quote?date=2013-06-09&nof=2[/img]  ¬†=> ¬†   ¬† ¬†Number of coins.  [img]https://ztt.se/btc:quote?img=col:green[/img]  ¬†=> ¬†   ¬† ¬†Image colour. Here's a long one with date and nof parameters and an img parameter with options pointsize, colour, background colour (semi-transparent), font and border (remove white-space):Code:[img]¬†¬†https://ztt.se/btc:quote ?¬†¬† ¬†date=2021-11-09 &¬†¬† ¬†nof=1.5 &¬†¬† ¬†img=ps:24 + col:DeepSkyBlue4 + bcol:$FECC0280 + font:Snap-ITC + border:10x4[/img]The basic URI is https://ztt.se/btc:quote which yields a PNG image with text on a transparent background.Append a questionmark ? to this if you want to add parameters.Separate multiple parameters with ampersand &.Separate multiple parameter options with plus +.A parameter can be a singleton, or a name-value pair; use the equal sign = to separate name and value.A parameter option can be a singleton, or a name-value pair; use a colon : to separate name and value.Dates must be specified in YYYY-MM-DD format.Note: This gives the price in dollars for bitcoin (1 coin or as many as specified with the nof parameter) at a specific date (specified with the date parameter). On its own, it does not show address balancies or anything else.",

So i suggest you to create a thread for this on Project Development[3], maybe you can create it as version 3 with some conversions too? Idk.But anyway this is a useful site, especially to sellers in Marketplace and those who are active in auctions who usually use a dynamic price in USD, BTC or EUR.

Can you retrieve prices with a shorter time history for no date query (eg closing price in the last 1 hour).For everyone's information: use \"&\" to combine multiple queries like color and date at once.
