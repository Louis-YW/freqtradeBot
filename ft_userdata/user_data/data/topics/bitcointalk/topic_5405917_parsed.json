Unlike the market, projects come into existence and get out of the market. This is the reason why experts always suggest to invest on top listed cryptocurrencies. Many projects that didn't grow in the initial days have taken years for its big progress. So, we can't get into conclusion which cryptocurrency will end or survive for the long.",

Many projects won’t survive when things turn and they have to stand on their own. Much of the crypto market has been exposed as a house of cards as a result of the recent bankruptcies. This likely means that many crypto projects operating today are zombies that have just yet to be exposed as bankrupt.",

Well, honestly, this is not a news cus it is something that have always happened with every bull run and bear market that follows it, this industry is currently filled with a lot garbage businesses/projects built not as to offer anything or contribution to the growth of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies ecosystem, but built as a means to which the developers or owners of such project can grab money from as many victims (in the name of investors) they can catch, This is why we all need to be very careful as to what coin or project we throw our hard earned money into. Quote  Some fiat money will also die.By fiat money, I want to believe you mean stablecoins, if I am correct, then I say yes to that.But if you mean the traditional paper money, I did say that it might happen, but I don't think it happen in this generation, it is true that we all want fiat to go and let Bitcoin and other crypto currencies take over, but this can not happen anytime soon, and beside, I honestly think both fiat and Bitcoin can still co-exist in our financial system.",
