      "body": "You have to wait until they verify your IDs. It is usually quick but may take up to 2 business days in certain circumstances. For instance, it's the long weekend in the US now and you may need to wait until Tuesday.You also most likely won't be able to immediately cash out your local currency using a linked bank account and will have to wait for about ten days, I think. They hold funds for security reasons, so they are not immediately available. But Coinbase is one of the most regulated and transparent companies, so If you're looking that is not scammy - it's a good choice. They have the UDS/USDC pair on both Ethereum and Polygon networks.",

HiYou only need very simple advice for this as you just have to turn your mind to another option by using the USDC to buy Bitcoins and then converting the Bitcoins to USD so you can withdraw them to any bank account you want. If you use the Coinbase exchange, you will definitely see the BTC-USD pair there and you can use that to cash out your assets to USD or to the account you want.Apart from that, you can also use other exchanges such as Bitstamp, but in my opinion the Coinbase exchange is enough to make such simple transactions which are not even complicated at all. So there's no need to panic and feel upset about that because you can search more about the exchange and also the currency pairs you have on coinmarketcap",

Tip could be use Binance or ByBit with your USDC, since Binance don't cater USDC now, convert it to USDT if you want to use Binance else you can use ByBit.",

      "body": "Binance is actually good but where you are right now, the exchange that you'll use to withdraw USDC and convert it into USD and have it deposited into your bank account really depends. Check Coinbase if the documents you have submitted were already approved because it's most likely that they're not. P2P is a common way where you can have it easily deposited but you might take time in finding one that's also available in that country. You have to spend time in researching what's the best market there in Malaysia.",

Why not tried that, and instead of usd use your own malaysian bank or remittance supported. Usually if you did your kyc it will be a smooth deal always on p2p as long as you pick those legit buyers and sellers.",

Their P2P trading platform can easily let you convert your USDC to USD or any other currency without any issues if you do Level 1 identity verification which isn't much of a lengthy process and also doesn't take much time.I've been using Binance for 2 years now and I've never faced any issues with it. You should give it a try and shouldn't listen to those false reviews which most probably are from their competitors to drag them down.",
