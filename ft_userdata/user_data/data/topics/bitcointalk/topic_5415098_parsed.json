  "content": "Up for auction is a 2013 LEALANA UNFUNDED / BUYER FUNDED Ag #789 (answering the age old question, \"Why is 6 afraid of 7...\") with BLACK ADDRESS      What's the deal with the black address? I'm not sure of the veracity of the claims below, but my guess is that Stack's Bowers got their information from YouTube:\"Only 2,000 Lealana 0.1 Bitcoins were issued in silver, and this buyer-funded example with a black address is a great rarity, one of only 10 issued. It is considered part of the limited Series 1 Lealana coins, offered before the address color was changed to green in May 2014 to comply with regulations.\"https://auctions.stacksbowers.com/lots/view/3-TYP2B/2013-silver-lealana-01-bitcoin-btc-no-3605-series-1-unredeemed-buyer-funded-black-address-troy-ounce-999-silver-25mm-sp-7 Also, would you look at that sale price, WTAF?! CryptoVice's August 2017 YouTube video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLWpSKAkCA0Whatever the facts are (and members feel free to comment with factual info) it's undisputable that this is a beautiful coin, and something of a rarity.
