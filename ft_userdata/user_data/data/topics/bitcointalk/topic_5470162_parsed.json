I guess he meant the microSD card slot. But its a bit confusing for me aswell. To OP:I just checked the docs of Braiins+ OS and it seems like the S19K Pro is not supported. No guarantee though, as I don't know exactly when the documentation was updated.This may be because the S19K Pro uses an Amlogic control board, as @skot also suspected.",

He means Micro USB, the Amlogic C76 A113D has no Sd/Tf card slot, only a Micro USB, regardless, as Phill mentioned above, the k version is not supported by BraiinOS yet.I also have a paranoia over the letter K in any Antminer Bitmain makes, this letter brings back sad memory of the S9k, I think k stands for KABOOM!, Bitmain collects all the bad chips and stick them on all the bad control boards they have and ship them to us like hot potatoes.",

I would not advise changing this control board and keep using the same fans with some adapter, you may burn it.It is NOT supported in Braiins OS+ yet, work is currently in progress. As always, any new miner model/variation needs to be carefully studied and tested to have a reliable clean implementation.The faster others release, the more you should worry about them taking shortcuts. But its your miners at risk, YMMV...",
