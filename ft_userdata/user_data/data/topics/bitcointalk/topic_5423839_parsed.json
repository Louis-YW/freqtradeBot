Without any statistics to prove, I'll say that happens 1 in every 10,000 altcoins.How then can you tell your not throwing away your money in a trash in the name of an altcoin investment.In the case of bitcoin, there is a lot of securities on it and all you've got to do is keep buying and hold. A time would come when the price would sky rocket as well.",

Bitcoin is in fact a safe investment asset where becoming worthless would have been extremely unlikely had it not been for technical failures and worldwide bans. Altcoin prices always follow bitcoin price movements, so I tend to recommend bitcoin to them rather than altcoin at first.But if they have enough money to buy both, then I also wouldn't be against them wanting to diversify their assets. But for now, regardless of the funds you have, you should choose bitcoin as the main investment asset as long as the price is still low.",

If it fails all altcoins will fail and lose value. Let's say you choose bitcoin. It comes with some degree of risk. You can gain or lose money from this investment.If you buy an altcoin instead you're taking the risk that bitcoin brings plus additional risk of the altcoin failing on top of it. Luna is a great example where it went from about $300 to 0 but bitcoin did not. If Bitcoin were to go to 0 you could expect luna and all other altcoins to follow.",

As for me, I will advice people to go for bitcoin because of its high adoption and utility and because it will still also increase in price during bull run. Anyone that is looking for more profit can go for altcoins, but they should remember the risks, like Luna, UST collapse and the recent FTT collapse, any altcoins can do that, which means it is just gambling while investing in altcoins. Bitcoin is better.",

Hodling is a btc nutjob cult thing, if you want to earn profit you have to sell.BTC price can only multiply at a maximum of ~5X the peak in a given 5 year cycle.Altcoins due to their lower price have a higher multiple of ~10X to ~50X capacity in a 5 year cycle.Traders know altcoins is where the maximum profit$ are located.So you only need to decide are you a trader interested in earning profit$ or a BTC Cult member that hodl just because the cult says so.",

Decimal is not the measure of how you should trust bitcoin, just do the mathematical conversions but what is expected is for you to invest the amount you can afford in your capacity with bitcoin, everyone has always claim been good with their alts not until you invest and have such ugly surprises from them.",

Because altcoin is not a true decentralized cryptocurrency, it is extremely risky. Bitcoin is truly decentralized and low risk. At the very least, you won't lose everything like Luna.

Is having some bitcoins (in decimals) more valuable still than having the value of one good altcoin? Based on my personal experience, buy just bitcoin. Buying bitcoin you know exactly what you are buying, buying an altcoin is always a risk and a bet. Besides very few altcoins, I would say ETH, BNB and I'm already struggling to name a third one, all the others could go up just like they could disappear, no matter the community they have. The community can pump the price up, but if there is no real use what do you think it's going to happen in the long run?",

There will be the debates about that altcoins have gained more than what bitcoin has gained and that's okay.If you think that there will be an altcoin that will gain more than bitcoin then suggest it to the others or do it on your own.

Is having some bitcoins (in decimals) more valuable still than having the value of one good altcoin? You also have to factor the risk though, altcoin is much volatile than bitcoin, hence it is more riskier, can go literally 0 to x amount in hours, just for pure pump and dump. But what will happen after that? and there are investors who think that the price can continue to go on a parabolic rise, and when it goes down as hard as it goes up, then everything is messed up in your end.So if you are a investor who is smart and wise and wanted to sleep at night knowing that your invested  will not go to 0 and be too big to fall, then obviously, BTC is the right choice. For me yes, having some bitcoins in your wallet and then continue to accumulate overtime (in decimals) is good for the long term as compare to some good but riskier altcoin.",
