  "content": "As we all know, Bitcoin is decentralized, and in its early days, we were proud of that fact--believing no government could control it and even thinking it might replace fiat. Those were the days when we were highly optimistic about Bitcoin’s future.However, with the current AML (Anti-Money Laundering) policies in place, it seems like Bitcoin’s decentralization is being challenged by regulations, especially with the introduction of KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements.Here's a brief definition of AML and money laundering for context.QuoteMoney laundering is a type of financial crime. It involves taking criminally obtained proceeds (dirty money) and disguising their origins so they’ll appear to be from a legitimate source. Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to the activities financial institutions perform to achieve compliance with legal requirements to actively monitor for and report suspicious activities.https://www.sas.com/en_ph/insights/fraud/anti-money-laundering.htmlCan we still enjoy the decentralized nature of bitcoin?",

Decentralisation is becoming harder and harder as days go by just like you said. However we still have the bitcoin network as a decentralised network no matter what. Of course the government wants to be in control every single time, however the nature of bitcoin is fully based on decentralisation starting from mining down to even price.The best way we can assist is for more people to key into decentralisation especially because of it's importance and freedom. Another important thing is to vote in the right leaders. Most topics about Trump and this election is to endeavour people to vote someone who's in support of the bitcoin and decentralisation network and not someone against it.",

They might create some action on how they could able to maximize the potential of bitcoin then would never think about doing some bad actions towards this asset.",

The decentralization nature of bitcoin has been affected due to KYC policies, especially in Europe, and it's something that has made things harder but certainly not impossible. There are still options, such as P2P exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs (even though some ask for identification and/or have excessive fees), or meeting in person, but it's definitely more complicated than it used to be in the past, especially if you were used to an era where all this wasn't necessary.",

P2P can be done without centralized exchanges. I do not need to go the an exchange before sending bitcoin to a family member or a friend or someone. I see those exchanges to be used for spot, margin and derivative trading. Some have P2P but you can make bitcoin transaction without them. Bitcoin remain decentralized and nothing is changing that. For convenience, some people can go for centralized exchanges.",

The decentralization of Bitcoin is still stand.Of course everyone knows that Bitcoin is decentralized, but that’s not what I'm trying to raise here. When I mention Bitcoin, AML, and KYC, I’m talking about how regulations have evolved. Remember when Bitcoin was viewed as the gateway to massive adoption and freedom? Now, as adoption grows, we see the government stepping in, regulating heavily, and squeezing out that anonymity we once thought was core to Bitcoin. It's less about its technical aspects and more about how regulation changed the way we experience it.@Charles-Tim (it's not about the technical thing)",

If it wasn't decentralized, we would be seeing so much issue arising. We would be seeing people controlling which transaction to include and which not to. You can still open your own wallet and make transactions without any third parties being involved. As long as you aren't dealing with fiat currencies or centralized exchange/institutions, you don't have to be worry about the government. There is no government yet that controls bitcoin.

Exchanges wouldn't be this strict without government intervention, as they aim to satisfy their clients, you know, the more traders they have, the higher their profits.Take Binance, for example. It’s one of the biggest exchanges, but due to a lack of regulations or internal controls, they got tagged for money laundering, leading to CZ’s removal as CEO and got imprisoned for violating the law. So, let’s leave the past behind and focus on the present. There are still ways to stay anonymous, but they're quite limited. As mentioned, P2P transactions are possible (except Binance p2p), but they're high-risk. Most of us now have probably come to accept these strict regulations, but what's key is that the government still can’t control Bitcoin’s network- or even its price.",
