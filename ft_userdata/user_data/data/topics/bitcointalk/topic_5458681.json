Do not fall for the Fear of Missing Out because the opportunities always existing in the market especially if you train your mind to see it. People do not see those opportunities because they never invest in their knowledge. You have money to make investment but why don't you have spair money for your education? Lack of knowledge will lead you to incur losses and the only one to cure it is to make an investment in yourself. The investment that you will do is not for short term only, but it can help you to achieve a lot of great things in life. So what are you doing now? Don't hesitate and make sure that you should invest in your mind. Understand what you are investing onAs you would for any investment, understand exactly what you’re investing on by having enough knowledge about how it works. RiskYou cannot be profitable if you do not know how to accept the risk, majority of people ignoring it and that is why they keep losing. Be aware on how much money you can incur before the trade and in that way you can have an idea if the investment is worth it or not.Remember the Past is Past A mistake that many new investors make is looking at the past and extrapolating that to the future. Yes, Bitcoin used to be worth pennies, but now is worth much more, so investors look to the future, not to what an asset has done in the past. What will drive future returns, Traders buying a cryptocurrency today need tomorrow’s gains, not yesterday’s.Pardon me if this topic already exist or there are more important ones I was supposed to include, but you can as well share your knowledge and advice for us to learn and improve.",

Anyway you have shared some good tips but these are too basics too know for a newbie to start trading. I saw many many threads containing basic advices for trading. To be a good trader or a Bitcoin Investor you must have knowledge about price prediction. So to be a good price Predictor I am also shared some of own experiences.You can check here : Beginners Should Follow These To Be A Good Price Predictor I am adding some tips here : 1. To grab the best price for investment or trading always enter the market when others are selling but similarly always for the upward or downward trend.2. Always keep eyes on future events and regular crypto News. They can manipulate crypto market harder. 3. Avoid emotions and grow a trading strategy. Also you must have risk management because losing and wining trade is a part but we have to minimalise losing and have to maximize wining. So always do technical analysis with proper risk management and funds management.",

Desire -> knowledge -> experience -> consistencyFor me, there is nothing too special if someone wants to become an investor for beginners.From my experience, just the four things I mentioned will bring a beginner to become a successful investor.From desire will give birth to knowledge in someone who wants to become an investor. Armed with the knowledge gained by continuing to learn, they will understand that in investing there will be such a thing as the risk of losing money so that it will become an experience.Experience will bring someone to understand when the best time to buy and sell and others.For those who are not ready for the risks that will be accepted, they will stop there. But for those who continue to be consistent, then they will continue with the belief that they will reach the desired goal.",

Be aware on how much money you can incur before the trade and in that way you can have an idea if the investment is worth it or not.Risk management is important if a trading wants to be successful. You need to calculate your risk to reward ratio because as you are targeting for profit that is also how you need to look at the risk you want to incur. You don't have to let loose yourself at your greed appetite for profit because the market can rebounce back to entry price and probably start any opposite trend and that is the reason to also apply stop loss to how much you are willing to loss to how much you are willing to gain in any particular trade.",

      "body": "You have written some great points and I really like the risk factor because you should be aware of the top profit you could get by risking your capital if they are worth taking a risk then why hesitate? But if the profit is less and the loss is more as per capital then why take the risk? Leave the idea at that time and wait for a good entry point.I think you forget to mention the most important factor for becoming a good investor which is money and how to divide your money which means how to perform DCA. I have read a topic here in the trading discussion in which op has shared a great idea of putting your money into and asset like BTC. He said we should invest according to the dip in the last 24 hours that the token had. For example, if in the last 24 hours, BTC is down by 2% then only invest 2% of your capital. This will increase the profit ratio and decrease the loss ratio. I really like that idea. But unfortunately, everything has limitations and this idea is limited due to the downtrend in BTC is not that much like even if the BTC pumped or dumped 10% you will invest 10% of your capital which is very low but that 10% in BTC is not low it lit a great impact on the whole market.As a result a newbie should set his mind on the profit he is expecting and how much risk is involved, when to book profit, is he trading or holding because saying investment means both but both holding and trading are two different things so he has to be aware of that.",

What's left is patience to achieve the results of the holding / investment because the investment is not made in a short time, so it takes patience to do it. What might be difficult later is the condition during the holding, market conditions will not be as smooth as you expect, there are often even sudden market drops which make many people lose patience, panic, and end up selling Bitcin at a low price.
