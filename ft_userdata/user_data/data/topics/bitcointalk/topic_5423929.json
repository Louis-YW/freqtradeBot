      "body": "Taking stocks and bonds as examples of securities, government and companies can provide that for investors to buy, while in return, the investors expect the stock and bond value to appreciate in price as the company grows and they will benefit from it as their money appreciate in value. With security, you do not buy any goods but what is just offered by an organization.Commodity is used to compare security, the difference is that commodities are goods, like gold, other metals and oil. As more people also demand for commodity, their price appreciate, just like gold, crude oil and bitcoin.Bitcoin is different, it is a commodity, not offered by government, company or any central authority, it is decentralized unlike altcoins which can still be regarded as securities.Both are differentiated because they are regulated by different agencies. Security Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities while commodities are regulated by another agency, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).",

This is clearer I think so. A more safer investment like what stocks, bond and commodities do and are under regulated umbrella, shares of companies included as it has government eyes and involvement, guiding by agencies through government. Is that saying also that agencies cover by government can not go bankrupt and investors lose money?",

This has happened before.. Imagine a war lol.Btw, isnt it fun to be a part of the journey watching that we have come from a magic internet money era to a recognizable commodity soon to be the global e-currency of the future.

A more safer investment like what stocks, bond and commodities do and are under regulated umbrella, shares of companies included as it has government eyes and involvement, guiding by agencies through government. Commodities are more like wheat and grain that could be replaced (such as artificial rubies replacing naturally occurring ones). Quote from: gantez on November 28, 2022, 02:31:23 PMIs that saying also that agencies cover by government can not go bankrupt and investors lose money? It depends but it's likely holding a firm a government considers essential (such as a utility firm - electricity, water, Internet) you're probably unlikely to lose money if you buy it while it's financially stable and producing profit (the government will likely buy it off you for more than it's worth if you're in a country that isn't corrupt and sell it for less than it's worth - to help institutions as governments can generally loan money for \"free\" -from themselves - provided it's well spent).",

Ether was pre-mined and sold as an ICO which still also makes it a security. Going from PoW to PoS, becoming more centralized making it just to be a security.",

If they talk about Bitcoin, then it's true since no one can control Bitcoin.",

      "body": "For Belgium to clarify or verify it means they are interested to legalize it. Security for any asset is the duty of the government for enabling environment for investors and businesses. Bitcoin is more secure than Ether because of their creations. Ether is more centralized to bitcoin. And government likes to participate in a centralized system because they can control the system but in the decentralized system they can not. As it is bitcoin is already secured so if Belgium is clarifying anything it might be Ether.Why bitcoin is not secured in Belgium? If bitcoin bis secured in Belgium then is not secured all over the world.",
