      "body": "My take is that in the land of the free you should be able to grow and light on fire whatever you want as long as it isn’t hurting anyone else. I’ve lived in states with legal marijuana use since 1996 and I’ve never seen it be a major problem. The only real concern I have is that people could be less effective drivers, but I’d still bet an average person high on marijuana is a better driver than someone 70+ years old. Still, I think better tests to more accurately assess impaired drivers is probably necessary.",

When used moderately the user can be able to control his behavior or other activities. I have observed that the prohibition of the use of marijuana always give rise to the use of other dangerous drugs that cannot be easily dictated. Law enforcement agencies can easily arrest someone smoking marijuana but it would be very difficult to identify someone that puts few hard drugs into his mouth. Some persons have agued that the use of drugs could lead to financial crisis because of the cost of these drugs. Marijuana is relatively cheaper than most drugs which means it could hardly have negative impact on the finance of a moderate user. Apart from the health problems associated with smoking and the abuse of marijuana, I think legalizing it might reduce dangerous drug trafficking and use.",

      "body": "Freedom dictates that one may do whatever he wants, as long as he injures nobody else.Government should advertise the dangers of marijuana a hundred times more than they do, with the true scientific studies to back them. Then let the people be free.It is standard in common law right now, that if a person injures someone else, he should be made to repay the injury. We don't need any special drug laws. Only good, solid advertising.If someone damages himself because he won't accept the 'advertising', let his family or the church take care of him. Why should the people, through taxes, be forced to bear the burden of someone doing self-harm, especially after he has been warned over and over?",

But when most humans are given too much freedom, then believe me. Actually destroying a generation. Balanced rules and norms can make people self-aware and not act as they please. And the most fatal thing is when human rights are exalted too much, then it will backfire.Where is the proof, look at today's USA. this is illegal drug (cannabis) being legalized and having legal shooting guns. America is free but going too far, this will be terrible. You can imagine if you are already using marijuana and continue to be drunk and commit crimes with firearms, be it looting, holding up to shootings.",

If young people aren't controlled by their parents, government should step in. But regarding adults, there should be advertising by government, and then freedom rather than government restrictions.If somebody won't obey the warnings, but uses his freedom to destroy himself... well, he is free, right? He might have asked for death, so if he resists life, and firmly asks for death, finally let him have what he asks for. Let him die.",

And make sure that you have health insurance that will pay your hospital bills, because your family loves you, and they might feel obligated to take care of you when you overdose.Of course, the only way to get enough money to afford the annuity and insurance, is to sell drugs on the black market.",
