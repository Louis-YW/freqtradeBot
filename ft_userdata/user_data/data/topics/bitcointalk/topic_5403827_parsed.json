I find this good because it solves two major problems which are the reduction of green house gasses (GHG) released to the atmosphere, and also solves the high energy requirement needed to successfully keep mining/ the high electricity tariff will also be avoided.I wonder how the united states will react to this considering that russia are under multiple sanctions from them.",

I think everybody should be doing so. It doesnt matter anymore countries proclaiming to be green are now going back to using coal. No difference. But financial survival is the key to win this economic war. If the country had invested a lot for solar power, they still can mine BTC.Its time the government itself are going to mine Bitcoin especially if they cant get funds anymore from its people who will keep complaining tax.",

Going into mining tells how real blockchain is and the era of digital economy is taking over with high competitive display. Russia as a nation has many blockchain and Crypto enthusiast and I think they stepped up the game with a strong leading margin irrespective of what is been said about them. Russia is really ready and her citizens together with organizations are taking the step forward to achieve a digital economy which will drive fast and rapid growth.",

If Bitriver is registered in Switzerland, though, why won't Switzerland deal with it? It's an allegedly neutral state, but it's been implementing sanctions against Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I wonder why they didn't follow US regarding Bitriver and didn't sanction it.If it weren't a state-owned company and thus something that would help finance a terrible war, it makes sense to partner up like that, and it's potentially a positive thing if it truly helps utilize the methane that would otherwise just be waste, though. Then again, it creates a link between cryptos, which is something new, and oil, which is something old and something we should abandon in the long run, so I'm not sure it's a good thing.",

Recently Kenyan Energy Company invited investors to create cryptocurrency mining centers as more excess energy is produced. Here two companies have partnered and have signed an agreement. This is good for the investors into cryptocurrency mining, because electricity is the much needed one.",

And as you said, Switzerland is allegedly neutral country, so, for them it's easier to do that than company from EU country for example. And in general, many foreign companies continue to operate in Russia despite war. Some are doing it through offshore companies to avoid bad publicity.In normal occasion I wouldn't accept such news positively. After all, it's state owned company, not private one. And considering that war continues, there is nothing positive about this cooperation.",

By this even the oil energy usage can be minimised on cryptocurrency mining. This is really interesting and surely every nation will have large scale diary farms. When they're planned well and utilised surely bitcoin mining can be made green.",
