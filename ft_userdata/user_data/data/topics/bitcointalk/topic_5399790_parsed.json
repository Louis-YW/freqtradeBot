      "body": "The moment you cross United States border Binance will notice your IP address changed, and they could lock your account and consider it hacked, sold or stolen, especially if you use it in some exotic countries far away from US.You could use vpn to mitigate this, but that could create even bigger problem for you, so I would suggest using P2P websites that don't have any mandatory kyc, like LocalCryptos, HodlHodl, AgoraDesk, etc.",

      "body": "Binance.us is a version of Binance that is intended for the US only due to the heavy regulation.Â  You can use Binance only outside the US.The exchange that has a p2p feature is on a Binance version only not on the Binance.us version. VPN might good option but it should be used upon creation if you start using a VPN but upon your current situation, it will change the IP address that was recently used which might put your account at high risk. See this for the big list of p2p exchange platforms including p2p.[BIG LIST] Buy/Sell Crypto (OTC, P2P, DEXs, CEXs, NO-KYC, ATMs, etc.)",

      "body": "Why not use other exchanges like Kucoin exchange based on their terms they do allow you to trade without KYC verification.So you can also able to trade on their P2P exchange. The only problem is that they only have a few listed sellers on their P2P unlike Binance on their .com domain but still worth as your other option to trade P2P.",

      "body": "Keep in mind that KYC is mandatory for both binance.com and binance.us, I doubt you'd be able to trade if you're from one of the prohibited countries/states. Using VPN won't help as well bc it only changes your IP and not the citizenship on your papers.",
