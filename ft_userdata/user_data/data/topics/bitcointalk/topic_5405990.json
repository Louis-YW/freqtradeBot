Bitcoin Core. It is an open source of software which is used to connect bitcoin users  as node.

And Agbe you have done well by investing in the knowledge building of students in your area, I encourage you to cover more topics such as blockchain and finances. I have a similar charity program currently running for some time, but my mind is focused on young graduates and not secondary school students as I view them to be too young to be bordered by the problematic financial economy and monetary theories but then I still believe your initiative to the cash they mind young.You can check this thread on my Charity work and let me know any area you need assistance and guidance, keep up the good work bro.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5393390.msg59779632#msg59779632",

Also, you spent it on a really good cause, which will surely motivate someone else too to do the same.I would like to ask some questions, I hope you will reply back to them.1. Are you teaching Bitcoin to everyone or a certain age group/gender?2. If a certain age group/gender, why not everyone? 3. Are you sure they are understanding the actual concept of Bitcoin and not just the monetary value?Good Luck!",

The basic school system teaches very little about what one would experience in real life, thank you for changing that a bit.I am actually more excited you are teaching investments, I would assume that would come with financial education and how to manage money which is a core component of making investments. Also utilize resources like books, videos or articles to make the lessons more fun for the kids, or those who are interested.You can consider linking all your previous threads on this topic together, so viewers can easily follow the conversation.",

And this usually translates into students not understanding everything perfectly. And unfortunately, in the bitcoin world, misunderstandings can easily translate into funds lost.I don't want you stop teaching them, no way, you're on the great direction. Just you too have to keep learning.",

And it's not just all about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and blockchain but all about technology which will open their minds that there is certainly a lot of it. I think this can be expanded in other nearby schools if you go ahead and ask for some help and support from the local officials.",

      "body": "Brilliant, Agbe. Think I've seen your previous posts before -- I always say and repeat: keep things simple, for the sake of simplicity, it's okay to sacrifice technical accuracy so you get the kids motivated and interested. Eventually, we all learn more and correct our assumptions, and realise later some assumptions aren't important to the userThe concern shouldn't be to correct at this stage, but to provide a basic foundation. And perhaps at this stage, it's more of economics than of computer science I would question teaching trading/investment though, even if it is Bitcoin's biggest use case at the moment, and yes, that is unpopular to accept.",

Now that yours have come, please kindly re-read the OP, the last statement with the link and understand classes that are involved. That is not withstanding. let me answer them but please still read the first thread for more understanding. answering your questions1. It is for certain classes (JSS 1-SS3)2. When you say everyone, it means even nursery and primary one, which is not good. so I used Secondary schoo3. Yes, they are understand the actual concept based on the evaluation.",

To top it up, you're even spending your personal funds doing it. Kudos, bro.The picture of the classroom is really a sad reminder of what the education system has become in Nigeria where various elected administrations have continued to pay lips service to that sector. Strikes upon strikes from education unions have not deterred the government in anyway in their seamless efforts to run the entire system aground. It's really sad.",

What is the age range of the students?2. How many days did it take you to teach them these important concepts?3. Aside the online resources, what other offline resources do you plan on utilizing during the classes?",

I don't mind rending my 2 system for the practical class in as much as we spread the knowledge across the schools within the LGAs.

Some would put them in the 'cold wallets' camp but others wouldn't. Then there is the question if they are not cold wallets, are they hot wallets? They are not hot either. The compromise would be to not put them in either camp but add a new section just called hardware wallets. They are cold in the sense that the private keys and seeds don't touch the internet, but they are hot because they are used on computers connected to the internet.  Keep doing good and don't get discouraged for making some mistakes here and there. And don't overwhelm the kids with too much information to create an opposite effect where they lose interest in Bitcoin instead. Excellent work!",
