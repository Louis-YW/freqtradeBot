Please suggest, what can be done through this account, and on bitcointalk.Regards,We all need money and since you have a skill in PR / Marketing for dApps, Web3 projects why not give it a shot in the service section you can offer a free trial since you have not yet established your reputation here, but once you got few good feedbacks I'm sure more clients will come in, marketing is very a competitive niche, and starting is the hardest part here in Bitcointalk so you need to be fully motivated to keep going.",
