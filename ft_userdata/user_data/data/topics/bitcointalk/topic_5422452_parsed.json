AI are commands built with a programming language and the work strictly on garbage in garbage out syntax so having their own mind seems impossible since the only work based on what the were programmed to do.",

What if they have their own minds, and are able to think like humans in general. It makes me anxious and think negative things.Just like the industrial revolution had its own negative and positive consequences, that's how the advancement of Artificial Intelligence technology would be. Most people would loose their job if these robots are assigned to do the jobs of humans. Another negative consequences might be that these AI technological devices might be prone to cyber or virus attacks which can make them to malfunction which could have devastating consequences. But these robots can be more productive, accurate and could engage in risky jobs that can cause death or injury to humans. But the truth is that AI cannot totally replace man because man is creative, innovative and can handle more complicated issues than robots. Regardless of how sophisticated they are, they can never think or act like man. You don't need to be scared that AI are getting smarter because they can never be smarter than man. All you need to do as an individual is to acquire more skills or improve on existing skill so that you can be productive to your society.",

At this time, however, quantum has the ability to do a few things much faster than the fastest, most powerful, standard super computer.When the quantum computer (QC) finally becomes as fully operable as it can become, and then when AI programming is added to this QC, true thinking ability will be available to the AI. This QC with the AI will become a suitable housing for Satan to come back up from the abyss.Revelation in the Bible says that Satan will come up from the abyss (death) to rule the world for a short time before he goes to his destruction in the Lake of Fire... in the end-times of this universe.",

      "body": "\"Artificial intelligence\" chess programs might not qualify for having intelligence.There are brute force password breakers that try every possible combination of letters and numbers. They will try A. Then AA. Then AAA. B. BB. BBB. And so on. I don't think that anyone would label a brute forcer as being intelligent. It has computational capacity such as an abacus or calculator. But lacks actual cognitive ability.What many do not know is AI based chess programs are virtually identical to them. They calculate every possible move, the way that brute forcers calculate every possible password combination. Making them identical in actual levels of intelligence. One thing we know about human minds is they do not function using brute force algorithms. The function of intelligence is intuitive, deductive and associative rather than brute force in origin. If our goal is to create a computer that thinks like a human. We may have to abandon brute force based approaches in favor of algorithms with higher compression and optimization. I don't think that there are many scientists, coders or engineers in the world who are prepared to follow that route. There might be no one at all who has the will or the skillset to succeed in creating actual AI. Which could result in AI technology being doomed to failure from the onset. I would consider the arrival of our AI overlords delayed. Unless some genius comes along and develops it. But judging from recent events, the world does not appear to favor much in the way of progress or genius atm.",

What if they have their own minds, and are able to think like humans in general. It makes me anxious and think negative things.Eventually i absolutely see that as an threat. Not because they would be able to think like humans, but because they don't have to.We measure intelligence from very human centric POV. And most likely code first real human-like ai:s with same insticts that drive us. But that would mean we would need to make them want to live, or to survive. At the point when something is x times smarter then any human, we would be easily manipulated to do anything and we wouldn't even know we were manipulated.Funny thing is that if there would be such AI hiding in the plain sight, we wouldn't know it unless it allowed us to.At the current stage of machine learning however, no, we are not talking about sentient being for a very long time.

Far from it.Question is more philosophical about the concept of being sentient and if that is a human trait only, because i don't think being self aware is so special or unique that we think it is. It's just naturally devoloped skill among others so we can stay alive better.You are comparing humans to current technology, so obviously you see that humans are superior when it comes to tech as we make it and code it. Humans can be tools too, so would you compare them to knives? Why would you compare future tech to knives when we have no clue what it will be, or what it will be made of? When you imagine past current metallic robots and try to figure out how they could heal themselfes and be self-sufficient like human body, you will quickly realise that humans doesn't require \"intelligence\" for most functions, like healing itself. Most of the stuff is hard coded in by genes/insticts.And if we want to make robots that heal itself, we must learn how human bodies are so efficient on doing that. And why human body is build as it is. How synapses are working, genes telling bodies what to do etc.We can already 3d print ears and make muscle like tissue with nanotubes, we can reprogram human body in so many ways, psychologically and medically, so as we get more and more data and scietific break troughs, is it such a far fetched idea we could code self aware biotech humanoid life from scratch that have less limits then humans?",

Though the first generation of AI could greatly assist us, I believe we should not be afraid of it at first; later, when we rely heavily on AI and it becomes more advanced, I believe they will begin to fool humans and take over our world. For now AI has a lot of help into our innovations in technologies so we cant deny that they are really helpful",
