My best advice for you are to invest what you can and also to ignore the short term volatility. Bitcoin can be used as a \"Currency\" or as a speculative \"Commodity\"... so if you use it as a currency, then low volatility should not matter too much, because you spend the bitcoins when the price increase... on the other hand.. buying and hoarding Bitcoin as a commodity, should be seen as a long-term investment... where you ignore short-term volatility in the price.",

If you still worried, it's better if you learn about Bitcoin and find a good reason to trust it. What if you've reduce the invested amount, learn about Bitcoin and still not convinced in Bitcoin? that means you shouldn't invest in Bitcoin.",

It also helps you to have money for life, emergent situations and you will not have to sell your coins anytime you fall into such situations with empty hands, no cash in hands.",

      "body": "first thing to keep in mind. if you have no intention to sell every month. there is no need to be watching the price dailyso stop watching the prices dailyyou have already admitted to wanting to invest monthly so just concentrate on when to buy, dont watch the price for when to sellas for how much to investdont invest more than you need to live onset a budgetopen a spreadsheet and input how much income you get.write out all your essential bills. and then write out all your other expenses. calculate how much you can live on if you deduct out some wasteful spending to then have some spare incomethis spare income which would have just been wasted is what you would investas for idea's like DCA.people investing in fiat plans like pensions do DCA because they deposit into a fund manager and that fund manager does the hard part of looking at a group of investments for the one that has the lowest market price for the year, and invest most in the low's and less in the highs(the practice of buy low sell high)so look at a bunch of investments that have proven longevity and utility. and then look at which ones you should invest most in and which ones to invest least inmany PoS coins are speculated way too high in premium price above their means. they cost only a few dollars to mint new coins but speculate too high on the markets (ethereum costs only $50 to mine new ether at hardware+electric cost but speculates above $2000) bitcoin however has more market potential to grow. in some island area's of the pacific (japan/hawaii) bitcoin mining cost is above $140k per btc so the market has alot of potential growth of people willing to buy over say $120k as its still cheaper than mining. bitcoins efficient mining cost is $25kso the window ofbitcoin   $25k                    $140k||||||||||||||||||||||||||||         ^ ethereum $50                        $4.6k|||||||||||||||||||||||||||              ^so figure out the mining/minting costs of cryptos (their most efficient($0.04/kwh) and least efficient($0.50/kwh)* mining/minting equipment cost)then look at where the current market price is within those windows of speculation, and invest more in the ones with alot more market potential for growth using sound logic of mining/minting costs",

I understand that the hype could be very encouraging while the recent downside volatility bitcoin has experienced might seem a bit discouraging but you've got to just invest an amount that you can leave for a while and keep doing your job while you do a regular check on the market ones in a while to know the change in the price of btc.",

I already have some amount invested, but way less than I'd like to have, but I have that fear of being put on risk more than I should.First, decide if you're in it for the long term or short term. Based on what you've mentioned, it seems like you're keeping an eye on the market, which aligns more with a short-term approach. If you're aiming for the long term, there's no need to constantly monitor the market to avoid fear of uncertainty (FUD), which I think you are already experiencing.Long-term investors focus on accumulating Bitcoin over time and worry less about market fluctuations. Personally, I haven't checked the Bitcoin market for days, and I just woke up to find it crossed the $45,000 mark. This illustrates that as a long term holder, occasional price checks are sufficient, reducing the need for constant monitoring. If you're considering investing, only invest what you can afford to lose, given the market's volatility.just watch the market less often and you will see the sweet spot about investing in Bitcoin",

How do I balance a smart investment percentage without getting overwhelmed by the market's volatility?Do not force yourself into the situation of fear of missing out. First, be confident with your existing investment and create a strategy for future investment. The recommended approach is to use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). Determine a set amount and invest that amount regularly until your investment in Bitcoin reaches a particular goal. Bitcoin is here to stay, do not worry about your past, work on the present and you will have a bright future.",

As for the amount to invest with, you can use 10%from your weekly or monthly income to invest in bitcoin, so that you can buy bitcoin frequently with that amount, but it should be based on your monthly income. DCA is the best way to accumulate bitcoin because you are buying frequently irrespect of the price of bitcoin at that moment. It also make your bitcoin purchase at ease with you and you can have time to plan your income for other investments too. Make sure that you have an emergency funds available and reserve funds so that if any expenses arises you can solve it. Have a bitcoin target so that you will only concentrate on meeting up with your target by DCAing regularly and this will make you not have time to get carried away with the little fluctuations in bitcoin price. A long term investment will lower the risk in bitcoin and will make you to be able to control your emotions if you are using DCA.",
