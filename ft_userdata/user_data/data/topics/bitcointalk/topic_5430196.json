For example, the are many people there who believe Social media owned by political adversaries is a threat to the national security (Tiktok is an usual case or this discussion).If Snowden took over, the Republican establishment would go crazy about it and the democrat establishment would question whether the Kremlin would try to influence the society in America through Twitter. On the other hand, There is a chance Musk considers his offer for the sole purpose of causing displeasure among his critics.",

That's very interesting, am not surprised he requested to be paid in btc though. The question is, will Elon be willing to pay in btc, or would he rather pay him in dogecoin?   Lol, it seems to me this did this on purpose knowing Elon stands in btc. This is really interesting.",

Still it is a good thing that he proposes bitcoin payment, especially since a few people claim that bitcoin was created by the NSA   I think that makes this theory a lot more unlikely.",
