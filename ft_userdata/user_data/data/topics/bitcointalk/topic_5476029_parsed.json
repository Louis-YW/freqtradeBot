  "content": "It should be common knowledge by now that we're not supposed to leave our coins in an exchange, sadly it's not.Some people feel we should ditch centralized exchanges altogether. I buy into that idea even though I've not fully stopped using them. I don't quarrel with using centralized exchanges, my quarrel is with leaving your coins in them.Those of us who gamble might get this better. When dealing with your online casino accounts, you usually just fund them with the amount you want to use in gambling. It's usually funded from your bet accounts or wallet. You don't leave your winnings in that account. You withdraw them to your bank account or crypto wallet.The same logic should be applied to your exchange account. Fund it with just the amount you want to trade or exchange. For traders, you can withdraw your profit into your wallet and leave only the amount you want to trade with. We have an opportunity to have full control of our money. A system different from the traditional banking system, so what purpose is moving from the traditional banking system if you'll just end up keeping your money in a centralized exchange?",

Although we can’t get everyone to listen but I read a report that bitcoin supply on exchanges has reduce to around 5.4% in as much as we can’t be sure of the reports I think many people have basically taken self custody of their holdings probably because of the recent uprise of issues either regulatory or hack cases faced by exchanges most importantly top exchanges. But aside the warning of storing coins on exchanges the other reason why some people warn against exchanges especially centralized exchanges that request KYC is the fact that one’s you get your coins from them even if the coins are move to self custody wallets there is still chance of your losing your privacy ones the government comes asking for it. So aside having full control of your funds, bitcoin also has given the opportunity of going anonymous.",

Centralized exchanges have their sweet attraction that can not be denied by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts. They and you can use centralized exchanges, it's not like a dead pill that will kill us immediately when we touch and use it.It's just we must be careful when using centralized exchanges and how we assign our money for our accounts on centralized exchanges. It should be a very small part of our money. If we lose it, we will be still good enough with rest money that is not stored on centralized exchanges.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsSecure your walletsSecurity checklistNot your keys, Not your coins",

      "body": "It is common advice to treat an exchange account as a trading account and not a holding account. Holding crypto in an exchange account has a lot of benefits for example on Binance you get a good APR for holding USDT (my personal experience). Whereas holding your USDT in your personal wallet would not fetch you anything. Again they have airdrops that are quite lucrative wherein you get a good amount of new tokens that are supposed to be listed if you hold BNB. What I am telling you is that based on my personal experience that does not mean I am using the exchange wallet for holding all of my coins.Having said that what will you get if you hold your cryptos in a Gambling platform? Nothing! Sadly that is the truth and you cannot force anyone to follow the rules.   We are here because we do not accept the rules and yet your advice can be considered unless you can provide a way to generate passive income with your crypto assets in your personal wallet. I feel if you have Bitcoin or Ethereum in your portfolio then regardless of the offers provided by any centralized exchange it is better to keep them in your personal wallet.",

Moreover, there have been several centralized exchanges that have ended up experiencing problems, making us have to be careful.If we want to keep the coins for a while, that's fine. The important thing is that we always remember what we have to do and don't keep the coins for too long.It's better if we move it to another wallet that we can control fully.

But hey maybe those who have not get the meaning of why people are saying not to hold coins on CEXs. TBH I am one of those who hold on CEXs but planning to move to non custodial wallet.Actually I have to do p2p or sometime trading that's why I was keeping funds on CEXs otherwise I value your suggestion and we all should adopt it. Because if you don't own the keys then you don't own shit. Yeah I replaced the word coin with shit. heheWell, we should use CEXs for trading or relevant activity purposes, besides this holding is not one of the great uses we should chose CEXs for, and that has been proved in history so many times.",

Yes, I totally agree with you on this very statement of yours about treating our exchange accounts just like our gambling account whereby we only fund when time to use and not leave our entire savings in it, due to the fact that we do not own the private key which controls the funds on an exchange wallet and many other reasons. Because just for example, with the recent crash of a popular exchange known as FTX, which happened probably 1 & half years ago, resulting to several people losing their funds, and you kept your money there, you probably would have been a victim of it, which is why it's always good to keep holding our funds on a very secure non custodian wallet like Bluewallet or Electrum.",
