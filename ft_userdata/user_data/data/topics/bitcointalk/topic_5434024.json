  "content": "So somebody I know is currently working for some Singapore people.They are heavily recruiting members in Japan at the moment.Thats their business model:You can become a member and buy some package up to 12xxx$ in USDT or in some cases btc, smaller amounts also possible.The model is, you have to play baccarat (always betting on player) or binary option on their site, and use martingale strategy.Before playing you \"purchase\" an insurance from them , which at the highest level, when you play with 12xxx$ is 30$.So you start with 100$ and then double if necessary. If you lose 7 times the game is over and they refund you the money instantly, so the highest bet is something over 6000$. If at some point your bet wins you basically won 70$ ( base bet of 100$ minus the 30$ insurance) . You can make claim insurance once a day, but they also have promos that you can play up to 3 times daily.Basically it's a free 70$/day.Here comes the catch. Your initial deposit is stuck for 90 days and if you actually \"lose\" and claim the insurance the 90 day thing restarts. You winnings can be withdrawn daily though.Now what I am wondering, what's is their goal by offering this. You obviously can't insure martingale because this is a losing business for them. Also rake back from the casino provider doesn't pay them enough so actually make money.While recruiting member in person or via zoom meeting they talk so much like they want to go public in 3 years, opening offices here and there and so on. They also say when they registered the company in Hong Kong they made a 200 million deposit, this also sounds pretty far fetched. I mean these people live quite large, staying in fancy hotels in Tokyo and Osaka and so on, so there is money. They are also not hiding their faces or identity. Still, this deal is too good to be true and the numbers don't make any sense.What do you guys think? What's their goal with this? They say they are aware the are making minus but they want to creat a network and player base to go public, sounds bullshit to me.",

If I made a scam I would target small timers to be honest that can't afford lawyers and so on and don't have connections. Also I don't show my face in public meeting them. That's why I wonder what's actually happening.I never said I want to do it, I know the numbers make zero sense.",

Their numbers may make no sense but probably the only thing they are looking for is to catch you on, become addicted, and win from the house edge on the long term. They win enough on a 6000$ bet in order to pay the 70$.That's my assumption, it goes the same with casino's offering bonuses on deposits.",

That leaves just a ponzi scheme: \"how about you give me $12k today, and without playing anything, for the next 90 days I'll give you $100 per day? Oh, there's a hidden catch I'm not telling you about: the moment the $100 per day for all my customers gets more than I earn from new people giving me $12k, I disappear.\"QuoteIt obviously looks strange but they are mostly targeting rich Japanese business men.

The customer obviously gave the ownership of there money the moment they deposit there money in the casino due to 90 days lock in period. Also this investment has minimum investment which makes this scam scheme profitable in long run. There's no way you can win on there Bacarrat because it's rigged that's why they are confident with there insurance scheme. I will appreciate this insurance if the casino is not owned by the insurance company and offer only a fair insured value at loss.Summary:The games is riggedInvestors withdrawal will be limited to the amount of there deposit meaning there lock balance will not be claimable once they win too oftenInsurance doesn't work in gambling since chance of loss is high. Only idiots will insured gambling.",

Just the deposit is stuck for 90 days.Also, the package the customers/victims purchase (the initial deposit) have a certain value because of the 7x martingale , it's calculated and not some random number.Also, the don't promote on social media, the have face to face meetings, fly people in, pay for the hotels and so on, that is different to what you describe.And your last point, if you have no clue about Japanese society you should not comment about it. I studied it 5 years and lived there for 10. You wont make it to the top without having crossed their paths at least once, thats just a fact. But at least we agree it's a scam, just how long it's running is the question.",

They actually met with vlado at some Forex expo in Dubai 3 weeks ago, that I know is true. I think that's their exit strategy just blaming a fall guy even though it's the whole company obviously. We even have the passport copy of the runner given by 1 or the Japanese.To your question, I don't know if they offered trial account, not that I know of. Also they are not Casino owners as explained above. Withdrawals have only been in USDT, bitcoin as a deposit option was only granted on special occasions.Now I'm trying to find out more about these people. The company was called cicada. Don't know the address of the site, just there is a youtube channel, insta accounts and so on catered for Japanese customers.",
