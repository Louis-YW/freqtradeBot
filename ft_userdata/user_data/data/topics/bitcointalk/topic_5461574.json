  "content": "Hello Casino Bitcointalk Community,I am going to concentrate to write what my thoughts are and use help where necesarry knowing (hoping) many people will read it. Maybe this idea is FAR from new. Then, at least, I will get some good advice here, because it is a personal journey as well. I hope we can just have a constructive conversation. I am after nothng but obv. applying what might be a good idea Today,after a weekend full of thoughts,  I'd like to share some thoughts on a unique opportunity that lies at the intersection of free speech, online communities, and as a human right, although a tricky business (like all businesses in the world) also the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency gambling.As the owner of commonsensetv.nl, a well-established platform (2019) dedicated to free speech, once a very big platform but I wish I knew what I know now. My business skills were not that good but it was fun and the platform still exists and has a lot of potential to be the national place whe only real people can come and speak and no trolls, AI bots etcetera. For the moment we have between 1200-2000 visitors a day.I've had my fair share of experiences with the traditional advertising world, but knew too little. I've tried the usual routes - Google's AdSense, affiliate programs, and the like. While these methods have their merits, they didn't quite align with my vision. It could have make me rich, by the way. Little did I know. It was not my goal either. I stood behind the deep sense of our platform. I still do, although opinions change. I think that is a good thing.I would like to discuss an alternative path. One that not only strays from the beaten track but also bridges the gap between different online communities.My idea is simple: Instead of relying on traditional advertising methods, why not explore the potential of direct advertising within the crypto gambling community? But here's the twist - instead of limiting this to crypto-focused platforms, we introduce these opportunities to a broader audience, such as the community at commonsensetv.nl.Imagine a banner that not only promotes a crypto casino or service but also sparks a conversation about the potential of cryptocurrencies. Or a blog post that informs and entertains, subtly highlighting the benefits of a particular casino or game, while also educating readers about the broader implications of cryptocurrencies.This approach allows for a more targeted advertising strategy, fostering a sense of community and mutual growth. It also opens up the door for long-term, creative collaborations. Think sponsored tournaments, branded games, or even the development of new, innovative gambling platforms.By embracing these alternative advertising methods, we can create a more engaging, dynamic, and ultimately successful gambling sector. One that values creativity, community, and the unique opportunities that cryptocurrencies provide.I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this and look forward to exploring these opportunities together.Best Regards and I might post two or three very similar posts elsewhere on this forum. This is because I am still not sure what is the best place to attract the right people for this.",

This is a general board for Bitcoin discussion, but definitely not for discussions about anything related to casinos and advertising methods.I will report this topic and let the mods decide which board is appropriate to post it on.",

Let's take my website as an example.Now, I'm aware of AI. There's CHATGPT with all its plugins.I could write an eBook about various aspects related to Bitcoin.I have no issue with using AI as a tool to assist. However, I do have a problem with writing the eBook myself without having any knowledge about the subject.I want my friends from my website to save some coins, knowing how to and learning what to do with it. I do not want them to make the banks happy.",

It's evident that you have a passion for your platform and a desire to explore alternative advertising methods that align better with your vision. The idea of using direct advertising within the crypto gambling community and introducing it to a broader audience is intriguing. It presents an opportunity to not only promote crypto casinos or services but also engage in meaningful conversations about cryptocurrencies and their potential benefits. This approach could foster a sense of community and mutual growth, and it might resonate well with your existing audience at commonsensetv.nl. By incorporating educational and informative content about cryptocurrencies alongside advertising, you create a more engaging and dynamic experience for your readers. It allows you to showcase the broader implications of cryptocurrencies while still promoting relevant services or platforms. Sponsored tournaments, branded games, and innovative collaborations could indeed be exciting prospects for further engagement and long-term partnerships with the crypto gambling community. As you mentioned, seeking the right audience for this idea is essential. Posting similar posts in different forums can be a good approach to attract different perspectives and engage with people who might be interested in exploring these opportunities.",
