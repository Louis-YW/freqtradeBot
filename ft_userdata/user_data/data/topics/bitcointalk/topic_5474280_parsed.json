The network issues were fixed and the price of Solana go up which shows how team worked hard.It is also good to hear about the airdrops that old DEXs  on the Solana network are giving.It is awesome that your friend have done a lot of transactions on Solana and will get these airdrops. Unfortunately I am not Eligible for them because I didn't use that exchanges. Or did not use Solana network much.",

Currently, there is something that can be seen from some of the airdrops that have been received. perhaps this is a sign of a significant return to effect in the upcoming bull season",

Solana has been consistently grabbing attention of  crypto communities ever since the mini bull run began last month. Its price has surged almost 6X from its previous all time low ($8), earlier this year. Today its price broke $68 level which is considered strong resistance point. There are speculations of Solana ETF circulating in the market, confirmation is still pending.",

Though I didnt used the pyth platform on any evm supported so Im not gonna bother to check my wallet but this is a big win for those who are eligible congrats to some of here. Surely this is a big pot money on airdrop once again. Surely we feel thr airdrop vibes alrwady meaning bull run is imminent.",

From an investment perspective, Solana may not offer greater profits than some of the emerging Layer 1 projects currently. The team is working hard because they hold a significant amount of SOL tokens.The team behind SOL is working extremely harder to make the project come back to good steps of bullish candles. I'm holding SOL until it's able to retraced its price back to the top, that's when I will make my estimated profit on the projects, this cryptocurrency, we don't rush but patience speaks louder and brings significant rewards that are expected. I'm surprised to see numerous numbers of investors holding SOL in the system, it's usual facts because these projects will pump bits by bits and not some random memecoins that doesn't survived the bear season. Solana is currently $61 bucks and we are having bear market this season.",

Although I had a solana wallet at some point during the last bull run but I basically don't have a solana wallet at this time. So congratulations to everyone that got in. Pyth is an oracles provider like chainlink. Blockchains are siloed ecosystems and oracles play a fundamental role at bringing off chain data, on-chain which is why they're very useful. I wish everyone luck on the drops. Didn't make the cut for Jupiter's airdrop as well.",

I am creating this thread to share all information about good potential projects which can announce airdrop in future. I think you wrote Solana, it's too early to conclude an altcoin season bearish that fast especially with only two airdrop distributions to be made (if shared will it have an impact on the solana price pump?) it could be a price correction and down that's the time to buy, right now the price that has lasted a few weeks indicates a positive attitude towards solana and that's natural imagine if when you buy solana below 10$ it might add to the potofolio from the airdrop if you get it. However, do not know what the price of solana will be like tomorrow because whale can sell solana at any time, other altcoins are also the same especially if there is news of large purchases of coins will make the market segment increase, if solana can survive at this price in the current phase I think it is a good thing and you can buy solana with DCA, or scalping to increase profits.",

Well if I have the chance to collect some of this coun through airdrop,  I won't mind that,  because at some point,  its only those who got in at the first stage that be lick to have gain from the previous drop of the token and similarly those who bought the coin also at that stage.",
