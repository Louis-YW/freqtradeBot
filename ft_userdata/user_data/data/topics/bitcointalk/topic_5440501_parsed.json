  "content": "A non-breaking space is a way to prevent a piece of text from \"breaking\" into multiple parts when there's not enough room for it to fit comfortably. This can be useful when formatting tables (I first proposed it here: Re: Gangs of BitcoinTalk). It can also be useful for signatures, too (e.g. @Royse777 could have used it recently when improving the ChipMixer signatures, [nbsp] would have worked better than [color=transparent].[/color] and could have allowed the design to remain the same; it wouldn't have been necessary to change the \"{\" into a \"#\").Although using the Unicode character (U+00A0) directly is possible, it's much handier (and more \"semantic\") to make it available as a BBCode tag.Here's a small patch for @theymos to add [nbsp] to this version of SMF:Code:--- /var/www/baseline/Sources/Subs.php 2011-09-17 21:59:55.000000000 +0000+++ /var/www/modified/Sources/Subs.php 2023-02-20 02:20:01.000000000 +0000@@ -1389,40 +1389,45 @@     'after' => '</div>',     'block_level' => true,    ),    array(     'tag' => 'me',     'type' => 'unparsed_equals',     'before' => '<div class=\"meaction\">* $1 ',     'after' => '</div>',     'quoted' => 'optional',     'block_level' => true,     'disabled_before' => '/me ',     'disabled_after' => '<br />',    ),    array(     'tag' => 'move',     'before' => '<marquee>',     'after' => '</marquee>',     'block_level' => true,    ),+   array(+    'tag' => 'nbsp',+    'type' => 'closed',+    'content' => '&nbsp;',+   ),    array(     'tag' => 'nobbc',     'type' => 'unparsed_content',     'content' => '$1',    ),    array(     'tag' => 'pre',     'before' => '<pre>',     'after' => '</pre>',    ),    array(     'tag' => 'php',     'type' => 'unparsed_content',     'content' => '<div class=\"phpcode\">$1</div>',     'validate' => isset($disabled['php']) ? null : create_function('&$tag, &$data, $disabled', '      if (!isset($disabled[\\'php\\']))      {       $add_begin = substr(trim($data), 0, 5) != \\'&lt;?\\';       $data = highlight_php_code($add_begin ? \\'&lt;?php \\' . $data . \\'?&gt;\\' : $data);       if ($add_begin)        $data = preg_replace(array(\\'~^(.+?)&lt;\\?.{0,40}?php(&nbsp;|\\s)~\\', \\'~\\?&gt;((?:</(font|span)>)*)$~\\'), \\'$1\\', $data, 2);",

      "body": "Bumping this because I feel it deserves a little more attention. It's obviously not the most exciting patch, but it adds something useful to BBCode and it does so in an unobtrusive way; I've never seen theymos' modifications but I'm guessing that when he added the [btc] tag to the forum, he probably went about it in a similar way (minus the custom font). As a small aside, the BBCode parser is a goddamned mess and I'm not sure what the SMF peeps were smoking when they designed it, but it must have been some seriously next-level stuff.A [nbsp] tag is a genuinely useful thing to have, and I'm surprised that it wasn't defined for BBCode from the start. The only sensible counterargument I can think of is: \"Why not just copy/paste U+00A0, when you need a non-breaking space?\". Well, beyond the obvious usability improvements ([nbsp] is much easier to see, share and talk about than:  <-- there's a non-breaking space there, in case you missed it), a more subtle reason is that a naked non-breaking space won't survive a post being edited. For example, here's a table that uses non-breaking spaces in a few key spots to keep things tidy:Strain nameTHC content (average)CBD content (average)Strain typeSmoke when?More infoAfghan Kush~21%~4%~90% IndicaEveninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/afghan-kush/Godfather OG~27%~0%~60% IndicaEveninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/godfather-og/Bruce Banner~25%~0%~60% SativaAfternoonhttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/bruce-banner/Ghost Train Haze~22%~0%~75% SativaAfternoonhttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/ghost-train-haze/Chemdawg~19%~0%~55% HybridAfternoonhttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/chemdawg/White Widow~16%~0%~60% SativaMorninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/white-widow/Devil Fruit~26%~18%~70% IndicaEveninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/devil-fruit/Strawberry Banana~26%~0%~70% IndicaEveninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/strawberry-banana/Sour Diesel~22%~2%~90% SativaMorninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/sour-diesel/Gorilla Glue #4~26%~0%~65% SativaEveninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/gorilla-glue-4/Girl Scout Cookies~27%~1%~60% IndicaEveninghttps://www.wikileaf.com/strain/girl-scout-cookies/SMF house blendUnknownUnknownUnknownNeverhttps://www.simplemachines.org/about/contact.phpI know from experience that if I edit this post then my formatting won't survive; naked non-breaking spaces will \"disappear\", and the resulting table won't render as neatly as it once did.So, in summary: I can't think of a good reason not to merge this patch, it seems like a strict improvement to me.",

Especially for Windows. Microsoft used to have some seriously talented programmers, and I'm pretty sure that most of their more recent engineering hires are left scratching their heads at some of the code that's still around from the old days.I'm just poking fun at the SMF team, I kind of get how they arrived at their design for the BBCode parser. It's not what I would have done, and it's very fragile and difficult to change without introducing new problems, but it does work.",

But because SMF automatically translates multiple spaces (like    this) into an alternating sequence of regular spaces and non-breaking spaces in the preparsing step, any intentional usage of non-breaking space characters tends to get messed up, as you mentioned. So when SMF's automatic preparsing-level usage of non-breaking spaces doesn't do what you want, this new tag will be useful.",

This can be accomplished with a workaround ([color=transparent].[/color]), but [nbsp] is both much shorter (which may allow for a more elaborate design to fit within the signature size limit) and more reliable (some characters cause trouble for the workaround, but not for [nbsp]).",

This tag also is simpler and shorter comparing to using transparent dot ([color=transparent].[/color]) as a conventional way to replace space. I have applied it in signature design for Coinslotty Contest which the tag really works on both of desktop and mobile screens, but unfortunately I didn't win. Now I'm trying to apply it in my current and next works, but the main challenge is [nbsp] takes more characters than normal space, which the room for styling would be decreased if there are plenty spaces to be filled with the tag. However it's a helpful and the most efficient tag if you prefer mobile-friendly signature design.PS. PowerGlove also introduced me the [nobbc] tag for the first time. He is a BBCode Master!

It's really getting my attention because for me personally, that tag would be very useful for signature design, more than any other bbcode-things.

I'm sure I'm not telling you anything that you wouldn't have figured out on your own, but in terms of output size, it'll be more efficient to write your example as: [color=red][r=20]█[/r][/color] (i.e. move the [color] tag outside of the [r] tag).Thank you for the suggestion PowerGlove! Honestly I didn't think about that before, but you are right man. That way is just more efficient and makes the code easier to read if you want to edit a whole signature design. It's important to manage the code properly so you can keep the characters amount as minimum as possible and make it readable which you wouldn't waste much time to just find the error codes.Quote from: aylabadia05 on May 02, 2023, 05:00:13 PMIt's not wrong if jayce calls you a BBCode master and an icopress table master.It sounds like I am praising you too much but in fact it is true.Never mind BBCode's ability, even when I make tables, I still often make mistakes that require corrections so that every explanation written in table format can be seen clearly.What I convey is just what I experienced on a topic that I made.Sorry for having the courage to join in on this great discussion.I am proud of all of your abilities.No need to sorry man, every opinion matters here",
