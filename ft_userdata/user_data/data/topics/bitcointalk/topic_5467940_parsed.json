Honestly,I was expecting to read how Bitcoin gives life or is life itself; perhaps I would have been aiming for immortality by accumulating more Bitcoin   All the same, your point is noted as there is a clear distinction between accumulating Bitcoin and gambling. The chances of success for the former is far higher than the later. Besides, there is historic data to support Bitcoin unlike gambling.",

The price of bitcoin is less due to a market dump and we all need to buy bitcoin today, a person who has enough money should buy bitcoin but if someone has less money or is short they need to invest some of their funds. I sentence is coming to my mind regarding Bitcoin that today invest tomorrow you will benefit. If you make an investment in Bitcoin then don't panic about the market and it will grab your funds but just remember that the halving is coming and the specialists predict that April 2024 may be the month of halving.  you just need to hold your asset and wait for the bull I am dam sure I will make you happy in terms of profits when it comes.On gambling my view is that stay away from it because it can addict a person with it. If it gives you a profit then do not be happy because at the same time, you will lose and you have nothing to bring to your home. So the thing which not giving any profits then why you are investing in it besides investing your funds in Bitcoin addict yourself to Bitcoin which is good for your future.",

Well for people comparing Bitcoin to gambling, I can't really say I have seen any person although I know they may be some folks but I think what people actually compare most here is trading to gambling and we can all the resemblance to both activities as the two are very risky.",

Though gamblers have been using Bitcoin as a payment method, it has nothing to do with gambling directly. Gambling is a kind of play with luck, where Bitcoin gives us investment opportunities. To make money from Bitcoin, we need to gain enough knowledge and experience. For gambling, just play with luck. I'm never interested in gambling, and I don't spend time understanding it. Rather, I have been focusing on making money from bitcoin trading, though I am not a professional trader.",

Op, don't think that trading Bitcoin is risk-free because there is no 100% guarantee here that you will make a profit, so you can also lose your entire life savings if you get involved with leverage trading, Therefore it depends on the type of trading you are into, future or leverage and or spot trading. but if you talk about buying Bitcoin and hodl, the risk here is lesser.",

Bitcoin investment can't be compared with gambling, it's completely different, and as you said, the bitcoin price is still low, and anybody that's trying to invest can do that now. Some people are thinking that bitcoin price is already high and they are scared to invest in bitcoin, some of them believe they wont be making much profits from bitcoin investment, that's why they prefer to invest in altcoins, but I will say that bitcoin price is still very low. Lot's of people are regretting why they didn't invest when the bitcoin price was lower. If you don't invest now, I just hope you won't end up regretting it later in the future.Quote from: Freelancershojib on September 24, 2023, 04:46:04 PMI'm not saying gambling is bad I'm saying no one should gamble because if you gamble you can lose everything your whole life income can go there that's why you trade bitcoins you light your future and gamble happy happy  Never get addicted to it and try to stay away from it. Why do you think gambling is bad? If everyone loses money to gambling just the way you said, then I am sure no one will be gambling again because no gambler will be left with any money left, but people are still gambling, they are having fun, and they are winning from gambling. The only thing that I think is bad is gambling addiction. I do discourage people from gambling addiction, gamblers shouldn't take gambling as a source of income, and they shouldn't expect a life-changing amount of money from gambling. If the money comes, they should take it and use it for any necessary thing that they need to do at that time.",

Because if you are too addicted to investment, you might end up borrowing money just to invest and think you will make profits so you can pay back. But on the other hand, you might not make profits from that investment, whether Bitcoin or not, because investment is not guaranteed. If anybody tells you, Bitcoin investment is a 100% guarantee, that is a big lie.In gambling, if a person is addicted, S/him might also do the same thing, thinking he might win from the game, then pay back the borrowed money and keep the profits, but since gambling is also not guaranteed, you might also end up owing debts.",

These two are not comparable; if Bitcoin were considered gambling, those who were using it as payment would only be able to keep it; they would no longer be able to engage in gambling. Those who were comparing Bitcoin and gambling together they misunderstanding it. No matter how long we wait to purchase bitcoin, whether it takes six months, a year, or two years, investing in bitcoin won't cause us to lose money. However, when you gamble, you can use your money to place bets while you're still sitting down, which will cause you to lose money. That is a significant example that shows how we cannot compare them. Some people compare it because they would rather make money immediately than wait for a long time. In fact, I think that gambling is a horrible idea because it will only lead to further problems for those who are unable to afford it. It's not good for people to become addicted to it. I cannot advise anyone to gamble, and any of my friends who I see engaging in it I do advise them to stop because it will not be good for them to continue this with their future because whatever we do today will determine our tomorrows, so it is still a good idea to choose a better future for our children. We cannot all engage in gambling and be content for them to follow in our footsteps; we all need a better way of life. Everyone will want their children to invest in bitcoin but not to gamble with it.",

When it comes to investment it is always good to have diversified investment than just putting everything in a single basket. Maybe the percentage of money into bitcoin can be kept high against the investment on the rest of the coins. Bitcoin investment assure with profit and for the same reason we can't say altcoins are bad. There is good list of altcoins that have the potential to grow and have got good track record. Quite often we used to see some altcoins into problem and users losing funds. With investment we've got risks and for the same if we stay away it is the lack of understanding we've got over investment.",

For those who gamble and know when to call it a stop they can’t be consider as bad gambler or seeing their gambling habit as a crime.
