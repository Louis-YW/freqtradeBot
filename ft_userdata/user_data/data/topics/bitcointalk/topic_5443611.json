I was wrong and lost time trying to follow them and profit from them. Bitcoin is the only one that will survive. Ethereum and other coins are not worth it but they are better then the other shit coins. The reason why Bitcoin is successful and the one you think about when someone mentions cryptocurrency is because it is the only one that has a reason to be here the others are riding off the success of Bitcoin.",

Well, actually cryptocurrency itself has a lot of models and there are even people who when they hear about the term or word cryptocurrency don't immediately imagine Bitcoin in their head because basically they have never heard of Bitcoin.If you say Bitcoin is a very reliable asset and a great one to buy and own over the long term, I think that's obvious. But if you talk about cryptocurrency to everyone, not all of them will imagine about Bitcoin or the word Bitcoin will cross their heads even though most of them can immediately think about Bitcoin because maybe in previous days they have heard from the news or other people.",

They simply feel convinced that Bitcoin is a tool to make them richer, and get richer quickly then they join. I used to feel very weird to know some people who buy, sell Bitcoin for about 2 years but did not know what is Bitcoin block explorer and don't know what is transaction hash (txid). They think after they make a transaction or withdraw their bitcoin from an exchange, it will be move quickly to a receiver. They have no knowledge about confirmation.It means they must be educated more from very basics and they must be less lazy.",

You dont wanna get blame when they burn their money. Yes bitcoin is reliable but it doesnt mean your friends would get rich when they bought it now. Its still a speculative asset but there is no harm telling them what you like about it and give them the rights to learn it as well and let them decide if they want to buy it or not.",

Bull season is coming, and that has historically been its behavior.It's okay to inform them and make an effort to persuade them if they don't believe in it, but you shouldn't force them.

At long run the project starts showing signs of discouragement but I still believed in than because of what they were saying. few days later my friend introduced me to another coin again and they were saying the same thing that bitcoin in scam showing all the evidence that will make me to believe them, and also showing fake advantages of their coin over all the coins that are in existence then. They even included my first investment in crypto as scam and also proof of evidence to show me that is a scam. I later give up on my first investment to concentrate on my new investment thinking that I can recover from here.To cut the story short I now made up my mind to even Invest in the so called scam Coin since the good coins have turned to bad ones. I than purchased bitcoin.Finally the scam Coin put smile on my face, it just comes as a rescue for me, since than I started liking bitcoin above all Coin and also admitted that it the king of cryptocurrencies.",
