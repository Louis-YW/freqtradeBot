This is absolutely hacking attack. They provide some links even I haven't bothered to click. I just deleted message instantly. Non-custodial wallet won't ask you verify KYC anyway. There are no options to input your mail during creating trust wallet. So no question to receiving KYC verification mail from Trust wallet. It might a result of data breach from various crypto sites. So don't click any links if you receive smialr mail.",

Going forward one of the keys way to avoid attacks like this is to verify by checking there social media (which can also be compromised) or login to your account if it is true you might see it there Now to a realistic thing no Non custodial wallet will ask for KYC because even if they do they can’t confiscate your holdings without the seed phrase or keys, but for case like TrustWallet which is closed source you wouldn’t know how the keys are even be generated or what they do with them. So ditch closed wallets and move over to open source wallets",

I must say that it's a poorly hatched phishing attempt because non custodial wallet will never ask you to submit your personal information for verification, this is only possible on custodial wallets. Also, you don't need an email address when creating a trust wallet or any other non custodial wallets. It's clearly a scam and newbies should be warned.",

Scammers have tools that gather hundreds of thousands of emails online, I don't know how they do it but it works, and they start sending email in bulk out to the email addresses, hoping that someone takes the bait, thing is crypto investors need to understand private keys and recovery seed, there is never a bug that will request for your keys to fix, it's all lies, only you must have access to your private keys, don't ever give it out for any reasons.",

Verify the sender's email address, check official websites, and confirm on their social media. There are sneaky folks trying to snatch your funds, so be vigilant. Don't rush into anything.

I also received short messages several times from scammers in the name of banking representatives. and I know banks will never do that unless they offer insurance to their customers. Moreover, I don't have an account at that bank.This is almost the same as the case revealed by the OP, labeling them from a widely used wallet platform. What is clear is that when creating a wallet you will not be asked to enter your email. but how do they get emails to spread information to all their users?Remain alert if someone asks us to link our wallet or something related to our wallet key. those who do that kind of thing are just scammers.",

The self-custodial wallets never contact to unless you ask for any assistance on their official support. I was just scrolling the latest news blogs and found that in the US there was a full team offering the service to hack any wallet on customer demand and they quit their service recently, Iw as shocked to know haha they stole $70M worth of the funds for their customers.Such team tack your social media and other Web 2 logins to track down your identity and then they directly target you by different means.
