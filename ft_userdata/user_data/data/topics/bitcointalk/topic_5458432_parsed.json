  "content": "This was approximately a year ago, and I would like to share a recap of what occurred.In late June of last year, I had a fortunate sports betting experience and won around $6,000 in LTC (120 LTC). Following my win, I promptly requested a withdrawal, but unfortunately, it was denied. This surprised me since Stake is typically known for their quick withdrawal times. To understand the situation, I reached out to their support team for an update.Upon inquiring about the denial, I was informed that this was a routine check and they requested me to undergo KYC verification up to level 4. Level 4 is the highest level of KYC, which involves providing a picture of my Passport/ID, a personal banknote to demonstrate proof of funds, and a bill to verify my residency. Initially, I found this request rather unusual and tried to obtain a valid reason as to why I was being singled out for verification when I simply wanted to withdraw my winnings. However, the support team was unhelpful, claiming they didn't know the reason or attempting to avoid the question by insisting on KYC verification.After submitting the required documents, I received a notification stating that the documents I had provided were insufficient. They cited poor image quality, unclear details, and sometimes even failed to provide a reason, leading me to believe they were deliberately prolonging the withdrawal process.Interestingly, despite the withdrawal issues, I discovered that I was still able to place bets on the platform. Unfortunately, like any other addict, I continued gambling until I lost all my winnings within four days. I attributed this to sheer bad luck, convincing myself that it was solely responsible for my losses.However, I later spoke to a friend who underwent the same KYC procedure and learned that his verification process took less than a day, enabling him to withdraw his funds instantly.Curiosity led me back to stake.com to review my betting history and investigate what had truly transpired. To my surprise, the tickets had disappeared, and when I questioned the support team about this, they attributed it to a platform issue, stating that neither party could access the tickets and that nothing could be done about it (refer to the images below).1st image: [https://ibb.co/nmxBBG8]2nd image: [https://ibb.co/1qSqgS2]I don't wish to dwell on this matter any longer, but I would appreciate hearing your thoughts. Personally, I feel that this is a highly questionable practice, allowing users to continue gambling while demanding verification for withdrawals, and then conveniently erasing the tickets and evidence. It appears to be nothing short of shady and potentially predatory to me.",

Your friend already told you that this verification procedure can only take less than a day which means the problem is on your side and nto Stake themselves. You are providing incomplete and low quality image that makes verification failed. Honestly, I will trust Stake on this matter because they process withdrawal amount that is greater on your requested balance. Singling you out will not gonna benefit them. Also your loss is also your problem because you didn’t control yourself that time. All I can see on your issue is that you are upset that time that's why you are attributing all your mistakes to Stake because they hold your funds for KYC verification.",

BTW, Op I think you should start to work on your addiction, you have seen what being addicted can result in, and also keep in my that this is just the tip of the ice what addiction is capable of. you can start by reducing your gambling activity, which could work magic if properly put to use.",

You agree on this when you sign up and check the small box acknowledgin the terms of Stake. Also they didn’t confiscate your balance but just temporarily hold while the KYC verification is ongoing.You will still have that money if you didn’t lose it by continuos gambling inside the casino. Stake has a vault feature, You should use that to keep safe your balance while waiting so that you will never see your balance frequently while you are accessing the casino.",

Otherwise you might find yourself in a tangled web of unjustified bureaucratic nonsense. The reason being quite simple: Even though most people mistake a complicated KYC process with malice from the side of the casino owners, the truth is that a long KYC process is because you tripped a lot of red flags like using a VPN, using a bot or just because you broke a rule from the terms and conditions. People really underestimate the terms and conditions and would rather not read through them because they can be quite long. But that laziness always has a price in the end.",
