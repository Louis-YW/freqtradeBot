  "content": "This is bad... really bad...https://www.docdroid.net/60YAbCz/cftc-binance-pdfInternal chat logs caught Binance's Chief Compliance Office (lol) talking about how terrorists only send small amounts to their exchange because \"large sums constitute money laundering\", his colleague replying that \"can barely buy an AK47 with 600 bucks\", and Binance's Money Laundering Reporting Officer (lol again) saying that they know shit is bad but they close their 2 eyes.QuoteInternally, Binance officers, employees, and agents have acknowledged that theBinance platform has facilitated potentially illegal activities. For example, in February 2019,after receiving information ‚Äúregarding HAMAS transactions‚Äù on Binance, Lim explained to acolleague that terrorists usually send ‚Äúsmall sums‚Äù as ‚Äúlarge sums constitute money laundering.‚ÄùLim‚Äôs colleague replied: ‚Äúcan barely buy an AK47 with 600 bucks.‚Äù And with regard to certainBinance customers, including customers from Russia, Lim acknowledged in a February 2020chat: ‚ÄúLike come on. They are here for crime.‚Äù Binance‚Äôs MLRO agreed that ‚Äúwe see the bad,but we close 2 eyes.‚ÄùAlso how CZ does a lot of insider trading against customers:QuoteDuring the Relevant Period, Binance has traded on its own platform throughapproximately 300 ‚Äúhouse accounts‚Äù that are all directly or indirectly owned by Zhao, as well asaccounts owned by Merit Peak and Sigma Chain. Zhao has also traded on the Binance platformthrough two individual accounts.+ a lot more.Someone is going to get arrested, or at least HEAVILY fined.",

If you want to run a business in a country, you play by the rules, and crypto trading is not ann should not be an exception.From my point of view, as my family is doing business in the EU area, why should I follow 5 different health safety regulations and standards and meet them each time we sell products that sometimes barely have 10k in value and a few hundred euros in profits while those guys run billions from an off-shore company while giving a damn about laws?And more importantly, why do we need them?If at this stage when everybody that has access to the internet can buy BTC (Bitcoin!!!) without using a CEX and should understand the problem of not your keys, not your coins I see CEX as more of a problem then a helping hand.
