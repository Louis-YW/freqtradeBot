From what I remember, he got banned and seems that he is still butthurt.I tried to search Bitcointalk on Bing and I don't see such message, maybe it's only displayed on desktop, not mobile. It's good that nobody uses Bing, so, not many will see this false information. I'm not familiar with Bing and their policy, so I'm not sure is it any way to remove misleading information from their search.",

More like a thumbnail and then a link to the Wikipedia page.You can search it on Bing and you see what I am talking about.I just used my desktop and it's really showing. Seems like a new feature of bing, it's like how google's search result features[1] that shows company about, socmed info, etc. when searching the name of the site or company. But the thing is it kinda sort of wonky feature of bing. These websites, game-protect, bithope, zoominfo doesn't shows in the top result when searching \"bitcointalk\" keyword but it become the featured text there. Unlike in google it searching \"bitcointalk\" keyword it shows the text from the top 2 result which came from meetbunch.On the other hand, there is a dislike button which can be used to report to remove the text/info from game-protect for misinformation.[1] https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/search-result-features",

Probably Bing changed the information or someone actually helped edit it. When I made a report, there was no option to editThe links are now;1. https://www.mybitcoin.com (seems to have lots of outdated information, thou.

I will be happy to receive your comments on the idea and its execution. I will try to be as concise as possible, but I am also striving to address all questions that you may have in advance. Here we go:Quote from: vdramaliev on August 24, 2015, 08:09:43 AMYou can also read the news about the reasoning behind the project here. I'm also wondering if there's a connection between the Bithope charity site and BitHope.org, at first glance I see a resemblance.Because of: @vdramaliev haven't visited this forum in two years, so can't ask @vdramaliev, to clarify what's right and what's wrong with regards to the actions of the BitHope site.",
