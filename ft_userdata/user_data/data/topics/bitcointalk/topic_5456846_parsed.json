All minimum amounts are set by exchange networks. We meant that you are not limited in your ability to change coins anywhere and anytime About exchange ID - our service is completely anonymous, so there is no way for us to associate your device with the ID of the created ticket. But when creating an exchange, a separate page is created containing the ID in the link. You can find this link in your browser history. And one more thing - if you have already created an exchange and paid, your money will not go anywhere anyway. You can always write to us and we will find your exchange in the database.In the future, we will add a personal account and users will be able to save and track their transactions.",

In this case, we do not make an automatic exchange, and the operator performs the exchange in manual mode. As a result, we made a manual payment for one of the orders.During the processing of this order, we found 3 things that are worth improving in our work. Thank you stranger!",

For small amounts of money the commissions take a relatively large part, so the rate comes out so low. If you check on a large amount, such as 1 Bitcoin, you get a much better rate.We are always ready to answer your questions and will try our best to earn your trust.",

This means a fee of around 6$ for a 50$ exchange. This is high compared to centralized exchanges that take as little as 0.5$ on the same transaction.",

We have some reserves on major coins. But you must understand that it is impossible to keep reserves for 350+ coins. I don't think that if we show some accounts with a couple of thousand dollars on them, we will be immediately recognized by everyone here as honest guys.For now our task is to test business model and collect initial feedbacks. Soon we will launch advertising campaigns and hopefully we will get more feedback from our clients.I'm sure that reputation is a metric that emerges over time.

The user only needs to enter the desired wallet and transfer funds. As you noticed, we have a lot of coins and it is possible to change any pairs. On exchanges, it is not always possible to exchange directly, plus registration and identity confirmation are required.Another important advantage is the minimum exchange limit. On many pairs, you can exchange from 0.0006 BTC, which is only 20 dollars (for example, BTC -> MATIC, and much more). Many exchangers do not consider it necessary to bother with such amounts.In the future, we will definitely add fiat. This is a rather complex and lengthy process.",
