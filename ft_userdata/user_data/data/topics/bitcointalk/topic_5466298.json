  "content": "Hello, Devs. After seeing a similar thread that provided hands-on resources and tools for debugging and simulating Bitcoin scripts, I decided to put together this topic on the resources and tools for querying Blockchain APIs. If you wish to build Blockchain applications, you will most likely require these data query tools in order to own your decentralised softwares and apps.Name of Tool/Resource    DescriptionLinkBitiodine Cluster AnalysisA Rust Bitcoin blockchain parser with clustering capabilities, allowing to group together addresses in ownership clusters. The parser is compatible with SegWit, correctly parses bech32 native outputs and witness programs, and deals with chain splits gracefully.https://github.com/mikispag/bitiodineBlockbook wallet indexing serviceBlockbook is back-end service for Trezor wallet that helps you to access index of addresses and address balances of the connected block chain, fast index search, simple blockchain explorer etc.https://github.com/trezor/blockbookBitcoin Iterate blockchain parserThis is some fast code to iterate over bitcoind's block files to extract blockchain data from the main blockchain. You can use this to show block hash and transaction size for each transaction in the main chain.https://github.com/rustyrussell/bitcoin-iterateBlocks IteratorIterates over Bitcoin blocks, decoding data inside Bitcoin Core's blocks directory.https://github.com/RCasatta/blocks_iteratorBitcoin Graph Database BuilderBitcoin Graph Database Builder (Blockchain2graph) helps you extracts blockchain data (bitcoin) and insert them into a graph database (neo4j).https://github.com/straumat/blockchain2graph",
