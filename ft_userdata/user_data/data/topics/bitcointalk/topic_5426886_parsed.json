  "content": "Casinos are struggling to find an edge against others, They try to improve their bonuses, loyalty programs and new games. I have an idea how they can scale up their business in a fun way for their costumers. I would like to know what you think about it.Community Casino TournamentsCasino “X” setup a tournament for ( Ex Babydoge ) could be $ADA $SHIB etcCasino X add 5k in value in the “babydoge” token as a prize of this tournamentThe tournament buy in, will be in “Babydoge” The tournament winner will be the player with the highest score after 7 days and the winner can collect the 5k in Babydoge. So why is this good?If the casino can interact with other communities in a natural way - Hey Guys, come and play this tournament with your favorite token The casino can now  scale up its business through other communitiesThe Casino can probably also get free advertising from the admins in that specific community telegram or discord, if they let them know they will have a big “babydoge” tournament. This event is a win/win for all parties, The Casino will get more players into their casino and the community token gets more new holders from the casino that want to participate in this tournament, and need to buy the token before they can.Obviously, this will requires multiple crypto payments options, so a \"babydoge\" holder can deposit in \"Babydoge\" I think this would be a good way for the casino to scale up, and fun for the players.",

I see no business but waste of money for casinos. May be it will bring them some sign ups but all these sign ups will not make them money. The real gamblers do not look for peanuts to waste their time. They look for casinos who have high bankroll. It assures their big wins to get paid out without hassle.",

You can see their a lot of games and tournament where you can take chance and with some prizes. Every casinos are trying to innovate their promotions so they can attract more gamblers and with that tournament they might have the chance to achieve their goal. You can see a lot of casinos already done this before.",
