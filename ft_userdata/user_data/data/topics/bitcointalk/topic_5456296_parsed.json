Like the price dropping below what it is right now?It's a truth that the SEC issue is among what's dragging down the price of Bitcoin, but let us not also forget that there are other things that could have possibly dragged down the price of Bitcoin and kept it struggling, such as FXT and the Luna incident, which also kept the market down for a while, so this is not much different and we are actually going to pass this stage. Halving is fast approaching, and a bull run is certain; the market will drastically correct itself in due time.",

Halving is fast approaching, and a bull run is certain; the market will drastically correct itself in due time.You should not over-hype the Halving event, because it has a minimal impact on the Bitcoin price. There are currently too many things that are pushing the price down, so it's not going to \"recover\" to $30k+ due to the Halving.  The whole Crypto scene are used as a \"Political Ball\" by the US election.... because politicians know if they say the right things, then some more votes will come their way.",
