  "content": "Hello!Which social media platform is easiest to monetize in your opinion?I've been mostly streaming on Twitch, but have had my own issues here & there due to the nature of my channel (mostly slots and sports betting) - it was all good a few months ago before the new rules, that's how I made most of my money. Maybe anyone has any other good recommendations outside of the scope of Twitch? (Youtube's a hustle, really hard to pick up and monetization wise doesn't seem the best).",

      "body": "Me personally, I don't like to build a business on social media platforms because they can terminate your account for any reason.It's better to build a mailing list or website that captures user contact info because you never know. I had a twitter account with 50K+ subscribers suspended for no reason, and a Facebook group with 100K+ fans deleted.Once you have a website or newsletter, you can branch off onto social media but you have to be careful.",
