That is good. I have told many people that are close to me about bitcoin but I also let them know the risk. I even do it in a way they can be afraid to invest, but also in a way I will let them know the best time to invest.

      "body": "If you're to carryout any awareness crusade then it's best you yourself learn about Bitcoin, because it's certain that you'll receive a lot of questions concerning Bitcoin and if perhaps you live in a society that have a different idea entirely about what Bitcoin is you'll have to do a lot of explanation and make them see Bitcoin for what it truly is. Like for mine, most people see it as a fraud and something that only the rich should get involved in (just like I did in my early days) without proper education and also the right knowledge you won't be able to achieve anything.So for now I'd advice you take your Bitcoin learning serious because you can't teach others what you don't know and if those around you become interested in it, you could direct then to bitcointalk and let them learn Bitcoin for what it truly is. Quote from: Y3shot on July 27, 2023, 06:31:29 PM It is my duty to tell about bitcoin to people and it is their decision to invest in it.Most of those newly coming into Bitcoin, are of the mindset that Bitcoin is a get rich scheme and once they invest their money there's no way they'll lose it and that's why it's always best you tell them about all the risks involved in Bitcoin and just as you have said if they are interested they can proceed with it if not then they should look for something they are more convenient with. Never force anyone into any investment if you do you'll have yourself to blame if anything goes wrong. Edit:On a second thought, I think you have another motive as to why you created this thread. At first I thought you really meant everything you wrote down in this thread but just scrolling through the first page of your post history o realized that you created this thread for no other reason but to fish merits.Quote from: Y3shot on July 17, 2023, 08:26:44 AMthis is the same reason why I haven't make any plan to hodl Bitcoin because of it is undervalued, and not reliable to hodl for a long time. But I think I know of few altcoins which I can buy  from my reserve savings later , Quote from: Y3shot on July 16, 2023, 09:08:56 PMHoding is what I do for living. Hodling is my occupation.  I don't think I can do without Hodling.  If I don't hodl I will loose.Hodling all the way.",

After all, we all want Bitcoin awareness and education to spread to many parts of the world. But it should be a balanced lecture that should include the benefits and risks of investing in the Bitcoin market. Making money from Bitcoin requires patience and bravery. Patience to keep waiting even when it seems you are just wasting your time and bravery to keep hodling even when FUD surrounds the market. So they need to know that it is not a quick path to money but a long-term investment. I don't also think that we should only tell people about the financial benefits of investing in Bitcoin but advantages like privacy and decentralization while using Bitcoin as a currency should also be promoted.",

When we talk about introducing someone to Bitcoin, it's all about providing them with information on what it is, how it works, and what it can do for them. But if we encourage people to buy and invest in it, we end up influencing their decisions that can have financial repercussions. Personally, I have nothing against telling people about Bitcoin; in fact, I encourage it. I believe that everyone should have at least a basic idea about digital currencies and the role Bitcoin plays among them.However, I would never try to persuade or encourage people to invest without first warning them about possible risks and threats. After all, the final decision should always be up to them and made after careful consideration, not hastily.",

That's right, some people who even know and invest in Bitcoin are only keeping things to themselves because they don't want any trouble from some people that they might introduce to Bitcoin, and at the end they have a failed investment. I am not the kind of person that falls into that category, as I will explain Bitcoin to anyone who really has an interest in it; I can't just pick some random person and begin to teach them about Bitcoin. Before I educate anyone about Bitcoin, that means you have really bothered me about it to the extent that I just decided to take the chance and give you some education about it. If you tell someone about Bitcoin when the person has not really made up their mind to invest, that's only when they will blame you for any loss, but for any investor who has made up their mind, they will bear the risk themselves.",

So I would like to know what is the method you use to reach people when you talk about Bitcoin? Do you do conferences? Streams... or what? Well, if you feel responsible for wanting to inform people, I imagine that you should do it in a big way.  as you say, money is essential to improve the quality of life and it is legitimate to want to share information that may be useful to others. At the end of the day, the decision to invest in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency rests with each individual, and it is important that they are informed about the risks and rewards associated with it",

Why people get into such problem is because they fail to do the needful by telling whom ever they are onboarding how the market trend is. They fail to let them know how volatile the market could be and also, some bought at high thinking they would sell high to make profit but the unfortunate happened to them and that is the reason why some people are in enmity with their families, friends and loved ones.Before embarking on bitcoin awareness, be prepared to answer any questions that comes your way and do well to let them know  the market volatility.Making sure they know that they doing their own research would help them be in the right position to flow along with the market trend would keep them safe so you do not get into trouble.",

Sharing up awareness of its existence would somehow fasten up the recognition and consideration but there are people who were close minded that not easily believing about those possible opportunities that it gives but instead they would really be having that kind of impression on sticking into it.Just always remember that you shouldn't really make out some guarantees about making money if you dont like on getting blamed out.Just let recognition and adoption move normally because its an inevitable thing.",

So, be always ready for that. If some people find bitcoin interesting, it doesn't mean they're gonna fully understand how bitcoin works and its historical price run. I understand if you're really passionate about teaching people about bitcoin, but one thing I suggest, don't force people who doesn't show any interest at first impression, because if you happen to have these kind of people convinced, they're most likely going to lose patience and of course their money as well.",

I really believe that if you solely educate people about Bitcoin and never attempt to persuade someone to make an investment, nobody will hold you responsible if they do make a mistake.Almost all of my close friends have been introduced to Bitcoin by me, but after I've taught them the fundamentals of the Bitcoin and its blockchain technology, I advise everyone to conduct their own research before getting involved in the system, especially in the investment portion. Therefore, since I don't make anyone invest against their will, no one will hold me responsible if they lose money investing against their will.",
