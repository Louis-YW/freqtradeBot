I was not lured by gambling ads, but I only noticed I stuck with the old gambling sites. I have not known about this forum at the time and I only believed in old gambling sites with excellent reputations which I played. After I quit gambling for a year, I started to gamble again after 1 year but not an addict again. Ads did not lure me because I know about gambling already with better first time deposit bonus, so nothing newnto me, unlike someone that has not gambled before.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 07, 2022, 07:12:26 PMIf this continues to happen again and again, do you think such a person will ever leave such a habit?I left gambling after it severely affected me, some people will not learn until they are affected. Discipline is all it takes if someone really wants to quite.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 07, 2022, 07:12:26 PMAnd another question is, if you are addicted to gambling and wants to quit but discovers that seeing gambling Ads on the internet is one of the triggers that lures you into gambling again, is it possible for you to stay away from the internet until you are sure you've completely healed from that addiction?The truth is that people that have not gambled before are the ones that are mostly lured by gambling ads the first time. But deposit bonus can be another thing though. Anyone that wants to quite gambling has to discipline himself before it can work out for him, ads should not be a problem for such person.",

To answer your question, yes, these Ads could lure the gambler back to gambling but in regard to gamblers who would like to stop, it depends on your own volition whether you'll let yourself be captivated by those ads.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on November 07, 2022, 07:12:26 PMIf this continues to happen again and again, do you think such a person will ever leave such a habit?Is it possible for you to stay away from the internet until you are sure you've completely healed from that addiction?If you will let yourself be lured on each and every ads that will remind you about gambling, then I suggest that you seek some professional help as you already have an addiction. But yes, staying away on the internet will probably help avoid online gambling.Also, if you'll stay on the internet, it's better to not search any gambling related things as you'll be likely targeted by those ads.Kinda weirded out by the porn and masturbation reference. You could use other other things to relate the issue but that's what you've chosen.",

However, you can find a good side in everything.  If a person wants to get rid of gambling addiction, then in this situation he can generally refuse to use the global Internet.  At the same time, he will get rid of two addictions at once - firstly, from gambling, and secondly, from dependence on the Internet.  The second dependence is also very strong. True, he can acquire some new bad habit - for example, drug addiction, smoking or alcoholism .... Some advise in this case to train willpower.  You can also attend training on goal setting and time management.  But in general it is very difficult to calculate all the consequences of watching such annoying gambling ads.",

      "body": "What it mainly does IMO is that it sparks the urge of the gambler by triggering his memory of what can be experienced in the gambling platform. Ads are effective in stimulating the minds of people if done well enough, and it could, too, affect the minds of gamblers who are trying so hard to avoid visiting the gambling platform. This is why even in the self-exclusion program, those who opted to be placed on that list are angry whenever they receive promotions and regular updates about the casino. It can easily break their concentration and they'll easily find themselves stumbling to play on the gambling platform that sent them the invite/updates/promotions.",

To the point they are being drawn too much to it resulting to actually giving a shot to try it. I have also experienced this kind of situation not just gambling related, but in general. My curiosity got the best out of me to eventually buy and try it to see for myself.This could be the case too for gambling players. Nice marketing strategy could really garner a gambling site a guaranteed client. Most of those people who often falls into ads trap are the newbies because they don't know the fundamentals yet and are very much willing to explore. Some people are also affected by ads in terms of being drawn back to their old gambling ways. Those people who are addicted are the usual victims of this. Relapse happens the moment they are triggered by something. In this instance, the advertisements of the casinos regarding promotions and bonuses. Ads could potentially attract again those who are planning to leave gambling behind depending on the level of discipline and determination of the gambler to change his gambling ways that are overly stimulating.",

As you have compare it to any other form of addiction, people can quit and won't relapse, it's all on the mind.

In some cases, it becomes harder because of the lack of spirit from the addicts to recover. It may be caused by the weak mentality of the individual or because of a severe level of addiction. However, doctors or medical specialists, always have varied ways to provide encouragement to addicts.IMHO, nothing is impossible to recover as long as the addicts are still alive.",

Generally gambling addiction can be triggered by other things too if the person has weak mental health. Even Twitch has applied strict rules for slots streaming section, gambling ads have specific targets for reason, IMO. There is no definite answer on knowing when a person can and could stop their respective addiction, let alone gambling perse. The most important aspect when a person is addicted to something is continually giving support and care. Remember that there relapses may happen and this may worsen the addiction of a given person.Lots of people have suggested rehab but what they need is constant care and support from their family members and peers. Understanding their situation is also one of those factors that gives you the patience to deal with your members that are addicted to gambling.",

It's not only the actual habit you know? most of the time, the views and the environment that will trigger you to do those habits are the things to consider you need to avoid. That's why when people are so addicted to certain bad things, he needs to migrate to some place where these addictions are not found. It really depends on when people will manage to get over it but most likely they need some months or a year or two to completely get away from their addictions because if they still get to those places or meet their buddies, there are high tendencies that they will not get over it again and again.",

In the case of ads, I can relate somewhat since I myself have been influenced by ads to play, not just in gambling but in literally most games I've tended to grow out of, just one simple clip could make me return. It's also not that addicts don't want to recover, it's just that seeing something related to what you're avoiding tends to create an itch, a really irritating and close to unavoidable one. I reckon it'd be easier to be responsible at gambling instead of completely avoiding/removing it from your system really. As for the latter, the internet has way too much stuff that avoiding it just for gambling seems kind of losing out, though if you're an avid book reader like me then hell yea go to a library and you can last an entire week without it (unless needed due to stuff like jobs ofc).",
