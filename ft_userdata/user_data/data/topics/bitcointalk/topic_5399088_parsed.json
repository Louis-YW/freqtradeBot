I like playing games in Bitsler they have a lot of provably fair games and they also have traditional casino games that came from third party provider and they also have sports betting, so instead of having 1 theme they have 3 which is more flexible for all types of players.",

But if you want to more games like that, You should play on Web3 casino like Betfury because they have a huge database for this kind of games. I not familiar with Bitkong and all of the probably fair games but I'm sure that the games idea is just same, They just differ on the animation and some minor details on the display. I'm not always playing probabfair games since it's a fast games. I just play it whenever I have extra money that I afford to lose.",

I don't really mind that because if I play on a recommended casino site, the casino won't cheat on its members.",

Most of the casinos,of the good ones I think already has some in house specific games trying to offer just that.Personally I don't care much about themed games,I only want to know that the casino is offering all of their slot machines games for example as provably fair,that is enough for me to go and play.I don't know many people from my friends who are also gamblers that have some specific liking to these themed provably fair games but this may change in the future,who knows,for the moment I don't see any big interest for these games.",

What are some of the best themed platforms? Any new ones? Although I can't say that I prefer all custom provably fair casino games, there are some I enjoy. For example, many casinos offer games like dice, plinko, crash, and minesweeper as custom, in-house developed games. I like these games because they all are relatively new and unique in design, and include a lot of interesting visual effects, and have a little twist. I don't think any of these games are better or worse than the standard games, they're just unique and different, fun to play and add variety to the casino gaming experience. For that reason, I don't believe there's a right or wrong approach to themed games, it's just an individual preference.",

What are some of the best themed platforms? Any new ones? Do you mean to ask what other casinos are offering provably fair on their games? If so, there are many of them which offers provably fair mainly because it is one of the most features asked and looked for by the players whenever they search for gambling sites to play with. Having a provably fair game will assure the players that they are not being cheated on by the house. In addition, this keeps up the reputation of the casino itself. Providing games which are proven to be fair to the players will give them a nice impression especially to those peoplr who will plan to play with them. Moreover, their existing players will surely play the role of free advertising due to their quality of service regarding fairness by spreading it to those close to them.",

All casino sites has this probably fair motive but the thing is not all of them are reliableÂ  instead there are many issues tackled that there are several casino that has faking their probability to mislead and cheat players .but those are the sites that is not last long in this business because gamblers nowadays are very knowledgeable about those things.",

Other than that I would not advise you to use sites that you mentioned as well neither Blockgaming because I haven't tried it out at the moment what you can do is choose the game you want to play, for example if you want to play blackjack you can go to : blackjack.fun , if you want to play crash you can go to roobet.com, If you wanna play dice there is duelbits as well therefore I do think you have so many options and you should not look for small casinos.",

Is it related to tower.bet which is a casino with some different game or it is like what you think which is about game with a tower style. But perhaps you are correct here, high likely he is looking for tower-based game like bitkong.

What are some of the best themed platforms? Any new ones? Actually, all casinos must use a fair theme. I guarantee 100%, but that doesn't mean it's a fair game. The casino also needs income from losses, so to say 100% fair I don't think there is. Casinos have their share in taking a share of the profits. Not a few casinos claim to be 100% fair but in fact, they are actually defrauding users. I don't need to mention one of them, but what is certain is that this forum has a casino with a high reputation and as a reference so that you can anticipate the unexpected.",

Gambling sites have really gone into the same path during the last years and offer very similar features and games options. Moreover, sports betting has gained too much influence and popularity in crypto space to the extent that smaller gambling sites lost their participation on the competition for gamblers on this market.",

If that is the extent of your decision making, you better be ready to lose every penny that you put into whichever site you lose. That's fine and I guess there are a small group of people who use such sites purely to relieve some kind of boredom, but it really is a waste of money to be entertained by some flashy graphics and peculiar sounds which are created to reinforce habit building behavior. It is a dangerous path to choose and very few people can afford to be that complacent with money. You'd be much better off analyzing the odds to determine how long your money will last.",
