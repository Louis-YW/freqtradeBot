  "content": "Hello guys! I felt I should share my little success with you in receiving my first bitcoin payment in my business. Well... I have a car which I used for Bolt (Taxify) as my side hustle whenever am free from my work. I've stumbled on a couple of topics of some members on this forum promoting mass adoption of bitcoin by accepting it in their businesses. Since then I've been nursing this idea and at the same time I've been having cold feet. I accept payment for my services in fiat currency or bank transfer, but with the naira redesign in my country, the new notes have really not circulated everywhere and it's been making life a living hell for a lot persons. So I said to myself this is the right time to add another means of payment to my business.I got some bitcoin stickers and for my car and It's been about two weeks since I displayed it and no one has patronize me in bitcoin. Though, some of my passengers see it and engage me in one or two conversation. Today, I carried a passenger and when he saw the stickers and was like do you accept bitcoin and I said yes and he said do you know you are the first bolt driver I have actually seen accepting bitcoin and I smiled. He asked me if I have actually received any payment in bitcoin and I answered not yet, and he said I will be your first customer to pay you in bitcoin. We talked a lot during the trip and our discussion was mainly centered on cryptocurrency, mass adoption, crypto ban in the country. At the end of the trip, he paid me in bitcoin with additional tip and I felt really happy about it. I know this is little but I hope it would help to promote mass adoption of bitcoin in my locality, the nation and passes a message to people out there that bitcoin is here to stay and all we can do is to embrace it and be part of history.",

There's no fixed price, bolt charges are based on the destination of the rider. There situations where you might be charged N1000 naira for a ride which is equivalent to $1.31 at N740 exchange rate. In this case no one would want to pay you in BTC because of the transaction fee. There are also situations were you might be charged N2000, N5000 which are equivalent to $2.7 and $6.7 respectively. If the rider is going interstate, then expect the cost to be higher than this, it might cost up to N15000 (20$) or more.

I'm actually thinking of putting two stickers at the back so that my riders can easily see it from there.

They've got some short comings to being very applicable.In one instance, bolt generally generates speculates how long and how many kilometres a ride might last and use that to speculate the price of the ride which is always visible to the passenger. Now, its know that many times, its always about that and on few occasions, traffic and other diversions can alter the price. Hence, its not something you pay as a go but upon arrival and its usually based on the price generated by the driver.Given the fact that, bitcoin transactions don't come with immediate confirmation timing and has got fees attached to its processing, how do you mediate between these. Increased fee surely ensures faster transactions and that might just be well over 30-50% of your ride fee.It just doesn't fill convenient and having to wait on transaction to get broadcasted and at least go through some confirmation.",

I was curious how you dealt with transaction fees and small amounts of transactions. By any chance, have you taken a look and considered Lightning Network for dealing with micro or small transactions? Would that be applicable and helps you? Or maybe that is out of option due to some reason.Anyway, It seems that your kind of activity is truly an example the ways of how to helps increasing cryptocurrency, especially bitcoins, adoption within some countries and communities. If there is an available bitcoin payment option, people whether directly or indirectly would be able to conceive of bitcoin's potency and benefit.",

Congratulations on getting your first bitcoin paid ride, many of the people here who have shared their story are yet to have a customer pay in bitcoin.

I wonder how OP will handle such situations considering the time frame for the blockchain network to reach three confirmations. Do you just let them go with the transaction pending because bitcoin transaction is “irreversible”.",

Unfortunately the fee is something global just like bitcoin and it doesn't take into account that $0.5 can be worth something. In developed countries you can't buy anything for that much. In Germany 1 EUR, which is more than twice the fee, won't even make the driver turn his meter on. A cheapest coffee costs you more than 1 EUR and 0.4 EUR is the price of a salad dressing at McDonalds. If you can get somewhere for $0.4 or buy a meal, that's great for you, but it's not a problem of bitcoin, just your country is cheap compared to the rest of the world.",

      "body": "This is a cool initiative, mate. In my school days, one day in an economics lecture, we were taught about the characteristics of a good entrepreneur, and I remember vividly that a good entrepreneur is a solution finder. It is true that the redesign of the naira note is affecting the people, and as a result, there is not enough cash for citizens to see and spend. But the idea of accepting Bitcoin would be a solution for your customers who would prefer to pay in Bitcoin, and with your sticker on the windscreen, it will also make your new customers curious, and if they are not yet exposed to Bitcoin, they might want to get themselves involved. So, bro, also get ready to teach 😉🥂, because some people may ask you a lot of questions about Bitcoin and others may want you to completely educate them. I am in a position where some of my customers who are not into Bitcoin get to ask me. One thing that surprises me is that some people still think that Bitcoin is only used by fraudsters, popularly known as \"yahoo boys,\" in some countries. While some of my customers would also ask me if there really is any market for Bitcoin (the main thing is that most people are not really aware of the digital currency, decentralized exchange, and centralized exchange), they don't know a thing about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.Even if you don't often get customers paying with Bitcoin, the sticker on your windscreen is a good advertisement for Bitcoin, and as Franky suggested, you should also put another sticker in the passenger area. Given Bitcoin's volatility, I usually convert to fiat currency after accepting Bitcoin payment and only keep my profit in bitcoin, so that even if Bitcoin prices fall, I don't have to worry about it because I've already converted my capital to fiat. You could also consider taking that step unless you only want to hold your bitcoin payment without spending any.",

Secondly this is not really creating awareness about bitcoin, thus just really shows that you accept bitcoin payments because people who know how to make payments with bitcoins already have bitcoins and are already bitcoin users and not new to it. Because people you carry are people in transit, they may just be interested in paying quickly with money or normal bank transfer.",
