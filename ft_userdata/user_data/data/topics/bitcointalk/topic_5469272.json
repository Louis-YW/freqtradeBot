  "content": "Greetings house. Abeg I don dey reason this tin since I say my express am out today.So many of us on this BotcoinTalkDiscussion forum dey ¬†take off our minds 4rm instead of adhering the capitals b/w \"Replying Posts\" and \"Creating Topics\" on this forum.Many of us only base on the goal 4 their POSTs to yield them MERITs 4getting say here na discussion forum capitalizing on BTC and not just of the MERITs.See... U can drop a reply on ones POSTs maybe look away but u see ur own created TOPIC? E no make sense to just drop am and look away in just that short note of time because your TOPICs creations calls for discussions such as to arguements, debates, contribution of individual ideas, encouragement and motivation, disagreeing to agree by picking the best points and it is believe say u as the TOPIC creator created the TOPIC as a means to take learn or share some ideas or update to or from the forum.So if u overlook the contents(thread) u created then means your point of creating the TOPIC remains effortless to u maybe u only insighted on gaining MERITs.With my best of notice, this platform no get notification alert were u go get notice say so so & so replied on ur post or made a post unless u visits its board & majorly na this system dey cos the overflooded of threads on the board(s) whether relevant or not, no 1 cares. üòèNa so \" I don't care\" dey take start b4 realizing we dey 4forget our BTC passwords and private keys oh hmm.As a matter of fact, such states na n dey make some investors being unstable from their businesses wetin them know na jumping 4rm 1 source 2 another til their stipulated is worthless and lavished due to uncertain ness & lack of concentration. This just be like wetin we dey talk 4 our local areas say... Nodding people heads together while u walk away.Conclusion >>> Do not junk with ur participations on the forum especially ur created topic (threads). U most learn to find relevances and contentment to that business u finds urself especially if u are into BTC investment.",
