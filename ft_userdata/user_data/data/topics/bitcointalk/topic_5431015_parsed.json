With winter approaching, it appeared the Kremlin intended to strangle the flow of energy to millions across the continent, an act of \"blackmail,\" some leaders said, designed to threaten countries into withdrawing their financial and military support for Ukraine.And then comes this admission: \"But now, after months of investigation, numerous officials privately say that Russia may not be to blame after all for the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines.\"The Post issued the rare about-face of accusations after interviewing a total of 23 diplomatic and intelligence officials in nine countries who have been privy to the international investigation into the sabotage incident which has threatened European energy supplies going into winter....",

      "body": "Personally, I believe that many of the things that are happening in the world are are attempts by some extremely super-wealthy people, to take over the world more directly.The US Constitution and laws give the US people almost direct control over government and their lives. Most of the people don't realize this, or know how to use what they have available to themselves, in US law. Canada, the UK, and Australia are similar. India is following closely behind because of its having been ruled by Britain for such a long time.One of the major freedoms that US people have is individual gun freedom. Without this freedom, the country - and then the world - could be made to collapse easily. So, this and other freedoms are what the super-wealthy people are fighting against.Everything that is being done in the Ukraine war and other areas around the world, are designed to collapse people freedom. It wouldn't be that the people wouldn't have reasonable lives without freedom. But they would always be on call to give their time and talents to the super-wealthy, by force if necessary.There is one basic thing that the super-wealthy are after. It's everlasting life for themselves, along with the control. They want to live, and to live in a healthy way, for a long time... maybe a thousand years, if possible. But the longer they can live in pure health, the more they will desire for themselves.We don't count, individually. We count only for the ability we have to give them what they desire.",

Seems like the are more interested in escalation than anyone else given their tendency to throw around accusations without actual proof. There wasn't a reason for Russia to blow up Nord Stream because if it had actually been them, then it would have prompted an aggressive international response. Which country is interested in seeing Russia wiped from the planet? Who has a motive?",

Although an investigation into this economic sabotage is still ongoing, maybe in a few months the culprit might be unveiled. Except it is proved otherwise, but I don't think Russia is behind this attack. Russian doesn't need to destroy the pipeline to stop the transportation of gas to Europe, they could just shut down the flow of gas from Russia. This attack is a desperate move to force European nations to seek alternatives to Russian gas by all means. I think it is targeted at destabilizing the gas export of Russia now and in the future. The conclusion that Russia is behind the attack without any probe or investigation is the handiwork of the propaganda machinery of some countries.",
