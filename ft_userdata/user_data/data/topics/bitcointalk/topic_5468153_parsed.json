I don't need a prophet to tell me what was burnt at the Supreme Court... we all know what it will be.This in what they really meant by \"go to court\" . Burning evidence in court is nothing new.

We have heard so many cases of monkey and snake jamboree, money missing mysteriously and as a matter of fact, that incidence is not the first fire outbreak incidence of that nature here In Nigeria. Sensitive government agencies experience that as well when there is much heated cases and we hear  files are destroyed and that made me believe the result of this fire outbreak would not be different from others. The same old story with different tactics.  We already know their gimmicks and strategic planning ahead. So therefore the news did not come to us a surprise because we too know the outcome.",

Many funny incidence that would make people begin to reason the crop of leaders we elect into our exalted number one office.They are just there making caricature of themselves and  their positions as our leaders. We are not kids to give in to those cock  and bull tales men. We are adults and matured thinking adults for that matter so nobody should think they would just come up with a tale to tell us and think we would believe them that easy. The truth is that the system here is messed up that everyone is mindful and are afraid of talking for the fear of the unknown. Nobody wants to be a victim of any circumstances as a result being tagged a saboteur by the government of the day.",

Playing their little cheap tricks  I laugh in Spanish at Supreme Court spokesman to reason give Nigerians sae the cause of the fire na electrical fault. Is this not funny for him to come up with this kind lie, give the whole Nigerians at this time wey everyone wan hear their own side(Supreme Court) verdict on the presidential election brought before them by the LP and PDP candidate. This untrue circumstance d make me the reason some kind thing on why this kind thing go happen this time. The said electrical fault no happen since, em come be this time wey Nigerians needs to hear the Supreme Court verdict also. Since their colleague wey be Tribunal don give their own judgement wrongly. Is this not a way of them indirectly running away from their side of judgment(lols). My question for the matter come be, did this electrical fault wey cause the fire, happen for Supreme Court not to give their own judgement concerning presidential election cos as em d so, this is another way for Supreme Court to dodge their own side ruling so as to die to case and make Tinubu continue to the rule us(t's well sha). Anyway, nothing do Supreme Court people wey come up with such an idea to get Supreme Court building burnt. Let them not think that it's over cos it is not. them and their families will someday get the result of this their act in the future. na God go judge them walahi",
