It just never got that much traction for some reason.With crypto becoming more mainstream it will probably do better this time, or at least we can hope.-Dave",

I wish them every luck with 3.0 project, but I don't have high hopes for that becoming widely popular marketplace all of the sudden, than again I was wrong before about many things.I think it will take some time after they lunch 3.0 project to gain popularity again, considering it was one of the famous decentralized online marketplace that use crypto. I'm excited to see what modifications their new site will bring, but for now it says openbazaar 3.0 - coming soon on a black screen. https://openbazaar.org/",

I remember merchant have to keep their computer/server online all the time (to make their goods searchable by user) and user need to install software which is a bit resource demanding where search took some time.Yeah, keeping the machine running was a big negative for the non tech people out there. Hopefully this time they either set something up that can allow others to host / mirror your store. Or a plugin for something like Umbrel / MynodeBTC where you just click a button and it does the rest.And having some other coins would be nice too.Along with a UI that was not from the early 2000s So, they do have a lot to do, but at least they are doing something.-Dave",

It's nice to see that they're trying to revive OB, but I really feel sorry for all of the developers who worked on \"Mobezha [fork of OB (I prefer not to vouch)]\" to keep its spirit alive.",

The word wasn't used as a form of description.I recommend reading this bit in the history page:QuoteAmir Taaki and a group of programmers from Bitcoin startup Airbitz created a decentralized marketplace prototype, called \"DarkMarket\", in April 2014 at a Bitcoin Hackathon in Toronto. DarkMarket was developed as a proof of concept in response to the seizure of the darknet market Silk Road in October 2013. Taaki compared DarkMarket's improvements on Silk Road to BitTorrent's improvements on Napster.After the hackathon, the original creators abandoned the prototype and it was later adopted and rebranded to OpenBazaar by a new team of developers. On April 4, 2016, OpenBazaar released their first version, which allowed users to buy and sell goods for Bitcoin.",

There might be some of them who might try it to buy something occassionaly, however, they might also not use it as their first choice of currency for shopping much of the time.",
