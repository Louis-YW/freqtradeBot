  "content": "Are you a bounty or signature campaign manager and want some tools to keep track of your campaigns/bounties? Want a dashboard to see all posts, entries, users, and many more? Maybe a bot to manage your topics or do calculations for you? The sky is the limit!Since I'm almost traveling and want a reason to buy a laptop (using my phone to do internet stuff is a pain in the ass), I'm now up for hire if you want me to code something for you. Give me a financial reason to buy a good coding laptop, please. For those who don't know, I'm the guy behind some tools here in the forum:[TELEGRAM] Yet Another BitcoinTalk Notification BOT (merits, mentions, topics,+) - A telegram bot that is used by 700+ users on a daily basis to make their forum activities more dynamic with near real time notifications. It comes with a bot that scrapes all posts and merits on the forum.Ninjastic.space - BitcoinTalk Post/Address archive + API - An archive that lets you see stats about users and the forum, search posts and addresses.Portuguese board raffle bot - A bot that I used on the Portuguese local board many times to manage raffles for the community. Someone creates a new topic, posts the link in the raffle official topic, and the bot will keep track of everything (even finish the raffle and choose a winner!) (Example).[Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images - A script that helped many users update their posts images when imgur broke the forum.And many more scriptsWait no more! DM me or contact me through telegram @TryNinjaIf you want to help me buy a laptop regardless (i.e because you like my tools), feel free to send me a few sats: bc1qtk4ucftjhadyn6d6emteg8r3zzd5vq0s2m62fw",

I recommend your service to bounty managers, as you can provide a fabulous tool that saves them time and makes their work with hundreds of hunters smooth.And because I like your tools and in appreciation of your efforts, I sent you a small tip; you deserve more than that.  TXN: ccd239ecbbcd5c87bcd38d5911f603e822840f1c7059941f640e65e185757b4d",
