      "body": "Let's say their accusations are correct and they all have the necessary tools to prove that the USA has indeed helped the Ukrainian army by supplying those heavy war machinery to give them an advantage. Is this some sort of a sign that the USA and western allies might join soon? because they might speculate by now, that the Russian forces are weakening due to months of the never-ending war with Ukraine. If this gonna happen, then it is really bad. I really hope it's not the case.",

Your thoughts...It's the same reason why the U.S. was not willing to put a no-fly zone back in March, they don't want to escalate. They're satisfied with a war by proxy. It's what the U.S. has been doing with Russia in the middle east for years as they were dealing with Bashar al-Assad. As long as they don't escalate with a direct declaration of war, war by proxy seems to be a winning strategy.",

But the shelling done in that area, by both Russian and Ukrainian forces is destroying it. Check the interactive war maps on the Internet. I think that Ukraine can still fight. From the link, it seems the Russians are a bit bothered by the intro of these Himars. Yes, there has been losses, but who knows what will happen when they finally accept defeat? There'll probably be no Ukraine to tell your children about and if Putin still remains in power, there'd be nothing in history books..  I think Zelensky knows that the best way to end the war is to give in, but he'd be no worse than Genghis Khan when the Russians invaded and conquered Siberia, if he doesn't fight harder and coupled with the support from the US, I think he's headed somewhere.",

Now don't get me wrong, the US foreign aggressive politics have been terrorizing the world since after WW1, but that doesn't mean Russia hasn't done the same, so this is just a classic example of whataboutism.",

Anyway, Russia don't really have any right to complain about these hot new toys, they're the ones the fired the first shot. They could have settled with a proxy war between Kyiv and the separatist regions they were supporting but they instead chose to put their boots on the ground. Now they're going to keep getting bogged down there. There were already within striking distance of Kyiv, they could have drastically cut this conflict short by outright taking over the capital and installing a new government.",
