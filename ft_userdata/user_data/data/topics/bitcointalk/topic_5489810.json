      "body": "Even if they spend hundreds of billions for that kind of attack, I don't think that we're ever going to see any change in bitcoin, in fact, the moment that bitcoin becomes Ripple's target means that they're going to give bitcoin more popularity and people that's invested in bitcoin doesn't really care too much about what others will say about bitcoin in a negative manner because at the end of the day, bitcoin is the one that will always come out on top. If Ripple doesn't even try to do other things, we'd probably see no results with what they're currently doing, they need to do some planning regarding how to impact bitcoin market in a negative way and without that plan ever biting them from the ass when they execute that plan.",

Bitcoin has proven to be here to stay and no individual, organization or country can bring it down.Try making a quick search on those attacking Bitcoin you would see a long list even from religious leaders, but none has achieved their malicious aims. Bitcoin controls the market even if we want to ignore that it is the truth. The bull run happening now would depend on how Bitcoin does, that is how strong the impact of Bitcoin is already.",

It's very clear from day one that Ripple was created to convert the decentralized money into centralized and we have seen how they pumped it hard during 2017 and even managed to reach #2 rank for a while but they have failed and now more people are aware about their intentions and this would only give more investment to Bitcoin and people would stay away from Ripple.",

It is a common practice in business for inferior competitors to attack the main products just to get cheap publicity. The price of XRP Ripple is just $0.6395, so it is not close to the price of Bitcoin which shows that the coin is not close to being a competitor. They will always claim to be the saviour of the environment to attack Bitcoin. Meanwhile, banks use more power and even Xman Light during Christmas consumes even more electricity. We have seen more Bitcoin mining firms diversifying to clean and green power success. All these attacks will not have any effect on Bitcoin because the coin has even quelled bigger attacks.",

Bitcoin has its own purpose and has its userbase, it's impossible to make Bitcoin user a fan of Ripple because these coins have very different fundamentals and to say it briefly, very different fanbase. If there is a competition between cryptocurrencies and any cryptocurrency becomes a worthy competitor of Bitcoin, then it will be amazing. We shouldn't look at crypto world like this or that coin is an enemy of Bitcoin, there doesn't exist enemy crypto, there is only a better crypto and bitcoin should be progressive to be the number one cryptocurrency.Quote from: alexey14 on March 21, 2024, 04:16:29 PMThis is the person https://twitter.com/chrislarsensf who spend more than 5M$ to attack bitcoin.

The only thing I'd mention is that this news is almost 2 years old, the articles date back to the end of March 2022. So I'm not sure how, where, and why it's breaking news.Ripple is trying to compete against Bitcoin, but the thing with Ripple is that no matter how hard they try to get the favour of traditional players like banks, they just aren't getting enough attention and aren't valuable enough to them. Bitcoin stays true to itself and successfully beats Ripple.",

The exchanges should delist ripple and it should get banned by the SEC and every other central authority there is. Ripple's own existence is an attack on crypto. It shows that people will trade anything as long as they can trade it. It shows us that most people aren't interested in the fundamentals and that's very concerning.
