  "content": "Hi everyone. Looking to sell the following domain name, it would make a great marketplace website, very easy to remember, nice and short.I'm a new member, and am from Australia. Having recently lost faith in Eth I've moved my attention back to Bitcoin, and trying to have more of a deep dive into the nuts and bolts of things, hence why I have joined this site.I'd be happy to have a video call over Zoom or Skype prior to payment to put a face to the forum name if that would help.Any questions please ask happy to accommodate in any way I can. Closing the auction 12pm, Saturday 21st, Â Melbourne, Australia time - time will be extended by 1 hour for each new bid to prevent snipingThe transfer is a very simple process, the domain is registered under my account with namecheap.com, to change ownership I just simply input the email address of the new owner, they are sent a link to take over the ownership, in which they then need to create a free account with namecheap if they don't already have one.",
