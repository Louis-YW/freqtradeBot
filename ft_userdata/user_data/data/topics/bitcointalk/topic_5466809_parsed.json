  "content": "I go to a local antique shop here that selling mostly items from Japan. I saw a lot of old japanese coins(not fiat) selling as collectibles but I don't know if there's a potential buyer here. I'm not sure either on how to check this coin since I'm not familiar with japanese coin.I will try to send picture later since the cabinet it was stored is not allowed to open without the manager key which sadly not available when I visit the shop this morning. The price of each coin ranging from 20$ to 50$ and the metarial it was made is probably copper or bronze due to the collar. Anyone interested here on this kind of collectibles or if anyone knew about japanese coin collectibles?",
