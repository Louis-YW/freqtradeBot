  "content": "A bitcoin miner is someone who solves a puzzle, such as the next computational and technological problem in the bitcoin network, and gets rewarded in bitcoin for doing so. They serve as the foundation for confirming bitcoin transactions on the bitcoin network. Miners also confirm transactions across the network and are compensated with the network fee of the transaction they have confirmed into the bitcoin network or blockchain. Given that not all miners can afford the high cost of purchasing computational power to own a node in the bitcoin network, which gives them an advantage over other nodes, are they still miners who only focus on approving transactions rather than solving the puzzle to be rewarded in bitcoin for their effort of being the first person to solve the puzzle? Since it is difficult to maintain and manage a node, won't they still earn plenty money by just confirming transactions on the bitcoin network only?",

It is done as a whole.Basically it goes like this:Get a candidate block filled with unconfirmed transaction that are verified to be valid including the reward.Generate a 'block header' containing the merkle root hash computed from those transactions and other data (more info: en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm)Then that block header is hashed with SHA256 twice, and the result should be lower than the target to be \"mined\".The last part is the computably expensive part which requires the expensive mining devices,without doing that, the miner's candidate block is nothing but a candidate and they wont get the reward in it.Note: I've asked a Mod to move this to \"Beginners and Help\" board where the question and answers might help a lot of beginners.",

It is done as a whole.Technically you can just run a full node, which verify all transactionsAlthough you won't receive any reward for this, it is an useful role of the network, keeping it decentralized,  more secure and more private (for those who run them)Quotehttps://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#special-casesWhat Is A Full Node?A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.",

Since it is difficult to maintain and manage a node, won't they still earn plenty money by just confirming transactions on the bitcoin network only?Firstly it is not all difficult to try and run your own full node which basically is just to have large space to download the full blockchain which is currently around 550GB with an increase of about 2GB weekly or you run a prune node which doesn’t stores all block but just few blocks. It is the mining nodes that require high computational power (mining tools like ASIC) to able to get the puzzle solved faster than other mining nodes. This puzzle is solved by just increasing the nonce which is part of the block header until it gets below the target level ( it is this target level that gets adjusted after every 2016 blocks, to maintain the 10 minutes set as average time for block confirmation). And the if the nonce falls below the target level this miners candidates block is what will be verify by other nodes to be included into the blockchain. Now the miner that actually gets to mine is candidate block gets both the reward for the block and also the transaction fees of the transactions he included into that his candidate block. So in simple term there is no way to get the transactions fees as reward by just being a full node, you must have to be miner that get to mines that block which will qualify you to get the transaction fees as reward",
