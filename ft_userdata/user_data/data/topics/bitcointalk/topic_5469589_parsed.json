There are times that the market do reverse, but this may not favor people that are using high leverage, and in that regard, using stop loss can be good.",

This is very important because you can expect a market setup that is in line with your plan. You will not be confused if you have a trading plan.Quote_ Don't make emotional driven decisions: Emotions like fear and greed can cloud our sense of reasoning and leads to impulsive action, just stay calm and stick to your plan.Trading emotions are normal because you're trading with real money. Your emotions will get worse and might control you if you are not confident in your trades, so you must have backtested your strategy.Quote_ Not managing risk properly: this protect your capital, by using stop loss other, It minimize potential losses.There is no strategy that has a 90% to 100% win rate, so risk management is needed. There are many traders who even have a 40% win rate but they managed to be profitable because they have risk management.",

Since what OP mentioned are common mistakes, it should also have a common solution but the problem is, it's hard to execute in the actual trading. Those who left trading are not really just they lose but rather they just lose interest in trading.Look at those who experience terrible losses even for years. They don't give up and able to bounce back on those losses and now seen as a successful traders today. Practice might not always can turned into perfect but what matter here is, the consistent win over losses.",

They just need to remain focus and disciplined.The biggest trick that separates the experience traders with the newbies is the fact that the newbies do not actual learn a single thing from their losses which is what professionals use to make them self perfect. The newbie is always fixed to his strategy and even when they continue to lose they don’t switch but the professionals usually navigate through many strategies even those that were originated by them and this where a loss is doesn’t matter to the professionals because he is learning a thing or two from it. Quote from: Kara3 on October 07, 2023, 10:28:17 PM_ Not doing enough research: knowledge is key in trading , knowing the craft is very important, take your time to study the market, analyse chart pattern, and stay updated to news that can impact your trade.Remember trading requires not just strategy, but discipline Follow up a strategy you learn or read about with practice because it is only in experience that you will gain the proper knowledge, the strategy might look ok on paper and but in reality it is not the best strategy to use in trading. Lastly there is no time frame to Learn a trade, it is a continuous process some people take just little time to reach or near the perfection point while some take a very long time before they get professional, so continue trading even if you lose but with a little amount. Do not go on and trade same way that gamblers do.",

If you as a new trader do not find out why you have been unsuccessful in your first live trade even after successfully trading on demo, you will be making a huge mistake. Another mistake a newbie trader can be making is to have too many mentors that you are learning from or studying their pattern. Too many mentors will lead you more to confusion and can make simple things more complicated to understand. Choose a few good mentors, learn from them and study their style and strategy.",

Every time the market situation changes, it requires additional strategies that are not explained in theory.

I don't see what's the problem here. you are never meant to always win your first trade. there are no rules that in order to become a successful trader you need to win your first trade. and with all that you have said you missed out a very important point. it is to learn to lose. The basics rule of trading is to trade with something that you can afford to lose. The second is emotion control and the third is to learn to lose. there is no certain order in which this should be done, but these are the basic rules that we need to follow in the beginning. so what is learn to lose? you start with a small amount for trading, and you do all your analysis based on what you have learned and set your goal such as opening the thread and choosing a closing point and also using stop loss or take profit. no matter what happens you should never change anything on that first trade. if you lose the trade then you lose it. there is nothing you should do about this trade. you are following the analysis, and you should stick to it. if you lose this trade, then you just close it and move on to your next one. when you learn how it feels to lose and if you can conquer that feeling of losing then emotion would never influence you. losing is not a bad thing if you are learning. and the key is to keep doing it and not give up. people who quit always put all their money in one trade and lose it on their first trade. and they keep on doing the same mistake over and over again. this is the thing we need to solve not losing trades. diversifying your trade is also a good idea.",

Gambling typically isn't structured for players to consistently win, whereas cryptocurrency trading offers a more structured pathway to potential profits. With the right timing and responsible management of greed, it's possible to multiply your investment in a good cryptocurrency.
