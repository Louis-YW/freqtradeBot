Does it matter if you use Tor to look at transactions but just didn't have all internet traffic through Tor when you activate your wallet on your phone or computer? As long as you are holding bitcoin and crypto on a non-custodial wallet, no one will be able to track you. I don't think that IP address could be an issue as ISP are usually not monitoring which sites or applications you are accessing. If you want that your ISP does not know if you are accessing bitcoin wallets or centralized wallets/exchanges, then you should use a VPN.",

I don't think that IP address could be an issue as ISP are usually not monitoring which sites or applications you are accessing. False, non custodial wallet has nothing to do with privacy.Electrum is non custodial wallet, but since it's lightweight wallet (SPV) you're connecting to someone server, not running your own full node.Actually if you want to have 100% privacy, you must not let your ISP or government that know you're have a Bitcoin on specific address you used.QuoteIf you want that your ISP does not know if you are accessing bitcoin wallets or centralized wallets/exchanges, then you should use a VPN.Masking your IP address via VPN is a bad idea, since VPN offer poor privacy. You need to use Tor.Moreover most of exchanges are against of VPN usage and can't use Tor, the best way is use Bisq that run via Tor.",

Not everyone is using VPN nor TOR anymore. We care about privacy but not that someone would be tracking your IP address how important could you be in this world Snowden or Assange?These people are even using twitter accounts while publicly saying they own BTC. No one cares anymore except maybe for those people who are in the country that illegality BTC/crypto. They could be prosecuted for having BTC.",

They could be prosecuted for having BTC.Most of people who publicly say they own Bitcoin is a popular people who have a body guard in their home, are you have a body guard that will protect you when you're sleeping?Of course using Bitcoin in illegal countries is break their local law, but it's a different discussion.Quote from: AbuBhakar on July 09, 2022, 07:35:10 AMIn your case, You are afraid about blackmailing if someone knew you are using Bitcon but the question is how will someone knew it if you are not posting online or letting them know thay you are using Bitcoin? Unless there is only few people in your country and its easy to track your daily activity. Because if a hacker will hack you through your IP then how come he will choose you as target without any basis for his attempt?IP address is a sensitive information and if they know your full IP address without any censor, they will know the specific location where you live. Also it's not hard to find additional information to know the person is, since we're already see so many company/institutions are exposed to secure their customers data.",

      "body": "ok lets handle a few points raised.IP addresses change, people can have dynamic addresses and such. (which some ISP's are too lazy to tag a true geo-location too.)heres a few things to remember thoughthere is not a man sat at your ISP(internet service provider) watching your every move.however your ISP has an algo to store your internet history at their end too. and they keep it for a few years.so although you may not be a criminal now, and bitcoin may not be banned, restricted or licenced now in any/all. things may change in a few years.even just knowing that certain wallets use certain ports, an certain packet lengths of messages is enough for someone to work out you use bitcoin.. authorities can then ask for a copy of your history/metadata from your ISP backdated X years and see what block explorer site you kept checking and see if there was an address that you kept looking at more then once.orwhat packet data of certain ports was sent/received to work out what apps/software you useusually if you are checking random people, you have different addresses being requested in blockexplorers for each day/session. but if your checking your own balance still has coins on it or the value of them coins every few weeks or months then you end up checking the same address more then once.. then they will put 1and 1 together and believe the address you often look for is your own stash..as for IP addresses. even this forum logs IP addresses, and if it were hacked they can associate your forum name with an IP address. and then do what hackers do best with an IP address.. hack the IP userother things like if you use tor. they can get to you via your IP entry point into torobviously hackers can do other things too, such as send you spam PM's advertising some trojan software. . the list goes on",

      "body": "That totally depends on the ISP you are using some ISPs won't give you a real external IP address and they are using nat, so the IP you see on the internet is not actually your real IP address however the isp and the governments can trace you and have access to your real IP address, and check if you visited the bitcoin-related websites or used the cryptocurrency wallets. that's very easy for them to trace people like that. But some other people will use VPNs while this cannot guarantee your privacy because after they trace your IP address they will understand that you are using a VPN service, as far as I know, they can use AI to get your real IP address, but if you use the tor network there is less possibility for them and if you use a trusted VPN and tor network this will be a pain for everyone to trace your activities and the wallets you use.",
