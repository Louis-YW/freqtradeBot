And crypto isn't good at creating them. How many jobs did crypto create? Some thousands of exchange employees, and some developers, writers, promoters here and there. Not enough to matter on a global scale. And most of the world is not using crypto, because people don't feel the need and benefits in doing so. So in terms of global trends and economy, crypto is a very small thing, despite existing for well over a decade.",

Traders and currency traders, who are fortunate to become rich from their activities promote the theory that crypto is the source of their wealth and not other factors. While the truth is that luck cannot be relied upon while launching projects. There are many safe investments that can achieve huge returns compared to crypto. Most of the investors in crypto are from countries where the fields of investment are limited, so they do not hesitate to venture.",

So unexpected and some thoughtful advancement that could be done with technology in the later future. Perhaps Perhaps system of recycled energy within a device to ensure it keeps been powered.Anyway, the social media is truly helping the masses of our time and it doesn't end in just money but the more people benefit from the various contents that are made available to them from the Internet. Yeah, it does have its demerits but also, it motivates others to try being creative and benefit from that.Other than waiting on white collar jobs and having people being able to laugh away there demise.",

Crypto trading/investing is a zero sum game, which cannot create wealth by itself.2. The social media influencers don't make money directly from the social media platforms(even thought Tik Tok has such feature). They use the social media platforms to gather a following and build an army of fans. Later on, they monetize that army of fans via different ways, like selling merch or using services like Patreon.Technology can't create wealth by itself.

In my own part of the country many youths have through the social media showcase their talents through comic short-skits video with the likes of tiktok, Facebook, etc and this has made them gather much followers and likes numbering in million on their page which in turn has given and still giving them financial benefit or should I say making money from it. We all know that there is a certain number of followers you will have on Instagram and you will be receiving payment from Instagram due to the numbers.So this is one way among many other that social media has help to drop concurrent income into the pockets of many which I could personally refer to as wealth creation.As for the last paragraph you referred to as being grandiloquent, lolz. What I actually meant was that back in times past means of making assets was not so much available in just with some few clicks away as technology has made it easier today.Thank you!",
