  "content": "Hello everyone,I'm experiencing some issues with Mercatox.com. On August 23, 2023, at 15:58:29, I opened a ticket to change my email address. I provided them with the requested information and pictures, answered their questions, and everything seemed fine. However, my request has been forwarded to the Security Department, and I've been waiting for days on end without any updates.In the past 34 days, I've reached out to them with 10 different inquiries, and the response is almost always the same: 'It's in a queue, we apologize for the long wait, and we'll inform you when it's changed.' I keep receiving the same response repeatedly, and I'm unable to use my old email address.Is it normal for Mercatox.com to take this long to change an email address, or is there a possibility that they are attempting to defraud me of my funds? What steps can I take to recover my funds, given their less-than-ideal treatment of their users?",

      "body": "Care to tell us why you are still using this platform, yet we do have a number of much better and popular alternatives?I have an abandoned account in Mercatox, but honestly I see nothing good about this exchange. From the poor User interface to the low liquidity in the orderbooks.Worse still, why did you leave funds in the exchange when attempting to change an email address? You now have no choice but wait until they sort you out, that is, if they don't scam you.",

Maybe the only thing you can do is make noise on social media. I've seen similar threads about the same issue, not limited to Mercatox, and most of the time OP can only make threads on Reddit or Twitter. You can request help from popular accounts although the chance to get their notice is quite low. You can also try to make a scam accusation if the service you used has a presence on this forum, but if they don't give a damn about it then it can't be helped.",

If you can log in from an old IP without a VPN, your problem may be resolved faster, but 34 days is enough to solve this problem.If you have assets on that platform, use Reddit and make noise there reply faster than here, else move to an alternative exchange.",

Perhaps OP is trying to get the funds they left ages ago?So @OP, by \"and I'm unable to use my old email address\", do you mean you can't login from the start hence the change of email request or you could at the beginning but old email was later revoked after you sent your request to mercatox? if it's the former, are you sure there is no way of recovering your old email? cause that might be faster.",

When I reached out for assistance, they asked for information like my account balance, the cryptocurrencies I used, a photo of me holding my ID with the current date, and I promptly provided all of this information on the same day.However, since then, I have received responses that only say, 'Please wait, your request is in a queue and will be processed soon.'

They haven't mentioned any issues with my information, IP address, or other potential problems.Sadly this is just the norm if you use a centralized service. They have to make sure they don't recover your account to a scammer hence why the process can take quite long, but definitely not as long as months or years (assuming they are not scammers in the first place). If we assume they are not scamming you, there is a chance that there is a queue, or maybe they lost your data too and are trying to recover it from their backup servers. Who knows.There is nothing you can do except be patient, and make a post on social media as mentioned above. It might give them pressure to process your issue faster, albeit the chance is low.

At worst, they are scammers and may misuse your ID and a piece of paper displaying the current date (they may use it to verify identity for other services).In any case, stop sending them more data, as the data you sent is sufficient to verify you, especially if you have not changed the IP and cookies.",

I guess I was totally wrong, and the issue is they have only one media of getting in touch with the support. The other social media links are just info and news channels.If you ever manage to get your funds out of there, just delete your account off mercatox platform",
