  "content": "The central Bank of Nigeria has limited cash withdrawal from banks and ATMs to #100,000 ~ $135(at the time of writing this post) per week for each and every citizen of the country.And have limited cash withdrawals for cooperations/enterprise in the country to #500,000 ~ $672(at the time of writing this post) per week.Withdrawing any amount above those limit they said will attract a 5% fee for individuals and 10% fee for cooperations/enterprise.Withdrawing from point of sale(POS) service have also been limited to a mere #20,000 ~ $27(at the time of writing this post) on a daily basis.The restrictions are said to be compounded for each withdrawal, so for example, someone who withdraws $27 dollars from an ATM on the same day and then tries to withdraw money from a bank will be charged a 5% service fee.And of course alot of people in the country did not welcome this development and many are speculating that this is the government's strategy/move to enforce the use of the country's central bank digital currency(CBDC) which was launched some time last year but up until now, less than 0.5% of the citizens are using it or have used it, I don't know how true this speculation is, but the fact remains that this is a breach to the freedom citizens have over their hard earned money that they decided to save in the bank, and it's not good, how can a serious business/cooperation be limited to having access to just #500,000 of their money in a whole week? Fortunately for me, I have 5 Nigerian bank accounts but I don't have a dime in any of them  , 70% of my entire savings in tired up in bitcoin and some other crypto currencies, 28% is tired up in my business while the remaining 2% is in my pocket for my daily expenditures.What is your take on this development? Are you a Nigerian or a business Man, did this development affect you or your business in any way?",

Many peer to peer exchange will definitely send the Fiat to your bank account. Do you think of any alternative to changing Bitcoin to Fiat that will bypass the banking rule?",

Well good for you if you have assets in Bitcoin or this industry in general but I think any problem was solved given that you only manage to make transaction \"privately\" through this block chain but since what you've mentioned is country related problem, this is only applicable if cryptocurrency is widely accepted in a country and fortunately, Nigeria is one of the major global user of cryprocurrency but what if same thing happened but in different country? A country wherein cryptos are not widely accepted. Will the same 'strategy' work? 'coz if that's the case you'd be only allowed to make use of your crypto money outside that country.",

Though Bitcoin is really helpful to alternate fiat, it doesn't you can rely on it, the government will always ask about your taxation which is IRS recommends having a bank account to make it easier to keep records.  AFAIK, every bank has different fee structures and features such as business and personal have different limitations which as business accounts typically have higher fees and minimum balance requirements.My advice is always to separate your personal bank account from your business account. It might you can keep some of your assets in Bitcoin and that would the case can help Bitcoin us but if your main purpose is to use Bitcoin and replace it with fiat, there's nothing you can do.",

Are you a Nigerian or a business Man, did this development affect you or your business in any way? One of the best option you have is to limit cash withdrawals. The Nigerian economy have been cash oriented which doesn't suit the current global financial standard that is why the government is pursuing a cashless project. The Central Bank of Nigeria currently spent so much money to redesign the naira and they want to make policies that will make the notes durable and not easy to use for crimes like ransom payments, corruption and money laundering. But this policy would have an initial negative impact on mostly small businesses. Lagos, Nigeria alone has about 20 million hawkers, carrying their goods mostly on their heads and selling them around the streets. Most of these traders have no bank accounts, so they cannot accept transfers. They would have no option now than to open bank accounts. 31% of Nigerians are not educated and might not have the necessary skills to carryout any online bank transactions. Which means that they would be forced to learn or become part of the unbanked population. The government must also ensure that online transactions issues such as arbitral bank charges, service and internet challenges are handled. For me, I don't think my daily expenses exceeds the $45 per day benchmark except if there are emergencies. And some small businesses accepts transfers or use PoS for payments. My only challenge is that most times bank online channels are either not available or slow. Sometimes you might have to wait for days before a transfers would reflect on the receivers account.",

Of course businesses will cross this limit and have to pay a service fee of 5% on each withdrawal, this will reduce their profits and as a result the goods sold will increase to cover the service fee. 5% is a large amount. and for co-ops and corporations the 10%, restrictions and insane service fees that weigh on everyone.When the government can't fully control bitcoin, then they will regulate the output of the bitcoin, people convert to Fiat and Fiat they regulate with restrictions and service fees.Bitcoin is the best choice for freedom without burdening anyone, but Bitcoin is widely opposed and not accepted as a solution to problems like this. this is because bitcoin is decentralized.",

The Central Bank is in bed with the president who is almost clueless as to how the cashless economy should work. No Nigerian will use or turn to the eNaira for transactions. It is already a dead project. Likewise it will also be difficult for any Nigerian business to turn to Bitcoin for transactions because the government still has restrictions on crypto transactions and will not fail to block any business account involved.

It can be a very effective tool against inflation which will control the spending habits of their citizens by not allowing extra funds in their hands. But if it's solely done for promoting CBDC, then it's a hilarious act and probably short-sighted. The use of CBDC will require some form of internet connectivity and a smartphone I believe. For a country like Nigeria, I don't think it's a super regular tool for all segments of its population.
