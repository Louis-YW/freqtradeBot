  "content": "A devastating earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit central Morocco a few hours ago. According to the BBC news, at least 820 people have died while over 600 people are being hospitalized. A lot of damage was caused by the earthquake.According to the US Geological Survey, The epicenter was in the High Atlas Mountains, about 71km (44 miles) south-west of Marrakesh, at a depth of 18.5km. This is really a very hard time for the people of Morocco. They really need the support of every one of us and especially the international community.May the almighty God see them through.",

Most of buildings weren't capable to whitstand such strong earthquake and outcome of it is much bigger number of victims than it could be. Every country which is dangerous zone where earthquakes can happen must follow Japan example where rules is very strict and their buildings can whitstand strong earthquakes. Unfortunately, it's not always possible, not just because these countries is poor but also because of corruption.",

I would in exchange ask those distributing the aid in Morocco for some credible proof that the help is actually reaching those that it is intended for, because I got the feeling that a large part will find its way into the coffers the the Moroccan elite.So before trying to be morally superior or dictating what other can say, take a few seconds to understand how the world works.",

The earthquake in Morocco is a powerful 6.8-magnitude and it is the highest the country has ever experienced since 1900. Marrakech the worst-hit area is mountainous which makes it a complicated terrain to build on. But your point is valid Hispo, most of those houses were not built to withstand this kind of natural disaster. With the knowledge of how earthquake-prone the areas are, the structures there would have been built to withstand this disaster. All these irregularities and substandard building is caused mainly by poverty and corruption. Most of these local dwellers are poor and can not afford standard houses and the government has been accused of mismanaging the country's resources. This was the same problem Turkey had when 7.8 and 7.5 magnitude hit the country. Most of the buildings were not built based on modern technological standards and the latest earthquake regulations. Corruption was the main issue in Turkey because regulatory bodies failed to do their work. Lands were even allocated to estate companies to build in areas that shouldn't be built on. There has been help from countries like Qatar, Spain, UK, and Joe Biden just announced that the US will give Morrocco all the support they need. We just hope that they get all the support they need to overcome this great loss.",

Natural catastrophes often have a long-term impact on the countries they affect, I hope they are able to overcome the loss and find an irreplaceable solution to this or reduce the likelihood of it happening again in the future. Natural catastrophes cannot be avoided, but their effects can be lessened by educating people about the hazards and teaching earthquake safety, which can help reduce human-caused earthquakes. This is heartbreaking news for the Moroccan people, and I hope the international community responds quickly. Many people have expressed their heartfelt condolences and prayers to them. I hope and pray they overcome this and we also pray such never happens to any country in the future again.",

It is a big contrast if we see at countries which have to deal with earthquakes and other natural disasters quite often and their funds are managed in a responsible way, Japan and Chile come to mind when dealing with earthquakes, their buildings are explicitly built so they can endure as much as possible those events, small movements are so common there that I have been told people do do pay attention to them anymore, unless it is specially strong. Also, Florida houses are build to face seasonal hurricanes and do not suffer permanent damages and be able to shelter people during those events. It just shows how far engineering can go when politicians truly care about people's well being, hopefully USA and other allies as relieve the pain of those poor victims..",

Days after the incident, some international communities intervened by sending aid to the Moroccan people to help in the rescue of those who are yet to be rescued and the delivery of urgent medical care to those who are most in need of it to survive. In response to the earthquake, the EU has donated one million euros for humanitarian purposes. The countries that have so far provided relief to the citizens of Marrakech are Italy, Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain.To read further about the aid provided by each country click hereMy heartfelt condolences to the people of Morocco.
