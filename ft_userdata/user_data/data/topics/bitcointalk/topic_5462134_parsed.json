  "content": "Greetings to Everyone, The company MicroStrategy whose Bitcoin assets total 1lac 52thousands 8 Hundred made a profit of $22.2 million in the second quarter of this year. This is a big change from the loss they suffered last year 2022.In July Month of 2023 they spent $14.4 million to buy 467 more Bitcoins which changed their profit compared to last year because their digital assets had a smaller loss in value.I aslo think Investing in Bitcoin was a good idea for MicroStrategy, as its price increased a lot. MicroStrategy used their own money to buy more Bitcoins and they believe more big investors are becoming interested in Bitcoin. They plan on selling some of their stocks in order to get more money to buy more Bitcoins in the future. SourceCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been increasing in price since 2023, and they are now worth around $29,206 which is good for MicroStrategy. Is MicroStrategy success with Bitcoin a sign that more companies will invest in cryptocurrency?",

Nobody can be indifferent to how someone makes huge profits on investing in bitcoin and other companies want it too. Seeing a MicroStrategy divest its shares and buy bitcoin with the proceeds, other investors may follow suit. This can create a chain reaction effect where institutional investors start buying btc one by one. The result of this is what the effect on the cryptomarket will be, you know.The actions of the MicroStrategy with bitcoin are something like advertising for the cryptoindustry. As long as they buy. It would be interesting to see what will happen if the MicroStrategy starts mass selling bitcoin. This will have to happen sometime, and that is why the MicroStrategy buys bitcoin. Otherwise, they will not make a profit. And here, the concentration of a big amount of btc in the hands of one whale can play a cruel joke.",

Although they have a huge amount of bitcoins on their balance sheet and it is obvious that it has to be reflected in the accounts, but in the stock market it is said that you don't win or lose until you sell, because you can think that you are making a profit with some shares and the day you go to sell there is a downturn in the market and you are in a loss.

They are the worst for DCA. Don’t know if you remember but they got a very good average buying at the $10K mark before the large bull market.Their issue was they kept buying as it was rallying. They were lucky with many of their buys but they started to buy the top pretty much. Instead of buying less they were buying more and more and their average price of $11K became like $35K very quickly and they were at a loss. They had a horrible DCA strategy.",

Do you have a crystal ball to know how the price will evolve? If bitcoin goes to a million or more in the future, doing DCA at $35,000 is a bargain, and as the price goes up, the average price of your DCA is likely to go up as well. I don't know if you were the one who stopped buying when the price went to $69,000 because you were the only one who knew the price wasn't going to go any higher this cycle, when all the predictions were for a much higher price peak. Tell me something, when the price in the future reaches one million dollars, what would you rather have, one bitcoin bought at $11,000 or 10 bitcoins bought at $30,000?",

The point of DCA is to actually continue buying regardless of what the price is. Their strategy just comes of as “worst” simply because we already saw what happened with BTC’s price from the time they bought, to today. Hindsight is 20:20.And I don’t even think they’re actually doing actual DCA — they seem to be just buying when they have enough cash.",

MicroStrategy is considered a proxy for companies to invest in Bitcoin so that there is an option to invest directly in Bitcoin through ETF funds. The share price is a direct reflection of investment in Bitcoin.Their purchase of Bitcoin is mandatory because without it they will not be able to maintain the price of their name so they have no choice but to invest in more Bitcoin.We have a long thread with all the news about MicroStrategy, you can find it here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5268108.0",

But they know how volatile it is, so they are not going to put in their balance sheet just like what MS or Saylor is doing.And I'm in the conclusion that MS is still break even at $29k++ price of bitcoin right now.Of course they can make money in the next bull run, but it will be in the next 2 years that big companies doesn't want to take the risk. They would rather have the money right now and move it inside, and not into bitcoin.",

DCA is to avoid questions where are bottoms and tops and doing DCA requires a long term vision for your investment so that you won't feel fearful, panic when you buy at tops. Doing DCA requires regular capital for buying and MicroStrategy have very deep pocket and new cashflow that helps them to do DCA last few years.I agree that if MicroStrategy have more experience, they would stop buying after a past all time high broke and a new bull run already last about one year.
