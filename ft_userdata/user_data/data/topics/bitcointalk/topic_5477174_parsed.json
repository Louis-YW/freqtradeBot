Of course, you need to be prepared for some losses when swapping and transferring between chains, but it is better to have something than just have a “dead” coin.",

So not sure about moving 10k. Maybe a bit at a time to check. Pancake has no customer support if something goes wrong so need to be real sure about any transfersUSDM is real.
