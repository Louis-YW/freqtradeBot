  "content": "Recently I have been seeing a lot of people who are key crypto players for the past few years, backing away from cryptocurrency & mining. I have a few bitcoins, but I have never trusted any exchange. I have bought BTC from people only and currently, it is in my own hands [technically speaking]. I get the whole FTX issue, but if you really are into Bitcoin & crypto, then why haven't you kept your exchange wallets in check? I personally almost never used exchanges. P2P is what bitcoin is really about.People lost millions, now many key players are backing off. No comments on that as it is a personal choice, yet spreading negativity on youtube & Twitter about the same is pointless. If you have lost something, then somewhere it is also your responsibility. FTX is responsible for cheating people, but people now making videos about why everyone should back off from crypto is not right & is spreading unnecessary chaos in the market. I am not an expert, but this is simply stupid.There are a lot of channels[pretty big] that praised Bitcoin & mining now backslashing it & people are really getting carried away with this. Bitcoin to the market is just an emotional asset, however, there is more to it but only if people try to see it. Do not get carried away. Think wisely & use proper data.Most of the NEWS is fake & is a decoy from the government to get people out of Bitcoin.",

      "body": "If we talk about psychological factors, then it is always easier for people to experience a loss or something that happened against their will by blaming others and not themselves. Now all the victims, inside themselves, naturally regret the mistake they made, but not everyone is strong enough to admit it publicly. As a result, so much dirt is now pouring into social media. A few days ago, we saw large withdrawals of bitcoin to noncustodial wallets as people began to learn from the mistakes of others. Do not store your assets on exchanges; this call has long been known to many. But the thought that this will not happen to me has given many people the understanding that this does not work all the time. To some extent, the collapse of the exchange served as a lesson for people not to trust the exchanges, and it is time for people to switch to their own thinking in exchange for the opinion of the crowd, obediently calling for certain actions.",

P2P is what bitcoin is really about.If you trade bitcoin/crypto â€” especially with leverage, then you pretty much have no choice but to leave a chunk of your bankroll on FTX or whatever exchange. The only problem is if people leave funds on exchange unnecessarily(with funds not being actively traded).",

Every piece of information needs to be verified before it is believed. It might be very difficult for people that have lost so much money not to be worried but like you advised we must avoid fake news. I sympathize with people that have lost money but they should understand that their health is more important than money. Seeking medical help would be a very good option for investors that have been affected emotionally. The lesson from FTX fall is clear: Never keep funds that you cannot afford to lose in centralized exchange.",

Being neutral means understanding that such thing is unexpected and expected to happen at the same time. Same thing is evident with rugpulls related problems; the idea itself. What we are seeing are people generalizing such that same thing could happen with other exchangers, but in reality it doesn't occur often. There are other big exchangers which are still performing well for this industry. Being worried won't make you comfortable of what you are doing in this industry and may just eventually affect your profit. You just have to be cautious with your actions such as not storing wealth with exchangers. Assets are meant to be put in wallets.",

No matter how people will critize Bitcoin it will still be the best and most valuable amongst all cryptocurrency.Those who are abandoning the crptospace because they lost their coins in FTX crash are disappointed and don't want to admit their mistake ,some people don't listen to instructions until they become victims of circumstance that is when they will realized that they are been ignorant of the truth.",

They are probably bitter because they lost so much. But then it reflects how they have actually misunderstood the essence of Bitcoin all along.

But I don't care about the news and their thoughts. I don't follow it. Blaming others is just a denial over our mistakes. It's not just you, I believe all of us here are continuing to use centralized exchanges because we have no other choice. Like traders, their income comes from day trading if forcing them out of centralized exchanges is tantamount to telling them to leave the market. We still use those exchanges as long as we know how to protect ourselves from dangers. You are right, don't blame others when it's our own fault.Quote from: royalfestus on November 27, 2022, 10:49:29 AMMost people that preach not putting money on exchanges have their money there.

People lost their money, so they ought to be stressed, and as a result of this, other people should be warned, but in all of that let the news carry the right information, BTC is a network that is resistant to all of these problems happening with centralized services and altcoins; BTC's price is volatile yes, but its network is strong and secure, people who use BTC correctly wouldn't have problems with the network ever.",

Even if it comes off as something utterly negative without expressing valid points, they'd still go out and cry wolf when they already lost a lot. Nothing to do about that honestly, and if people really are into crypto, no matter how much fear-mongering there is all over you'll never really think about it and consider those to affect your choices and your decision on how you will be doing crypto moving forward. People have been burned because they haven't been careful. A lot of times in the past were we already saying that never ever leave your money in exchanges. Guess what, FTX was a big exchange, and because of that everyone felt they were secure and BAM! The unimaginable happen. Understandable that people will be upset, and some will even go to lengths to swear to their teeth that crypto as a whole is just a fad.",
