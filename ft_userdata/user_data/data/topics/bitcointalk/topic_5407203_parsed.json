The percentage of how the price (pumps or dumps) of Bitcoin moves is high compared to Gold.Here is an example comparison for past years on returns/losses of Bitcoin and Gold.As you can see on the chart, it's very far from gold how huge the Bitcoin returns over the years.",

Actually gold does not move, only the fiats are trying to fight and want to equalize the value. You should look at the fluctuations in a time frame of say 3-5 years.I also don't want to oppose you investing in bitcoin. But because of the volatility, people generally slowly lose confidence when prices dump.",

I mean buying bullion or buying gold jewelries or whatever method?Bitcoin is volatile, Gold not that much, so for me it's better to invest on bitcoin, I mean you can live with the bear market, use it to fatten your wallet and then wait for the next bull run and then get a huge profit in returns. As opposed to gold that you have to take your time to see profits, maybe it will take at least a decade to realized how much money you really make.",

That is, you can pay for goods and services, invest, gamble and send money from one side of the world to the another side in a decentralized way, paying affordable fees.Furthermore there is the huge potential of profit on long term, that is also an advantage compared to gold, which is pretty stable. On the other hand, if I were a big investor, with many assets and properties under my control, I would probably invest in gold as well to diversify the patrimony and protect myself against inflation.",

The gold will help you to store your money but without ability to increase like investment. People understood in wrong way if the gold can be considered as investment. Basically, the price of gold remain stable but the inflation was making it looks like going up but another financial instrument that can be called as the real investment has given better performance compared with the gold. BTC is farrr better with potentially to increase even higher and crossing its previous ATH. From here you need to understand what gold is.

Compared to bitcoin, gold is more stable and less volatile. Gold is more suitable for holding assets than as an investment. I like thrills so for me investing has to be volatile so for me I would choose bitcoin over gold. In short, both are very good, it depends on your investment preferences.",

If you are using money that you can not afford to lose then i would definitely go for gold instead of crypto. Gold is very stable in terms of price movements and even if the financial markets go down like the did with the crash of the banks 14 years ago, gold remains stable or even starts to rise then. Of course it is also part of the truth that the potential ROI of gold is nowhere near as high as the one of Bitcoin. Just look at the last week. Bitcoin gained 11% in value in only 7 days. That are numbers that you will probably never see with gold.",

I understand that both are good havens for wealth from economic volatility, but it doesn't always translate to our happiness. To me, the profit opportunity as well as the risk are the same things that need to be thought about carefully before starting to think about investing in them, and as a BTC lover, I recommend that newbies like you can buy it and keep it for a little over 4 years to find happiness.",

However, if you really wanted to take advantage of both markets, I guess diversification is good. I mean when bitcoin is very volatile and we are in a bear market, then maybe Gold might be a good option to at least hedge your wealth for some time. And then go bitcoin when we are about to start a bull run. At least it's going to be a win-win situation for you.",

Gold is more stable and ROI over a number of years is way smaller than that of Bitcoin so if you have not taken the time to understand Bitcoin Investment and are too emotional, you might not be able to handle the market swings but Bitcoin is a Better Investment in the long run or even in the short run if you invested in the right time as what happened to me in 2017, Invested when the market was just about hitting the Bull season.",

Why? That is because I'd see a huge profit potential with Bitcoin and I can make it not too long, unlike Gold which it never grows fast. And the other reason is that I love the volatility of the market which makes me easy for me to trade and earn. It might be confusing and I understand that but make yourself clear first and do study the market behavior to stop that. Never rely on others' opinions as it was you who could decide just be sure that you are ready enough to accept the consequences of investing.",

If you're thinking about ROI, you should look into those assets that have stable movement with their value rather than getting into a risky one like bitcoin, so, if it's the choice then go for gold because you can calculate how much you can potentially have for the ROI.
