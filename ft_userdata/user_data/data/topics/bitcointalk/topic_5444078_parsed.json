      "body": "You mean terms and conditions?Entering the T&C is not possible for a banner ad as space is usually limited. Also this is one trick to get someone to start betting impulsively if the advert is published by the casino.However, most of the ads circulating are affiliate links so they don't even direct you to the T&C of the promo at all. I also often find expired promos among them.",

      "body": "Perhaps because these promotional banners are primarily designed to attract user's attention and curiosity? I mean you can't experience these bonuses if the user does not interact with the casino (e.g., registration, KYC etc..) because of course, usually, these bonuses does not exist when they do not have an account in the first place. And maybe it's the player's prerogative to read the rules whenever they feel like to participate to the said promotional bonuses.It's just their way to convert traffic into their own customers, if I understood you correctly.",

When we were able to connect through the promotion we should also have the awareness to go through the terms and conditions. Even if the terms and conditions were added we just go click agree and proceed further without going through the terms. This happens out of the urge to enjoy the promo. Later while experiencing some problem we'll start reading the terms and conditions.",

Their promotion is geared on new set of players or those who wants to try it because their promotion is very attractive.I'm not saying that they are doing it to mislead, but from what I observed, this seems to be the norm for any sector and business.So it'sÂ  very important to read the T&C very closely before joining their promotions.",

All they did was redirect you to their website and some of it is injected with referral links so that when you bet, they will have a percentage of it. Most gambling sites today don't really need you to sign up first. You can check out their website and freely roam around although there are some restricted parts because you are still a guest. Regarding bonuses, they have Telegram or Discord pages now so you can just ask them directly if they are offering whatever bonus you prefer. i.e. Deposit bonus.",

Most banner will redirect you to the sign up or to the homepage first, you as player are the one that should be diligent enough to look deeper for the promotion. It is simple actually, skip the sign up page then go find the T&C page for the promotion you are attracted with. Do not blame how the banner works as if you are having a casino and you want to advertise your promotion with banner, you will do the same as it is how to attract users to sign up.",

How can that be possible? Gambling sites are using promotional offers to advertise their sites and the kind of service they are providing. If after you have known about the promo and you just want to get offer without registering on the site, that is not possible, you have to register before you will be able to get any promotional offer, also knowing they you have to read the casino's terms and conditions.",

Often they give you a bonus and wait if you win anything, then don't allow you to withdraw until you go through KYC, even though you haven't deposited any significant sum, and aren't trying to withdraw a lot. You can deposit, claim a bonus, lose the bonus and try to get your money back and you're hit by KYC just to get $200 back. This is bullshit as you're clearly not a money launderer and most countries allow for $1k payments without any KYC simply because these are such small amounts that nobody would try to launder this way.",

When a marketing gets into promos and bonuses, there should be the actual information upon clicking those banners like a guest section where it's all written.No need for any logging in as that's highly discouraging visitors when they're not yet registered on that casino. But for those that are registered, it's not really a big thing.",

Thereâs no such thing as free money or easy to get bonus on casino industry because they are business not a foundation. Itâs normal for a banner ads to display only limited information that focus on entertaining players to try the casino because thatâs how ads work. This is same with cigarette and beer ads which doesnât highlight the effect of the items they are promoting. Let the user deal with the terms when they are already playing.Besides not all casino offer a ridiculous terms and conditions for their bonus. Winz.io is one of them because their bonus free spin doesnât have any wagering requirements and other casino offer a low wagering requirements which achievable compared to the typical 30ish and above wagering requirements.",
