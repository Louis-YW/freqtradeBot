  "content": "When playing multiply manual bet, I've noticed that the profit winnings don't match the bet amount or bet odds.In this example ( I have many) :1-https://imgur.com/KKfZO98-Bet amount: 256sats-Bet odds: 51.01-Profit : 2562 sats-Bet on: low-Roll: 132The expected profit should be :12820satsThe apparent profit odds: ~11In other cases the profit is 0 sats no win no loss, no balance change.2-https://imgur.com/arRoGJc-Bet amount: 1sat-Bet odds: 11.01-Profit : 0sat-Bet on: low-Roll: 217It also happens the other way around where it gives a profit when it should have been loss3-https://imgur.com/1cTw6bm-Bet amount: 128sats-Bet odds: 51.01-Profit : 1sat-Bet on: low-Roll: 2114Has anybody experience this bug?I tried to find similar cases but only found claims of fraud cheating etc. which I don't think this is the case as I've referred to it as bug that I can more or less easily reproduce, the frequency varies.Had filled up the contact form on the website 2/3 weeks ago and last week again, messaged Thequin as well 2/3 weeks ago and last week I tweeted @freebitco asking to look into the issue but didn't get any reply.Had also saved the roll verifier for some of the first bugs when I started to log them but they all seemed to be a match, so not sure if that has anything to do.I'm barely know anything about cryptography ( I know it exists) probs or basically any related to math, so just wanted to know what is going on or if I'm overlooking something since I feel I'm getting something wrong as I couldn't find any mentions to this.",

Had read many threads about scams cheating, specially for free rolls and lottery, so I'm not concerned in that regard.That's why I did not jump to conclusion and tried and wait for 2 weeks after contacting them first, cause in the end a screenshot won't convince nobody since they can easily be manipulated, only the admins can check if they are authentic since the messages I sent to them have the date and the exact time of the rolls.So just tryoing to find somebody that could have any clue or had something like that happen to them, which is the weirdest bit, that it could not be happening just to me.Thanks for the tip, I had posted it on the thread Jackg suggested, is that the one you are refering to as well?",
