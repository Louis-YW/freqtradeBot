Well, it's different these days and not the same anymore as before because bitcoin has gone far and despite being a very volatile asset, it's unlikely that it will go that low.Think of those people that are waiting just to buy cheap bitcoin like around $10k down to $3k, there will be a massive buying order on exchanges if it's reached and even to $1k so thinking that it could be low as $1 or zero is totally crazy despite of that \"possibility\".",

If your government still cares about debts while people all over the world are worried about what to eat the next day and if they do still have a job the next  day, your government are still pretty much decent. But yeah they may get the money from your accounts.You're still lucky because countries in EU today are all just thinking about sanctioning Russia without thinking if they could still run their cars after. Protests are everywhere not just in China. All Bitcoiners just need to do now is just hold what they have.",

Possibly it is going up long term and I agree with you that the banking system could fail at some point. Still the recent surge in price is more based on technical factors like the last bullrun ATH and such things. But lets see what the future in China brings, there are always many news from there.",

We are so way past that and I think those having this thought should rather stick to fiat than hope for the impossible.Speaking of which, sometimes I wonder what laws do they stand on to confiscate someone's holdings at there facility and declare it for a purposes. This is some of the reasons the need for decentralized systems cannot be denied its place in our world today. The grip of centralized systems is terrifying on an average citizen as by just a snap of the fingers, one can be denied access to life's savings.This also stretches to what length people might be doing it wrong in using CEX in the crypto world as it operates on same principles. If its not decentralized, your no good having large somes on it.",

Some love to exploit their feelings and making that kind of topics has the potential to convince them sell.Also, while 1$ and \"bitcoin is dead\" are obvious FUD topics, questions whether the bottom is in or how long this bear market last are actually legit imho. Quote from: Myleschetty on July 20, 2022, 02:58:27 PMAre you wondering the reason behind this sudden surge in the price? The current surge is not that big. It's nice, but fr from uncommon. So asking for reasons may not give correct answers.It may be China problems (as you said), it can be end of bear market, it can be bull trap. We'll see.Quote from: Myleschetty on July 20, 2022, 02:58:27 PMtake advantage of the people will always happen. This will make people realize the purpose of BTC and before that happen hold your bag when you can. Always remember, not your key not your coin.One can look into recent history and will see that some banks did take people's money in the past financial crisis. Bitcoin was created to fight that.But people never learn. Greed (and poverty) make people risk big money to earn some more cents. Average people's financial knowledge is almost zero. And governments (and banks) exploit that at maximum. This is the world we're living in. So you're right: people should carefully hold their Bitcoin.",

It's because \"CCP tanks protecting banks because the Bank of China (Henan branch) declared that people's savings in their branch are now investment products and can't be withdrawn.\"I thought an investment is supposed to be an agreement between two parties in which the capital, interest rate and duration is discussed and unanimously agreed according to terms and conditions. Because what I see here is a clear intrude upon ones financial freedom, which is totally wrong, because what if the money in the bank was the only hope for the common citizens, how do the government intend such individuals to survive? And that's why I'm happy for Bitcoin as it gives us power to have control over our finances. And for the other statement about Bitcoin falling back to either $1000 to $0, it will take the head of a Carmel to pass through the eye of a niddle for the price of Bitcoin to fall to such price again",

Especially how long, I think is an important question, that isn't so easily answered. Naturally users will point to previous cycles, but I'm convinced that this isn't going to follow those previous cycles. There's also an argument in that they never really have, but people have identified certain correlations, and ignore other things. Even asking if its the bottom is an important question. People are invested in Bitcoin for different reasons, and someone can believe in Bitcoin, but need immediate access to their funds to not be able to ride out a bigger drop in price. I don't have any problems with anyone questioning what they've invested in, and I actually think we've probably all done it at some point.",
