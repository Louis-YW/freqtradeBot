  "content": "I am using Jaxx wallet for years now and I made its update to Jaxx Liberty when time has come. I never had any issue with this wallet until recently, when I encountered a curious problem.This is what happened:- I had a small amount of BTC stored on Jaxx- recently I bought another small amount of BTC, from an ATM, and I gave the address of Jaxx wallet- the transfer has been realized successfully.Problem: The amount I bought is not shown in my wallet, on Jaxx's main screen, but the funds exist in my wallet. I will detail below.As you know, on Jaxx's main screen are displayed the wallets initialized by the user (I have initialized only 3 wallets: 1 for BTC, 1 for ETH and 1 for Jaxx's own token -- Jaxx Unity (which does not exist yet, anyway). Also on Jaxx's main screen, on the upper part of the screen you can see your total holdings (the cumulative amounts of all wallets).After I bought that amount of BTC last days, the amount shown in the wallet (on Jaxx's main screen) did not change. It continues to show the old amount. On top of the screen the cumulative amount of the wallets is also not changed.However, if I try to send BTC the wallet allows me to send my entire amount of BTC (meaning the old one I had in my wallet and also the one I recently bought).From the above sentence it's clear that my transaction was successful so there is only a UI problem (I believe).I tried to access Jaxx's customer support, from jaxx.io, but there it's stated the support is only working within the app:QuotePreviously, Jaxx Liberty customers had to send us their technical support questions through Social Media and ticketing systems (e-mail). Unfortunately, scammers have gotten very good at impersonating us on those platforms. We want to prevent our Jaxx Liberty users from becoming crypto victims, so we’ve made a leap forward by integrating a smart in-app support system. Not only will you get a more convenient way of receiving assistance, but it’s also immediate and tailored to you. Please be sure you’re running the latest version of Jaxx Liberty so you can get the support you need directly in your Jaxx Liberty application. Safe. Fast. TailoredI tried to access the support service from the app but there is no support. To be more precise, inside the app I have the following sub-menus under Support menu:- Service Status: if I click on it it opens a page saying that BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, DOGE and a few more coins are Operational (I don't even know what's the use of this)- Get Help: opens the page from their website, where it's stated the above mentioned quote- Error Code Glossary: a list of error codes and their explanations- Version History- Your Jaxx ID- Our News ResourcesLast 3 sub-menus are self-explanatory.As you see, there is no support inside the app.Having all these said, has anyone else encountered such an issue? Or does anyone know a proper way to contact Jaxx support?",

      "body": "Jaxx offers two separate wallets for Bitcoin: one with Legacy addresses (start with 1) and the other with Segwit addresses (start with bc1q). Could it be that one of these wallets isn't enabled, but when you try to spend your bitcoin, the wallet automatically combines the coins from both these wallets?As far as I know, the Jaxx wallet is closed-source, so I wouldn't recommend using it because, in the case of closed-source software, you have to blindly trust the claims of developers about what their wallet does and does not, without any possibility to verify such claims.",

      "body": "Thank you for your opinion, witcher_sense, but it's not that.I have the Bitcoin Segwit wallet disabled (by me) before I made that transaction from 2 days ago. And this wallet (meaning Bitcoin Segwit) was added recently to Jaxx, through an app update. The old BTC funds I had were inside the Bitcoin wallet. And those funds were shown in the wallet, on Jaxx's main screen and also on the upper part of main screen, where you can see the cumulative funds of all wallets. I had obtained the old funds before Jaxx started to support Bitcoin Segwit. (I even activated the Bitcoin Segwit wallet, to make sure, but it shows -- correctly -- 0 funds in app's main screen.)And the new funds were bought also using the classic Bitcoin wallet, not the Segwit one (as this one was disabled).So, practically, now I see the old funds (on main screen) and not the new funds I bought recently. But if I try to send funds, if I select Max in that screen (to use the maximum amount which can be sent) it shows me that I can sent all the funds I am supposed to have (the old ones and the ones I bought recently).So it's practically a UI error, as the new funds are not shown in main screen, added to the existent ones. I hope I explained more clear now.Quote from: Pmalek on June 30, 2022, 08:54:02 AMI assume you have checked the transaction on a blockchain explorer and it's confirmed to have been received in the correct address.Yes, indeed. The transfer was successful, as I wrote in OP. Besides, I can also send all the funds (old ones + new ones). It's just the total amount is not shown on app's main screen.Quote from: Pmalek on June 30, 2022, 08:54:02 AMIs there a way to delete your Bitcoin wallet safely and re-add it?Does Jaxx have a resync feature or a way to delete the cache to fix what the UI is displaying?It has but, given the curious situation, I am afraid of doing that, in order to not lose all the funds I have Quote from: Pmalek on June 30, 2022, 08:54:02 AMBut the best option would be to abandon it entirely, create a new Bitcoin wallet with a more reliable software, and transfer all your Bitcoin to it.I also have another Bitcoin wallet, not only Jaxx...

The other wallet app I'm using is Bitcoin Wallet for Android. I will give a try to the ones you mentioned. About Jaxx, you are right. However, what I found interesting about it is the fact that it contains 2 anonymous exchanges inside it, allowing you to change a cryptocurrency for another one without offering personal information.Quote from: witcher_sense on June 30, 2022, 11:02:37 AMYou also can try to clear the app cache or reinstall Jaxx completely, but if there is a bug in the wallet's codebase itself, you can't do much about it.Quote from: Pmalek on June 30, 2022, 09:15:57 AMIf you have the seed and/or private keys, there shouldn't be problems with wallet recovery. [...]you can then clear the cache or re-add your Bitcoin wallets on Jaxx.Thank you for your thoughts as well, Pmalek and witcher_sense!In the end, I managed to solve the issue. At first, I checked all the articles posted by witcher_sense, but they were years old and they were not addressing my problem. First link was about missing funds, the second was about missing funds after upgrading from Jaxx Classic to Jaxx Liberty, third one was suggesting to make the upgrade (which I did many months ago) + use app's refresh function (which did not offer me any positive result) + clearing app's cache (which also did not help me), while the fourth article was saying about some possible problems leading to incorrect balance, but none of them was for my case. This problem (meaning to not correctly synchronize the balance) appeared only recently on Jaxx and I never had it before.So after checking the articles I tried to clear app's cache, but nothing changed inside the wallet.Then I said a prayer, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. I used the recovery phrase and -- voila! -- my funds were shown correctly on app's main screen, in the Bitcoin wallet shown there and also in the upper part of the screen, where the cumulative amount is displayed.Now I can see the entire amount I was supposed to have (and which I actually had, as it was only a UI error).Thank you all again for your inputs, your observations were very valuable and now I managed to fix my problem!",

Second one is ShapeShift. I knew that Changelly is centralized; however, inside Jaxx you can use both without offering any personal information. You simply select what coin you want to exchange with another one. I don't know how they allow that, since they should be are forced by law to obtain clients' personal information. Probably it's only a matter of time until they'll coerce Jaxx developers to remove the 2 exchanges from the app.Quote from: dkbit98 on July 01, 2022, 10:46:25 AMAtomixDex alternative I send you is also exchange but decentralized and they are using Atomic swaps, so you can swap Bitcoin with other coins and vice versa with minimal fees.You convinced me already  I will install it this weekend, thus I'll have enough time to play with it and explore its functions.

      "body": "Changelly, ShapeShift, and ChangeNOW are probably three of the most mentioned exchanges that belong to the group of instant exchanges or instant swaps platforms. Some of them claim to be non-custodial and anonymous but we have numerous accusations on this forum alone where users have had their coins frozen or been asked to undergo KYC. I have heard them say we never ask our clients for their personal information, but our partners have the right to do that. When that happens, the user obviously doesn't and shouldn't care about which partner or third party froze the coins, and the only ones that should be held accountable are the people running the instant exchange. You get worse rates using such swaps platforms than if you used a standard exchange yourself. I see a small advantage for instant exchanges compared to CEXs only when you are exchanging a small amount. If you do that on a CEX, you have the initial deposit minus the blockchain fees, the actual swap minus the trading fees, and lastly the withdrawal fee, which takes a decent bite from the total amount. If you can reduce those expenses somewhat with an instant exchange, why not. But overall, they aren't that useful.",

Sadly, it is in testing phase for Android and iOS and I did not install Windows version.Then I installed Unstoppable Wallet for Android. And I can say that I was pleased by what I found. UI is adequate for users, the wallet is easy to manage / set-up. It also allows atomic swaps (not for all coins, as far as I saw). Another great feature is the possibility of time-locking transactions. However, this feature is experimental (as the wallet informs) and it's limited to 0.5BTC.Last, but not least, the wallet work also with Tor. However, I was unable to start Tor. When I select, from app's menu, to activate Tor, it remains in infinite loading. I am not sure if this is a problem determined by my phone or if it is a known bug. However, even if it is a bug, it can be fixed. And having the wallet work through Tor is one of the most safe feature possible.Thanks again for your recommendations, dkbit98!",

I could launch Tor services from the wallet and they started, without encountering any other problem.

Or it does, but the notification does not disappear. There isn't available even the Clear notifications button. Furthermore, if other notifications appear, then Clear button becomes available, but after pressing it the notification regarding Tor still does not disappear. Only way to have it removed is by restarting the phone (other than going to Notification Settings and disabling the notification for this wallet).It's not a big deal, but it may be look as disturbing by users which are used to keep their notifications clean. Other than that I did not encounter any issue, yet, with this wallet.",
