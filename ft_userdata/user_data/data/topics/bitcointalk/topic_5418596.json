  "content": "Freedom is priceless, but it's unfortunate that some countries are depriving their citizens of this right. The banning of Bitcoin is one of them, and the countries doing this are not wise but not entirely foolish because they have their reasons. Nonetheless, they are showing excessiveness in their dispensation of authorities as far as I am concerned. However, one thing these countries have in common is either they don't practice democracy or it is weak in the country.Not all policies are completely good, and you don't cut the head off because you want to cure a headache. I pondered on this today after responding to a reply, how naive some of these countries could be as they (the government) and their citizens would be negatively affected in the following ways, though they are not the limit:1. The government cannot earn through Bitcoin in terms of investments, taxes and others.2. The citizens would be deprived of the fortunes attached to Bitcoin when they own it or do investments with it.3. The citizens would be deprived of employment that could be paid through Bitcoin only, especially online.4. They will be forced to embrace fiat with high transaction fees and a slow time of completing most international transactions, unlike Bitcoin.5. The investors' confidence will slightly be affected since many companies dealing with Bitcoin will not be able to thrive under such conditions, so they go elsewhere.6. Setback in blockchain and the technology attached to it when countries are yearning for advancement etc.They do this in the name of curbing illicit financial flow, but the question is, is it worth it? I don't see a winner here if they truly have the love of their country and citizen at heart, they should have regulated it, not banned the coin. What do you think guys?",

Even China banned bitcoin several times, it banned bitcoin mining, now the second country after USA with miners that have highest bitcoin hashrate after it went to zero immediately after the crackdown, what also surfaced later is that bitcoin is treated as a virtual property in China. Nigeria's central bank as a central authority, banned bitcoin, but yet bitcoin not banned in Nigeria. Many others like that which make citizens of some nations to still be able to buy and hold bitcoin.",

      "body": "Two things I disagree with.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on October 28, 2022, 07:17:51 AM1. The government cannot earn through Bitcoin in terms of investments, taxes and others.This is a bit of a misconception.If the citizen of each state sells a coin to some other citizen, the amount of money overall in the said country stays the same, you buying a BTC for 100$ and then selling it for 60k means that this has changed:John had 1 bitcoin, you had 100$, I had 60k, now John has 100$, you have 60k, I have one BTC, as bitcoin doesn't produce money out of thin air.For sure it will tax you for your gains but if it weren't for BTC I would have spent those 60k on something else, maybe a car, and the state would still have got the tax on vat and on annual tax and road tax and gas tax ...and tax and tax! If now the value of the coin has reached extraordinary levels and the citizens of countries that have stocked up on BTC want to sell their coins at a profit and there are buyers from other countries, what would the governments of those counties benefit since their citizens are actually importing foreign currency at the expense of their own since they spend dollars, euros, and yens to buy coins from abroad?So basically a government would only benefit if the balance is positive, if everyone would be just buying coins then it will be a loss for them, and there's no way for every country to benefit in the long run, it's impossible!At a personal level Bitcoin can indeed make you wealthy and protect your finances, but on a global level, it's just a redistribution of money.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on October 28, 2022, 07:17:51 AM4. They will be forced to embrace fiat with high transaction fees and a slow time of completion, unlike Bitcoin.The are plenty of services that are just as fast and at least in Europe, I get no fees for an instant national transfer.",

The government cannot earn through Bitcoin in terms of investments, taxes and others.@stompix had a great answer to this one.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on October 28, 2022, 07:17:51 AM2. The citizens would be deprived of the fortunes attached to Bitcoin when they own it or do investments with it.At the same time people are saved from scams and fraud from the company that uses Bitcoin to exploit people.  Banning Bitcoin is much better than keeping it afloat and not regulating it since there are lots of people who wanted to take advantage of others by exploiting the trending industry.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on October 28, 2022, 07:17:51 AM They will be forced to embrace fiat with high transaction fees and a slow time of completion, unlike Bitcoin.Have you ever done a fiat money transfer?  Most of the bank transfers today are almost instant, I think you should try it once.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on October 28, 2022, 07:17:51 AM6. Setback in blockchain and the technology attached to it when countries are yearning for advancement etc.Blockchain technology can be integrated even without Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is just a product of blockchain tech so basically, Blockchain technology is far wider than Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry.  So we cannot say that banning Bitcoin means not accepting blockchain technology.  Any country can integrate blockchain technology and reject any cryptocurrency in the market at the same time.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on October 28, 2022, 07:17:51 AMWhat do you think guys?The world will go on without Bitcoin, Blockchain can be integrated without the present cryptocurrency so the government not implementing or adopting the current cryptocurrencies doesn't mean they cannot take advantage of Blockchain technology.  But I always think that it is always better to have extra option since it opens up more opportunity.",

Yup, ING and Erste for example, I get zero fees for national transfers, AMRO also offers 0 fees for the whole eurozone but they are not instant, don't know how much they charge, there are some banks that offer them for free in some countries as they have alliances with other banks and so on.But yeah, I should have probably added: \"some\" as not all of them do and some that do do charge a monthly fee which doesn't exist in bitcoin.Quote from: Antonas1 on October 28, 2022, 12:53:22 PMIf you already know that your country bans Bitcoin, then don't do it. Even if you already have it, exchange it secretly, that's what P2P is for.It depends on what type of enforcement that country seeks, if they ban it so they can wash their hands off any problems it causes then it's no problem dealing with it, if they actually seek to pursue and fine or arrest traders most P2P won't help you. Remember that in order to do P2P you still need to find a trader and deal with him over a different payment channel be it bank/wu/skrill whatever, that guy with his hundreds of weekly payments to strangers is so easy to identify that if they wanted they could track him in one minute. And then all they have to do is follow the money flow.I would advise anyone in a country that enforces a ban with prison sentences against trusting somebody online for trades, you might be dealing with an undercover cop.

So countries that ban Bitcoin don't really feel these negative effects. Most of the countries that banned Bitcoin are repressive regimes that don't want their people having any financial freedom, because it could potentially undermine the regime, if Bitcoin would get serious traction there.",

I feel angry when I keep hearing people (the Government) thinking that Bitcoin is use for illicit financing. We all know all such kind of funding has been in play way before Bitcoins existence through Fiat, but are they ceasing to use their fiat money still? No. I think it is just them trying to control their citizen's financial life.Don't be angry with that since its normal, to many people still use bitcoin to take advantage of others this is why I can't blame the government to think negatively on it  plus we can also add up the volatility which create some confusion about the real status of bitcoin. Maybe the country decide to ban bitcoin doesn't need its existence to its country for now but for sure in future once blockchain and bitcoin development will be widely adopted for sure they will also take a look back on this.",

What do you think guys?We know that our governments combating fraud activities since then and then it could Bitcoin is a possible threat to that since it's decentralized and no one has control over it.  But instead of taking advantage to tax their people, they prohibit to use of it, governments only care about people's taxes they think that it'll help their people circumvent capital controls which do illegal activities and possibly governments lose economic controls.That's why Bitcoin was designed with a decentralized nature so that no one has to control it and people still use Bitcoin even though it's prohibited in their country.  Who cares if the government didn't accept Bitcoin as a legal tender?  In fact, in this case, their loss not ours.",
