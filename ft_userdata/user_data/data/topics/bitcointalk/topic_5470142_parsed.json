  "content": "I was traveling from Port Harcourt to Bayelsa state yesterday afternoon, we go to a police check point and it was the Federal Sars men that stopped us. While they were doing their lawful duty of searching the vehicle and the passengers in it, a girl that was sitting behind me made a comment and the officer that was conducting the search heard her loud and clear. She said '' You people are just wasting our time, if it were the bad boys terrorizing the region you people won't stop them''. The Sars man got angry and asked the girl to come down from the vehicle, the girl came down and she was taken into their custody for further questioning about her comment. The officer asked the driver to carry the rest of the passenger and continue with the journey. Some passengers pleaded with the officer to let the girl go but they refused, they said the girl must show them evidence where she saw them not stopping bad boys. They accused the girl of working with bad boys. The girl was detained while we continued with our journey. The girl wouldn't have found herself in that situation if she had kept quiet without saying a word. we should learn how to control our tongue at all time. Don't say unguided words when in public place.Don't say anything when your opinion is not sought after in a public place because you don't know who is who.     I feel like sharing this so that we can avoid some unnecessary problems in our lives.",

Especially in a country like Nigeria where security agencies are looking for any available means to victimize the citizens instead of protecting them. the girl on her own part after making the mistake took a proud lane, if not, she would've pleaded with the officer that it was a slip pf tongue and promise not to do it again. The officer, even the most wicked of them all will caution her based on her gender and maybe collect even number if na fine girl, or maybe collect small thing from her as usual and you guys will continue your journey together.  misguided statements should be avoided in this country now as body dey pepper almost everybody now with the condition of the country, talk less of uniformed men wey no get joy right from the beginning. she is even in more danger now as they may even attack her sexually if she's not freed before night.But permit me to ask you OP, SARS still dey Nigeria? I thought it was ended a while ago after the end SARS protest or did the government reinstall it?.of course not. maybe what you guys saw was SF(special force). and not SARS. Maybe you confirm better next time before posting. your message was well received as we all need to be cautious to be safe out there. The girl may just have been having a bad day and vented her frustration on the wrongest people. transfer of aggression is surely a bad emotional discipline and should be avoided at all times and at all costs.",

      "body": "Basically what the girl said concerning police force in nigeria is official act to police people, because sometimes I do think if police collaborate with criminal in some certain act, because sometimes when criminals is operating close by and you inform police that maybe criminals is attacking a particular place and they need to relief from hands of criminal, police will take a longer time before going to such place for the moment.Police will relaxed and wasted some time and by then the criminals has already operated before you will see appearance of police, is not that they don't have what it takes to make sure they caption the criminals but they don't want, nigeria police doesn't respond or give attention immediately when you needed them, and what they will be after is to take money and hold people who is not a law breaker and allows the law breakers to go.I don't know if all the criminals police people are their information and that is what I don't want to believe, because when check in nigeria police check point you not here that police arrested all this criminals in their active time in checkpoint so I don't think what they said about the sars is bad, but at least she would have respected herself until you people go out from there knowing that police people is on duty and she can equally be use as escape goat.",

It was a caotic situation. i began to beg for a total stranger because she was about to see crazy if we left her with them, the driver shunned her to keep her mouth shut and we kept begging until they agreed and the officers told her she should work on her way of speaking to people especially older people, immediately we were released, we proceeded to our destination but that was after 2hours, i was already late for my meeting because of someone's rude way of talking.",

Honestly. Some people are not cautious of what they say. There's power in the tongue. The world has been controlled by the word of mouth. You cannot allow yourself to be loose to the point that you let things out of your mind through your mouth. You think with the mind but never allow your mouth to echo all what's in your mind.We learn everyday and night through the events that happen before us and that's what makes us stronger by the day.",

Indeed her words was misguided and I must say, there are always these persons, once that others need to learn from and in this instance, it was her. She should have been aware enough on how the scenario would turn. Not like these things don’t happen but, in as much as you expect the Police or any arm of the armed forces to take you in without due reason and evidence, you should as well be very aware not to accuse them without an evidence as that, was an accusation.I have had the opportunity to see passengers been caught with unlicensed fire arm in a regular stop and search, I’ve also seen some smugglers been caught migrating themselves into the control from these stop and search. Not to mention the risk they take in those check points. There are good cops and bad cops. We should as well acknowledge that and not ridicule those doing the actual job.The rogue officers will always be after there #100 and that’s all. You can as well be patient with them and let them do their job. If you want to take a case with them, have your papers in tact and let’s see how they would force you to pay them a penny. That can’t happen, it’s only when your in the wrong or your about them not doing there jobs of stop and search.I know these guys deliberately delay your time in these search due to lack of compliance but, bare with them and help them change.",

One of major causes of us facing daily crucial scenarios are our inability to sealed our tongue, it's definitely not in every case we ought to speak out because certain situations does require absolute silence, though one might be consider an unwise individual but vividly it's the right thing to do especially when we come in contacts with these aggressive men in uniforms.

You do not know who is sitting next to you waiting for information to tap from your conversations. Sensitive discussion ought to be done in confined environment for privacy and avoidance of information leakage. Most times people complain of attack or possibly robbery but they forget to remember that they had a conversation at a particular place they were not supposed to and unfortunately some criminal element around them must had heard them and trailed them to their destination without them knowing and  launch an attack on them.

And the situation of the country doesn’t make it any easier. it normal to get that impulse of wanting to react, not everyone has that self resilient mindset , I want to ask, if the lady in the context was an important person or a person with influence, will the officers have the effrontery to make a noise ? No !!! They saw a chance to oppress the young lady who is just  pouring out her own frustration in a way she can. To me it is abuse of power by the officers on the young lady, she committed no crime for her to be detained more less do the officers have anything on her.   Officers who are not doing their job properly, should be stand corrected cause no one is above correction, our country made those in uniform bigger than the law and we all know how excessive and intoxicating power can be. Don’t quote me wrong, it is important to know when and how to talk when you’re relating to people. Wrong Manner of communication can lead you into trouble.
