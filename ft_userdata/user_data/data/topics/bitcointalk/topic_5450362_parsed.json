So then what can the borrowers can do with it. can they get a profit ?Yes, you are correct. On our platform, lenders can lend their LP pool positions (represented by Uniswap V3 NFTs) to borrowers for a specified duration. During this time, borrowers can use these LP pool positions to earn trading fees generated by the underlying Uniswap V3 pool.As the price of the assets in the pool changes and more trades occur, the LP pool positions generate fees. These fees are distributed to the LPs (lenders) of the pool in proportion to their contribution to the pool. However, in the case of our platform, the borrower will receive the fees generated during the duration of the loan.This enables borrowers to earn a profit from trading fees generated by the LP pool positions without actually owning the underlying assets. It also allows lenders to earn a fixed fee for lending their LP pool positions, without having to worry about the fluctuation of trading fees and the underlying asset prices.",

We'll soon make the token metrics and details about our fundraising rounds public and officially begin the fundraising. The reason you see our twitter inactive is because we haven't started with community building but its scheduled to begin this week!",
