When the transaction is confirmed, only the receivers will see the amount assigned to their address. I do see a similar thing using Electrum wallet to view incoming transactions: my assigned amount will be visible on my overall balance, and my address will be marked to separate it from other receivers.",

No, it might seem like a joke, but it happens, people would narrate something but will not totally be sincere about the whole story, and you might not be seeing clearly at that time.My advice for you is to take the issue up with the sender, such is the only one that can shed light on it. Just ask him for the details of the transfer (TXID), by this, everyone would know what happens. Bitcoin transactions are not hidden.",

      "body": "OP at first, it is likely the sender made two transaction at the same time possibly you were to receive something lesser from the sender than you expected or that amount was a wrong input by the sender and maybe they corrected it by using the RBF (replace by fee) option so that your transaction does not scale through that figure and I believe after the other transaction must have been confirmed then the sender likely allowed yours scale through by also using the RBF option if that is the case.All these are just speculations though but it would be nice you put up the transaction ID so we could see for ourselves and be able to ascertain what really happened otherwise everything you read hear would be a guess work with no proof of action. If you can as well tell us the time of the day it happened then we could also tell what happened.",

Then again, if someone wanted to scam you by doing that, why would he even send you that $100 transaction.Either way, once you send more info we might figure out what exactly happened there.",

OP should show us the transaction ID to the both transaction  for clarification so we do not start saying things when the situation is an unrealistic one. Most times things f this nature happens and it is backed with proof for members to see and  know what transpired so as to proffer solutions but OP has failed to do so making it looks like it happened real when there is no evidence of such transaction but however, if it is real then I would say the sender used a replace by fee option to thwart your own pay and used the same RBF to resend your pay in a lower amount. That is just it. If you are not satisfied,with the response to your inquiries, you can upload the transaction hash for the forum members to see  and if you know the sender, you can get in touch with them to know what happened.",

But if not then the $100 is another trap same as the first transaction.What are you dealing with the sender? If he promises that they will give you BTC worth $1000 with a bonus of $100 it's a sign that the sender is a scammer.",

Im confused. I thought once a transfer is sent and you see it on incoming it cant be changed or modified?The OP explained exactly the experience of RBF in his own question. no need to beg him to supply TXID as the vanished $1k version is gone(rejected) so no investivation or new info can be gatheredthe 20min wait for the $1k to be left unconfirmed shows there was an insufficient fee paid, thus later the $100 appear with a priority fee(higher) and so at the 20th minute the $100 confirms thus completely making the $1k rejected. in short yes the sender done a RBF scam on the user and the user should demand the remaining $900 from the sender if the receiver required $1kas for others warning about not to blindly trust zero confirms. this is true for amounts more then the price of a soft drink. pizza of something small. and especially true for the subnetworks that mess around with unconfirmed 'smart contracts' that dont settle when received, but days, weeks months later. as they too have many ways to switch around which tx gets confirmed finally later onthe usual loose guideline of risk tolerance has been (before RBF existed)zero confirm: <$30 (0.001)1 confirm:>$30 (0.001+)2 confirm:>$300 (0.01+)3 confirm: >$3k (0.1+)4 confirm: >$30k(1+)5 confirm: >$300k(10+)6 confirm: >$3m(100)some still use this loose guideline but be sure to keep im mind that RBF has made it easier to steal from zero confirm and also from certain subnetworks that have badly developed mechanisms",

Don't try to allow him have any clue about your wallet keys in other for him not to take charge of it unaware to you, he may probably sent the two transactions and once they two got confirmed wired back the $1000, so providing the transaction id for that your account will help alot, but know that bitcoin transactions are irreversible and cannot be altered, except if your wallet is compromised, the reason we keep saying that not your keys not your coins but many don't understand why.",
