I have so many friends who heard about bitcoin before 2015 and didn't get involved and now they regret their hesitation or lack of decision-making. On the other hand many get involved in cryptocurrency later and get their reward for taking the right decision in time. I think when any opportunity comes and you see the potential in it, you have to dive deep and get your research done and take the right decision in time.",

Yes at least know the basic knowledge about cryptocurrency but sometimes most of the newbies get stuck and forgot to process to the next step, you know in trading and investing in cryptocurrency even experienced traders make mistakes or experience loss, but most of the time experience traders just know how to handle it.So starting as soon as possible is a good move, especially at this moment when the market is down, that could easily be a potential profit in the future when the Bullrun comes. Instead of investing when the market price of the cryptocurrency already skyrocket we all know that is wasn't the time to invest or accumulate cryptocurrency since everything skyrockets it becomes riskier for investors since it could easily be a big loss so investing as soon as possible so that you wouldn't regret it.",

And in another case you have to promise that you will not sell bitcoins at a loss. Then you will get good profit from Bitcoin.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on March 11, 2023, 09:49:36 PMBitcoin is not rocket science, you don't need to learn everything about it to \"succeed\", if you are an investor, you just have to not sell at a loss and hope for eventual profit, if you are earning Bitcoin through some job, just keep getting better at the job.Yes I agree with you. Bitcoin investing does not require much analysis like other altcoins. Because the whole market depends on bitcoin and all investors like bitcoin and invest in bitcoin so bitcoin is never likely to be a scam and bitcoin will never have a big crash. So investing in Bitcoin for long term has high potential of profit. And all investors can profit from Bitcoin.  Patience will be required in this case.",

The law of the correlation of theory and practice says that for 70 percent of practice you need to study 30 percent of theory. This happens because practice without theory is blind. And theory without practice is meaningless. This approach will avoid a lot of mistakes, as well as financial losses. In general: you need to study and are not afraid to apply.

Getting the knowledge that helps you discern when a certain proposal is a scam scheme, or a certain investment decision may not grow some fruition and how to avoid. This way, you can guide against loosing the bitcoin which you already have while in your quest to achieve more. Like they say, \"a bird at hand is better than a thousand in the bush\".",
