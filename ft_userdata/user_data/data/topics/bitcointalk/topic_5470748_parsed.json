Is it merely necessary for recording every transaction, making it essentially just a database? Please continue to be pertinent; I am aware of how blocks are produced.It is not just a database. The blockchain has the ability to provide a trustless and transparent record of transactions. These transactions are verified by thousands of network participants. And unlike to a centralized database blockchains operate via a network of nodes. Each node has a copy of the entire blockchain which help to decentralize the whole process.Blockchains are of course not limited to Bitcoin and are constantly evolving. Ofc they are not just limited to cryptocurrencies but extend to various areas of the economy and/or society.",

I'm about to begin investing and even trading.The bitcoin blockchain which is the first blockchain to ever exist is not used because of stable financial situation, it is for the purpose of having a public ledger that contain information about blocks and transactions which are validated or verified by nodes. If you want to begin investing and trading, you should know they are different from blockchain. Without blockchain, there will not be anything called bitcoin transaction.It is worth knowing that trading is very risky, but you can invest in bitcoin, especially in time like this when bitcoin seems to be undervalued.",

      "body": "Think of it as a database, which is stored in thousands of computers across the world. These computers are called \"nodes\" of the network, and by the protocol they will follow the database that contains the most \"work\". By \"work\", I mean that it contains evidence that the most mining has happened in that chain; another way to think about it, is that the most resources have been spent on that database. It is trivial to verify that with the uniformity of hash functions. If you follow that route, and simply accept as valid transactions included in that most-worked-database, then what you have is a network where minting money and transaction verification are done collectively, without any central authority whose presence is mandatory for the network to operate.",

Cant argue with that since most of the users who join this is investing some of their money and wishing for a huge return due to past performances. But maybe understanding this is more important cause its not all about getting 5x or more profit but the efficient it can bring to different sector once its get more adoption.",

Please continue to be pertinent; I am aware of how blocks are produced.As @Helena Yu put it, I don't think it has to be too technical if OP wants to stay up late on BTC. Regarding the functions served by blockchain I think there are many, what is clear is that transparency is at the center of Bitcoin and there is no transmission to the bank for transaction completion and Bitcoin is encrypted with its own security protocol.",
