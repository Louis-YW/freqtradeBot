I also understand due to inflation the value of fiat each day is going down. If I compare iWhatt with Bitcoin I should be able to know how much it's value has gone up compared to others assets in the world.  I don't understand is that without the comparison how can we determine Bitcoin is more valuable that anything in this world. This is the reason we need this comparison. Comparison is the only way we can increase the adoption of Bitcoin.",

Don't go \"wow\" when BTC hits $100k. Because $100k today doesn't value that much anymore. It's still low. BTC's value and that of fiat is different, BTC has a limited supply and with a high demand it gets a higher value, all of which happens in a decentralized way. Fiat currencies get their value from their government policies, economics, etc, all being centralized. Though BTC is not yet a legal tender anywhere other than El Salvador and even though you can spend it in almost everywhere in the world, it is still in very small numbers, and you have to convert it to fiat most times. So BTC's value still has to be measured in fiat currencies to understand its purchasing strength.Quote from: virtualdn on May 03, 2023, 11:50:27 AMWhat I mean is... don't sell cheap when you do it because you might never see your BTCs again. When you sell would not change the value of the fiat currency you are converting to or how much inflation is affecting it, even if you hypotetically sell when 1BTC is $300k or more, if the fiat money is worthless then, once you convert it to fiat it no longer worths anything too. What i believe is there is no need to sell off BTC's completely and move back into a censorship currency, it is better to hold a censorship resistant currency and convert to fiat when you need to.",

It should be noted that Bitcoin will never survive without fiat, it even has its limit of supply, and it has its times of appreciation and depreciation, so why do some people look at Bitcoin's positive side alone and turn a blind eye to its downside? Both have their pros and cons as nothing is perfect in reality.From an economic view, I believe that someone that has planned his project to be executed between 2022-2023 by saving in Bitcoin on November 2021 will be regretting while not saving in Fiat.This means that it's all about our planning, smartness and accurate speculation on the two, it's not by letting others believe one is supreme.",

When you are in control of someone Finances (where you can freeze it at any time especially when the person is a suspect) you have a good control of an important part of that person.I don’t think the government would be ready to give up that control, Crypto-currency is system that keeps them away of such control, and monitoring. Let’s take for instance all of crypto-currency becomes centralized today and the government has good grip of a control on the users and crypto still has all of its advantages over traditional means of finances, I bet the government would have giving full nod to it. The issue is that they can’t control or manipulate crypto-currency the way they want to.",

Gradually, as the years are passing the price of bitcoin started to increase in value due to the limited supply of bitcoin and the massive adoption. On the other hand let's take a look at fiat,it has being depreciating in value since the beginning till date because it is controlled by the government and some economy factors. This shows that bitcoin and fiat value is moving in opposite directions. The more the years the higher the value of bitcoin, while the higher the years the lower the value of fiat. The fact is that we can't do without fiat currency because the government controls it and we are also controlled by the government. Save in bitcoin and keep your daily fiat spending in the bank. The two currencies can't survive without the other",

However, the thing that needs to change is the mindset of people buying Bitcoins. I have started to change my perspective on the BTC exchange rate to my local currency.I use the method (currently) the price of 1 bitcoin is equivalent to Rp. 415 million, so when the bitcoin price touches 450 million rupiahs, the bitcoin value strengthens, whereas if the bitcoin price touches 400 million rupiahs, the bitcoin value weakens (essentially I prefer the bitcoin price in front of the fiat price).",

So basically even though inflation is approaching, sooner or later all of that will be accompanied by adjustments or solutions.Quote from: virtualdn on May 03, 2023, 11:50:27 AMSo stop comparing BTC to FIAT and see the true value of Bitcoin.
