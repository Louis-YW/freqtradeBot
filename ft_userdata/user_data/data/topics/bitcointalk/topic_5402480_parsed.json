This bear market is expected and not new as it has happened before like in 2018, but the end result would still be bull market that will later skyrocket bitcoin again to all-time-high. Just be patient for you to see this to become reality.",

Yes it can be skewed a bit by pumps on obscure alt-coins but overall it is fairly reliable. BTC and ETH combined have been the lion's share. The bottom few thousand coins really don't amount to shit.",

It just moves along the current price.For something truly staggering, look at how the IMF literally created 650 billion USD out of thin air:Quote from: https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/08/23/pr21248-imf-managing-director-announces-the-us-650-billion-sdr-allocation-comes-into-effectIMF Managing Director Announces the US$650 billion SDR Allocation Comes into EffectThat's actually that amount of money created, not like the Bitcoin market cap, which only considers the latest price, and the number of units. In reality, there's way less USD invested in Bitcoin that the current Market Cap.",

While it gives you an insight on what's happening to an asset, overall it is nothing but a number to awe people and lure them into buying. The recent sell off is pretty amazing too, considering that it happened in a span of days and not even weeks. Even stocks has the same issue so I guess it is just investors trying to save some cash currently but it could be anything.",

So, how about you? Have you tried ?that is supposedly how it works. if the token is listed in other exchange and its price in the other exchange is $1.Â  the marketcap will be recalculated and average afaik so the cap will be 1.5T. this is very simplified but you get to have the idea already with just it. BTC is in every exchange.don't start thinking of creating a new memecoin, the hype is already over. we're done with it.",
