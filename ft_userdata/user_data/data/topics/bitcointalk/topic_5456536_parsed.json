I did check the other boards for announcements but it's a bit like finding a needle in a haystack.I'd prefer people with a good track record and that I can check their work somewhere.Thank you.",

I also recommend jayce to do this job since he has good reputation on making good signature design and also not been surprised to see many recommend him to do the job since he's really a perfect choice with this.",

Thanks guys!Quote from: hugeblack on June 18, 2023, 02:53:39 AMJayce is an excellent option, but there is no objection to some competition.

No one can predict the future, and everything could be changed rapidly in overnight. Honestly, I got perfect timing after the legend of sig designer medUSA left the forum when I was developing my skill. Of course I wasn't that good at that time but no pain no gain. There were so many contests back then which you could proved your skill to everyone on the forum, but yeah the risk is you might get nothing for the time you have spent. Actually creating a contest is a win-win solution for both sides, which as project owner, you can promote your brand even before the signature campaign launches, and for the sig designer, it could be a good place to show your skills. But the problem is, the participation rate is pretty low today comparing to the number of active designers in the list. Hopefully more designers could take a risk and join any contest in the future.I would like to confirm that I have been contacted by the OP few days ago and the work is already in progress. Thank you once again guys.",

That being said, I won't mind to join a design competition because most of the time the winning prize is more than my fee, lol. And the OP can also find fresh talent.",
