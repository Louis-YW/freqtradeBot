Soon, you'll have accumulated a wealth of knowledge that other newbies who have spent more time in the forum have yet to acquire. I hope you have gone through everything you have stated in your topic; you can't be a leader unless you lead by example. So I wish you the best of luck in the forum and hope to see you rise higher in the ranks soon.",

Your comment is supposed to come from an old member or someone who visits the forum frequently before he registers.There are dozens of topics in this section that provide similar recommendations, and it is enough to check the topics sticky at the top of the section to find them.There is an important recommendation that I think you did not pay attention to, which is to use the search feature before you publish any topic, because the answer to your topic may already be there and there is no point in repeating it.By the way, the recommendations that you mentioned are the recommendations for dealing in any forum and are not specific to this forum only.",

Besides, study it first and learn more further before joining in such a discussion. You forgot the very important that beginners should be avoided.Copy-pasting or plagiarising from the article without citing a source, it's a mortal sin here and there's no chance if you have proven to do this.

Sometimes a theory is very easy to understand but very difficult to implement. I think that in order to thrive on the forum, it is not enough to know the rules. It's also important to apply what you know and provide concrete examples of your understanding and skills.By applying the knowledge you have in forums, you can add value and help others better understand the topics covered. Also, by providing real examples, you can build trust and a good reputation among forum members. I hope you feel comfortable and successful in this forum. Cheers bro",

I'll like to add to the list, newbies should learn how to use the search option they should learn how to search and look for answers here in the forum. If newbies should learn how to use search option it will reduce the creation of a lot of redundant threads, no joke that the forum has been active for a long time and the probability that the answer to the question you have in mind has already been written somewhere here in this forum all you have to do to access it is to search and I think alot of newbies underestimate and look down on the search option in this forum.",
