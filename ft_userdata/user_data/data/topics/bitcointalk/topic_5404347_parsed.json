My name is Mark and I'm the CEO & founder of YieldTopia.finance.https://2520259417-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FK2ZJ3HiSfjzpYCqnaUpG%2Fuploads%2F8lARpXSNGXwnSqP6Fncn%2FMark.%20(1).png?alt=media&token=3fb0c2bc-7b38-4204-8e23-b9ff590cd05eYieldTopia is a new yield protocol that offers a sustainable high APY $YIELD rewards, backed by a utility-driven ecosystem.We're determined to create a truly decentralized staking platform that DeFi users can trust, avoiding centralization and human error. Our focus is sustainability and scalability. https://i.ibb.co/6H7p8BY/protocol.pngWhat makes YieldTopia different is the mechanism behind the protocol, besides having an incredible APY, YieldTopia was designed to be scalable and sustainable. We've achieved that by building an ecosystem surrounding the protocol and its native token $YIELD that's focused on constantly generating additional value to the protocol and the YieldTopians (our community). ðŸŒ±YieldTopia Protocol:YieldTopia Yield dAppYieldTopia SwapYieldTopia NFT MarketplaceYieldTopia Launchpad & Token GeneratorYieldTopia's Stable Coin - $USDYYieldTopia's Native Token - $YIELDYieldTopia In A NutshellYieldTopia is the financial haven you can actually trust. Decentralized, community-driven, trustless, profitable, and most importantly YieldTopia is sustainable and scalable. Providing a variety of utility, profitable high-APY yield protocols, $USDY stable coin, NFT Marketplace, Launchpad, and much more. The best part is that the entire protocol is decentralized and designed to support the $YIELD token, yield rewards, and pegging the $USDY stable coin. YieldTopia doesnâ€™t ask investors to trust them, they designed it to be TRUSTLESS, the way decentralized finance was always meant to be.https://2520259417-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FK2ZJ3HiSfjzpYCqnaUpG%2Fuploads%2FDi2KMsqqobZjLcaAiO5G%2Frebase.png?alt=media&token=dc941a34-73ba-4bc9-a53d-86cd4efbc33bWhat Makes YieldTopia DifferentCelsius was right about one thing, if you donâ€™t have free and unlimited access to your own funds, are they really *your* funds?Unfortunately, they didnâ€™t actually go by that mantra but YieldTopia does, and thatâ€™s what makes YieldTopia, $YIELD, and $USDY different â€” better â€” sustainable â€” and scalable.The team behind YieldTopia analyzed every single DeFi project that failed in the past few months and learned from their mistakesThe downfalls of other projects gave YieldTopia valuable analytics and information to achieve true sustainability for the whole platform. Each and every utility of YieldTopia supports the pegging of $USDY (keeping it at $1.00 at all times), and supports the value of $YIELD, keeping the rewards given to investors VALUABLE. Investors get rewards every 30 minutes, which the platforms mentioned earlier did not allow, and most importantly, $USDY doesnâ€™t overprint or leverage beyond its reserves, this mechanism helps avoid the situation of de-pegging.Introduction to $YIELD token - the gem behind YieldTopiahttps://2520259417-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FK2ZJ3HiSfjzpYCqnaUpG%2Fuploads%2FKwF9L5DeIn17z1DFX3RE%2Fsdsd.png?alt=media&token=7fd856c6-5d3d-41f9-9f5e-11c20dcbd56e$YIELD is YieldTopia's native token and the main token used within the whole ecosystem. All of YieldTopia's utilities are focused on benefiting $YIELD and its holders. The incredible yield protocol that YieldTopia is known for requires investors to use $YIELD in order to participate in staking & farming pools, and generate the high APY rewards which are also given in $YIELD. In addition, $YIELD can be used for lending & borrowing, DAO voting, providing liquidity, swapping between popular cryptocurrencies, and earning a portion of YieldTopia's profits simply for holding $YIELD.Smart Contract Source CodeBSCScan: https://bscscan.com/address/0x61B0a06FBd5eD569AD901144AD4AA27B303fc3d0#contractsGitHub: https://github.com/YieldTopia/YIELD-Token-Smart-ContractSmart Contract AuditAuditing Company: InterFiAudit Report: https://github.com/interfinetwork/smart-contract-audits/blob/audit-updates/YieldTopia_0x61B0a06FBd5eD569AD901144AD4AA27B303fc3d0.pdf$USDY Introductionhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gQSZeiOF_WESritt7XSeYA.png$USDY is a decentralized stablecoin which is crypto-pegged in a decentralized way with $BUSD, at a 1:1 ratio. $BUSD is rated as the most reliable stable coin in the crypto space, considering that it is owned by Binance the biggest crypto exchange in the world, we agree with that statement. The stability of $BUSD will help maintain the stability of $USDY with the United States Dollar, our job was to design a crypto-asset that is pegged and always at a 1:1 ratio with $BUSD, and Binance is doing the heavy lifting keeping that pegged with the United States Dollar. This is the type of sustainability that other stable coins which got de-pegged or facing a de-pegging scenario are lacking ($UST, $USDD, etc).The Benefits Of $USDYâ€Šâ€”â€ŠMore Than Just Another StablecoinA Piece of YieldTopiaâ€™s Profits:All $USDY holders will earn a passive income from YieldTopiaâ€™s profits, each and every utility of YieldTopia generates an income that will automatically distribute a portion of that to all $USDY holders. This income is completely passive and will appear in your wallet. DEX Liquidity Provider: Become a liquidity provider for your favorite crypto assets provided with $USDY, you can create LPs on YieldTopia Swap or other DEXs / Swaps and earn a fee from each swap.Earn Via Lending: YieldTopia is working on multiple partnerships with large and well-known lending protocols and DAOs that support lending. Once the partnerships finalize and get announced, $USDY will be listed on these platforms and will become available for the holders of $USDY to earn additional income when lending via these various platforms.Staking & Farming: $USDY will be available on YieldTopiaâ€™s farming & staking pools. In addition, similarly to the lending feature, we are currently working on various partnerships with staking / DAO platforms which will allow $USDY holders access to profitable pools dedicated to $USDY. As YieldTopia grows additional partners and opportunities will be added. Referral: Earn additional rewards by referring your friends & family.YieldTopia's DEX / Swaphttps://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*YGrTO64smIL7ILNKhtIQug.pngYieldTopiaâ€™s Swap is a branded decentralized exchange provided by the YieldTopia protocol. All fees collected are sent to YieldTopiaâ€™s liquidity pool & reserves, providing additional backing to the $YIELD token, $USDY stable coin, and the entire protocol.
