  "content": "The Building Blocks of  Bitcoin Core and Blockchain Implementation. Coinbase Transaction Protocol and the Proof of Work Parameter of the Database verification  system are the two building blocks components in the Blockchain implementation. These are simply known as Bitcoin Core Pramiter in the back end of the Bitcoin Core System Software. Also, Bitcoin and  Blockchain are two different components which work as pairs through Bitcoin Network and the Bitcoin Core is the Client to manage Bitcoin Transaction System and its database. It is based on a principle of Cryptographic hash function and digital signature for verification. Which provide the irrefutable proof of evidence for ownership of the digital asset via the Private Key protocol. No, one can sign message unless they are the owner of the Public Key or the address. The system is based on Coinbase Transaction protocol, which is the foundation of the Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology. So, the first transaction of the Genesis Block was made with Computational Parameter of the Bitcoin Core. Genesis Block's Publickey and its Blockhash was verified by Blockheader, which is an analogue numbers and letters of the previous Block but as there are no previous block, so I proces it with Coinbase Wallet and digital ID instead of 256 bits of Zero, because the verification was essential and requires. Genesis Block BTC Address and Coinbase Wallet Address together formed an encrypted logic based validation mechanism, which is called Bitcoin Radix or the mathematical root of the Genesis Block Index Number, which refer as Merkeleroot after its first computation.  That is the foundation and invisible function in the backend layer of Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Genesis Block verification  Logarithm  that provide authencity of the Block entry of the Genesis Block in the Bitcoin Blockchain database. The Coinbase Wallet and its unitary Public Key provide validated verification to the Genesis Block Hash. The Gnenome Nautical identication Documentation is cryptographically embedded in the Signature Log that repeat simultaneously in each Block transaction for Proof of Evidence.",
