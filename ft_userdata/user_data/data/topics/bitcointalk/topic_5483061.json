They may be asked for advice on taking the country forward or on major policies of the country. So we can say they are the most powerful it can be directly or indirectly. Some may think that their attraction is not for getting the power but to increase their wealth. Whatever, It is now not confined to one place but is now engaged in a competitive behavior which will increase as long as the world exists.SourceIt will not be very difficult to guess who can be the most ahead in this competition in the future world. I have been seeing a lot of rich people collecting bitcoin lately and there is a big competition to collect bitcoin among the recognized rich internationally. Now the day is not so far when the top several company owner all over the world will also be defeated by the BTC holder.Bitcoin is now a weapon with which only he can maintain his power in this space.I have seen several individuals who are the top bitcoin holders. They are: Michael SaylorJustin SunTyler Winklevoss & Cameron Winklevoss Jack DorseyChangpeng Zhao (CZ)Brian Armstrong.Jed McCaleb and many others.In the race to become the richest in the world in the future, only¬† businessman can not get that place. In addition to being a big business owner, one must hold bitcoins. Do you agree with the statement?",

So we can say they are the most powerful it can be directly or indirectly.  Money equals power. But there's a difference between self-accrued power and SOVEREIGNTY... don't even try to link them to any political or gubernatorial positions except they've been tutored already on that.. what you gotta understand is that - most of those countries you mentioned are already DEVELOPED countries and the rate of intolerance over political curruption is really high.  Bitcoin would certainly reach higher limits than what we've known it to be today... Cus why are the governs fighting to have prior control? It has shown its providence for over a decade and more.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Do you agree with the statement?Of course Op one way or the other man can hold bitcoin for future use, it also a means of investment for some business men, but not all are capable of doing such.The way things are going round now, crypto currency has become special and a very attractive source of making cool money.Not only the business men even though the most countries have fully engaged themselves into it.Now it is a lesson to us all, if you can make a view from far you can see the most richest men in the world are into crypto racing, still making money not by relying on the whole wealth they are having, what about we should also have that same patience of holding Bitcoin. I think we can also find ourselves on the list one day.",

It's their choice to buy anything they want, be it, assets, investments, businesses, etc. And don't forget about the corporations that have been holdings thousands of Bitcoins and it doesn't matter about being richest in the world because it changes over time.",

Do you agree with the statement?The idea that one must be a holder of Bitcoin in order to be considered as one of the world's richest and powerful is something that I may not agree...but also may not disagree. Look Bitcoin is an asset in a digital form and its value has skyrocketed in many years after its inception and if one happened to have invested heavily with BTC years ago then certainly this can propel someone to be rich beyond imagination. However, based on the list above, getting involved with Bitcoin is not enough. There are so many profitable assets out there in the world where one can explore and if successful then one can be so rich. In fact, you need money to get into Bitcoin and you need to work on that money before you would have something to invest. One can even go to politics and get rich in the process...this is certainly so true anywhere we go.",

Maybe this bull market, we will those prominent persons making huge gain as they can hit the billion mark. But what happens during the bear market? Obviously their assets is also going to be hit hard by it. So, doesn't manner if there will be a rich as to who will be the richest, in my opinion. Bitcoin is different form of investments that we can't compare to let's say Elon Musk or Bill Gates or whoever is the richest person at this point in time.",

Mind you some of this current Richest men have some stash of Bitcoin While others are waiting for it to be properly backed to implement them in their business Business is an opportunity So a good business man would want some portion of the cake. One advantage I find your list of potential richest¬† have would be their relatively low average age. Holding a Huge amount of money is a method to become one of the richest but not the only method.The needs Microsoft or Tesla Carter for is different from ones Bitcoin solve.¬† We can't tell what the future holds A company can just come later on and invent an immersive virtual world That would be Grand breaking.",

But at the end of the day it is still a competitive playing field and not always fair to all, the more capable you are the more dominant you are, and it is unlikely that bitcoin can turn them into champions the wealthiest person by the crowd's standards.",

Well, that's by the way.I think you are still overviewing the future, and by doing this, you will make a lot of mistakes. Fine, many will make huge money with Bitcoin and crypto investment, especially if they know how to build good businesses around them, just like the exchanges are doing. But to make so much huge money through cryptocurrency to the extent of making it in hundreds of billions easily as you believe, that is what I am doubtful of.The billionaire level we see is not so easy to attain and those who are the richest in the world have it hugely in other sectors you might even downgrade. Cryptocurrency will continue to give money but to give that huge money and that fast is what I doubt. Many sectors are there in the financial market before it and have produced billionaires, yet they have done it for a long time, but it wasn't in a single sector of asset dealing as you think.",

Michael Saylor: Michael Saylor founded business analytics software firm MicroStrategy in 1989. Tyler Winklevoss & Cameron Winklevoss: The former Olympic rowers are best known for accusing Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea for a social network. They used some of their $65 million legal settlement with the Facebook CEO to start stockpiling Bitcoin.Jack Dorsey: Dorsey cofounded Twitter in 2006 with Ev Williams, Biz Stone and Noah Glass, and was CEO until 2008. He returned in 2015.Changpeng Zhao (CZ): The Chinese-Canadian coder cut his teeth building high-frequency trading systems for Wall Street's flash boys.Zhao founded Binance in July 2017, raising $15 million through an initial coin offering.Brian Armstrong: A former Airbnb software engineer, Armstrong cofounded Coinbase in San Francisco in 2012 with former currency trader Fred Ehrsam.Jed McCaleb: Before entering crypto, McCaleb created the file-sharing service eDonkey2000",

For bitcoin holder I think has chance to be rich person in the future but need main business without prefer source income from cryptocurrency, more completed when businessman have investing in bitcoin when their profitable hold in cryptocurrency and take benefit in the future with drastically higher price.

There's the president, the prime minister, institutions like the parliament, which are likely to be more powerful than rich individuals.Now, I've checked the net worth of all the individuals listed by the op. They're all billionaires, but the amount is usually less than $5 billion. CZ is an exception with $15 billion, but he might lose a lot because of criminal investigations.
