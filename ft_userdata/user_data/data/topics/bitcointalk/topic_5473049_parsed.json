  "content": "There was some similarity when I accidentally learned about T2T2, many people are probably still continuing on Friend Tech. And I bet this is a project filled with hype.  Are any of you interested in this project? As far as I know, they conduct IEO on Bitget, IEO details: https://www.bitget.com/events/launchpad/details/7121 I don't know much about the current events regarding this project, but from the looks of it, it seems like it's quite hyped to launch at the moment. What do you think about T2T2? Will this project cause many developers to launch and list similar products in the future, because when I learned about SocialFi, I wasn't sure what they could do or if they were simply taking advantage of the term to cause attention.",

When there is hype --for sure there could be fraud and people should be careful about that. I searched fake T2T2 and many reports that have been published about fake T2T2 projects. However --joining the exchange Launchpad event about this T2T2 is perhaps worth considering. As we know early holders perhaps have the potential to gain profit near the future when a bullish trend comes.",

I wont consider legit if their prime exchange to choose is bitget since that platform is full of suspicious listing projects. Probably they have a lot of agents that find projects or listing with a fee on their pocket or commisions that why there are lot of listing. Not into fud but Ive seen some exchanges works like that and now they are dead.",

As soon as it’s listed, it will dump hard until the tokens are not worth anything.",
