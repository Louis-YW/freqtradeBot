I can’t undersstand how these websites and scam projects continue to operate while people still also invest in something so unreal. How can these mining websites promise more profit than any powerful mining device can deliver? I will simply explain how it’s not possible:It is easy to see that it’s fake when you calculate the profits you would receive from the most powerful device available in the market, which may give you $100 for example per day after paying electricity fees. These websites claim to offer even higher returns without requiring any effort from you apart from giving them with your money.Anyways if that's what this member is seeking for, he should be aware that this is not the right place to post this request. If he is genuinely looking for similar websites to invest in and doesn’t understand the risks I have clarified things for him to avoid such scam.",

Also, the well-known mining pool Viabtc had launched its cloud mining program since 2020.I am convinced that they are all spam programs in one form or another, regardless of who runs them. But what I meant is that these programs are still popular and their promoters are still succeeding in causing victims. I'm not encouraging OP to go ahead with the scam project but I'm just explaining his position that he might be following programs run by major platforms like Binance.",

Whenever you do able to encounter some good returns or offer then always be skeptical on this one and be that always make your own research .Cloudmining would really be that legit on the time that we do talk about Hashflare or Genesis which do offer those contracts but if you do have plans on being a miner then you would really be needing tobuy your own asics or GPU or basing up on the coin that you are mining into.",
