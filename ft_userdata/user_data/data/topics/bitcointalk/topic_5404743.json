  "content": "Username: IranusThis user registered since 2016, based on his post history, he's mostly active in Bitcoin discussion related (e.g. Bitcoin, wallet, mining, development, exchange, speculation etc) until 2017, even though he did ever post on gambling board, but it's just few posts only. Then this user inactive and comeback on 2020, but most of his post on 2020 until right now is full of gambling boards, he did post on Bitcoin discussion related, but it's just a common sense and not high quality post like when he was 2016-2017.His last post on 2017 is December 17, 2017On January 31, 2017 he opened a thread to sell Bitcointalk accountAccording to BPIP, this is the security and moderator log about his accountQuote11/12/2019 2:53:12 PM    woke up2/2/2020 5:48:56 PM    password reset via email11/18/2020 6:23:21 AM    woke upHis first post on 2020 is February 19, 2020If anyone want to read his post on 2016-2017, read the pages from 173-91Considering if he switch from Bitcoin discussion to Gambling discussion because he joined on casino signature campaign. I find this is strange since he's like a different person based on the quality his post on Bitcoin discussion between 2016-2017 and 2020-until now. What do you think about this?Some archive of his old posts1. https://archive.ph/rzJdL2. https://archive.ph/Ci4o33. https://archive.ph/SfIDO4. https://archive.ph/uHIfQ5. https://archive.ph/wM2he",

Changing the password or posting on the gambling section doesn't prove the account changed hands. Need more solid evidence to tag the account. Correct on all of that.  Being in a campaign where you have to post in certain sections can definitely influence where you post--whether you like or know anything about those sections or not.I have not looked into this situation in detail, but one thing I can say is that if there's a scenario like this where a member has woken up after a long time, joined a campaign and so forth, check the style of that member's posts.  If there's a language switch or a shift from good English to typical bounty hunter English, that's a dead giveaway and I've seen it many times.As far as Iranus is concerned, the evidence I've read so far does point to the account changing hands, but I'm not 100% convinced and thus am not going to tag him.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on July 01, 2022, 08:07:44 PMI am not a fan of digging accounts and I really do not encourage it too.Then don't do it.  But please don't discourage others from doing it.  My own detective work in the past has turned up lots of sold/hacked accounts, and you've got to be aware that there's too much bullshit going on in the forum that if it weren't for those members delving into suspicious accounts, people would be getting away with everything under the sun.",

But I saw many users to be in trouble because of doing that. They continue, keep making angry users against them, at some point the opponents get opportunity to get their revenge. Everything creates a bad environment and users start hating each others. You and me could disagree but I think it's better to contact someone via PM and tell them what you think. Give then time to reply you. If you think it was not satisfying then ask public opinion.If someone has changed their posting habit and regular in gambling board with wearing a gambling signature then it make sense that they are following the signature rules and posting to fulfill their weekly posting limit. Not everyone has genuine interest to post regularly.",

On top of that, since majority of campaigns are gambling oriented and I don't see this trend changing anytime soon, people simply prefer to write there even more than required quota as they want to secure their places in the future campaigns and there's no better way to do that than having majority (if not all) of posts written there. That's just reality of this forum, people adjusting posting habits based on signature campaign rules.Quote from: Solosanz on July 01, 2022, 02:01:13 PMHowever this is still a suspect, I accept criticism or anything to prove I was wrong.You have to provide the evidence and not the other way around.

Then I found some report from scam/spam buster in this forum and I choose to follow their path. That's why I searched some accounts if I found they're breaking forum rules/campaign, then I make a report in this board.I'm not trying to gain a quick reputation, I never ask anyone to leave me a positive trust or include me in their trust list.

I think after making some suspect, many users will continue to find another proof to prove it's really changed hands, but seems many people disagree with this.Should we not create a report if the proof isn't completely 100% convinced?",

Iranus' case is none of that. It is entirely up to you though, but if you do not really care that a user gets kicked out of their campaign and gets tagged for something, you can send them a pm to notify them of anything you notice in their post history, or to tell them that their posting pattern of quoting posts and returning back to it to fill it up is wrong like the previous case you reported, and they should desist from doing such, especially if that member has been in the forum for long and has ranked up. If the member is headstrong to change & still flouts that advice, you can now make a report against them.Quote from: Solosanz on July 02, 2022, 07:53:28 AMCan you find his address on 2016-2017? if you can find it and he can sign a message, then this case will closed.Iranus does not even have to sign any message for the case to be closed, they already told their own side of the story, i think every member can decide to sign a message to prove anything or not.Quote from: Solosanz on July 02, 2022, 07:53:28 AMShould we not create a report if the proof isn't completely 100% convinced?
