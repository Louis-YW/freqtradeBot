  "content": "NVIDIA RTX 3080 vapor chamber with a hole develops blue substance insideAs per the QuasarZone report, certain RTX 3080 Founders Edition and RTX A6000 graphics cards may be susceptible to problems related to vapor chamber cracking. The initial thread on this issue was initiated by a member, likely a technician, who was assigned the task of investigating the root cause behind the excessively high hot spot temperatures exhibited by these cards.Importantly, these graphics cards had not been previously opened or subjected to repasting, as confirmed by the original author of the thread. However, it was swiftly determined that there was a breach in the vapor chamber. This breach resulted from a chemical reaction that gradually created a hole within the vapor chamber. Because of this, fluid leaked out of the chamber and oxygen got into the void.https://videocardz.com/newz/breaking-badly-when-blue-substance-is-found-in-cracked-geforce-rtx-3080-vapor-chamber",

      "body": "I hadn’t heard this one but developing a blue substance inside sounds like a problem that you probably don’t want to have when it comes to an expensive electrical device with a very high operating temperature. Sounds more like an episode of Breaking Bad than a report on graphics card issues. Hope they got this issue figured out.",

I even blew up heat pipes above the video chip, but that was after 3 years of mining.So buyers of used video cards bear all the risks.",

It's essential to stay updated on such developments, especially if you're a user of these GPUs. The RTX 4080 has already been discontinued. Don't buy old RTX 3080According to Board Channels, a site aggregating sources and information from NVIDIA, AMD and Intel board partners, NVIDIA has recently announced a discontinuation of two GPUs. The inventory cut off is now in place and these graphics cards would no longer be available starting this quarter. It is alleged that NVIDIA has stopped mass production of these GPUs.The cards in question are RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080. NVIDIA has distributed the last inventory and board partners are now placing orders for their successors, the alleged RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and RTX 4080 SUPER model that are expected to launch in January.https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-reportedly-stops-mass-production-of-rtx-4070ti-4080-gpus-now-focusing-on-super-variants",
