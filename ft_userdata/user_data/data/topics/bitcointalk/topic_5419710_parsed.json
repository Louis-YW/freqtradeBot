Both these platforms then suspended withdrawals and then later filed for bankruptcy, with everyone who still had coins on them not yet being refunded a single satoshi.Do not believe the CEO tweeting that everything is fine. Of course they will say that, since saying anything else will just accelerate the bank run they are already experiencing. Get your coins in to your own wallets now.",

On the other hand, we have the Binance CEO, or whoever is behind their official Twitter account which with its big influence causes additional panic related to FTX.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1589374530413215744I personally don't like a single thing in all of this. The big impact of the biggest player or another fiasco with the exchange will certainly have serious consequences.",

Dumping their tokens in secret and then announcing it after would have been worse I think. At least this way FTX users are aware of what is going on and are being given some warning to get their coins off the exchange before its too late.Unless of course CZ is also shorting FTT, and by kicking off this bank run is now making huge profits. That's definitely the kind of shady shit that Binance would pull.Either way, the CEOs are making huge profits at the expense of the average users. Stop letting them.",

I just can't believe that crap like FTT is still worth around $22 despite all the negative campaign surrounding it.Since Binance still have the biggest trading volume for FTT than anything is possible, but I just checked Sam posting on twitter and he is saying that everything is fine, and competition is spreading false rumors about them.Honestly, I never liked both of this guys (CZ and Sam), and this looks like some high level stupid chess game they are playing against each other.",

The issue may be hyped but the company is having related issues. I will advise people to wise and stay away from FTX for now.I also write a tweet about how it will go wrong for Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX",

Lines like \"FTX is a strong exchange,\" \"FTX is popular,\" \"FTX makes a lot of money,\" \"FTX is a huge exchange,\" \"FTX is solid,\" \"FTX is one of the top crypto exchanges,\" \"FTX is too big to fall/fail,\" and so on. They haven't learned their lessons. And between SBF doing his urgent damage control versus CZ doing his greedy moves plus washing dirty linens in public, SBF is really bound to lose. CZ's moves created an extremely strong pressure that FTX couldn't possibly withstand. A perfect and lethal combination of CZ's almost $600 billion of FTT to dump in full view of the entire crypto public plus his popular public image with a big and strong body of followers who will definitely be taking a cue from his actions would certainly kill FTX. Poor SBF! CZ is the man who knows the game! But he isn't the hero here. They're both villains.",

Current rumors about BlockFi are being dismissed, but I don't think they are in a particularly healthy situation either. Hell, even Coinbase only survived by laying off 20% of their employees.I've said it before; it does not matter at all how reputable an exchange is, how long they have been operating, or how big they are. There is no such thing as too big to fail. This applies to all crypto exchanges, Binance included. Are all the people chasing promises of ridiculous interest rates and obviously unsustainable growth on these platforms too young to remember 2008? How an investment bank with almost $700 billion in assets (which is twice the market cap of all the bitcoin in circulation, so FAR more than Binance is worth) which had existed for over 150 years failed? I suppose an endless stream of naive teenagers new to the space would explain why these platforms keep attracting more users while simultaneously causing millions of users to lose everything.",
