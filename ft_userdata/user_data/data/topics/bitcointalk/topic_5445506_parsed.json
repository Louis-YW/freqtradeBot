      "body": "The louder a coin's headlines, the more likely it is either a scam or a mediocrity. This coin has zero liquidity, zero trading volume, zero volatility, the project is not listed anywhere, no one knows anything about it, but for some reason it is in the amazing status. An ordinary shitcoin, which nobody needs, and which will never show anything significant in its life. So it will die on some unknown exchange, until it is delisted and completely forgotten about.",
