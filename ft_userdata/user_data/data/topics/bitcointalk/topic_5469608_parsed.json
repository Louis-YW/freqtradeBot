He is about to make doge hodlers have some cool cash soon because he could continue this antics for those who want to take the opportunity for the ride. This is not the first time he is showing his love for dogecoin, couple of times this year the memecoin has gained some percentage in price. In 2021, he was instrumental to the rise of dogecoin to an ATH of $0.70 and that was a very big performance. So he may be repeating such run for his loved meme anytime soon.",

Elon knows that everyone's thinking DOGE is gonna shoot up, so I'm thinking it might not be as attractive to him to pump DOGE when there are other coins that could potentially make him even more money. We've got a bit of a bull run vibe in the air, not just for Bitcoin but also some bullish posts about altcoins. Maybe DOGE will hit $1 in this upcoming bull run, maybe not. It's up to you if you want to put your trust, and your money, in DOGE.",

Source It's a different kind of Elon Musk when he acts on a meme coin that he wants to promote. He knows how big the established Dogecoin community is. Because I remembered way back in 2017 that there was a really big community of Dogecoin, the others recognized Dogecoin more than Bitcoin. Doge believers are that possessive.So since Elon Musk mentioned it, they were really encouraged. So now, as I see it, it is another reminder or awareness among the doge holders for the upcoming uptrend in the approaching bull season.",

No doubt there is also the possibility of profiting from it but such chances are very slim. I don't also think that Mr. Space X has the influence to pump the market like he did before. Elon Musk cannot be trusted because he considers himself first and doesn't care about other investors. So he might not be able to attract much attention to DOGE.

Most of the investors are waiting for the next bull run and once it starts they will continue investing in all of those coins which can grow during that bull run. The intelligent investors are already holding Bitcoin and a few other coins in their wallets and they will sell those coins during the next bull-run's ATH.",

The 50/50 chances you say, I'm a little doubtful about that. You know Elon is very influential when he posts something on Twitter about a meme coin like Doge. And we have seen it several times. Like Shib, he only said briefly in the post about SHIB, but look at the sudden effect it caused on the market when the value of Shiba Inu rose.We still can't really say, honestly, that I'm also holding doge because somehow, if anything good is said about meme coins like doge or SHIB, it will definitely have a positive impact on the crypto industry market. Let's face it, he shakes the market suddenly when he takes a step about it. He knows very well how to shake the market here, to be honest.",

Around 5 to 10 times the current price of Doge coin.However, I am wondering what will be the impact on Doge coin for the market impact after Bitcoin halving? Moreover, investors will get good profit during bull run. Because doge coin minimum $0.60 to $0.70 is expected. However, it is impossible to say whether doge coin will reach $1. If you have invested, you have to be patient for one year to reach $1",

Dogecoin doesn't hold value like bitcoin but he enjoyed toying with it because he knows that people will not held him responsible for his actions because nonsense is what they don't entertain, he should continue whether he will until SEC get full of him and decide to invite him over for questioning.",

It does not even need Musk for the price of Doge pump.  Seeing however that Doge rises up to $0.70 during the bull market and then drops to $0.06 in the bear market makes Doge not good for long-term hold. I learned this from experience as I have tried doing it since 2021. Now I'm just using Doge to bet. If it ever goes up this 2024, investors who also held it for a long time will likely unload them.",
