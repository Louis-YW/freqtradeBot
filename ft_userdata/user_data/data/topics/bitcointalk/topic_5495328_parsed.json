      "body": "You see, forcing anything or something on someone is not a good idea or expect that it will result in a bad outcome, and in terms of bitcoin or crypto, imagine you persuade someone you know, a colleague, friends, or family to invest in bitcoin even though they don't want to or have no knowledge about it. What do you think will happen? Of course, expect that the person you force to do something he doesn't know will surely lose their money and may have a negative impact. That's why it is important to only share what bitcoin is and what it can do for someone, and if they have shown interest, then that's good. That's when you can guide them and help them understand bitcoin even more. Thats why I only share about what bitcoin is and how it can help someone without trying to overshare and make them want to know or do bitcoin just because I boost too much about bitcoin.",

You should have gone ahead to drop your own opinion first based on what was stated on your topic title, \"The reason why you shouldn't force someone to invest in bitcoin.\"Anyways, the reasons are simply. Bitcoin is a volatile assets and if you force someone to invest into Bitcoin and the market becomes volatile and reducese the investors capital, they will blame you for their loss, peradventure if the person decides to take a legal action against you, you might loss the case because you actually force them to invest into Bitcoin against their own will. If you want someone to invest into Bitcoin, only teach them what Bitcoin is and also give them some Bitcoin materials to guide them and after they are satisfied with what they learn, they will make their own decision either to invest or not.",

Why should you force anybody to do anything especially an adult They free to make their own decisions and face the corresponding consequencesIf I do introduce Bitcoin I never add it would make you rich or grant you huge profit I usually tell them it's an asset worth holding especially towards inflation in the long run. In a nutshell, if you force a person to make a decision you would be accountable or responsible for any results that ends up coming.",

Hence, one should not be forced to invest in it most especially if he’s not knowledgeable and has no prior experience investing in any volatile investment. And one should not be forced only because there are good number of bitcoin investors who end up getting rich in the process. Know that everyone of us has our own skills and interests in life. And one who works for others might not be possible to work for you as well. So always consider if the person is willing and interested to learn and invest, otherwise all your efforts on helping him and motivating him to invest will only go into waste. It’s still more advisable to let the person decide on his own which investment he’ll be more likely to invest conveniently and confidently. That way, no one will be held responsible if ever he will commit mistakes and losses in the future.",

This happened to me before with my two friends forcing them to invest in Bitcoin the outcome but the outcome is good at first but when the bearish season came now they blamed me because I suggested them to hold BTC they think that I am a scammer even though I never made any profit from sharing information about Bitcoin or share affiliate link.They don't even think that all investments have a risk and they should learn to handle the risk and I feel bad about the bad outcome and regret to spoon feed them into crypto that is why I learn that is why I always tell them the risks of crypto and they should DYOR always before they enter into crypto and I told them first they shouldn't blame me for their lost once the market price didn't perform as their expected because I already told them the risk and it's their own choice if they are going to bite or not as long as I just gave them enough information without forcing them.",

Your reasons are very clear sir, you have just said it all. in addition to what you just said earlier is not good to force someone who is not willing to invest in bitcoin, not because he don't know about bitcoin investment, just that he has chosen not to invest, deep down he has a reason for making such decision, some person might be scared of losing their money in bitcoin investment. However we need to have this at the back of our mind that bitcoin investment is  not a do or die affair is only for those who are willing to take the risk.",

Also, forcing someone to invest in bitcoin is kind of like using the same polarity of magnets, the more you try to force them then the more likely it is to go away so be careful how you do the convincing because there's a thin line between forcing and introducing.
