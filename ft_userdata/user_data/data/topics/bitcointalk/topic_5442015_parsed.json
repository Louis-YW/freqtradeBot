The best way to know is to visit each casino on this section and check out their designs. Since you're already here, you can visit each of them and try to compare if the design is the same as betboom and pin-up. That design isn't unique and that depends who their developers are or the provider that they've been using. So, I guess you'll be able to find similarity on other casinos by just spending your time browsing here.",

I only would love money, winning, and profit more than color or theme. So if you can't find what you want, you can use and input the script, add ons to Greasemonkey (Mozilla firefox) or tamper monkey (chrome) then change the theme color or anything you want with similar. You can find bookmakers site related crypto on our signature if you want more different..",

So I would suggest you to avoid both the sites completely if you love your hard earned money. For the sake of design if you fall in the trap of these sites, then no one can save you from it and you will end up in making losses. What’s the problem with other reputable site’s design and UI? They have great user friendly design and mostly they are “trusted “. I would suggest you to play there and remove this design hype from your mind. Wishing you best of luck for your gambling career.",

It could because you are wanting more, in general, but you are also seeking for risk of losing money from doing so. Take note that clone gambling sites are simply not affiliated with the original and that is an enough reason to be cautious with engaging into such platforms. If you are really into such concept then stick with it than to find an alternative offering the same thing you have liked from the start. Most of the people here are not even familiar with the mentioned platform so what more of its clone.There are many gambling platforms to choose from and for me, they are all offering the same set of games and almost the same promotions. The only thing wherein they differ is how the site itself is being managed as a whole. Keep in mind that it is money you are using to engage with such platforms so you better be careful; sometimes the urge to save will cost you more.",

Additionally, the OP is not telling the truth about the casino not accepting cryptocurrencies, as they do. However, I strongly advise against depositing any money with them.",
