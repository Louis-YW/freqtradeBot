But also note that there are other recommended online wallets such as the electrons wallet and blue wallet with a host of others,  that can give you good services also as a beginner.",

I can't fully comprehend what you mean. If it's simply for Bitcoin, why don't you get started with Electrum, and you can move to a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor, both of which are quite affordable too, in the future, when you're more familiar with cryptocurrencies too? I don't believe that it's absolutely necessary to start with a hardware wallet unless you're holding an amount worth over $1,000 or $2,000 and desktop wallets don't seem safe enough for you, which they are, depending on how you use your PC.

This is very secured and it's recommendable to keep all your assets in here especially if your investment worth a lot of money. But if you're only using ledger to keep just a small value of cryptocurrency, I wouldn't recommend to use it. There are many secured software wallets out there where you can keep it. I've been using Electrum wallet for awhile and I found no issue with it, so better to keep it there. I think it's practical to add your $200 into a coin or a token you're currently invested rather than buying a hardware wallet.",

Ledger is becoming stupider day by day.Thank you for sharing. I had no idea that Ledger wasn't as safe as it was thought to be. I'm also planning to purchase a hardware wallet soon and was considering one of the two major brands. I would have bought one, but I'm currently away from home. Trezor is currently running a promotion for 15% off; the basic version starts at €58, which is nothing compared to the safety of your funds. Desktop wallets are generally safe, but the environment is usually the issue because of possible threats such as malware or keyloggers; thus, a hardware wallet is an ideal way to protect your funds without too much hassle.",
