Our Twitter has been suspended because of the bots' activity! Unfortunately, lot's of Bounty members that have joined turned out to be bots. We are working to restore our account and we will reward all the participants as agreed! However after access is regained we will take a closer look at Twitter participants and accounts that have posted generic comments like \" it is good project team is good I believe it is success\" etc - will be disqualified. Please read our posts and comment only if you have something relevant to say. We don't want to hear fake praises. Â This only harms our company I want to know what you think about a bounty Campaign twitter account being suspended because bot's activity.Is it 100% thatÂ  was caused by the fault of the bounty campaign participants themselves? If you are the project owner, what can you do?",

Maybe a screenshot of the message about their suspension.Very many bounties employ bot like accounts to follow, tweet and retweet anyway, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was the cause.",

Its manager didn't even gradually checking the participants or making only qualified participants that can participate in the campaign. If the twitter owned by the project getting banned and this is just a common thing. This is showing how bad the campaign manager can affect the project itself.",
