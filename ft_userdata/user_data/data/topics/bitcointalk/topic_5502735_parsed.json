CURRENT PROPOSAL2-stage mining procedure. Transactions must include an output for a 1% \"convenience fee\".The difference between the total inputs and outputs will still be the standard fee which we will call \"storage fee\".Stage 1: Similar to how mining currently works. But in order for a block to be fully confirmed and added to the blockchain, it has to undergo a second mining stage where miners will compete for the \"convenience fees\".Stage 2:Miners will mine on the block from stage 1 and the winning miner will collect all the \"convenience fees\".Once stage 2 is complete, the block will be part of the blockchain.",

Bitcoin is decentralized and it should be continued with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision, for pure decentralization.If there is centralized solution to limit transaction fee, fee rate, is it good?It will cause another split, fork in Bitcoin community and after Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, we will have another Bitcoin \"Fee Limit\" perhaps. Miners will choose the chain that benefits them most, not the chain people with aim to get cheaper transaction fees like. You can see Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, with bigger blocks, cheaper transaction fees, but demand on these blockchains is actually very lower than Bitcoin blockchain.Less miners, less hashrate, their networks are less secured, one more reason to don't choose them for fund transfer.https://howmanyconfs.com/",

Well, I strongly agree to your point! Bitcoin's transaction fees has become a bit of nuisance in recent days. With more and more adoption, I foresee that the transaction fees are going to increase based on how busy the network is. Also with each halving, the mining rewards are getting decreased. So people who have invested a shitload of money in setting up their mining operations, will be more and more dependent on the transaction fees, rather than block rewards. So the transaction fees is bound to increase and it might increase to a certain point where it becomes unaffordable to use Bitcoin as a payment processor. If the Dev can find a way to limit the transaction fees, I think it will only help Bitcoin to remain financially viable to be used as a payment processor. Right now, the bank transfer is way cheaper than bitcoin transaction. Either the transaction fees issue needs to be fixed or we need to find a way to block BRC-20 tokens from the network forever.",

This threshold was written in the code as COIN * 144 / 250, suggesting that the threshold represents a one-day old, 1 btc coin (144 is the expected number of blocks per day) and a transaction size of 250 bytes.So, for example, a transaction that has 2 inputs, one of 5 btc with 10 confirmations, and one of 2 btc with 3 confirmations, and has a size of 500bytes, will have a priority ofCode:(500000000 * 10 + 200000000 * 3) / 500 = 11,200,000See? There was \"input_value_in_base_units\". But that method of calculating transaction priority was discarded.QuoteDo we make it a set percentage of the total number of satoshis being spent?Warning: coin amounts in satoshis are expressed as a whole numbers.

Fees are not covered by consensus rules. If you have a node, you can relay any fees you want (including free transactions, and 100% fee transactions). If you are a mining pool, then you can enforce those rules. No fork is needed to change it. And in test networks, you can actually see, how some CPU miners enforce their own rules, and for example make transactions like that: https://mempool.space/testnet4/tx/94444d3f15c1ca6905368c2121a0240c098ed62b061c1ac923cc9bff67991b55 (zero fee)https://mempool.space/testnet4/tx/9a385f0a8b5f730d21510ee6804121ebb77abf270be39911a5314f85a08746e3 (9,950.00 tBTC fee)And the same can be done on mainnet.",

      "body": "Quotebut it was never used as a way to assess feesIf you know the transaction priority, then you sort your transactions by this priority. Which means, that transaction with priority 1,000,000 is put lower in the queue than transaction with priority 2,000,000. Also, as an experiment, you can just grab the current mempool, apply those rules, and see, which transactions are selected, and which are skipped. You could be surprised.Quoteit didn't decide what non-zero fee they had to payOnly because we didn't reach the maximum size of the block yet, when this rule was active. But in general, that kind of rule can be used, for example as a starting point, to see, how well or bad it is selecting transactions.Quoteit's mandatory to pay the fee that is calculatedNo fee rules can enforce it. Even if you change consensus rules to enforce fees (which I think is a bad idea, because why miners shouldn't be able to pay zero fees, if they are going to collect those fees in the coinbase transaction anyway?), then still: it is possible to make an artificial traffic, only to meet your rules, and this is probably not what you want. Say, a transaction X would be forced to pay 0.01 BTC. Then, transaction X could pay that, but the miner could send 0.01 BTC back to the user, just to override some stupid fee policy. And it is possible to join those payments, then both will be accepted, or none, so it will be trustless.Also, we had some altcoins, which were advertised, for example as \"feeless\". Guess what: people still have to pay: not with coins, but with time instead.Another case was some exchange, which charged too huge fees. Guess what: it was exploited, when miners sent to them some payments, using a lot of small coins, so the exchange was forced to pay those miners back, when moving received coins.So, to sum up: you can enforce your own fee policy. But you cannot expect, that everyone will be forced by consensus rules to follow it. The best you can do is making a new \"de-facto standard\", similar to \"1 sat/vb\", which we have today.Quoteint(total_value/100)+1Then, it will hurt you in the long-term scenario, where you will send a single satoshi, and pay a single satoshi as your fee. Which means: you will be forced to pay 100% fees in that case.In general, percentage-based fees is one of the reasons, why I stopped using some LN channels. Above some amount, it was just more profitable to pay size-based fees, than amount-based fees. And then, some of my coins simply left LN, because if you have 0.01 BTC, and your fee is 0.1%, then you pay 1k satoshis. While on-chain, with a minimal fee rate, you can get it confirmed for much less than that (I had some batched on-chain transactions, when I paid 80 satoshis per output, and LN was unable to compete with that, because of percentage-based fees in some channels).Also, your code may explode, where \"total_value\" will be zero, because then, you will be forced to pay a single satoshi anyway (created out of thin air?). I hope you won't decrement some zero-filled uint64_t, and you won't repeat Value Overflow Incident in that case.",

People who withdraw their money from exchange or custodial wallet would be burdened with additional fees.3. It give less reason to perform UTXO consolidation, which means total UTXO will grow at faster pace.OP might be looking for a way to solve fees issue but I think it would be creating more problems than we already have because the system isn’t designed to actually use the quantity of the coins but rather each is treated as an UTXO which doesn’t matter how high it bitcoin in each UTXO is, so a change will also be needed. My biggest objection to this is since there is limited block space a fixed fee will mean that larger transactions fee would be prioritized which means someone sending a small amount of bitcoin might have to wait a bit longer than wanted, which will actually discourages the first purpose of bitcoin as P2P currency. Right now one can actually have the ability to pay more when they wish to help speed up their transactions, which is ok.",
