These browsers are often used to collect your data from your personal info, and browsing habits down to your shopping lists.  What could be the worse that could happen since the browsers already are watching everything you are doing? Could they even see the private key when you create a wallet or restore wallets?Opera isn't an opensource so no one knows what they put in thier codes.",

It's one wallet for multiple coins and usually includes a lot more web3 chains preinstalled than wallets like metamask do.It cuts down the chance of you being phished and Opera are a decently well known browser so it's easier to reliably install a trusted version of it than it is to install one for a wallet like metamask (especially with the potential for scam ads - Opera would be a more expensive target).Both wallets seem to have good cross platform support too (Opera on a phone and Desktop only need the 12 nmemonic words put in so you can use your wallet on both - makes the nft gaming side of crypto a bit easier - but nothing of high value should be stored on a phone).",

Since wallet needs to synch through the blockchain it will take lot of space and may slow down the browser experience as well. I don’t know, many of them might be liking it but personally it feels little insecure to use such wallets. I used MetaMask but left it because it feels someone is always watching my wallet. The trend is growing because they want to give easy access to everything. However we are forgetting that these wallets were made for safety and anonymity. It can get accessed if we are on public WiFi or something like that. That’s just personal opinion",

Have anyone came across Web browsers having Crypto Wallet other than Opera and Brave browser. Are these wallets safe?Personally, I don't use such browser-based wallets as my main wallet due to security reasons. Because it is easier for a hacker to gain access to your browser through some malicious website compared to gaining access to your computer. So usually I use such wallets as transit wallet due to added convenience for trading/gaming. But for my personal wallet, it's definitely not a browser-based wallet. So if you are holding a significant amount of crypto, prefer hardware wallet and nothing else. Some initial investment on hardware wallets will save you from future regrets.",

Have anyone came across Web browsers having Crypto Wallet other than Opera and Brave browser. Are these wallets safe?Online wallets as a browser extension are not a very secure option for storing your bitcoins in my opinion.  The reason why the developers of the Opera browser created such a browser extension is that new technical solutions are needed to attract new users.  The competition between different browsers is very high.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are known to all people on Earth.  Support for cryptocurrency transactions is a great PR move for the Opera browser.However, in my opinion, it makes no sense to use such wallets when there are lightweight clients like Electrum that are perfectly able to interact with hardware wallets.",

While it might be great for adoption and on-boarding, it should not be used as a long term solution to store coins. This is my take also using web browsers with inbuilt crypto wallets. Maybe for short term purposes but if you want to store your coins long-term,better transfer it to your own wallets holding your own keys. I am also not confident using crypto wallets via web browsers, we all know that this is being handled by certain devsand we don't know exactly the code they are integrating in this application, maybe possible loopholes or something backdoor.",

But I don't think it's a good idea to use browser extensions as a personal wallet, even if they give control over private keys. There are other wallets for alternative currencies that can be used as an add-on to the browser, but almost all of them have been exposed to hacking attempts since they are always connected to the Internet through the browser. It would be better not to use it as a main wallet and just use it for small transfers.Quote from: FatFork on January 31, 2023, 04:15:09 PMI was aware of the Opera Crypto browser, but I had no idea that they had integrated a crypto wallet into the default version of their browser.

Though users need to be cautious with these as the security of your crypto coins is not 100% guaranteed.Quote from: Vaskiy on January 31, 2023, 03:59:28 PMAre these wallets safe?Not a chance! Safety and responsibility of one's crypto assets lie with the user and as always, like what's being advocated here: \"not your private key, not your coins\"...any wallet that does not give you access to these private keys is not to be trusted! And with so many chromium based wallets on the market it's best to stick to what is proven to work and gives you full custody of your wallet.",
