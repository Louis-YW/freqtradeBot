You know there are many users on this forum, they will know a site through the signature campaign and once the site sponsoring it see more people and more profit after the campaign begin, they continue to sponsor the campaign. But not all end well as the profit may be low than expected, that is why you will see some campaigns later ended, but that is not the only reasons a campaign can end.",

Like you have already worn the signature of a casino and by creating this topic, that casino is visible to me, so that casino's or projects were visible to many more people like me. Apart from being visible to them, they are getting many users from here, This is how they get their customers and profit and spend a certain percentage of funds on this signature promotion campaign as per their marketing strategy.",

You should be familiarized on how business works when it comes to advertisements.Company gain profit through their customers while they part of their profit for advertisement to increase their reach to gain more customers. It’s same idea on the regular ads set by popular companies like Coca cola and so on. Signature campaigns sponsors are crypto businesses!",

The funds used for the campaigns are often part of their marketing budget.It acts as a form of advertising. This can lead to increased traffic to the sponsor’s website or platform, potentially resulting in more customers, sales, and revenue.The return on investment from these campaigns comes from the increased business they receive because of the heightened visibility and brand recognition.It’s not just about having their signatures or avatars advertised to the public, but also about how effectively this advertising translates into tangible business results.",

Or if I may say companies with investors, budgets for marketing, sales and all other departments. They are a profit making organization and as such they have a marketing and sales budget some of which strictly goes into signature campaigns. Maybe you haven't noticed but sometimes, the campaign managers will prune the number of participants in a campaign and their reason will be because the organization is cutting cost or reducing its budget. Something like this happened some weeks back in Shuffle campaign being managed by Little Mouse.  QuoteI want to know to know how advertising their Avatars and Signatures provides funds for the sponsors or is it that they just actually want their Signatures or their Avatars to be advertised to the public?Signatures campaigns are like ads.

The projects gains from their advertisment on the forum directly from forum members picking interest in their platforms from the campaigns that's ongoing on the forum and from other benefits like the number of traffic or unique site visitors that they get from the forum. Basically if the projects weren't receiving value for their promotions that they were carrying out on the forum they would have ended it a long time ago Projects are advertising on the forum for various reasons, some just need the traffic the forum offers when their links are been click on and it helps place them at higher position on google website rankings which introduced them to potential clients when they search for services that they render while some need the reputation that the forum offers like for mixers that the forum has being playing a major role in making them very popular among the forum members and cryptocurency community at large. Signature Campaign sponsor make their money from the popularity that the platforms gives them and all this happens because of their signature campaign. Some happens immediately while others take longer therefore some projects might be using money from their pocket without making any profits but with time and as the project gains more community acceptances, they'll likely make back all the money they have sent in publicity and also make other profits.",

So the flow of funds is of course very clear from every campaign that is held because it starts from the company itself which occurs before the campaign is run. You can also find things like that in every car company that continues to make advertisements every year with their new products and each advertisement must of course be paid for, right?",

That is true, if they are not in any way benefiting from the forum advertisement, they will stop their campaign.Because they are paying hefty amount of money weekly and if they have no profits from their business itself, they can easily shut down their operations. So the clickable link can easily direct to their site and they will know the stats on what they  are getting from being visible to this forum.This is also why some campaigns are short-lived, when they feel they are not getting the results or traffic that they want from their ad expenses.",
