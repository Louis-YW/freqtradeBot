However, something like USA banning bitcoins can have huge short term effect. In the long term, crypto will still keep growing. Look at the ban by China which is a major economy in the world. Even after that bitcoin prices have grown at good rates.",

I am aware that the possibility of that is low since El Salvador has always expressed interest towards bitcoin but just hypothetically, how much would bitcoin be affected if El Salvador does not show support any more?Generally there are only 2 ways that something like this can affect the price (effect is only on price, not much else):1. By dumping on the centralized exchanges and pushing the price down.Meaning if the El Salvadorian government signs up on centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc. and start selling (dumping) their coins there. That way the price would directly crash because of the increased REAL sell pressure.But they'll never do such a thing. They'll sell it the same way they bought those coins, off the CEXes...2. By talking about the sale and causing the weak hands to panic sell.This is what usually happens and because we are talking about \"weak hands\" panicking, their collective sell pressure is not something that can be predicted.But I speculate that because this hypothetical situation is not a very significant thing, the panic sell shouldn't be that big either. And it will definitely be a short lived panic.2.1. Another important factor during panic sells would be the existing market trend. During bull runs with a strong momentum, such news would be completely ignored and we may not even see any kind of panic sell. But during a bear market or when price is going side way without knowing which direction to go, the negative effect of it is stronger.",

OTC market is perfect place for institutional investors to purchase and sell bitcoin. Like Bitcoin Spot ETFs, they tried to accumulate bitcoin through OTC market first, not on CEX first. Because on CEX, their massive buy or sell will affect trading volume and price.CEX is their last choice if there is no other place to buy or sell, especially selling their bitcoin.Quote2. By talking about the sale and causing the weak hands to panic sell.If they do it, they will not sell all their bitcoins. That saying, if appears, will be used as a fud, to make a market crash, and help El Salvador buying dips. They can sell their bitcoins, but they will never want to make noise about it. It affects the market and money they can get from taking profit.",

Topic opened a few days ago -> What happens to $BTC when El Salvador sells their Bitcoin?To even understand how pointless these questions are, a few facts need to be taken into account.The first is that ES has around 6000 BTC, which is a drop in the ocean compared to what is traded on a daily basis - currently CMC shows that the volume is around 550 000 BTC or around $53 billion. The second fact is that the ES is a very insignificant country in any respect, the poverty rate has increased by about 5% in recent years and today it is over 30%, people live hard, and the president calls himself the most handsome dictator who at the same time builds some kind of hospitals for pets. The third and very important fact is that Bukele will not be president forever, and whoever succeeds him may conclude that the BTC experiment has failed, sell all coins and decide on a new experiment.ES is a conveniently constructed story about a country where everyone pays with BTC and the same it's legal tender, but it's just an illusion - a poor man is still poor no matter what currency his country declares as legal tender.",

Because a national government want to control its national currency, and surely no country globally can control Bitcoin as its own national blockchain so that turns it to a national currency. It sounds like a perfect future for Bitcoin mainstream but if we think deeply, it's unrealistic and is not a perfect future too.Because with Bitcoin, it's perfect if its blockchain is decentralized from hash rate to Bitcoin nodes, and its transactions are uncensored. If a single country can control Bitcoin blockchain, it's not a future I hope for Bitcoin. It will destroy many good things of Bitcoin blockchain and will make its value and price falling down.QuoteUltimately, CBDCs will take over the world while Bitcoin gets \"left behind in the dust\".
