(at least, i don't think you have a hardware wallet, and 2FA costs money per transaction)in the wizard => option \"create a new seed\" in the wizard => you should have written down the seed on a sturdy piece of paper, defenatly not in the cloudin the wizard => you should have confirmed your seedin the wizard => you should have chosen a strong passwordnow your wallet should have openedCan you confirm that this is what you did? If you deviated from this list, could you tell us what you did different?A \"normal\" wallet can not become a \"watch only wallet\" just like that... And a watch only wallet cannot be converted into a normal wallet... Something must have happened...",

You have to import the 12-word seed phrase. Create a 'standard wallet' by clicking on the standard wallet and importing your electrum wallet seed phrase, instead of importing the address you can not spend from as it is a watch-only wallet. If you import the seed phrase and you see zero balance, that means you do not have the seed phrase of that wallet.",

Your public address by itself means nothing, in order to be able to control the Bitcoin you bought, you need to have a private key from that address - and you stated that you did not generate the seed (Electrum), so I ask a logical question - did you buy Bitcoin, or did you buy a Bitcoin address?As for the \"leading company\", even if it is legitimate, their responsibility for what they sold you ends once the Bitcoin is in your (non-custodial) wallet.",
