  "content": "A week ago I was still wondering about the violations in this forum. Now I know a little about the infractions that lead to permanent bans.But there is one more thing that bothers me. I saw a lot of accounts marked as spammers by actmyname, those accounts were marked a long time ago, now they have changed and are no longer spammers. Will the tag stick forever? Is it in this forum if someone ever makes a mistake they can't fix it and it's forever?I initially praised a actmyname for taking the time to flag spammers, and making this forum better, but I was disappointed that actmyname didn't take the time to check whether what was tagged had changed or not.Is it fair if the tag sticks forever? I'm just a newbie, honestly I'm scared to say this because it might result in someone flagging my account",

He can look into the account and check if it is true that the person is no longer spamming.But I will say that prevention is better than cure, they should nit spam so they will not receive the spammer neutral tag.",

Some people do open a thread if they think they are worthy of negative or bad neutral tag removal, discussing it with other people in the public on this same reputation board to give their opinion about it to be removed or not.",

I think the problem that bothers me is obvious. I'll lock this up but later so anyone with the tag from actmyname has a look at this thread and hopefully they can report if they've corrected themselves and aren't spamming anymore",

Quote from: _act_ on June 19, 2023, 06:47:31 AMIt is just a neutral tag, not red tag.Stop generalizing it's just a neutral tag, if you get tagged with him, I believe your chance to get accepted into signature campaign is lower than other users. Not to mention few campaign managers will kick you immediately after you get tagged.Quote from: PytagoraZ on June 19, 2023, 06:54:02 AMBut I still see people have that tag and they have good posts. I mean, you're not the one who get tagged, they must be aware of the tag and they're trying to get rid off from it, if they don't care, it's their choice.",

Some people do open a thread if they think they are worthy of negative or bad neutral tag removal, discussing it with other people in the public on this same reputation board to give their opinion about it to be removed or not.But actually it is not a bad tag, but seen as bad by the people given the tag. Just a neural tag that the people given can work towards a way for it to be removed. I have seen many of the people that were tagged but got into a campaign. Some of them are not even still having quality posts enough.",

I saw a lot of accounts marked as spammers by actmyname, those accounts were marked a long time ago, now they have changed and are no longer spammers. Not that I'm going to go check your allegations about who is or isn't a spammer, but considering that @actmyname is one of the more respectable members of this community with an impeccable reputation, I have no doubt that every spammer deserved such a tag at the time they got it.Quote from: PytagoraZ on June 19, 2023, 06:40:42 AMI initially praised a actmyname for taking the time to flag spammers, and making this forum better, but I was disappointed that actmyname didn't take the time to check whether what was tagged had changed or not.I'm just going to tell you one thing, and that's real life that sometimes becomes a lot more important than any online activity. Just because someone doesn't have time right now doesn't mean they don't want to do something, and if you're so worried about it, maybe you can help him and make a selection of those members you think are no longer spammers.Quote from: PytagoraZ on June 19, 2023, 06:40:42 AMIs it fair if the tag sticks forever? I'm just a newbie, honestly I'm scared to say this because it might result in someone flagging my accountMost members will not leave any feedback for no reason, and if someone does (and does it often) then chances are that they will not be a DT member for long.

Is it in this forum if someone ever makes a mistake they can't fix it and it's forever?Why do you have to engage in anything suspicious as against the forum ethics before, we have a number of people in millions on this forum and they are not all tagged, thise being tagged gave done some well evident enough and you can see the reference to confirm them, if it's neutral tag then you may not have to bother much, but if it's red tag, they person would have done something bad as to warrant having a ban except that he does not cross the rule for getting banned, is it that easy for someone being a scammer to change easily and you espect his tag lifted just like that over years, so others could fall into their hands?Quote from: PytagoraZ on June 19, 2023, 06:40:42 AMI initially praised a actmyname for taking the time to flag spammers, and making this forum better, but I was disappointed that actmyname didn't take the time to check whether what was tagged had changed or not.Why should he bother, when the reason for giving the tag is well established, if you're sentenced to prison for performing an illegal act, will such judgement be reverted even if the person changed a new person or repented for his mistakes, those receiving tags from him are those found obviously doing one or two things below standard and which are uncalled for, my advice is that tou don't start what you will later regret doing.",
