It just that the unpredictability of people with their investments could have a big impact towards the price and that's definitely going to be how it will turn out. I do hope it wouldn't happen to the biggest exchange. As long as they would be away from potential detrimental issues, they would be fine.",

Binance is one of those companies that looks like it has risky enough products that they'd end up closing down parts of the page and liquidating user funds to cover other bits (earn, futures and margin would probably be the most at risk of this type of thing - in that order).Binance could also face problems ftx did such as hacks and poorly managed investments (we've seen the second one already but not to a huge extent - they don't back many popular collateralised tokens though which might protect them from some things that companies like ftx and coinbase might have been more vulnerable to).",

Crypto is really seeing bad fall here, not to mention and stress on the centralized organizations only. I think that's what we should be learning from the past and current crashes that if your money is in someone else's hand then you are at the risk of loosing it all and ending up your life savings with it. Have you guys noticed that it never happened on mega scale with bitcoin if the coins were put into the wallets, either hard or cold? They are heavily safe there and unless and until someone loose their keys or forget the keys then they are all good. Even if someone loose it, the coins are still there untouched!!Times come to remind every crypto guy to shift to wallets, secure the money, and use p2p trade methods. Makes me say one more time Not your Keys, Not your money. #NYKNYM",

      "body": "Any company can go bankrupt, and IMO the risk is higher during the economic recession. If it's a good company, then it's perhaps less likely to fail and more likely to reimburse customers if it fails, but nobody is protected. I'm guessing that many thought \"not your keys, not your coins\" was a radical pro-Bitcoin statement because surely reputable companies do have all the money their clients gave them and nothing bad can happen. I hope the FTX situation will convince more people to store their own coins. I don't think Binance will go bankrupt, but I wouldn't say it's impossible. And why store coins there if you can just download Electrum and store your coins there, for free, without ever worrying that someone will take them away and then not give them back because this way nobody can take them away?",

Binance is seeking licenses from a different country, Binance already know that government regulation can pull them down or make their hard effort go to waste.  So they are applying for licenses in different countries where they can easily expand their operation if they got approved.  I had the idea because Binance is already applying for license in my country and even helping the government in the promulgation of cryptocurrency knowledge.Yes, there is a possibility that Binance will get bankrupt but I do not think it will be soon.  They are doing great at this moment and there is yet any issue that can make their exchange go bankrupt overnight.",

FTX and Luna are billion dollar company and they don't just magically failed without the magic touch of CZ. Everything in crypto is connected to CZ because Binance is always venturing on new promising project. This only means that Binance always received the source news in crypto on what’s gonna happened before it will release to the public that’s why they are always safe on this kind of shit show.The only way Binance will bankrupt is when regulators push them to the limit and charge them with tons of cases that worth a fortune to settle. But it's impossible for Binance to suffer same method of down fall since they don't owe anyone on crypto space since they are an early adopter exchange in crypto before the marketcap explode exponentially.",

In my opinion, if Binance goes down for whatever reason, so will the majority of cryptocurrencies, leading to a tremendous impact on the market. While I trust Binance, and I don't think there's any reason to worry about our funds, we've already seen that there are no guarantees when it comes to the safety of assets. I'll be withdrawing half of my money from Binance soon, but for a different, not relevant to the topic, reason. Generally, I'm satisfied with Binance's services because they're extremely convenient.So in summary, it's unlikely Binance will go bankrupt or shut down, and it's wrong to compare it with Luna. Luna wasn't an exchange.",

We saw something like 6-7 billion pour out of FTX in the span of a couple weeks, which had been thought unthinkable to such a large exchange. Anything is possible and if the jitters get loud enough we could potentially see the same size run on Binance. That being said, the amount they must have profited on fees over time is ridiculous and if they invested that sensibly then they should have a very good buffer against bank run type events. I'd be more concerned about hacking than a similar drain of resources.",

I think it makes sense to bring this up as there is not really an exchange that I think will last forever, at some point all of them will fall or they will be bought by another even bigger entity, and after the demise of FTX it makes sense that people are worried about the future of Binance, however I do not think this is something which can happen in the short term, Binance for the time being seems like it is in a solid enough position, however if you are worried about this then get your money out of their exchange as soon as possible and never use it as your main wallet.",

After withdrawing from the exchange to aid the collapse, he now appeared to be interested in acquiring it. Several months ago, you made over 2 billion dollars on the same exchange.

Obviously, you cannot deny the possibility of this, They have shown proof of having enough holdings but obviously, there has never been a complete audit as to whether or not they have the complete backing of all the assets, and that also in reliable currencies, not just some token value of which can drop anytime. In fact, this is risky because just today I saw a tweet from CZ criticizing Bloomberg for writing false info about them online, but think what if that info is actually true and they are having their holding in BUSD only, now in that situation it's not that difficult for anyone to compromise BUSD as well, and even Binance can move towards bankruptcy.",
