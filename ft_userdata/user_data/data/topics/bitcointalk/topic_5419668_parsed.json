  "content": "I have always heard this saying: You would be addressed the way you are dressed . This also connotes that you should address people the way they dress or appear. In my location you must wear a suit, a shirt tucked in good pants with a tie, or a well-tailored native attire, to prove that you are ready for business or employment. Wearing a jean, T-shirt or any casual wear is indecent in business and you would be treated like an unserious individual. But over the years I have learned that appearance can be deceptive, this has made me treat people or business prospects by their behavior, ability, and productivity and not by appearance. Some reasons for my decision are:1. Good appearance doesn't guarantee quality: A so-called not properly dressed applicant might be more qualified and knowledgeable than a well-dressed prospect. Therefore it would be proper not to judge them by their appearance. 2. Scammers and criminals hide behind attractive appearances : To deceive people, some criminals dress presentably because they want to divert the attention of their targets. In my location, most Ponzi scheme operators always dress corporately at all times, just to give the people the feeling that their funds are in the custody of responsible persons.3. Limited time: Thinking of what to wear can be time and strength-consuming. Most people that are too busy with work or other engagements might not give adequate attention to what they wear. As long as the clothing is clean and good to wear, they are okay with them. 4. Weather condition:  It is very important to wear clothing that suits the atmospheric condition at a particular time, but most people especially in Africa don't understand this fact. I have been forced to wear a three-piece suit under the hottest sun I have ever experienced because my organization wants me to look presentable and corporate. I was sweating like a Xmas goat and all my clothes got soaked. But a T-shirt. a pair of jeans and a simple shoe would have given me the smartest look at that time. 5. More attention to the inside: Some perceived poor dressers feel that the mental and emotional well-being of an individual supersedes the physical looks. They believe that virtues like creativity, interpersonal skills, selflessness, contentment, etc are far better than appearance.6. Poverty: indeed, looking good or corporate might not be very expensive but the truth is that some persons cannot afford them. Some individuals cannot provide a meal for themselves because of poverty. It would be unfair to look down on such persons maybe during interviews or business proposal meetings because they are not well dressed. He might be the most qualified.    It is good to look nice and attractive but looking down on people that you feel are not well dressed might not be the best option.",

      "body": "Yes, it matters A LOT, especially if you are in a client-facing role then the way you dress will also tell how the clients will address you. Also, it helps in establishing that you are someone they can trust because you care enough to dress well for your job. But if you are working a job that does not require you to talk to any clients at all, then it's okay if you just wear whatever feels comfortable for you so long as you do not disobey your office's dress code. Luckily, I'm employed in a place wherein people won't care about how you dress so long as you get the job done when they need it.",

      "body": "It has been the norm to wear formal attire when in a job interview.  It is a show of respect to the company to which you are applying.  It also represents your motivation and also a reflection of what person you are.  Being in a poverty isn't an excuse to not wear a neat-looking dress, if not formal attire. At the end of it all, a person needs to be presentable.  I do agree with you on number 3.  Adjust clothing according to the atmospheric condition, a semi-formal would be better for that event.  Slacks pants with a collared t-shirt tucked in are way better than a person who is sweating a lot in a three-piece suit.    But a pair of jeans and a t-shirt aren't that presentable especially if the gathering is some how formal.",

At least until you're rich enough that you don't need a job and at that point you can dress whatever you like. That's probably the best policy to go for, although it can really vary between different workplaces - if you walk into a factory or warehouse you might expect to see everyone wearing relatively casual clothing. If you walk into a solicitors office you might be more assured and impressed it they wear a shirt or maybe even a full suit, because it gives the appropriate level of professionalism when it comes to handling large sums of money or potential court cases.",

I understand it myself but to seek for job , that kind of job that you have to appear nice you have to try and appear that nice you. Your topic come here also. If you don't appear nice you can be prevented out of the opportunity to get interviewed where you can display the talent or knowledge the employer is looking to see. If you don't get a chance to impress how will they know. It is not a pity situation but to try and get dress well in an interview. In many interviews dressing is part of the interview.",

Some reasons for my decision are:Everything you stated are a bunch of excuses imho, it just doesn’t make sense. We are humans, we can’t see the heart of a person we can only judge by what we see. And the first thing anyone sees is your physical appearance, it is your most powerful tool, your appearance creates the first impression a person has of you even before you speak. This gen z like to think of themselves as being “woke” and challenge the traditional way of doing this, I think it will be impossible to change the dress code of the business world. Appearance does matter. If you’re in the business world, you have to look smart always, it gives investors and colleagues the impression that you can be trusted and that you have a sense of self value. I can’t imagine going for a interview or walking into a room to pitch an idea to potential investors dressed in my pyjamas, none of them is going to trust a guy in PJs with their money. It’s that simple.",

      "body": "It is the proper thing to always dress and appear well irrespective of the environment one works or stays in. Gone are the days where always being formal with a tucked in sleeve in pants and suit or jacket, is norm. These days the T-shirt on jean can be rocked to work or other business engagements or it could be dependent on the sector one works in. One doesn't expect an accountant or a lawyer to be seen in the office always on T-shirt and jean. However, an engineering or logistics business might place no concrete slab over dress code. Appearance matters a lot. It is distinguished from dressing in the sense that an appearance of being neat is a general outlook on dress and body cleanliness. The remote work experience many of us had during the past Covid-19 lockdown, actually revealed that most persons work efficiently in their most comfortable cloths. Don't know how trivial that sounds, but it places more emphasis on work efficiency, skill, general outlook of neatness and dress code as a component of what makes ones appearance matter in business and employment.I consider appearance as a necessary productivity hack in business and employment these days, as it contributes to the trust bond between colleagues, clients or parties involved.",

But at least it has invited everyone to see the product or work that has been packaged well. But I prefer to consider the quality of the contents inside even though the packaging is not very attractive to look at because the outer packaging is the first thing that will be torn and thrown away when someone wants to use the contents inside.
