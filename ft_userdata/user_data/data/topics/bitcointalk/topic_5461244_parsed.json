Thugs will only become more open, desperate and some, may have no choice but to find opportunities like this to set themselves and their family free. If we were in a fair world, each others wealth would be celebrated...but we are not.You'd have have to be an idiot to flash your wealth when majority of social media users, or population for that matter, are living pay check to pay check at best, counting pennies and watching their loved ones do the same, or worse, like lining up at a food bank. People who otherwise would be living normally if the global economy wasn't the way it was.Quote from: pawel7777 on July 27, 2023, 08:50:39 PMHas anyone heard of him? Was he a decent guy, or just another wannabe celebrity?Never heard of him, but the influencer type are usually cocky, narcissistic and not as charitable as they might portray themselves on camera. If he got himself chopped up, he was either stupid, unconscious of his environment, or connected with bad people. I believe that being chopped up and left in a suitcase is a pretty grim way to go, to have that done to you, it's likely you were either a good person that was unfortunately connected to dangerous people or not such a good person and put yourself in harms way by being connected to dangerous people.RIP anyway. No matter the discussion or the circumstance, no one deserves to not only die that way or be left in that state.",

This is not so much for being a crypto millionaire, nor so much perhaps for the lifestyle he showed in social media, because today there are many influencers of that style and they do not end up dismembered, but for getting into messes he should not have. Getting into debt with someone you shouldn't and failing to repay the debt is the most likely cause of that.",

As pointed by someone here, this incident most likely got nothing to do with Bitcoin or crypto for that matter though the man can be holding some. Anyway, it is not a good idea to be flaunting your wealth especially in a country like Argentina but then again being showy is something many people enjoy so it is a choice or a risk one can be making.

The strategy adopted by Satoshi hiding his real identity (anonymous) has indirectly saved his life from the target of people who think Bitcoin is a threat to their business and people who want to take Bitcoin pieces from it.This incident needs to be used as a lesson for anyone who has large amounts of assets stored in crypto. There is no need to advertise too much the amount of assets currently owned on social media, you never know that the many people who follow you on social media have malicious intentions towards you. Vigilance needs to be increased for your safety and also for the assets you have, be wise in using social media, there is no need to show off your wealth in public places because it will threaten your safety.Learn from Satoshi, even though he has more Bitcoins than anyone else in the whole world, people scattered all over the world never know who the real Satoshi Nakamoto is.",

I am not saying this is it, it could be few other things but it's not about living a good life and showing off, the news said it's done by a professional, he must have hurt someone, a killer was sent to get the job done.",

Most people will consider this as another black mark against crypto currencies, because they will not go into details and look for information about this person (analyze lifestyle and ways of earning money) as you did (for which, special thanks to you).\"Missing millionaire crypto influencer found dismembered in suitcase\" - these will be the headlines of the articles, although it is quite possible that he suffered this fate simply for the most ordinary debts (in fiat) and in fact, he had little to do with crypto currencies.",

According to the article, he was also a car salesman and rented out luxury cars that probably brought in more income than trading in cryptocurrencies.To be shot, then chopped up and stuffed into a suitcase is also a telltale that he has made some not so nice people very angry. Perhaps some deals gone wrong with some not so understanding people. Most likely nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.",

Because if you become someone who often shows off, whether it's in the form of showing off your wealth or showing off in other ways. Usually there will always be a handful of people who will definitely not like this action. So as much as possible, we should always be able to stay away from this show off.Moreover, like showing off wealth in the field of crypto investment such as bitcoin, for now it will indeed be more prone to being targeted by a handful of bad people. Because crypto/bitcoin assets are now trending and popular in the world of investment assets. Therefore, the bad guys, became interested in targeting people who own crypto/bitcoin assets.And criminal acts that target crypto users, most of these bad people use the internet system (people who are called hackers). But after learning about this incident, it can be concluded that bad people who target crypto users can commit direct crimes without having to go through the hassle of hacking the target's computer.So in conclusion, we as investors and users of crypto currency. Must be able to be more careful, and must always be able to stay away from showing off or being arrogant. Because we never know, what's in anyone's heart, even the closest people.",
