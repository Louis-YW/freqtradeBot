I have been seeing autoban especially when Lovesmayfamilis reports cheating or plagiarism accounts.Permanent ban: Means the user is banned permanently and not supposed to return to the forum with another account. Though the user can appeal and get lucky in rare cases.Temporary Ban: Means the user is banned for some days, weeks, months, years as the case maybe. The user will return to the forum after serving the ban punishment. Signature Ban: Is allowing the user to use the forum but not using the Signature space.What is AutoBan and how does it differ from Permanent ban?Does it work as the name implies? Which means no moderator bans you. Maybe the ban is triggered automatically by the system codes? If no, why is it called Autoban?",

If it happens that there is no reason behind banning then how can we appeal. If I get the answer to this question, then the newbies will benefit a lot.

Maybe the ban is triggered automatically by the system codes? If no, why is it called Autoban?As far as I know, AutoBan is a permanent ban. The Modlog displays, amongst other things, banned accounts over the last 30 days. The type of bans listed are \"Autoban user\" and \"Nuke user\", both being permanent bans. Nuked also see all their posts deleted, but can only apply (I believe- not sure though) if Activity <30. An account that is Nukable may not be Nuked, but simply Autobanned. Temporary bans are not displayed in the Modlog.As to why the name Autoban itself, it looks as if it originates in Automatic Ban (likely extended to manual ban), but who knows. I can tell you it is not related to a german highway though …Quote from: Dr. Osh on November 14, 2022, 07:01:27 PM<...> Now my question is, if he could not reveal the allegations of theft, why was he banned.<...>Not sure what you mean.

From my standpoint, I think OP actually wants to understand the possibility of one getting auto banned even after complying to certain rules and regulations of the forum. However, as the name sounds, it seems it is more likely human moderation was ignored or warnings ignored that may have been sent, hence the reason for the auto ban of ones account. We usually get message inbox or response for wrong posted threads, out of point posts and other nuisance that can make the moderators of bitcoin dish out warnings before a ban follows. If several of such messages has been sent on more than one occasion without no regards to heed to correction, then the ban follows.",

They're usually not actually automatic.)And here is a description of what kinds of bans are present on the forum and how they differ from each other:Quote from: BadBear on December 02, 2015, 04:45:15 PMThere are 2 types of bans.Autobans. Isn't what it sounds like, it means someone pressed the ban button, but it's automatically carried out, as opposed to be manually entered. Though there is a mod or two running scripts because of the spammers. This results in the message You were banned by a forum moderator, email xxx. Both global mods and admins use this, so it isn't a guarantee it was a moderator, just more likely. I use autoban instead of manual bans for permanent bans because it's faster and more efficient. All bans in the modlog are autobans, and permanent. Autobans ban the account involved only, you can still log in and do everything normally, just can't post or pm. It also adds units of evil to the IPs used, a new account created using these IPs will need to pay a fee. Units of evil increase with additional bans. Nuking is essentially an autoban+deletion of posts.Manual bans are only available to admins, and are generally configured the same way as above, though it's possible to increase the scope of the ban to include things like registering from certain emails/providers, ips, subnets, hostnames, etc. Can also add multiple accounts to the same ban. It's also possible to prevent banned users from logging in at all using the banned account, this will prevent them from being able to read the forum and access pm's too though, so I rarely use it. These result in the customized reason for the ban+duration, insubstantial posts or whatever.",
