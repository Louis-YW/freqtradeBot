I trust that we can all agree that the best way to help those affected by such a tragedy is to donate money directly to reputable organizations, rather than giving it to someone who claims they're collecting donations for the victims. We must be vigilant in protecting the most vulnerable from exploitation by opportunistic individuals who seek to take advantage of the situation for personal gain.",

If we know that Syria has been living in a state of war for 12 years and there are international sanctions imposed on it that prevent it from dealing with such a crisis on its own. I do not exclude the Turkish victims, but I imagine that Turkey is able to contain the crisis with the help of its allies and international friends. Few countries rushed to break the siege on Syria and send aid, but this remains insufficient since some of the areas affected by the earthquake are not under the control of the Syrian regime and are controlled by armed terrorist groups.",

It is not an international. So, they are focusing on people who hurt in Turkey. About 13 million people have been affected in this disaster. Death toll is more than 22.000 people. There are more than 80.000 people injured. There are more than 6000 ruined buildings. 10 cities destroyed by earthquake. Can you imagine that? I don't think Syria's death and losses as much as huge in Turkey. However, rescue of Syrian people is very important. I think, Syrian government and international institutions such as Red Cross and UN should have dealed with disaster in Syria. Turkish people have been struggling with economical crisis an this disaster in the same time. Additionally, about 10 million Syrian people are living in Turkey. Turkey has been providing them social needs since war in Syria. For this reasons, I think, blaming Turkey about ignoring of Syria is not fair. Syria is problem of whole world. Whole world have to share this responsibility.",

Whole world have to share this responsibility. No one in this disaster blames Turkey for what happened in Syria or for not supporting Syria. But I have seen many programs that were launched to help Turkey only, as if Syria is not on the map of events.What I want to say is that Turkey, despite the magnitude of the disaster, is able to stand firm with the help of its international friends and partners, while Syria suffers from international sanctions imposed on it that prevent it from even obtaining adequate aid.Two days ago, the United Nations envoy visited Syria to examine the crisis, but no draft resolution has yet been issued to mitigate the horror of the Syrians' tragedy, especially as the region awaits a severe cold wave during the next few days.",

The situation in Syria, despite the devastation, is less severe than that of Turkey.It is more unfortunate that political considerations are more important than humanitarian considerations. An international decision must be issued to nullify all international sanctions against any country in the event of a natural disaster or epidemic.
