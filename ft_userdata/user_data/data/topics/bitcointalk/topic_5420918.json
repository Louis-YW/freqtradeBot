Only what password can do is to access the wallet you created on a device, the password remain to that wallet on the device. If the wallet is deleted or the device is changed, you will set a new password and the old password becomes useless when importing the private key. Only private key can be used, that is why you supposed to backup the private key. You can not generate private from password.",

It's not 100% clear what you've done, I will assume you withdrew your coins from MtGox to your wallet and exported the private key.* I remember that certain wallets (Multibit?) were allowing to export the private key password protected. If that's the case you need both the encrypted private key and the password.* A crashed computer has in most cases a recoverable HDD. If that's the case you may be able to recover the wallet file. That may also be password protected.However, recovering the private key from a password is most probably impossible. The only case it would be possible would be that it was a brain wallet built from that password (is that the case? do you remember how you created the wallet, was it you from some words, or it was the wallet software doing it at start?), but if that's the case probably it was already found out and stolen, especially if the password was dictionary word.I think that your best chance may be to get the data recovered from the old HDD.",

If you bought bitcoin and then moved it all to Mt.gox then you should find out about Mt.gox death because it crashed in 2014, they are now announcing they will return bitcoins to that year's victims, you should contact them directly for more details.2. If you bought bitcoins on Mt.gox and transferred them to your personal wallet and you lost your private key. My condolences to you, there will be no way to get your 16500bitcoins back, without any chance unless you're lucky enough to have another copy of your private key, try rummaging through your brain.",

Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 06:45:44 AMI bought 165000 Bitcoin in 2010. I invested it in the mtgox. Did you buy bitcoin somewhere else and sent those coins to Mt.Gox? Or was the purchase completed over the exchange and the coins never left Mt.Gox? What did you invest in Mt.Gox?Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 06:45:44 AMMy computer crashed in 2013. That means nothing if the coins were at an exchange. Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 06:45:44 AMI was not worried as I had my private keys in a safe but my written paper notebook ruined and cannot read my private keys. Private keys of what? Were your coins ever withdrawn from Mt.Gox, and if so, where did you send them? Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 06:45:44 AMI have found my main passwords. Passwords of what?Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 06:45:44 AMPlease help me out to import my Bitcoin address into my new computer. Importing an address won't allow you to spend the coins from it. The transaction needs to be signed, and it gets signed with the private key.Edit: You posted while I was creating this post.Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 01:08:30 PMI saved my private keys in a diary but that diary got damaged. Is the damage to the notebook beyond recovery? Can you read none/some/most of the characters of the private key? Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 01:08:30 PMI have my wallets password of my computer. But my broken computer  was in my family house and mum puts in the computer in  dustbin. I hand no idea that I could have restore the data from the hard drive. I now live in abroad. I don't know how to import my wallet in my new computer. Your mother threw the computer away and you no longer have it. Since there is no computer, there is no wallet or wallet file either. You probably have the decryption password to the wallet file, but without the file it's useless. It would be like if you had a key to a house that got completely destroyed in a fire and doesn't exist anymore. You can't do much with it. Quote from: HokaidoMinamoto on November 14, 2022, 01:08:30 PMAlso I need help to see if I can get some Bitcoin back from the mtgox. I am afraid the coins in your private wallet are lost and are beyond recovery. You might have more luck with the BTC that were left in your Mt.Gox account when the exchange got rekt. But you need to prove the account belongs to you, and I am not sure if you can do that.Here are a few sources, maybe they can help you in the right direction:https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20220706_announcement_en.pdfhttps://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/if-you-lost-bitcoin-in-mt-gox-scandal-there-is-now-a-chance-of-some-recovery/I don't guarantee for the accuracy of the 1st document.

If the computer ended up in the trash together with the hard drive on which the wallet files were located, then you have nothing, and no passwords or anything else will help you. If by any chance you have that hard drive, then you can try to save the data, and whether you want to do it yourself or seek the help of professionals who deal with it is something you have to decide.",

If there was such a program that works, the developers would never upload it, but use it to \"mine\" for Satoshi's wallet's private key.
