Here's one many people don't think about much.DIESELGEDDON – America’s diesel supply on verge of catastrophic collapse, leading to HALTING of food, fertilizer, coal and energyQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-05-11-dieselgeddon-americas-diesel-supply-on-verge-of-catastrophic-collapse.html# In what we are now calling Dieselgeddon, the supply of diesel fuel in the United States is plunging. By the end of May or early June — unless something changes dramatically — diesel fuel will go into extreme scarcity and have to be rationed across America.Because diesel is used by nearly all trains (because they’re “diesel-electric” trains), transport trucks, construction equipment and farming equipment, the crash in diesel availability will sharply affect all the following:    Food availability    Fertilizers for growing food    Coal for powering the electrical grid    Construction projects    Transportation of consumer goods to retail stores    UPS, Fedex, USPS and other package carriersFew people realize how important diesel fuel is to the economy, but they’re about to learn this all-important lesson the hard way: Without diesel fuel, America’s economy ceases to function. Full stop.Without diesel, UPS can’t deliver packages. Amazon.com shuts down. The USPS stops delivering mail.Without diesel, the trains can’t deliver fertilizer to farmers. Food crops don’t get planted or fail to produce sufficient harvests to feed the world.Without diesel, all construction projects stop, meaning roads and bridges are no longer repaired. The highway infrastructure collapses.Without diesel, the United States of America ceases to function.It all begs the question: Why is there a diesel shortage?Mysterious fires and biodiesel conversions of existing refineriesOne reason we don’t have enough diesel being refined in America is because over the last few years, major fuel refineries shut down their diesel operations and began retooling to produce “biodiesel” — a highly inefficient, virtue signaling product that’s actually horrible for the environment and yet depends almost entirely on food production to make the fuel. (It’s incredibly wasteful to grow food and then turn that food into fuel. Just look at corn-derived ethanol fiasco that’s an ecological nightmare…)...",
