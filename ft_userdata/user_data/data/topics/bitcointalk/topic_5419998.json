FTT event has much more serious consequences, last time such consequences were after the collapse of LUNA and its stablecoin UST. So it is not quite correct to compare the hacking of some token by some hacker and the collapse of an entire ecosystem, which has obviously been accumulating these problems for a long time.",

I don’t know what Binance did here after announcing that they will liquidate their holdings and now they are buying the whole project, it looks like a manipulation but we will see. Lucky to those who are able to short with FTT, now let’s see if BNB will pump after this.",

SBF decide to sell FTX to the binance. So, all of what people called FUD was actually the fact that happened with FTX. It was not only FTX but all of projects heavily invested by FTX may be dead too. FTX is known as exchange site that was heavily spreading the money into the various projects. Alameda will got liquidated very soon.   it's down 75% now.",

      "body": "Oh well, I doubt Luna has the same problem. The crypto community is undoubtedly shaken, though, as this is a significant concern. First, because of all the negative news items that happened this past year, many individuals lost faith in cryptocurrencies. Recently, FTX bought the failed cryptocurrency business Voyager but afterward ran into liquidity issues. Second, even if Binance's purchase of FTX is genuinely intended to benefit FTX and its consumers, it appears as though Binance will grow following the transaction. Decentralization seems to have lost its definition in the crypto sphere. What do you believe the dynamic will be now that Binance has purchased FTX, a company that is known as a rival to Binance? I don't want to think about negative things happening, and I'm hoping for the best. But, we can't close our eyes too.",

The solution, Luna, is to create another token. FTT would be another case for sure. FTX has probably helped many crypto ventures. Helping them now is giving it back, and that's where Binance comes in. It's timing alright, but it's necessary for what is happening now.",

FTT has a different situation, but the good thing (I guess) is CZ acquired it. What will happen to FTX? That's the thing that I will wait. I'm not using FTX TBH but seeing a very popular exchange being acquired by another popular exchange is the thing that I didn't see ever.Because of these events, the crypto market lost a huge amount of market cap and most of the top coins (stablecoins excluded) are now down double digit. Bitcoin from around ~$21,000 is now sitting at ~$18,000 and Ethereum is at the ~$1300 price. Good time to buy again . We're given another opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin and other altcoins.",

The case of Ceo FTX and CZ is the same, I don't really care. Because in the end, it will have an impact on the price of crypto in the market. It was evident when the interval of a few tweets BNB increased in an instant. Remember that altcoin price manipulation is real and not just meme coin.
