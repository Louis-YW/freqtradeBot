I also appreciate aspects such as elliptic curve cryptography, encryption, and Monero, though I understand you might not grasp all of this. Therefore, when I refer to Bitcoin, I am encompassing all of these elements.Bitcoin represents a way of life, one that involves enduring ridicule and being labeled as a fool, fraud, or even a drug dealer. Living with Bitcoin is a long-term bet, spanning 5, 10 years, or even more. It means being a holder in the vast expanse of the world, earning respect through your commitment.You must understand that your money is your own, and it matters to no one else—neither to your partner nor to the state. It is hard-earned and well-deserved. Why would you hand over money to the government that cost you so much and so little to them? Why divulge your personal information on Instagram only to be bombarded with advertisements moments later?The world is harsh, and they always come after those who think differently. Never doubt that. Hence, it is crucial to encrypt and protect yourself, minimize your exposure on social media, and find solace in the privacy of the night.I urge you, consider switching to Bitcoin.",

Think about it—many people don’t understand the risks of exposing their personal lives.Yea, it's actually true that one of the key features of Bitcoin to me is it privacy, but that doesn't makes you as a person anonymous, if you really want to stay anonymous it's by reducing and limiting your social media activities and these has nothing to do with being a Bitcoin holder.So in term of improving your privacy and security on the internet it's a personal job you will have to do for yourself, that's why knowledge on how most of these scammers works is very important, because you are definitely going to know what you should under no circumstances share or make public on the internet, so in essence of what am trying to say is that the privacy attached to Bitcoin is mainly about your financial transaction when using Bitcoin, not your personal life, that's your own responsibilities, by limiting and sharing less of your personal information online and offline.",

Not many is the answer:https://x.com/shopinbit/status/1811651225005195471https://x.com/CoinCards/status/1809702144288882870People may not care about privacy, but will choose whatever is more convenient, cheaper and faster - that's why PayPal/Mastercard/VISA are still the king.And they didn't get popular because of HODL narration, people need efficient payment processor.General public does not need another real estate market.Bitcoin is very bad for transacting on regular basis, one of the narrations is that it will become a \"settlement network\" for bigger transactions only but for this privacy is very important and that's why I think Bitcoin will fail at it as well.The only thing going on for Bitcoin is it's name, technically it's inferior to many other projects.If you forget about the name and focus solely on tech, what would you rather use ? slower, more expensive coin_x or faster, cheaper coin_y ?The answer is obvious and we can see it in the retail market.There are people who will still defend it's usefulness but they are just closing their eyes to the competition and are more like a religious cult of \"BITCOIN\" than anything else.This people will have hard time to \"sell\" their narrative to people who need a tool for their everyday life and not just future promises.Regardless, for some Bitcoin may still be a good investment, just like Pokemon cards.",

Did I understand you correctly, OP ?Reading this right now and the fact that, I’ve had to see this liking of Bitcoin to religion by several individuals it makes me to try and see its best fit between culture and religion. Mind you, these are two different things entirely as;Culture talks about the way of life of a people through its social, religious, arts and material expressions of a people. In essence, culture encompass religion while,Religion deals with the belief and worship of a higher being accepted as sovereign over all to put it shortly.Now, if we try to fit Bitcoin in one of these, it’s best fit is culture as money is a cultural heritage of a people. What’s generally accepted by a group. Bitcoin is accepted within a group and so, users having to refer to Bitcoin as religion doesn’t actually fit in.",
