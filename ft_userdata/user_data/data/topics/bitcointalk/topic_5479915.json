Personally I would suggest using a non custodial wallet Since funds are more liquid in exchanges and would encourage you to sell while neglecting your holding strategy. Selling in profits is not all bad but selling Btc in loss? That's a no go for meTrust me been there and it wasn't a proud decision.",

Buy a fixed amount, that you can easily become used to and comfortable DCA-ing. Trying to DCA different amounts based on the price of bitcoins will not be feasible because there are always other needs that demand attention. To DCA, you need to be comfortable doing so, not under any pressure either from internal and external source. Making an attempt to invest based on the price of bitcoins is you generating internal pressure for yourself.",

      "body": "Option 1 is like putting $30 into Bitcoin every day no matter what. It's chill because it spreads out your investment over time, smoothing out the crazy ups and downs. It's an easy way to do it without stressing too much about the daily price swings. Option 2 is a bit more adventurous. You buy more Bitcoin when the price is low and less when it's high, trying to catch those good deals. But it means you got to keep an eye on the daily prices and that can be a bit of time consuming. So, it's all about whether you're up for the laid-back vibe of Option 1 or the rollercoaster ride of Option 2, depending on how much attention you want to give to your Bitcoin moves. Personally, I cant do either. I can only buy bitcoin with my extra money I earned like from leisure. Whenever I have some spare funds, I just toss them into Bitcoin. It's a more laid-back way to ride the Bitcoin wave when you've got some play money to spare.",

Maybe doing weekly or monthly would be more wiser in my opinion. The 2nd option isnt that great cause why you buy based on its range?

Which is better?If you prefer a steady predictable approach go for Option 1 (buying a fixed amount daily). It spreads your investment over time lessening the impact of market ups and downs. If you're comfortable adjusting based on market conditions choose Option 2 (buying at the current price). This lets you capitalize on lower prices and increase your investment during market dips. Consider your comfort with market fluctuations and how actively you want to monitor prices when deciding. Both options require a long term commitment so pick the one that suits your financial status.",

Can invest in Bitcoin? Â If you can afford it you can do it no problem. Â But those who do not have the ability will not be able to fulfill this dream. But if you can do it then I support you.

I wouldn't sacrifice my comfort just to go all in on Bitcoin. BTC still is (and always will be) extremely volatile and betting everything on BTC seems very risky.Good luck with your Bitcoin journey, but we don't need another 1000 forum posts about DCA.",

If the price of Bitcoin decreases, then you can get more Bitcoin for the $50 you purchased. With the $50 you will make a purchase, you are regularly saving money for the long term.",

Investing in Bitcoin on a daily basis will become easier for you if you remove the unnecessary things from your life.Not only you, but all people should think about this and prepare a plan for the future. Both of your options are good, but I prefer the first one because whether bitcoin is going down or up you are buying it on a daily basis with a fixed amount.You may have the advantage that as the price of Bitcoin goes down, you have the opportunity to buy more at a lower price, but currently the price of Bitcoin is quite high.Anyway, I have a suggestion that if the price of bitcoin stays below $50k then you keep buying 30 dollars on a daily basis but if the price of bitcoin increases more then you keep accumulating dollars, and enter the market at any time in case of a dump, because this is a cryptocurrency market, there are constant fluctuations.",
