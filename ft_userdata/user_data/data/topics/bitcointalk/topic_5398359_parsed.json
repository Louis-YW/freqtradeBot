If every hand will be on deck to work with the team in their plan to burn some of the coins and also stake some it will help reduce the circulating supply and that will take out whale from holding a large amount of the coin that could lead to future manipulation of the market. I believe the team is taking the right step at this hard time for the community.",

However, it doesn't mean that the percentage is zero. there is still a chance that Luna can rise up again although may need more time to grow and progress. But, it will happen if:- Developers really focus and are concerned with this condition and make their best progress based on their fundamentals. The community doesn't panic about selling again and again- Stop spreading bad news about Luna again",

It's always wiped out and close to zero from its price so if someone thinks that have lost money on this coin can his/her money can be recovered. Don't expect a lot.What's gone is gone and treat it as a loss that you can learn from. Treat every word the foundation says with a grain of salt and you don't have to put trust and confidence on it at all times.",
