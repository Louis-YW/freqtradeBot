He usually mention that service along with Dave's recovery service to make his post more convincing. I saw this and I wanted to one of his posts he made in Development & Technical Discussion to moderators, but I didn't know what to write as explanation.It does sound like shilling and promoting some unknown websites that allegedly recovers lost bitcoins... but I am not sure if that is just a scam or not.After looking at his short post history I can say that I wouldn't trust his recommendations at all.What I did found is that both websites he mentioned are registered by same person, so that means that it's the same owner.It was private registration done in Tempe, Arizona by organization Domains By Proxy, and they both use DOMAINCONTROL.COM name servers.This is not by accident for sure.QuoteDomain Name: bringbackmycrypto.comRegistry Domain ID: 2626588248_DOMAIN_COM-VRSNRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.comRegistrar URL: https://www.godaddy.comUpdated Date: 2021-07-14T04:19:42ZCreation Date: 2021-07-14T04:19:42ZRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2023-07-14T04:19:42ZRegistrar: GoDaddy.com, LLCQuoteDomain Name: WALLETRECOVERYSERVICES.COMRegistry Domain ID: 1809198204_DOMAIN_COM-VRSNRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.comRegistrar URL: https://www.godaddy.comUpdated Date: 2021-06-19T15:06:09ZCreation Date: 2013-06-18T05:28:46ZRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2022-06-18T05:28:46ZRegistrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC",

And the wallet recovery service recommended by newbie users would be quite dangerous if it's not well-known on the forum. At least I am not gonna trust to such recommendations. Just be careful whether they are scams or not.",

I saw Trustpilot reviews of Wallet Recovery Services, and it's a score of 4.9 from 211 reviewers, which is impressive if the reviews are genuine. Why would someone want to create a new service if the old one is just doing good.",

Poor strategy ðŸ¤£Let's assume they are honest and really working in recovery. My question is will anyone actually trust them? At least if I am in such situation I will not hire anyone online to check my file or data or whatever it is, instead I will go or bring them in person to have the service.",
