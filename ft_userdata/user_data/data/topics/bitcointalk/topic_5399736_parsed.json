  "content": "Eth or tron will be new fed and usdc or usdt will be new currency. Why ?Becouse its much more easiser to control stable coins supply and demand instead of old fed wire system wich will be shout down or closed down probably in few years becouse its old system and new dollar is usdc and usdt.Luna ust was for them just the test drive off course usdc and usdt is protected so nothing happens with them as with luna The stable coins are our new way of banking plus they can freeze if there is too many stable coins out th er e to avoid that just buy the btc.With stable coins they can control better inflation and move faster everything and we all can get richer without doing nothing....if we are open minded to learn.Those who dont get into new system...they not gona be even poor they will be debted becouse prices will sky rocketing and if you dont have good supply of digital money from crypto then you will be victim of the inflation.",
