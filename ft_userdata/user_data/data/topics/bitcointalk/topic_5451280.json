  "content": "This is actually a story. I first learned of Bitcoin in Central Park, NY. Someone approached me and my friends, explaining to us what it was but one of the members in our group dismissed it as a scam and we carried on with our day. This was in 2010. In 2014 a fellow college student sent a message to me and a group of maybe 60 or more people encompassing BTC and its value proposition. While it looked familiar to me I was being studious at the time, trying to simply focus and brushing this message to the side. In 2017 we saw it on the news rise to 1k, then 2, 3, 4, around that time is when I was working in the corporate world in a corner of a large office building surrounded with cubicles. It was at that moment when I saw my computer screen I stood up when you could literally hear a pin drop in the room. It was in the afternoon and nobody was making calls lol. So I rose and spoke aloud very firmly, and with meaning: \"What do you guys think about bitcoin?\" At that moment 15 colleagues in the surrounding area instantly jumped up with excitement! Thats when I knew bitcoin was going to be something. I finally realized that this was something truly special. Ever since then I would consider myself somewhat of a \"Bitcoin Enthusiast\"From then on I went to form a Bitcoin ATM industry focus when I started seeing BTMs (Bitcoin ATMs) pop up at gas stations all over the place and knew they needed an ISP to conduct their business, which is what my company specialized in. Everybody needs internet. I generated most of my business through Bitcoin ATMs and one Gas to Electric Generator Bitcoin Miner operation. Overall this was a very fun experience, I have since moved on to a new endeavor. I am very excited about this one!I hope you enjoyed a little glimpse into my past, I am surely having some fun reminiscing. Everyone should make sure to take a little extra time for themselves to stop and smell the roses. Time flys, and in the famous words of Ferris Bueller \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it\"",

I am expecting at least 5 of my portfolio on the ATH. I won't lie I will also consider some good alts for more profit generation.",

Can't blame you for not catching Bitcoin's vibe back in 2010. It's like telling an '80s kid about the internet - mind-bending now, but back in the day, it was just techno-jargon.As a legit \"Bitcoin Enthusiast\", you're the digital Indiana Jones, exploring the web for riches and action. And don't get me started on the Bitcoin ATM - it's high-stakes Whac-A-Mole with real money on the line. Keep spreading the Bitcoin love, buddy, and tell the world your tale. Who knows, maybe you'll land a TED gig, preaching the power of e-currency and changing the globe, one Satoshi at a time.",

      "body": "The natural progression of most bitcoiners at that time was from skepticism to curiosity, to shock and then awe or enthusiasm. Some would toggle back and forth between curiosity and skepticism as the price rose and fell until it gained some sort of balance in terms of price and adoption.Bitcoin was a bold move by Satoshi, a brilliant one, but also brave cause it challenged the laid down order of the financial system, not everyone could immediately share that daring idea until they saw some sort of physical proof in the form of historical price data.It doesn't matter what price you bought at, what matters is when you actually understood Bitcoin, there were many who found out about Bitcoin as far back as 2010 and bought some but couldn't hold for any significant price profit, cause they did not understand it at the time.",

      "body": "Your story is very interesting as very few people got the chance to know about Bitcoin in 2010's or earlier. If you had not heard your friends opinion that time then you might have made much more than you have made after realizing the potential of Bitcoin in 2017. Many people didn't even heard about Bitcoin before 2014 hype, but after that the adoption rate increased. I congratulate you for finally understanding the true potential of Bitcoin and earning with it.I first came to know about Bitcoin in 2016 from this amazing forum. I was mainly trying to find a way to sell some Udemy accounts that had some premium courses which I enrolled using 100% off coupons, and I was lucky enough that one of my Google searches took me to this forum. After signing up on this forum I learnt initially about Bitcoin and some other altcoins, and my knowledge increased over time. I have learnt a lot from this forum and without it I wouldn't succeed in crypto world.I invested in Bitcoin and other altcoins during 2017 and I have made some profits, but due to market collapse I have lost some of my investments that I put into altcoins. It was around $1000 that I lost because I invested most of it into a low quality altcoin that I thought would go to moon, but it went to the Earth's crust instead. I also invested on some other altcoins and hold them in a exchange. My luck didn't favored me in that choice as well because the exchange went down and I lose almost all the capital that I invested in the altcoins. Initially I turned my capital to $6000 with trading but after those events I lost everything.However, I must say that I was lucky enough because I was in touch with crypto since then and in 2021 I have made my mind and restarted into crypto world. And from that time I have been earning a substantial income through trading and other legitimate ways. I also tried my luck in gambling sites but lost money instead of earning any profits from those sites. I don't know about others but for me trading was a good choice. If someone can master it then the volatility of the market is highly favorable. I won't claim that I'm a master level trader, but so far it has helped me a lot.",

      "body": "Beautiful post; I literally lived your story. In 2017, there was enough information about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to pique some interest in them. Each iron reported a crypt. All these scam projects that called themselves similar to Bitcoin, with bright names ahead of \"gold\", attracted hundreds of investors. But I, unfortunately, did not understand the difference, thinking that all cryptocurrencies are the same, and did not pay much attention to Bitcoin. All the advertising was pouring in the background until, by chance, I came across this forum. Then the information got pointed in the right direction, and realizing that there was nothing significant except for Bitcoin, I became seriously interested in it. But yes, if we talk about when I found out and when I realized that I should take a closer look, almost nine years have passed. Sometimes I really regret that time.",

I definitely have fun writing it down. The progression over the years, the stories, I have become very attentive to bitcoin now, after all thats happened. Glad to have a small blip of fun in a sea full of shit posting as you make it out to be hahaha 😆  I will try to jot down more stuff like this as it comes to mind.",

I admire that you actually acknowledged a few years later that Bitcoin is worth checking out, and you turned a simple idea in the heat of the moment into a job opportunity that will likely last in your entire lifetime, if not for the next few decades at least. Your work is truly admirable and ordinary; a large number of early Bitcoin stories start by mentioning the lost opportunity during the first few years, but yours is sincerely different.Great job once again, keep up the good work and assist Bitcoin broaden its horizons.",

The others don't buy because they're scared of investing. It's not bitcoin's fault people aren't educated and know nothing about finances and how the monetary system works.",
