Will you choose 10 pieces of Waves token over a 0.01 Bitcoin?Let's break it down. 10 pieces of Waves token is only worth $46 whereas the 0.01 Bitcoin is worth $198. Waves has 100 million coins circulating whereas Bitcoin only has 19 million in circulation.In cryptocurrency, you have to understand its circulation and the maximum supply.",

Is this already on the verge of Dropping Deadline??? I believe you are trying to refer to the current bitcoin price drop. It is temporary like any other price change be it bear or bull. Of course bitcoin is easier to buy at the lower price but this should not induce stress in a trader. If you are getting stressed, you need to stop trading for a while. This is the time to buy and getting low prices should not force you to sell - something you need to practice before trading, otherwise you will make the mistake of selling at a loss.Also note that bitcoin has been having ups and downs since its launch. Check older charts and see for yourself. Observe the market for at least a few months before making your first trade.",

Is this already on the verge of Dropping Deadline???Price fluctuations are a reflection of market dynamism. It's not dependent on a single factor or person. The dip you see today in Bitcoin price shouldn't in any way scare you into staying out. You should see it as another golden opportunity to get in cheap. There isn't any deadline.Quote from: Invester on September 04, 2022, 05:22:46 AMWaves has 100 million coins circulating whereas Bitcoin only has 19 million in circulation.In cryptocurrency, you have to understand its circulation and the maximum supply. What you tried to explain here is the Law of Demand and Supply, tilting it to a fact that the higher the supply the lower the price. However, it doesn't always work that way, especially in cryptos. There are tokens with less than 50,000 maximum supply, yet their unit prices aren't even up to $1,000.",

Is this already on the verge of Dropping Deadline???It was really stressful if you will check the chart every day. Tried to skip sometimes and make a habit to think positive despite the downsides that might give you an easy life. You have to be aware of the dump and pump scenario as this is what the market it looks like. Because the more you've got affected by the price changes, the more it gives you stress. If you really trust Bitcoin and your investment, it is certain that you will never feel any worries and distractions.",

Honestly what you see as a \"small amount\" is only because of the high price that Bitcoin has right now, but technically the percentage of profit you get would be the same as any other investor (though the amount wouldn't be since well, the amount invested is directly different). And additionally, dips are opportunities imo, especially for new investors.",

Is this already on the verge of Dropping Deadline???Those who have reasoned by not buying Bitcoin in the past will also make another excuse at this time by saying Bitcoin still has the potential to decline so such a person will never buy Bitcoin ever. So there is no need to see and hear the reasons for such people as long as you yourself still have a strong stance to choose Bitcoin in the current condition. Do every job based on what you have researched and also make sure everything you do is based on the desires of your own heart, not from the minds of others.",

The Bitcoin market is only stressful if you are looking at the short-term to medium-term price fluctuations. If you zoom it out, it isn't really stressful. If you also easily get carried away by the bear season, you might get stressed. So you should be fully aware that any market goes through the usual bear and bull cycles. The bull is for taking profit and the bear for accumulation or stacking more. If you are playing with Bitcoin's volatility, it's also a bit stressful so hodling is generally the better option. And don't worry, there's no deadline here. Just be patient. The market is not for those who are in a hurry.",

Is this already on the verge of Dropping Deadline???It is wrong thinking because people can still buy bitcoins even if they don't have much money to buy 1 bitcoin. They can use the DCA strategy to buy bitcoins. So, for example, they have determined that every month they want to invest in bitcoin and their budget is around $50.They can just buy it and hold it and if they do it for a year, their number of bitcoins will increase, especially when the market is still like this. They will have a chance to collect more bitcoins. It depends on how the strategy you will use in investing in bitcoin.",

Besides, it is not necessary to buy the whole 1 Bitcoin instantly, we can start accumulatingin a small amount instead. I'd never see it as an excuse but I rather think that these people really don't want to take risks and are still doubtful about Bitcoin.

Anyone who is interested in bitcoin for the first time and is determined to buy it in earnest, and doesn't talk about it in vain, buys as soon as he has such a financial opportunity. Such a bitcoiner will not wait for the right moment and a low price. Whole btc is not important to him and he will buy as much as he has enough money for. At least a whole bitcoin, at least a part. A stressful crypto market will not be an excuse for them to be inactive and will not stop them from pursuing their plans.",

Bitcoin market condition is driven by the force of demand and supply and as a chain whatever market conditions we see are a reflection of the direction of the demand of the asset. Am very optimistic about the future of Bitcoin even though some people may feel that Bitcoin is failing on its promises of given x price this year but that was based on speculation which is sometimes wrong, the reality is different at this point since we are at a phase in Bitcoin market that gives many the chance to get in at a low price which is the best time to buy more Bitcoin. The cryptic market may look stressful to those who want quick gains but the long-term holders already have a settled mindset toward Bitcoin and they are ready to wait till their investment is mature enough before they take out the profits.",
