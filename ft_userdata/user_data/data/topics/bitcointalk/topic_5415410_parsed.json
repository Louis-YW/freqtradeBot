  "content": "Part 1: The brief intro of Dmail or some news of projectAs a new generation decentralized mailbox, Dmail has become a leader and pioneer in exploring web3 mail services. Since its launch in June 2022, the number of emails sending and receiving via the Dmail platform has exceeded 1 million, and the number of community members also has continued to grow. Dmail is now becoming a linkage for web2 users to experience convenient information interaction in the web3 era. At the same time, Dmail, which was originally built on the Internet Computer, is trying to bridge the gap between different chains. In addition, to support MetaMask(Ethereum) login earlier this year, in August, Dmail also supported BNB Chain login and BUSD payment, making it a step closer to a multi-chain ecosystem! Now we are working on KCC, Aptos, Polygon, Sui and etc. And Dmail has raised a seed&strategic funding from Amino Capital, Hashkey Capital, Draper Dragon, KuCoin Labs, OIG VC, Spark Digital, Outliers Fund and other 20+ global top VCs. Meanwhile, Dmail is the winner of the 2021 Wanxiang Hackathon. Part 2: What Is Dmail?Dmail is an on-chain Email tool with the function of web3 asset transfer, each Dmail mailbox corresponds to a private “canister”. Dmail guarantees the safety of user information, and forms the fundamental decentralized identity (DID). With Dmail, users can access information, assets and DApps securely and seamlessly. Email is the next generation web3-based collaborative platform that integrates the functions of message communication, asset management, data storage, workspace and etc. Over time, Dmail will become a fundamental infrastructure tool and DID for users to enter the web3 era, and will be a bridge that links web2 users to easily use blockchain services. Part 3:How Does Dmail Work?Based on the unique architecture of the smart contract, all Dmail mailboxes are allocated a batch of private container “Canisters”. With the web3 digital signature system, the user information stored in the Dmail mailbox can be secured and avoided the risk of leakage. Each email sending is equivalent to the interaction of the smart contract, that is, the interaction of the Canisters corresponding to each mailbox. During the interaction process, crypto assets can not only be used as the information in the container to interact and sent with emails; the Principal ID corresponding to the container can also constitute the basic decentralized digital identity (DID), which supports the borderless interaction between users with information and assets by accessing various applications. In the process of implementing email encryption, the following ways: 1.Wallet login to achieve decentralized identity;  2.Distributed nodes and distributed storage based on a consensus algorithm ensure no downtime, ensure service continuity, and user data sovereignty and for-good storage, realizing the real web3;  3.The mail header and the mail body are separated, and the contract is chained and key encrypted to ensure the privacy of user data; 4.The agent robot realizes the bridge and link between web3 and web2; 5.Dual-ID verification is required for the recipient to send and receive for the first time, which solves the problem of spam. Part 4：Dmail’s featureAs a decentralized email application, the email function is the foundation and core of Dmail. Compared with traditional email, Dmail has made some improvements based on the blockchain technology in the standard protocol of email, the NFT account system, and the sending and receiving experience to enhance the user satisfaction and convenience in Web3.0 era.Dmail的邮箱功能提供了传统邮箱收发邮件以及附件的功能，除此之外，Dmail还利用区块链技术开发出发送数字资产的新功能。用户可以通过绑定邮箱NFT账号，而后进行邮件和资产(Token和NFT)的发送。Besides sending and receiving emails and attachments in traditional mailboxes, Dmail also uses blockchain technology to develop new function of digital assets sending. Users can send emails and assets (Tokens and NFTs) by binding their email NFT account.At present, Dmail have realized the information sending and receiving with most Web2 mailbox and all Web3 mailbox. The number of mails sent and received has already exceeded one million since the June-launched of the testnet! In the future, Dmail will continue to provide customer-centered information subscription and enterprise-mailbox service, etc.Decentralized cloud storage functionIn traditional mailbox services, user information is stored in a centralized server, which creates a security dilemma for relevant information storage. Dmail uses distributed storage technology to store emails. In its network, the essential component is called a “container”, which not only functions as a smart contract, but also Dmail’s “container” for storing information.In Dmail's solution, to save the capacity of the network library, A-Z containers are preset according to the number of platform users and the amount of information. Upon user's demand, the email will split the email header and body and hash it into the entire decentralized platform. The email header is on the chain, and the letter body and private key are encrypted and stored in the corresponding “container”. Only Verified sender and recipient can decrypt read by private key. When the current “container” storage capacity is fully occupied, another “container” featuring AA-ZZ will be established again to prepare for the storage needs of platform users when applicable.With the help of blockchain technology, Dmail will provide on-chain storage services for all data, and users can upload private, valuable and long-term storage attachments to cloud storage for calling and querying at any time.Three-pass Protocol Encryption ServiceOn the basis of decentralized storage technology, Dmail mail can achieve three-pass protocol encryption services:Ordinary encryption: The content of the email is non-attached to the chain and in a normal storage;Advanced encryption: Email header is attached to the chain and the main body encryption is stored in distributed storage;Full encryption: The message header and body are both encrypted in distributed storage.In the fully-encrypted email, the user logs in to Dmail through the blockchain wallet (key or mnemonic), when the user edits the content and asset and sends it to the recipient who is also a Web3 user. Only the keys of the recipient and sender written based on the contract can parse the email content, the entire process is executed by the contract, no third party(including Dmail) has the authority to view the email content except the sender and receiver.4. PFP NFT avatar and DID.The mailbox is one of the essential user identities the Internet, In the Web3, the decentralized mailbox can become the decentralized user identity by its specific nature. Dmail is making DID a reality through a variety of efforts.In September 2022, Dmail became the first DApp in the industry to support PFP NFT avatar settings! Users can easily set their favorite NFT avatars on the Dmail platform. The development of the PFP NFT avatar function can increase the personalized user expression promote the digital art, and strengthen the usage scenarios of NFT. More importantly, the NFT avatar function is the premise and foundation of the development of DID. Multiple user information can be attached to the NFT avatar. After combining with the storage, communication and asset management functions of the decentralized mailbox, it demonstrates a greater trend to become the user’s DID information in the web3. In the future, users with PFP NFT avatars can experience many multiple services by the automatic identification of identity rights on the Dmail platform.With the development of public chains, the interaction and connection of various applications deployed in different public chains are limited. Dmail hopes to inter-link a variety of public chains to let more users can experience the convenience of decentralized mailboxes. Dmail will continue to expand outward, linking various public chain networks such as ETH, BSC, Cosmos as well as building a service system suitable for various public chains to meet the needs of users on different chains.At present, Dmail has supported the login of MetaMask and BNB Chain and the payment of BUSD. Dmail is working industriously towards a multi-chain ecosystem.Part 5: Why Dmail?Dmail has significant advantages regarding web3 information development. Compared to the traditional web2 mailbox, Dmail is compatible with the product functions of web2, and the web3 application solves the defects of the old-generation products. At present, Dmail can already complete information interaction with most web2 mailboxes. Due to the involvement of blockchain technology and the application of three encryption levels (normal, advanced and full encryption), Dmail solves the problems of traditional mailbox information leakage, data attribution, and spam letters. Both ordinary C-end users and enterprise customers will not draw major concern about mailbox security. The current development trend of the Internet leading companies reveals that the web3 has become unstoppable trend. To realize web3, DID undoubtedly carried very important functions and user attributes. Dmail is becoming the infrastructure for web3 DID functionality. In the web2 era, the mailbox was already a kind of Internet identity identification; in web3 era, Dmail can still function the mailbox identification features to exist as the DID (decentralized identity) for users. At present, Dmail has launched the PFP NFT avatar setting function, combined with the NFT Domain account that firmly has the potential to act as a DID, which establishes the foundation for Dmail to continue to develop the DID function in the future. In addition, the unique asset management function of the Dmail platform can also help users to realize the accumulation and appreciation of encrypted assets in the web3 era, and adapt to the economic incentive model of the web3 era. In terms of development progress, Dmail is the current mailbox DApp, the product that convene the majority function of web3 in an express development, which leads us to believe that Dmail can lead more users to the web3 era. Part 6:What Dmail Want?The web3 universe is still in a long way and Dmail will continue the function of web2 mailbox, and endow new DID attributes to create an information service platform that serves more users as well as allowing more users to experience the efficiency, convenience and security of the web3 universe. On the basis of the continuous development of web3 and its underlying technology, we hope to open up the indiscriminate transmission of information between traditional mailboxes and blockchain mailboxes with the Dmail mailbox application as the entrance, which will reduce the threshold for users and developers to participate in the encrypted world, and allow users to use the blockchain like you use the internet. Meanwhile, the Dmail can also create a portal for free communication for the development and prevalence of the new generation of Internet web3, and provide more convenient, safe and reliable services for Internet users in the new era, and become the cornerstone product of network applications in the web3.0 era. Part 7:Wrap-up ThoughtsDmail team has just celebrated its first anniversary, during which the vigorous team members experienced exploration and setbacks, and also experienced the honor and pride moment of being recognized. No matter what the situation is, all Dmail team members and the partners of the Dmail team are adhering to the original intention of the pioneers with a mindset of moving forward and great curiosity of  exploring the future for bring building Dmail into a web3-level information service DApp as well as  linking to  web3 for users.",
