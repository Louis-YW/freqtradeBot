At least about 15 years ago I already used to get a reward for placing advertisement in my signature on some forums. It was a time when SEO links were very actual, so many were very motivated in advertising via pass-through links. It was different, because the amount of already left posts mattered and it was less important how active you are at the moment. But well, I was paid for advertisement in my signature. Of course there was no BTC at that moment, so we got the reward in USD and much less than projects pay for it at the moment. But I first found it much earlier than came on bitcointalk.org and even earlier than bitcointalk.org first appeared.",

So millions of athletes worldwide need to contact the person with the rights in order to ask permission or pay fees?

Even 99bitcoins said a similar thing.That's not entirely true, but if you are talking about earning bitcoins through signature campaigns, then yes, Bitcointalk was one of the earliest platforms to introduce them. However, signature campaigns themselves have a history dating back to the early days of online forums.I remember that back in the days when vBulletin was a popular forum software, it also featured signature options. Of course, users weren't earning money from these signatures, but there were campaigns and promotions involving signatures.Quote from: Zoomic on November 02, 2023, 10:33:52 AMThis is nice to know that apart from the Bitcoin - Pizza event, HODL typo error incident, there are other things that emanated from the bitcointalk forum.Yes, not only these terms, but many other significant developments originated on Bitcointalk. For example, Ethereum was first announced on Bitcointalk, and MtGox, one of the earliest bitcoin exchanges, also had its beginnings here. The idea of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and token sales also gained popularity through discussions on BitcointalkQuote from: Zoomic on November 02, 2023, 10:33:52 AMSo, apart from here in bitcointalk, has any other forum or website adopted the signature campaign system of advertisement?Does theymos have a patent for signature campaign such that no other forum can replicate what is happening here without his permission.Seriously? Why would theymos do that? It's important to understand that Bitcoin thrive on decentralization and openness. The beauty of signature campaigns (or it used to be  ) is that it promotes community engagement, spread awareness, and provide opportunities for forum members. Introducing patents and exclusive rights would go against the very principles that Bitcoin stands for. So, no, theymos having a patent for signature campaigns is highly unlikely and would not be in the best interest of the Bitcoin community.",

That's right, but the payment rates depend on average on the market. When is was SEO motivated people could get pass-through links on other sites for several bucks, so the most SEO attractive forums could bring you the same amount maximum. Of course, like LoyceV said, it was not on every forum, many added rel=nofollow tags on signatures, so you could earn on your signature mainly on the forums which wanted more content which would be paid this way. All those forums are dead already because that era of mega popular SEO links is over more than a decade.",

I once joined a local community site that probably used the same CMS as bitcointalk and had a signature feature under posts. However, in my local forum there is no signature campaign so the signature space is usually filled with words of wisdom or promos about products/servicesI assume the emergence of this signature campaign is because the bitcointalk site is a large forum so many companies want to advertise their products here, but because the bitcointalk forum does not provide advertising space, the trick to being able to continue advertising on this forum is to rent signature space from forum members.",
