Bitcoin at $31000 now but Luna at $3.9. if bitcoin decreased to like $27000, this will significantly affect Luna price. This coin is not worth holding during this time until if bear market has ended. If you buy this coin, know that you are gambling.",

I don't know what people think about this and i keep seeing people who feel delusional about this coin in the various telegram trading group. This is so funny to see that and how pathetic these people are. They are keep saying this coin will become big again. Im sure that the price of luna will be even deeper than the current price. The new token will be released everymonth.",

And as much as we feel sorry for those who lost a lot of money here, I don't think they can recover it back by investing on Luna 2.0.so I doubt that even if we are in a bull run, they can regain the trust and reputation. Sure there could be occasional pump, but it will be due to the manipulation behind and not investors putting their money because they believed on the project itself. Those days are gone now and we might say that they will become another shitcoin in the congested altcoin market.",

That's the hard reality that they have to accept and just throw their attention and money somewhere else that's more valuable than of these.",

With Luna Classic, such Moony pump will create so many Luna-Classic-made millionaires and even billionaires. It won't happen and it won't be too easily to get rich like this.With Luna 2.0 (new Luna), people are still fomo about it. However, it takes time for all legal issues to be resolved (if Terra team can resolve it), and fud disappears. It takes time for whales to collect airdropped Luna back. When they finish token re-collection and if Luna won't die in hell, it will shine. I don't expect to see its shine in weeks or a few months. Maybe one year later and if it won't die in mean time.",

But this is going to fail not because the price of Bitcoin is falling or the whole market is in a bear season right now but because it is already a big failure in itself. This is Luna 2.0. This cannot be detached from the original Luna. This is bringing with it all the trauma, distrust, and failure of the first coin. I am not expecting so much from this coin.

If you lose money the first time with Luna, you might not be out of luck because not only you but a lot of investors even Binance, themselves have reported that they have lost huge when investing in Luna. But if you keep losing with Luna 2.0, it's no longer Dokwon's fault but yours. Obviously Luna2.0 is a trap that Dokwon created to deny responsibility as well as continue to rob investors for the second time that anyone can recognize and you have chosen to gamble to find luck but unfortunately luck has not come to you.",

If you buy this coin, know that you are gambling. No surprise with this.What's surprising for me is that, Luna project still have community that is willing to support the project even though their old coin lost a huge amount already and investors lost a huge amount on LUNC (former LUNA).It's understandable if investors will buy this coin for short term profits only but if there is somebody who will try to hold this coin in the long run, I will say that you're stupid enough to be an ignorant one. Ignoring what happened in the past is just stupid for me. Just don't hold this coin for long term FFS. I'm not an investor of LUNA but I feel pity still for those who lost huge amounts of money.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on June 07, 2022, 11:59:16 PMLook what the CEO did to his twitter  What is he hiding from the public?Anybody who is still believing this scammer will be Kwonned once again Hiding something = red flag already and intelligent investors know that. Projects must be transparent at all costs especially in social media. I like the term \"Kwonned\" though . It's another term of getting scammed .",

They need to find something to be used to get out from the market. They are dumping their luna to make sure they will able to recover some amounts of money to their pocket.

Well, maybe this is just an analogy that I made, but personally, I will also do the same thing, which is to try to recover as much of my assets as possible, and look for other more trusted investment places.",

I Luna hype is over and they will need more time to gain again the trust of traders and investors to buy the Luna 2.0. I don't actually expect that they will recover easily after the airdrop because those whales that got back again their extra token will surely exit immediately once the new fork token is listed which really happened on the first week of luna v2 listing.Don't buy this coin unless there's a clear sign that the team has already gained the trust of investors.
