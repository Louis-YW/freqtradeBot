The incident follows a statement made by the Bank of China's Henan office that deposits made by customers are \"investment items\" therefore, they cannot be withdrawn.https://saharareporters.com/2022/07/21/china-deploys-battle-tanks-prevent-people-withdrawing-money-banks-crisisThis is why crypto (Bitcoin) is the only way.

The world needs good governance and freedom from oppressive regimes. Bitcoin can't thrive in countries where the aforementioned variables are lacking. Besides, not everyone will adopt bitcoin. You do have a point. In extreme cases like China, Bitcoin cannot offer a solution, cause it would not be allowed to thrive and citizens would not want to risk their safety using an illegal currency, which many of them cannot purchase due to regulatory bans.But, in a general scope, Bitcoin is an avenue to bypass strich regulations. We saw that in Nigeria, where during protests (2020, in relation to police brutality) donations where sent in through bitcoins after the government clamped down on bank accounts of those involved in the peaceful protest. This has also been replicated in other countries as well.We would never have a utopian society, but having an alternative like Bitcoin is a lifeline.Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 25, 2022, 09:26:30 AMSeveral reports have debunked the viral video of the tanks saying that the video was actually filmed in Rizhao City in Shandong province and that  they believe the activity was a military exercise 1.Could be attempts to cover the situation up to the public eye.

Bitcoin is truly the alternative for those who want to exit the corrupt systems, even if they only make a partial exit (use bitcoin alongside banking system).The central chain of authorities will never want to loose the freedom chains and want full financial authority over the people and bitcoin is the key to open it and that's why they always put up some restrictions and try to create negativity for it among people or fearing them with punishment if they involve in these matters.Bitcoin has provided them with control of your funds in your hands if you can take security responsibility.This case of banking scam is perfect example why we need bitcoin and banking system are not secure way of keeping your funds anymore because they are also like your funds are theirs not yours.Quote from: pooya87 on July 25, 2022, 08:55:02 AMFor example a couple of months ago we saw how the Canadian regime shut down bank accounts of all protesters and anybody who even slightly supported them through social media. Meanwhile bitcoin was not affected and the truckers received donations through bitcoin to help their cause. They completely put restrictions on bank account to block the fund flow of Truckers in the protest but there was huge donation in bitcoin and other cryptos after that they try to send notice and block crypto transactions also but you see it was not helpful to some extent and you can't take funds from people wallets if you are not using their services.Quote from: Davidvictorson on July 25, 2022, 09:26:30 AMI'm sorry but I do not totally agree with the OP's statement that Bitcoin is the only way.

But how do you think world can be free from these oppressive regimes ? The same government and their policies and they are not turning upside down within few years and bitcoin is really good option for people to advance their growth if we see it from different aspects like ;1)Your fiat is subjected to inflation and your dollar bills would be worth nothing in coming years because the government are printing money out of thin air making the existing value down each day.2) Is your funds safe in bank? We have already seen its not So there are many other reasons and from personal approach the adoption will increase day by day and prices will surge and if you can just be part of it.",

And we know that most people are not able or do not want to think too much about such complicated things as the possibility of being their own bank. When I think about how many people have problems with their bank cards, whether they constantly lose them or forget their PIN, imagine what would happen if they tried to use Bitcoin.Because of this, many have accepted the wrong storage method, so they use CEX as storage, which is no different from storing fiat in an ordinary bank. In some countries of the world, certain savings deposits are insured by the state up to a certain amount, so that even if the bank fails, you have a chance to get your money. It's not that some CEXs don't have insurance in case of hacking, but in the event that QuadrigaCX or something similar happens, everything can only become a story for a movie, and clients can hope for some crumbs after years of lawsuits.",

Bitcoin staked in centralized platforms is no Bitcoin at all. +1To summarize it, Bitcoin without responsibility is basically fruitless and counter-productive, i honestly do not think this point can ever be overemphasized, people who use Bitcoin must understand the responsibility that comes with it, you can't choose to be your own bank and not take responsibily to protect your funds and be in complete control. Bitcoin without responsibility isn't freedom at all, if you do not control your funds, then you are not using Bitcoin in the right way, neither are you free from censorship, and we use Bitcoin mainly to evade censorship from government/centralized services. To enjoy Bitcoin perfectly is to take responsibility of your funds.",

Unlike us who are just ordinary people who when we have a small mistake will get a big punishment. that's why centralized systems are some of them unfair and arbitrary. Several other cases, such as the mysterious disappearance of a bank customer's money, also often occur. In my country a few months ago there was a loss of customer money of 1.6 billion Rupiah or around $ 106,000 which according to the bank was withdrawn by the account owner himself, but the account owner did not make a withdrawal, when the account owner asked for cctv recordings the bank did not provide it.IDR 1.6 billion in Lost Account, Customer in Medan Suspected It was withdrawn by Teller, Bank Clarification",

Any coin that has a centralized protocol that will prevent you from spending your coins even with your private keys is just a space away from banks. Let's look at an example:Solana halt their blockchain more than twice now just to reduce the impact of sellers on the market, is that different from what the banks of china are currently doing? This is why Bitcoin is just unique and hence we shouldn't generalise bitcoin and cryptos(altcoins).",
