  "content": "A topic that I answered, which mentioned what to do if you won $50k, it reminded me of the history of the title.The character in this story, far from paying a fine of $500 and leaving his situation for granted or ended, never stopped maintaining that he was not a cheat and went to trial, the cost of that trial was $50,000. He showed that he won because of his exceptional skills at Black Jack.BtW, that the character in question was a quintessential definition of what a Gambler is, he won big money (millions) and him did it the same to lose it but he left an extra to worry about his reputation, Stu Ungar bet on it and won.Also add that this player was recognized for having a fairly high level of intelligence, he was able to predict cards from up to three decks, according to legend, at the end of the 70s he destroyed the casinos playing Black Jack and it is thanks to his skils that the casinos were adding decks, in some Casinos despite it, the entry was prohibited for this player.It's worth the question in hindsight:1.- You accept being told that you cheated, you pay the $500 fine and that's it, life goes on. You know that those who appreciate you know of your virtues, and you do not need to cheat. 2.- You defend your innocence!.Omg! but you know that it has a price of $50,000 that leaves you possibly as the topic I am commenting on... in a change of life.I think I know the average(@) response, but it's good to know what the best opinions are.Also leave you in any case this story of one of the greatest poker players, who did not know how to control his great skills and as a great poker player Mike Sexton said, \"he never understood the importance of winning and ensuring a future*\". More words, less words but something like that he said.Source:Black JackQuoten 1982, Ungar was fined by the New Jersey Gaming Commission for allegedly cheating while playing blackjack. The casino said that Ungar \"capped\" a bet (put extra chips on a winning hand after it was over to be paid out more), and gave him a fine of $500. Ungar vehemently denied the allegation, and said that his card counting skills were so good that he didn't need to cheat. Ungar fought the case in court and won. He avoided the $500 fine, but paid about $50,000 in legal and travel expenses. Ungar stated that he was so exhausted from travel and court proceedings that he was not able to successfully defend his WSOP main event title.https://www.homepokergames.com/ungar.phpQuoteWhen it came down to competition, Stu was a born winner and losing was not one of acceptable scenarios for the young wizard (as he would certainly be called by his peers today). He became famous for his saying Show me a good loser and I'll just show you a loser. L:https://www.documentarytube.com/articles/stu-ungar-story--the-champ-who-was-and-could-have-been (*):I remember Mike Sexton's phrase from a documentary I saw many years ago, I don't remember the name of the documentary but the message of what he meant will stay with me forever.If I remember documentary title, I'll update it.",

I can just play again and let people watch me closely play and win again.$50K is too much to waste but probably for some other people, they'd spend that much to clean his reputation and prove to the world he is not what they say they are.

Good reputation brings out the difference and respect in our lives.If I am not rich and a low class,I will gently pay the fine of $500 dollar,even if I am not allowed to play anymore in the casino,I will go and look for other casinos that haven't known me.",

But only if this event does not leave a stain on personal reputation, which will ruin the rest of your life. It seems to me that it will be necessary to weigh the pros and cons of this decision, which may differ in different situations. As they say, situations are different and there can be no universal answer to everything.$50,000 is a small amount to rehabilitate the reputation, if the reputation in the future will allow you to earn more than this amount spent. Otherwise, it's money down the drain.But in general, a good reputation does not cost any money and is priceless.",

Paying the 500$ fine will make him guilty and probably he will be ban to the rest of the casino since they are all connected on same network. A 50,000$ cost to clean his reputation is acceptable if he really has the talent on card deck prediction since no one will gonna question him anymore if he is winning since he already proved his case to the court. It's really an expensive investment but as we all see now the result, he dominates most of the casino using his talent after he fought in the court which he can't do if he yield and accept that cheatig accusation earlier.",

It's true, when a person doesn't have much money to go to court, the person has to pay the fine, but it's better to stop playing, because if you keep playing, you'll just be labeled a cheater and in all casinos they'll always use the same argument for not you. pay, they will always accuse you of being a cheater. so stop playing forever is the best option",

I don't think spending $50,000 just to prove your innocence will still be worth it. They accused you already so there's no sense defending your side. It will cost you a lot of trouble and money. You don't have to protect your pride and ego that much if you know that you didn't violate anything not unless if you're a well-known person that has a reputation to protect.",
