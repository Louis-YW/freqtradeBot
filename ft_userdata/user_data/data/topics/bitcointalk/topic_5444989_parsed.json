Because sometimea the real team arent really aware of the project posted here or someone just wanted to shill or promote it create one for them. Usually these cases occur that even the team when you asked thm on their official site no idea that they got a forum ann here. Always ask on their official contact before doing any kind of bounty or services for them.",

Maybe, but you also have to check the people behind the project, or even the Bounty Manager that will handle their promotion And with that, there are a lot of projects that really here to scam blatantly, or projects that in the beginning looking for the success itself, however, when it goes South, they suddenly disappear. It has been the case since I join in 2017, and there are a lot of project who turns out to be successful as well but scam investors of their hard earn money even with a great Ann thread in this forum.",

      "body": "The bounty manager should be the one who tightly linked to the project, it does not make sense if the BM are just playing around about creating the campaign. Though, filtering a trustable bounty manager should be the precondition before joining any campaign.Lastly, a project announcement thread on bitcointalk should not be a necessity for a project. It doesn't mean anything about the project's legitimacy, and having an ANN thread does not guarantee the project will responsible for anything. Do also note that certainly the majority of altcoin project that popped out is very likely worthless project, you going to have a hard time finding out which one truly trying to build a solution for some problem.",

If the project has decent reputation and they don't want to distribute the bounty rewards, their reputation will be ruined and they need to choose to distribute the rewards. There are already a lot new project get negative feedback, it's proving have an ANN thread in this forum doesn't guarantee the project is legit.",

There are lots of concept to look out for before promoting or taking up a project for promotion, and for me having an ANN page on the forum is not a pass mark. Instead as a promoter, onus is on you to find out the basic details about the project you are promoting and the bounty manger managing the event. For example, the popular Digitalbits team are very reputable, and popular across Europe; yet they did not reward promoters adequately. So to summarize, theres no right way to avoid such mistake",

I mean if they know about this place, then they would have an ann thread for sure, there is no doubt about that, it is not really that hard to have one and the return is usually pretty good unless you are some small project that nobody heard about.However, lets acknowledge the fact that crypto world is bigger than this forum as well, there are plenty of places that they list, such as twitter or reddit or whatever where they ignore bitcointalk and that is why they may not have any ann thread here as well. This is why I think it is all about if they know about it or not.",

Now i see most of the project has an Announcement thread and if i found out that there is one project that didn't have an Ann thread then i will not going to join them as promoters, there are a lot of legit projects out there why we will waste our time on the project that has no announcement thread, announcement thread is very important we will know the new development of the projects through announcement tread so the project that has no announcement tread is maybe a scam.",

This is why I think it is all about if they know about it or not.Yeah, the crypto world is bigger outside bitcointalk. Most that I'm seeing are in Twitter and they're taking their community from there to their very own Telegram groups and that's the ugly side of it. Because as we know of these Telegram groups, that's the easiest place for scammers to stay. Easy to add new members without their permission and most talks are being done quickly and can alter discussions and change names so fast. But those that acknowledges the forum, they always include the forum with their announcement because of how they respect it and knew that i was started by the OG, satoshi himself.",
