I see you are a newbie, there's no restrictions on who can tag. You can also use this account and tag them, also remember to use your main account and tag them too and allow DT members to rest.",

      "body": "You have created this account just to post like this one? All three posts you made hunting bounty cheaters and alt accounts. Why not write from your main account? After all, you are not fighting against a DT. So, you should not have a fear of anything. You should have the balls to write against bounty spammer if you want to expose cheaters. I guess you have a good-ranked account and you can use that account to post in Timelord2067's dedicated thread for alt accounts instead of creating a new thread every time. BTW, You should know that multiple accounts are allowed and if someone doesn't cheat on any campaigns, there is nothing to do. Next time try to dig out if they have cheated or not.",

You can see that andrew_788 only copied the message to a BM from a previously left post of dwminer1. So he copied also the address dwminer1 uses. andrew_788 posted this address just once and only here. So there's no reason for a DT to react. And as you can see there are many DT members who read all this and didn't react. Because they also understand this and don't jump to conclusions.",
