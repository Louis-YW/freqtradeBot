Since you dont even seem to mine yourself it will basically be solo mining for now. What would be the advantage from using your pool?A 1% fee on PPS+ is surely not sustainable, the amount of BTC reserve you need for that is just insane, even super large pools can't get that to work for them, also the hourly payout isn't very doable IMO.There is really nothing good about a random pool coming out, it doesn't help with decentralization it just ends up going bankrupt, causing small miners to lose money, to run a considerable pool size today you need a lot of money, many of these smaller pools actually are nothing but a relay/proxy that uses other large pools, not to mention names but if you were to dig into it you would see that.",

It is basically always the same. TO me it is already not that far away from a centralization, because if just one big pool will go down we will see basically another big one instantly gain enough hash rate to be close to 40 or even 50% .",
