Shey una dey see this format.Six months? for someone who is leaving office in less than two weeks? no be propaganda be this. I read about the loan move, but the reason for it was not properly communicated to the best of my knowledge. That being said, a $800 million loan for someone who is about to leave office sounds crazy, and I doubt the Senate would approve such a decision. There is often news about the country borrowing money. I've never read anything about them repaying outstanding loans. Enough of Buhari; the country is poised to change governments, and I hope the incoming administration is better than the current one.",

We suppose also think about d way wey our economy nd people go feel if we come carry dis kain debt come put for the next generation head.As for d matter of N5000 wey dem wan give poor pipu every month, we suppose put our mind for ground look market condition to know if d money go fit help people wey need am.

Why him no borrow dat money use am run one project wey go give people job, dat one no dey their dictionary. E no go better for people wey vote this man into power. Bubu just waste 8years of Nigerians time. The man carry us go backwards like 100 steps. Him no go fit boost of one thing wey him do for Nigerians. Na only to dey block boarder him sabi so their cartel men go get free hand they import their own things dey make money when others dey suffer. Who go pay back all this loans, him never fit give account for the previous loans wey him collect and just few days to commot office him dun rush go take another one.

Abi he go go borrow another $800million, and if so, how long will they continue doing so without harming the image of our beloved country Nigeria. Because this matter for sweet me for body if only the news been say Federal govt wan take loan of $800million so as to empower 500 youths in each of the 774 local govt areas for the country with the sum of $1500 (i.e #1.1million) each to carry start better business. Eh for really make sense. Because even if na that $1500 shared to 500 youths in each of the 774 local govt area, I bet you plenty change go still remain inside that $800million (i.e $1500 x 500 x 774 = $580million)",
