Though don't quote me wrongly because all altcoin must not be as same the one invested but lemme just say I ran out of luck whereby the project dumped on me since then I seized to try luck rather than focusing and putting my efforts in bitcoin or even those established altcoin at least the risk will be less knowing too well that those coin can't scam investors or even think of dumping heavily on investors than newly birth project or listed altcoin.",

I am looking for such coins.",

Even BTC was considered a high risk investment at some point but years of existence and continuous price increase have helped to boost people's trust. That being said, one has to understand their risk tolerance level to know where to channel their investment.  There are several new potential projects in Solana blockchain that can do well in the next bull period, and other blockchains as well, it is just for you to know what you are looking for.",

I would prefer new Altcoins which is entering bullrun for the first time.Going for already existing altcoins is not the best option if you really want a huge profit during this bull run because they have reached a certain trading volume that they cannot do at 10x their current price. Therefore, instead of investing in such existing altcoins, it is better to invest in bitcoin to minimize the risk.Taking risks is critical in every investment. If you want to make a lot of money during this bull run, you should invest in new crypto projects with a lot of potential because they can easily make multiple times their initial listing price, but the risk is very high because there is no guarantee that you will make it.",

Some of them could still go for like 20x but if you’re looking for something more like a 1000x then you need to look at new coins that are just entering the market because the riskier they are they some could bring the more profit. But which is that to bring that gain? That’s where the problem lies and you will see people choosing the safer option of bitcoin.",

I would prefer new Altcoins which is entering bullrun for the first time.Probably new if you want maximum profit. They have higher chances of having more room for growth than the already established altcoins that we have after all. Ofc that brings with it its own risks, more likely higher compared to established coins already. I myself would prefer already well known coins instead of others, maybe less-known ones but nonetheless already known compared to new ones.

I would prefer new Altcoins which is entering bullrun for the first time.Established coins.Yes, we've seen the price of altcoins pumping during the bull run, but do all of them pump? No. Most of the established coins do. Most of the top 100 coins do. Most of the top 10 coins do. The top coins that you shared already pumped their price during the bull run, and there's a high chance that it might happen again. I'm a conservative type of investor who always prefers investing on some established coins rather than those new projects out there even though time is on my side. I don't want to risk that much money into something that I believe will be a failed one in the future. I'm not saying that all new projects will end up as failed ones, but most of them are (based on history), and there's a chance that I might lose investing in new projects rather than getting profit.Overall, I believe that there will be some who will try and invest into some low market cap altcoins in the bull run in hopes of the getting some huge profits, but not for me.",

The exact proportion of the investment would depend on the individuals and how much risk they want to take. Even among the established altcoins, there are some alts that have had a spectacular rise last two months while some haven't rose as much. Coins like LTC and MATIC are both established, have potential for the future and haven't increased much in the current bull run. Newer ICO coins are also a good choice during the bull run.

I would prefer new Altcoins which is entering bullrun for the first time.In are circumstances we all know that bitcoin is the most volatility among other cryptocurrencies and the investment is something you will invest very large before you can make a reasonable profit, but in terms of volatility and potential bitcoin is there and to regain its stand in the market bitcoin is there, so therefore it's good to invest in bitcoin because its not fall drastically without resurrection or increasing back,so it's the aspect we do encourage people to invest with bitcoin.So in the aspect of altcoins, its very obvious that we take more risk in altcoins because so many of them lacks volatility and also lack potentialities, people who invest with altcoins make sure they targets the market and read the chart of the market very well before investing, because so many altcoins doesn't survive a long run of bearish season while some survive it, so what we should when we want to invest in altcoins is to make a proper research to know the altcoins that will not die off on the process of long term bearish.So it's not all the altcoins that bring up profit but from my perspective it seems that altcoins investment give more profits than bitcoin for the altcoins that have a potential and for altcoins you bought when the price was extremely low, so getting profit for cryptocurrency is something you have to calm down and study the chart to know when the market will yield profit and when it will not yield a profit.",
