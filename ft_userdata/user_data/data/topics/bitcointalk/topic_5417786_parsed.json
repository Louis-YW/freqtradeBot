It will help your casino to convert guests, testers to real users on Neodice.  It'll be great  QuoteIs withdrawal fee static and only will be updated manually by your team?Or withdrawal fee is flexible and updated automatically too? On most platforms, withdrawal fees are fixed and only be updated after a while (maybe months).We are always optimising transaction costs, but at this stage it is not yet an automated process.",

It would be a way to make it difficult to know that the money came from Neodice.I agree with CoinEraser on this point. I don't think mixing implies uniqueness of the casino (*subjectively, it's up to you to decide). Certainly this procedure would increase the commission if we implemented it. It would probably be a nice addition for a small mass of users, but right now we are focusing on more important things.",

It will certainly give the players a more relaxing experience if whether they are winning or losing hehe. Also, because your faucets has been gamefied, it might be good to add some sound effects for them. This will certainly make everyone more interested in playing them.bbc.reporter Your idea sounds great. It's hard to say what percentage of users would prefer to have music on by default. How do we know that players will get a more relaxing experience out of it? Maybe the user will turn down the sound on their device or make it louder?Perhaps it depends on the connection of the user's associations, at first glance the style of the gaming platform should match the music(retrowave, synthwave, etc) and the accompanying mood, but this is more individual than it seems. A good consensus has therefore been to leave the choice up to the players. However, if there is a high demand for it, we will implement it.",

I know these may not be priorities for Neodice, I just would like know.In answer to the first question, I would like to say that at the moment we would like to keep things intriguing. Let it be a surprise. As for the second question, we will stick to this futuristic style for the time being. Perhaps we will think about changing it after some time, when we have stabilised.
