  "content": "Does anyone know of a website or service that offers rentals such as houses, apartments, or rooms, with the rent paid in Bitcoin? Please share resources if you know some. I live in Sweden but work in Denmark, due to the lower sink tax and crypto tax. I have used sites like BoligPortalen, kvikbolig.dk and uthyrningsportal.se, but they are all more traditional. As Sweden is sweet on startups, maybe such a service/website is available here already? Is it even legal and how can you protect yourself and prove your transfers? Have you seen any such service or infrastructure? If it did exist, would some of you users/holders/miners consider paying for rent or even the utilities in cryptocurrency? Is bitcoin the right currency to use in such a service or are there obviously better ones? Maybe stable coins (less volatility/more open/public / ...)",

Please share resources if you know some.Personally, Im not really sure but if you can specify your country's name, maybe someone could help you.Quote from: Sliderman123 on January 11, 2023, 12:35:26 PMIs it even legal Again, it depends on your country, is bitcoin and crypto  legal in your country? You'll get your answer by yourself.Quote from: Sliderman123 on January 11, 2023, 12:35:26 PMIf it did exist, would some of you users/holders/miners consider paying for rent or even the utilities in cryptocurrency? Imo, in most countries ppl have to convert their cryptos to fiat in order to pay for their rents. Due to bitcoin's volatile nature, most ppl (who are unaware of its potential) are afraid to accept payment in btc. But Im always happy to accept/pay in BTC for all the utilities if it is possible.Quote from: Sliderman123 on January 11, 2023, 12:35:26 PMIs bitcoin the right currency to use in such a service or are there obviously better ones? (less volatility/more open/public / ...)Less volatile ? You means stables ? But then again theres no point in using usdt, since its riskier than fiat usd. Bitcoin is the safest one.",

(less volatility/more open/public / ...)Be more clear to get better answers, but in short, all you need is to know if the site accepts gift cards and then you can easily buy them, and this is mostly in applications that do not require KYC.If you are ready to do KYC, then you can order a Bitcoin credit card and then top up the balance with bitcoins.You can order from your friend, or ask here if someone will pay for you.Annnnd many other options.Quote from: Sliderman123 on January 11, 2023, 12:35:26 PMIs bitcoin the right currency to use in such a service or are there obviously better ones? (less volatility/more open/public / ...)The answer varies according to the country, taxes, and the store's need for liquidity. If the store does not intend to sell Bitcoin within the next 10 years, it may be an amazing deal.",

Please share resources if you know some.I don't know any but just tried to help you search it through Google and found this: https://cryptwerk.com/companies/rent/Note: I don't know much about that website but it's the first to appear when I've searched the keywords that I bold in quote.Quote from: Sliderman123 on January 11, 2023, 12:35:26 PMIs it even legal and how can you protect yourself and prove your transfers? Have you seen any such service or infrastructure? It's legal as long as the owner has permits and bitcoin isn't banned in the country where you're about to rent.Quote from: Sliderman123 on January 11, 2023, 12:35:26 PMIf it did exist, would some of you users/holders/miners consider paying for rent or even the utilities in cryptocurrency? At this moment, I'll have to think about it since we are in a bear market but still maybe a few times I might.Quote from: Sliderman123 on January 11, 2023, 12:35:26 PMIs bitcoin the right currency to use in such a service or are there obviously better ones? (less volatility/more open/public / ...)There's the recent interesting acceptance of services that are being done by other forum members and they obviously have that goal of accepting it. So, it depends to the owner of the business or rental property if they like to support and accept it but obviously, the ones that are optimistic about bitcoin will have no doubts on it.",

(less volatility/more open/public / ...)   -  With Bitcoin being 12 years old in this industry do you think it is not a proper currency? Just imagine in a decade and 2 years, that other countries like El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender currency in their territory, and the big companies accepted Bitcoin, do you think it is not the right currency?Now to the question of anyone is doing that with a Landlord who uses Bitcoin as a mode of payment in the rental, my answer to you here is that it depends if the renter is a bitcoin enthusiast and if the tenant is also a crypto enthusiast, it can be said if it is possible to happen, but if this is the policy of the landlord of the apartment, it is possible for him to teach his tenant to have a wallet so that he can pay him with bitcoin from their bank account to the wallet apps.",

If it did exist, would some of you users/holders/miners consider paying for rent or even the utilities in cryptocurrency? Is bitcoin the right currency to use in such a service or are there obviously better ones? (less volatility/more open/public / ...)First of all, bitcoin is a currency and it has value. So if both parties are agreed on bitcoin payment, then for sure there is no issue in doing a transaction in bitcoin.In most countries, including mine, it is not legal to do transactions in bitcoin, so in my case, if i still do transactions in bitcoin and any mishap happens, in terms of house, or apartment ownership, I cannot take my case in a court of law.So you need to consider the legal aspect of this matter also as when the rent is paid in bitcoin, the government may demand taxes on rent received, and then they found that all is being done through bitcoin, so if you are not sure about things, better hire a legal person to guide you.",
