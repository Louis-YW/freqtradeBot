Make I first define dem in simple terms. Forex trading na where dem de sell and buy different fiat currencies for centralized foreign exchange market. While bitcoin and oda cryptocurrency trading na digital currency wey dem de buy and sell for decentralized exchange. So bellow I go list di differences between di two and which I feel says get advantages pass.This one no be true sha.Decentralized exchange is a place where you can buy and sell bitcoin and other coins but that is not the only place to buy bitcoin. You can bitcoin in centralized exchange like Binance, Kucoin and Okex exchanges but there is always requirement for signup and verification of KYC before you can used the exchanges, you can also convert your coins from bitcoin to fiat in centralized exchange using the P2P.Quote2: Liquidity, bitcoin de less liquid because e never de universally accepted for now, and people no fit to easily spend am. Whereas  forex de more easy to liquidate because you fit to easily  convert fiat to another fiat and fit to easily take am make payments.This liquidity self also get as e be.Bitcoin is not like other altcoins that will be hard to spend as they are limited by some exchange. Today, there is no exchange that is crypto base that don't have BTC and if they support the pairs that you need, you just need to sell and convert to whatever you need. If you are expert, Bitcoin is even more friendly to sell under some minutes than Forex that you have to request and probably wait for some hours before you get your cash.Unlike Bitcoin, you are limited to the type of broker to sell. If you have Bitcoin on Binance, you can withdraw it to another exchange to sell but some broker will not allow you move your forex from a broker to another broker.Quote3 Volatility, bitcoin na currency wey de experience highs and lows within a short period of time, so dat one make am to be volatile. Also plenty bitcoin de in di hands of a few individuals wey be whales, and if any of dis big fish come sell dem bitcoin, e go sharply affect di price. While plenty big traders de inside forex, and di volume of trades for forex pairs no de make am  experience volatility like bitcoin.4: Accessibility, you fit trade forex directly or tru a broker. While bitcoin de  less liquid and e require say make you get wallet and exchange account.5: Risk, aside from di risk wey de for bitcoin volatility, if hackers find your access keys, na to clear your coins wey de inside your wallet. Whereas di main risk wey de inside forex na di factors wey de  affect currency pairs, such as di exchange rate wey de differentiate di two currency. I carry small research from did link https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/forex-vs-bitcoin--what-are-the-differences--190321.amp#aoh=16961574448631&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24sAs for di one wey get advantage pass, as e concern to make money between bitcoin trading and forex trading, aldo risk de more for bitcoin, but if person learn di techniques of how to trade am, bitcoin na im sure pass. Because di end wey go justify di means na to make money.Forex na di biggest market wey de for di world and im don already de established, compared to bitcoin wey just de start. I believe say with di fast adoption of bitcoin by individuals and as some governments de also adopt am inside dem currency, im go soon pair with forex. And as di world de became one global village, bitcoin  wey bi digital currency wey no get boundaries go take over. How you see am?I need to combine this together for easy comprehension.Volatility of market depends on how intense the market is, if you can to go google, check for yourself how the oil market crash to negative price during pandemic, it happen less than 24 hours, many market crash including bitcoin market but Bitcoin never went down to zero. The reason why the price of oil crashed was because of the fear in investors, the same applies to the price of bitcoin as well.Bitcoin is not less liquid except say you no get money, you get $1M worth of Bitcoin to sell and e no possible. That forex that you think is liquid, if everyone decide to sell their shares today, it is going to be like there is a world war coming because the damage is going to be bad. When people sell shares, other holders don't panic of fear to sell but bitcoin, people fear what will happen after and that is as a result of trust, stop saying bitcoin is not liquid.Lastly, every business get him risk, you fit try Forex make am or go home and you fit try Bitcoin make am or still hold, depend on the perspective.",

So bellow I go list di differences between di two and which I feel says get advantages pass.To add to wetin Antotena talk, Bitcoin or cryptocurency trading isn't done only on decentralized exchange (although that's the idea advice to avoid been subjected to regulations on centralized exchange like mandatory KYC verifications). Exchanges irrespective of their types are like broker for a cryptocurrency trader, they're the platform which we use for trading our cryptos dem. Centralized exchange oh, Decentralized exchange oh can all be used to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurency available on their platforms. The difference between Forex and Bitcoin trading na the type of currency Involved in both trading because Bitcoin na for cryptocurency and fiats na for fiats currency. As you talk about the risk come dey talk about hacking, forex get more risk because forex uses a centralized system wey be say everyone need to deposit their money into the broker before you fit trade Forex but you can trade Bitcoin directly form your wallet through P2P without standing a risk of hack. But this one no mean say your own wallet no go fit dey compromised but if you take the necessary precautions you no go get that problem.Quote4: Accessibility, you fit trade forex directly or tru a broker. While bitcoin de  less liquid and e require say make you get wallet and exchange account.You dey use only Bitcoin which gives more Pros to Bitcoin trading because Bitcoin can be traded without the need of an exchange or an escrow because you can trade Bitcoin P2P without any third party or platforms and that's the real P2P. That local P2P wey you dey do with vendors without needing an escrow that's the main P2P and you can trade Bitcoin that way or other ways using other decentralized exchange platforms. When it comes to accessibility, Bitcoin trading dey more accessible than forex trading. And for the discussion since no be about cryptocurency but Bitcoin, the main difference between Forex and Bitcoin trading na say Forex trading na the biggest market in th world and has to do with trading different currency but Bitcoin trading na just one cryptocurency trading. When you talk about cryptocurency trading na when you fit compare the two small but forex go still get the upper hands when it comes to volume since the market no start today.",

Bitcoin is very liquid. Even there are many altcoins like ether, bnb etc cetera which has lower marketcap to bitcoin but they are also liquid with high trading volume, not to talk of bitcoin which is have higher trading volume.

Btc fit only dey that volatile from time to time like when major news hit the crypto market like if one whale just decide to dump on the market or buy huge or even begin hype one coin, maybe bitcoin or altcoin. Another time wey btc dey get such volatility na during halving bull. But on a normal, we no fit carry btc volatility compare market wey every country currency dey involved wey dey interchange about 6 trillion dollars on a daily basis. If you look at the volume of pairs like pounds, dollars on daily we dey trade we go know. For example pairs like gold or silver paired with dollar na something wey dey dreaded with volatility and they are traded in the forex. Pairs wey like pounds and dollar too na very volatile fiat.",

Na true say no be for only decentralized exchanges person fit to trade bitcoin, you fit also trade am for centralized exchanges. Only be say na for decentralized exchanges di originality de, dat na why I focus emphasis on di decentralization, say make I talk on where dem no get comparison. As you talk am say centralized exchanges for bitcoin de serve as brokers de serve for forex, so di two get similarities, unto say na third parties dem be for trading matter. But bitcoin in decentralized exchanges de more unique, and direct P2P no de involve anything centralized.Also bitcoin de very accessible in dis regard wey you emphasize, because with direct P2P you don bypass every centralized third party. Aldo im get im own limitations wey be say barrier no de to prevent or reduce the possibilities of scams, meaning say you de on your own if di other person scam you. Unlike using exchanges wey fit to drastically reduce the chances of scams. For di fact say bitcoin give more freedom to operate, and say im no de tied to any particular government because im de decentralized, go make am to be more accessible for trading pass forex wey carry plenty government regulations.",

In fact volatility de synonymous with bitcoin, even as a layman dat time wey i no too sabi di technicalities wey de for bitcoin, I don de hear am. Di sincere advice wey any learned person for bitcoin go give be say di coin de volatile and no be get rich quick syndrome, meaning say risk de involved well well.

But we have to also have it at the back of our mind of the many possibilities that are embedded in the volatilities in the price of assets that are in the Bitcoin categories which makes them the best choice against other stable currencies like the United States dollar.",

It is true that forex close during weekend. It is also true that if you know an indicator, you can use it both for forex and crypto trading, but forex has some differences. A crypto trader do not know anything called pip or lot because crypto trading is just layman calculation if you understand how to calculate. It was easy for me to calculate in crypto trading, but in forex, you will use pip or lot for the calculation which you need to learn. If you want explanation about this, I can recommended EarnOnVictor according to what he has been posting on trading discussion. Maybe he will post something about it here.",
