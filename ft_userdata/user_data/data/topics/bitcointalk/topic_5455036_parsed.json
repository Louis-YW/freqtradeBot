      "body": "Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, Is this casino only available on mobile application by downloading it on playstore and appstore? I don‚Äôt see any registration button on the website as well as the poker room itself to browse the game.The only feature available on the website is the withdrawal and deposit. I‚Äôm confused on how your casino works if the website version is possible. Nevertheless this is like pokerstar application but the only difference is you are accepting Bitcoin as deposit. How many players is your average active daily player?Welcome in the forum!",

I don't know if this others have brought this to your notice.Then lastly, this is a new site launched to this forum and I would want you to run some promotion by launching a signature campaign which would give your project more visibility across the forum, to carry out this action I will suggest to contact @Juler12 ¬†and CryptopreneurBrainboss for effective management and gain the best turnaround for your project.Once again welcome to the forum",

I would even call them experts (compared to me) as they ended up in high places in tournaments. Many of them were even playing in live games (not trough net). I guess crypto attracts certain type of people, who want to make money but enjoy the risk as well or the \"game\" of it.
