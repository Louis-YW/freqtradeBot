Between Palestinians genocide is carried out way before 9/11. It started with 1948 NaKba. Below is article about confessions of Israeli veterans about there role in Palestinians massace in 1948 Nakba. This is not the first and only massace, it continued from time to time till date.https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140217-israeli-army-veterans-admit-role-in-massacres-of-palestinians-in-1948/amp/In 1948, there was no 9/11 then what's the logic of Nakba and innocent Palestinians massacre.",

      "body": "It is interesting how old conflicts like this one we are sadly witnessing today resurge, suddenly people from both sides start to dig as deep as possible so find material which could make their foes look as bad as possible in the eyes of public opinion, in the eyes of all the people around the globe who have a phone or access to internet. It reminds me when Binladen was assassinated by the United States in Pakistan and after Al-Qaeda indeed confirmed his death, a lot of videos and news reports of Muslins around the world started to appear, they said that Osama was not dead and continued to live in each one of them. It is so easy for anyone to share that side of the story, but no one will talk about those muslins who denounced terrorism and did not want their religion to continue to be stained by it.",

This is more like desperate attempts at creating propaganda which is easily debunked only to distract the world from the genocide.Like the recent hostages IDF took from UN and UNRWA but claimed they were Palestinian resistance but the lie was too obvious that it only led to their ridicule. Otherwise it is easy to just google celebration and then claim the people in the picture are celebrating 9/11.Here is Venezuelans celebrating 9/11Do you see how stupid the video in OP is now?!!",

It may not be moral to many for me to do so, but I just canbot handle such stream of bad news coming to me at that pace. However, I admit that when I am interested in getting some updates to what is going on, I am not sure where to look for information and I mostly opt to watch left wing mainstream media, they mostly talk in favor of the cease of the destruction of Gaza and their civilians. Though, I am not sure to what extent the information I get is biased or manipulated, There is no doubt much of it must be. Lately I have seen in Twitter people claiming that those babies which appear in the videos of the aftermath of Israel attacks are not actually small dead bodies but Chinese rubber dolls imported by Hamas to make propaganda in favor of themselves. It sounded so disgusting and unreal but at this point I do not even know who to trust with feeding me with facts...",

Because we can never tell you by watching a video, the whole world is now looking at the internet, and updates are available all the time. I saw in the media a few days ago that the Israelis brutally destroyed a Palestinian hospital, does this ever fall under the laws of war?. There were children, old women men, and many pregnant women who were in the hospital undergoing treatment.

And even when they deny they are purposely trying to destroy and swipe out Gaza our existence. It is quite ironic to be honest, on one hand they say that every accusation is a call for antiseminmtism and in the other hand the IDF spokeperson goes on CNN and admits Israel  bombed a refugee campaign because there was some alledged Hamas members hiding in the camp, of course they did not even confirm the dead of those alledged terrorists, but international media managed to confirm the dead of civilians...",
