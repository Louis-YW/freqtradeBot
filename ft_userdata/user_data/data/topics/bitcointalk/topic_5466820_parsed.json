I suggest 0.1x all sMerits ever exchanged in the WO thread, rounded down to the nearest unit. Then, appropriate sMerits should then go to merit sources, to provide more appropriately. (whether this applies to user profile Merit count is another topic).WO is a thread for price discussion and fun. It's not meant to disrupt merit distribution. A one-time fix should be enough to recirculate merits to more appropriate places. If they recirculate there, then so be it and let it be.This opinion has changed since my post in nutildah's thread. There I basically said anyone can merit whoever they want/as they see fit.

Though after seeing the numbers, I see the problem clearly.Honestly looking at the numbers, they clearly prove that there is no problem. Although individually there is the feeling that many are taking advantage of themselves to obtain merits in the WO, the reality is not quite like that.Looking at the numbers, those who received the most merits in this topic (the top100) are users who do not need to hunt for merits, as they have many merits coming from their excellent collaboration on the forum.I believe that there may be one or two cases of users who obtained some advantage in these merits. But, I don't see it as being something significant that justifies the idea of the problem presented.Anyway, this is my analysis based on the numbers collected.",

WO will not be locked and it will continue under the current rules for a long time to come.I would not be in favour of a two-tier merit display system. If campaign managers will look at the number if merits received by applicants as a condition of acceptance or increased payment, they can discover the source of the merits if it is important to them or their clients. As per the excellent now locked thread where discussion about merits in WO was initiated, various suggestions were put forward. If theymos took steps to either cap/limit merits based on various criteria then on specific threads then that might make a lot of members unhappy because the poll in that thread resulted in 97 votes of which 59 were against disabling merits in WO and only 38 were in favour.
