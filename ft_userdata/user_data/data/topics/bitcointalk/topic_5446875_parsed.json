I can't say I heard about them before but allegedly they have been around since 2017 and are (were) based in the Unites States. If anyone has any money there, you have 30 days to withdraw it says SEC. Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/29/crypto-exchange-beaxy-shut-down-after-sec-lawsuit/Crypto trading platform Beaxy has officially closed its doors as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the company and its founder, Artak Hamazaspyan. with operating an unregistered exchange and brokerage, the agency said Wednesday in a statement.The SEC also accused Beaxy Digital Ltd. of illegally raising $8 million in the offering of an unregistered security with its BXY token. The agency additionally noted Hamazaspyan “misappropriated at least $900,000 for personal use, including gambling.”Windy Inc. took over the platform in 2019 after the founder misappropriated money, according to the SEC, and managers Nicholas Murphy and Randolph Bay Abbott maintained Beaxy for trading crypto assets “that were offered and sold as securities,” the SEC said. So the agency is also accusing them of violating securities law by operating an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing agency, though the platform was described as defunct in another SEC case last year.",

There are so many charges and accusations against this exchange, but the one that gets my attention the most is this:QuoteThe agency additionally noted Hamazaspyan “misappropriated at least $900,000 for personal use, including gambling.”How these owners of centralized exchanges and services gamble with their customers money is so frightening. For people who read all of these news and still use centralized exchanges as their main custody for BTC, i don't know what they are still thinking, is it until someone, possibly one hiding in cayman island gambles away their money that they would learn.",

I even thought this was a promising exchange back then. This exchange was strongly promoted outside of this forum as well. If I'm not mistaken, they even imitated the early strategy of Binance by giving away a Lamborghini. I cannot remember exactly how things have turned awry but it was indeed accused of being a scam. It's surprising they didn't do something with their lack of registration despite them certainly noticing how regulators are tightening their policies on crypto exchanges. It seems they're just sitting by waiting for their time.",

I know some people that lost money in FTX and Celsius and they are still storing large amount of money on Binance so what else to say. At least in Beaxy case people will have time to actually withdraw their money (or at least that's what they say).Quote from: Darker45 on March 31, 2023, 02:42:32 AMIf I'm not mistaken, they even imitated the early strategy of Binance by giving away a Lamborghini.

What I heard is that the new managers of the Beaxy platform are the ones who caused it to be shut down by the SEC because they violated the securities law; in addition to that, the founder of Beaxy is a scammer and has done illegal acts of embezzlement and gambling with users money and the other reason, as explained by @PX-Z, is that Beaxy has worked for years without a license and registration as an exchange or broker. Fortunately, there are 30 days for users to withdraw their funds from this suspended platform. I hope the community does not blindly trust the centralized exchange platforms or the platforms that are somewhat unpopular in the market because they are not devoid of problems and losses.",

Those marketing \"techniques\" are usually reserved for the worst possible ponzi scams. Yeah, they did that. It wasn't the most classy move, of course, but Binance wasn't the first crypto exchange that did that. As a matter of fact, if my memory serves me right, Binance also took that idea from another CEx. I cannot remember which crypto exchange did the same prior to Binance. But I remember reading an interview of CZ around that time attributing that giveaway idea to one of his staff. There was also a time when KuCoin did a Lambo giveaway. Today, where have all the Lambos gone?",

Maybe it was just a stupid marketing gimmick or they just canceled the whole competitions.It wasn't favorable for the small traders anyway, as the winner was going to be picked based on accumulated trading volume. By the time someone can make huge trading volumes, this means they can afford the lambo as well.",
