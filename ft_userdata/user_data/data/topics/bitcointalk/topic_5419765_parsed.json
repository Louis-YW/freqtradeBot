I believe that Fully decentralized casino market are not that steep and that much competitive compared to centralized casino but as we see centralized casino are the go to of gamblers because of promotions and other incentives. Though I believe that there will be a time that decentralized casino will rise and strive as web3 casino becoming more popular. Also, People are just hating KYC and it's obvious that we won't do any KYC on decentralized casino. Well, Goodluck to you and future promotions here in the forum!",

Though i still have some other concerns in terms of legal aspect, and also measures put in place to ensure security of user funds, prove to hacking and also measure put in place to deter bad actors from using the casino as a means through which they carry out their nefarious activities such as money laundering etc. I am not expecting you to address all this right now, it just me thinking out loud, i believe going forward, we will see how things play out and know if those i mentioned above are really concerns that must be addressed or not.For now, i would say Goodluck with the development of this casino, you are creating something that is very different from others, but also prepare good funds for promotions and marketing - just my 2cent.",
