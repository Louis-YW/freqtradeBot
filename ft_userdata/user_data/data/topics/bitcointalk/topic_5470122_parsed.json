  "content": "I joined this forum a few months ago, but I don't know enough about computer-written skills to understand the purposes of most of the written equipment. As a result, I'm still having difficulty posting or making comments in the forum, just like other people.Some of the challenges I face areability to use quotes perfectlyability to quote two users at the same timeability to add images even after being promoted to Jr member of the forum.What helped me was attempting to quote any member's response, which I found both interesting and difficult. Then I began to examine how the response was formed, I kept examining people's posts, and I began to get the function of the majority of the textual instruments given.I'd appreciate it if someone could send me a lesson video or a thread that teaches all of these writing skills in detail, both to relieve my stress and to help my fellow newbies who have yet to master them.Thank you all.",

I will advice you go through the threads shared to you above especially the SMF help section to know what each icon mean. You would get most now but as you grow in the forum so will you get acquainted with some of this features. To add an image is not hard all you need to do is to upload that image into https://talkimg.com/. After uploading then copy the link and come and paste here. You can actually edit the size by adding Quote[url width=size that you want, height=height that you want][/url]Also one thing I do is I intentionally quote some members when I see new arrangements on their post to see the raw form it was before posting. Also one thing is prioritize previewing your post before posting them",

But, when they begin to look around the forum and participate here, they'll get relaxed and learn everyday. The easiest part of the forum is that, it's grouped in categories. Read through those sections and try to research on cryptocurrency terms you've read, but don't understand. There you can find more means of contributing to the forum. By setting up new thread centering on questions or added response on the bitcoin ecosystem. Forum members spend time in providing the best answers that can keep a newbie safe. Talking about writing skills, just get few English guide books and remain active. Practice makes us perfect. Members here due to their steady writing activities have noticed significant improvement in their writing skills. Focus more on books, when searching and reading bitcoin technology. Videos may not explain bitcoin completely well, like the book explains to readers. Videos are distractions.

The new things stated by other members that you learnt, shows how hardworking you're to the society. Sooner or later, you'll be passing across sweet information and knowledge to the coming newbies. Don't wait to be perfect, before creating any thread. Present to the forum, what you've got. And be happy you did it, in future.

Most people find it difficult to do all the aforementioned by you above when they first came into the forum. And till date, some senior ranked members in the forum don‚Äôt know how to use every tool in the forum. If you were a computer literate, studied in-depth in computer science before, this won‚Äôt be a problem since you can easily navigate and tell the function of each.The best way I use to learn is that; I quote the OP to see how the post was written before published. This give me a better insight on how to do something like that when I need to post something related to that in the future. I will just save the link to the post in my notebook for future purpose. I feel that‚Äôs the best way I can learn it faster; paste the work, edit with my informations and then preview before publishing to be sure that I‚Äôve done the right thing.",
