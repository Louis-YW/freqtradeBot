Who could have forced China to use blockchain to record the tracks of their bio labs? Obviously no body. Also I noticed circcash is a dead coin, this wouldn't look good if you want governments to take you serious.",

And why do you cuss so much, that ain't a good move for a universal developer who is ought to save the world from another pandemic by selling a totally and utterly dead/*shitcoin.And you think that US is going to use nukes against China, just like they did last time after covid, right?*= Couldn't resist mentioning the obvious. Imagine Satoshi had a mouth like you, he would be arguing with a nobody like me on a different coin's forum over his dead/ shit coin and his ideas to save the world. Pardon my french!",

I bet that none of you fools will listen to me because you are all a bunch of suicidally stupid (Â  WÂ  AÂ  Â  Â  PÂ  ) idiots who would rather die than listen to someone who is much smarter and better than youÂ  Â  (Â  WÂ  Â  Â AÂ  Â  Â PÂ  Â  )Â  Â  . This means that when the next pandemic comes in a few years, none of the BSL-4 labs will post cryptographic timestamps of anything, and that means that they are free to fudge their data to cover up their crimes, and as a result people will die, and nobody will learn anything from it.I'm afraid this category of monster dildo up on our ass is locked/ inaccessible even for a hard core OnlyFan person like me. [ lol in order of P=7]. You need to pull it out a bit, we're not that kind of a whore.[order of P=7^lol].Jokes and trolling aside, where do you get your meth? I wanna try it, seems to be dope. Nobody is going to listen to your whining about a certain totally dead coin, stop trying to convince people otherwise by rather your extremely offensive wordings. Lol at your use of yandex via Tor browser, it's not like anyone would care if you went there without Tor, only thing they could care about would be their sanity.Damn I haven't been this harsh for a long time, look what you made me to do.ðŸ¤¨",

I have got 1 million and willing to sell for 10,000$, it seems a good deal right?The reason why nobody is going to use your useless coin is because it's useless, even more than shitcoins on yobit and other exchanges. Well I guess this is my cue, I can hear the police car's siren, damn they're so fast, say hi to Macron! Lol.",
