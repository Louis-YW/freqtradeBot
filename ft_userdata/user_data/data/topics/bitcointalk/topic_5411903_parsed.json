  "content": "Besides Casascius, Lealana, and Denarium coins, which other crypto collectibles are the most valuable? I'm talking about physical items like bars, coins, and art. Not NFTs which can magically disappear in an instant. It would be good to have an ordered list from the most expensive crypto collectible to the most affordable one. This would be for anyone's reference in case they want to know if the collectible they're holding is worth some serious cash or all the other way around.Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

      "body": "So, I assume you mean based on personal valuation?If not, obviously some of the earliest or 1st edition coins are probably the most valueable (just talking premiums). Cas, Lealana, BTCCs... Ideally loaded, otherwise they lack an important part of what makes a crypto-collectible exciting (imho).Personally trust and quality and appearance play the most important role to my evaluation.I really like CI coins, clean but strong designs (mostly), affordable, low mintages and a reputation reaching back to 2014.Then some of the Lealanas are just amazing, starting from the 0.1 - 1.0 BTC silver coins (those with gilt look fantastic), but also the XMR set or some of the rare BTC set editions were incredibly artistic in design.And yes, ofc I really like Moonbits, my favourite is probably the 0.005 BTC titan finish chip - the hologram combined with the dark colouring and a decent loading and low mintage make it a perfect collectible in my eyes.",

Historically rare and important coins have been known to fetch multiples of their melt value as high as 30-50x or even higher.
