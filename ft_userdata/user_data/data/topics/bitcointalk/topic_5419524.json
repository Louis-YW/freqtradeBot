  "content": "- Hello guys to my friends here in this forum, I just want to show and share a video clip movie where the scene of this show is where the bitcoin is inserted while the 2 characters in this movie are in the car talking to each other and the radio was turned on for a while and you can hear the announcer say that the price of a bitcoin is about 1.25M$ each. After that, there was nothing, because the theme of the movie was gold mining.He was quite boring when I watched it because I thought the theme was about bitcoin but it wasn't. Now, what I'm wondering is why the price of bitcoin was inserted into the car's radio station when the character opened it? Is it possible that the director or the producer intended for the viewer to hear and see this thing? What do you think?If you think about it and let's look at it, it's a very good feeling and a lot of fun if that's the price of a Bitcoin, that is if you have bitcoin holdings in the long term.Source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR2Yvu6jY5U",

It worth mentioning that the radio scene is around minute 8:152. Bitcoin in movies is nothing new. Most probably that news is meant to emphasize that the action happens in a more or less distant future. Nothing else.",

All I know is that i wouldn't mind hearing numbers like those in a couple of years or so.  @OP I wouldn't put too much thought into it as we are far from early days and a lot of people have been heard about bitcoin already.",

Recently, Bitcoin is considered a digital gold so the movie is directed towards mining Gold and since mining is a term for Bitcoin it's not a bad idea to speculate bitcoin in a smart way like the director did. Saw viral tweets about the movie because of that particular scene. Now, I just viewed the movie through the link you shared. The aim of the director has been achieved and he/she did a great job for promoting Bitcoin and at same promoting the the movie through Bitcoin.",

As mentioned already, it could be a sort of \"click bait\", to help with advertising of the movie, by getting users to share that particular scene and publicize the movie. Movies do this with subtitles and use of certain trending topics to boost the marketing.$1.25 million is a probable amount within the next 5 decades or so, but who would hold that long?",

And I don't think the motivation matters that much.I also don't like these sorts of unrealistic predictions, if you set your expectations too high, you will sooner or later get severely disappointed. People need to be grateful for what they already have, Bitcoin has demonstrated fantastic performance before, even if it stops growing, the people who invested in it before the 2021 bull run have gotten themselves a very sweet deal.",

So I guess it is quiete funny to hear that in this movie that plays in the future.Don’t underestimate Bitcoins my friend. Bitcoins have lot of potential to be honest. Back in 2013, all trolled Bitcoins and gave away on random stuffs. Then when Bitcoins suddenly touched 69k$ mark, all were stunned. Similarly now many people are mocking Bitcoins, once again if Bitcoins touch the pace, then definitely they will cry on their decision. I am pretty sure that the writers of the movie have, done equal research and have put that scene on the movie.",

Everything is possible.Currently most should still be early adopters looking at the end of blockrewards. Bitcoin has seen 3 halvings (2012-2016-2020) and there will be 31(32 not sure right now) more until 2148. In 2040 there will be less like 0.5 BTC as blockreward and in 2068 there will be BTC as currently in a weekly BTC campaign. The currency for the price of $1.25 million is now time. I would like to have a DeLorean and travel to 2148 and see the blockrewards and what happens after that.",

However, this is just a movie, so it's fiction the best and maybe the director or someone involved in the creation of the movie just wanted to insert it, maybe he is a bitcoin enthusiast after all. And it's a win win for them, just like the OP, he was caught with the price being mentioned in the movie and now trying to spread it here in our community. Nevertheless, this is just a mere speculation and again, fiction that we shouldn't take very seriously.",

Let's count, USD money supply is about $21B, so $1.25M*21M is $26.25B, about the same.",
