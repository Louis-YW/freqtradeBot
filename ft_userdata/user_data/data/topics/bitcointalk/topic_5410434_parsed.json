  "content": "This sounds like insanity. But please, bear with me.Here is my pitch: Free electricity for your mining operation and Carbon Credits for 36 monthsAnd my promise: If you join this project as an investor or miner, fame is guaranteed (only if you want, of course)What is it?A pilot project for the reduction of carbon emissions in the Philippines on the island of Mindoro with government backing.Why is the electricity free?Because green energy it is a byproduct of the process.What is the total available capacity?0.5 MW for the pilot projectWhy are you pitching to the crypto community?Because the project cost is 1 million USD. We are inviting up to 40 professional crypto miners who own and operate ASICs to finance the project in return for free electricity for 36 months. Pitching to VCs or lenders is a much longer and more complicated process.Why do you need an investment of 1 million USD?The project is about capturing CO2 in a solid state, removing it from the atmosphere, and storing it in the soil. The investment covers the cost of the facility and the equipment.What are Carbon Credits?Too long to explain here. Google it.What is the plan?The free electricity of 0.5MW can operate around 200 ASICs with 2,300 Watt each. Therefore, we need either one applicant with all the machines or several with a smaller amount.Why not GPUs?Possible, but much more difficult to transport to the site than ASICs.Who can apply?Option one: If you are an investor without your own mining facility, you can participate by investing only. The purchase of mining hardware and the operation would be our part, but you would own the hardware and keep the profits. For the operation, just a small maintenance fee would be applied. Investments are possible in increments of one kilowatt with a fixed amount of 2,000 USD per KW. Option two: You own a minimum of 5 ASIC miners that you can bring to the project site in the Philippines within the coming three months. We need to know what ASCIs you will bring and what their total power consumption in watts is. For each kilowatt of usage, you need to invest $2,000 in fiat currency (USD or Euro), BTC, or ETH. E.g., 10 machines = 23kw = $46,000 investment.How fast do I recover my investment?That depends on your specific miner. We calculate around 150 to 220 days with the current rates and ASICs out there.What is the project duration? How long do I get free electricity?For 36 months. Maybe much longer if the pilot continues to operate after the project is finished.If I bring my miners, who will operate them?In case you bring your own hardware: You will operate and maintain your hardware. Nobody else. We only provide the facility (hall), free electricity, and free fiber optics internet connection.Can I leave whenever I want?Yes, at any time.Can you provide residency in the Philippines if I want to hang around during the project period?There is a possibility. It depends on your nationality. If not, you just renew your tourist visa every few months.Are you sure this is not a scam?I understand everyone who is skeptical. But this is a real project in the context of the UN AGENDA 2030. No fiction and no exaggeration. I will explain everything in detail to serious applicants during a zoom call.How long can I apply?It is quite simple. We offer 0.5MW of free electricity, free internet, and a free facility for a total of 36 months in return for an investment of 1 million USD. As soon as we have reached 0.5MW in ASIC power consumption from one, ten, or one hundred applicants who are committed, the project is closed. This can be tonight, tomorrow, next week, or maybe never.We can discuss general questions publicly in the comments, but if you are a serious applicant for this project, please DM me. Let’s not waste each other’s time.",

Unless you want to publically explain, instead of demanding people DM you, I only see red flags. Actually the very fact that you would rather speak to people privately instead of showing your startup/mining business's authenticity, is a huge red flag.Why should any of us trust you with our money? Do you even have team members? Who are they? Who are you? What can you show us?Until you can bring forth something of substance, I will avoid your project and I would recommend everyone else avoid it as well.Smells scammy.",

But before everything else, I'm a little embarrassed that the government-- if this is true-- is part of a plan trying to attract investors by promising free electricity on an island where a lot of its inhabitants don't have electricity and the rest can only enjoy it for a few hours every day. Good to see that there is, after all, someone who conducts a little bit of research instead of just assuming another scam.Let me address your last concern first:You are on spot. The island of Mindoro happens to be the \"Brown-out capital\" of the Philippines. Up to 12 hours a day without electricity is not uncommon. I live in Mindoro for the last 2 1/2 years. And this is precisely how the project started out. I have developed off-grid solutions based on biomass pyrolysis for the USACE in cooperation with FEMA in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2007 to 2019.While we have focused on the extraction of energy-rich gases (H2, CH4, CO) or \"Syngas\" to run gen-sets, the byproduct \"Biochar\" (a residue of the process that accounts for about 30 percent of the initial feedstock) was useless for us.Well, things have changed significantly during the last few years. Biochar has become an internationally traded commodity with prices reaching up to 2,500 USD per ton. Many producers of Biochar do not even capture most of the produced Syngas or the process heat. For them, the energy is the byproduct, and the revenue is generated exclusively from the Biochar.Additionally, one ton of Biochar can obtain 3 carbon credit certificates (one CC for each ton of CO2 reduction) that can be traded on exchanges like www.ctxglobal.com. CCC’s for biochar trade for around 300 USD each on the exchanges if the right production process is used. So why bother with the few pennies that one can make with the gas? Especially if one lives in a country where electricity is cheap, right?But for us here, living with the constant power outages is extremely frustrating, to say the least. Of course, everyone who can afford it has a solar system and many have small backup generators. But this is not really a solution. The economic loss for the island is estimated at 400 million Pesos per day (around 8 million USD).So, I began to investigate the available options and found, that for this region, biomass pyrolysis is the ideal method of electrical power generation. For the simple reasons that the required feedstock is available in abundance and that the initial investments are moderate.The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) has its own Renewable Energy financing program called FUSED. https://www.dbp.ph/developmental-banking/infrastructure-and-logistics/financing-utilities-for-sustainable-energy-development-fused/ Anyone who is interested might contact Mr. Rustico Noli D. Cruz (Head, Program Development and Management Department) at: mdcruz@dbp.ph, or Mr. Jericho N. Martinez (Program Development and Management Department) at jnmartinez@dbp.ph and ask about the WE initiative in Mindoro.  I and my team have created the complete feasibility study and a presentation that outlines our approach to replacing the current capacity of 80 MW of oil- or gas-fired power plants in Mindoro over a period of 5 to 7 years with modern biomass pyrolysis plants. The project will not only create up to 25,000 jobs on the island in forestry, transportation, agriculture, engineering, etc. and increase its GDP by over 300 million USD through the sale of valuable Biochar, it will also help the Philippines to save 80 USD in foreign reserves annually, become independent from the costly import of fossil fuels, and to transition to a sustainable economy with a carbon negative balance sheet.Alright. So far, I have only scratched the surface. This project has, until now, created several hundred pages of analyses, studies, spreadsheet calculations, and PowerPoint presentations. Will anyone in the Bitcoin forum read any of it? Would anybody be at least remotely interested? What do you think?The DBP will engage in the project after we can present a working pilot project that proves that biomass pyrolysis can be a sustainable form of power generation for Mindoro and for the Philippines as a whole. They are familiar with power generation from biomass combustion, but the 100+ year-old process of biomass pyrolysis is too abstract for the officials. Just showing them countless videos of similar power plants all around the world does not do it for them. They need to see it in action. Alright then.So what are we talking about? Do we need to build a prototype biomass pyrolysis power plant ourselves? No! This is off-the-shelf technology. The complete system is ready to order and can be fully operational within less than four months. It produces 24/7 electricity from the feedstock that we have here in abundance. We have guaranteed prices from Biochar importers in Europe and the USA for up to 10,000 tons annually. Additionally, we will receive carbon credits for every ton of Biochar produced that we will sell.And here is the twist: Even though my initial approach was to develop a solution for the island of Mindoro to generate sustainable electricity, after getting deeper into the subject matter of Biochar and Carbon Credits, I and my team have realized that the electricity that we will produce is actually really just a nice addition.But still, the project hardware and facility need to be financed, right? I had a small GPU mining farm a few years back. It was fun, but at one point, it was just not profitable anymore and I called it quits.And this is how the approach came about. The lenders want to see how we can generate electricity 24/7 from locally available feedstock reliably.Can we talk to commercial banks or maybe the importers of the Biochar to give us the required loan? Sure, but this is a very tedious process where we are talking about collateral, equity, ROI, cash-flow forecast, and much more. So why don’t we just do something crazy?For how long did Bitcoin get bashed for its environmental impact and the massive amounts of CO2 that its transactions produce? Forever!Now imagine a scenario where one, ten, or one hundred bitcoin miners finance a project that produces a commodity (Biochar) that is carbon negative (the CO2 that the plants have captured during their growth phase is solidified, stored in the Biochar, and – when put back into the soil – withdrawn from the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years). Is that a headline? What do you think?Our goal is to get the pilot project up and running as soon as we can. All required preparations are made. The amortization period (1 million USD investment) just from the sale of the Biochar is around maximum 220 days. This means that after this time, all investors got their contributions back. Additionally, the electricity is free for each investor to use it for mining. Meaning that, for example, a miner who invests in a 30 kW share of the available max. 500 kW (0.5MW) and who has 10 machines with around 25 USD daily profit each, generates 55,000 USD in the same time (220 days) that it takes to get his investment back. And as we will make the contract for a total of 36 months of free electricity, the mining revenue could amount to 273,750 USD if the daily rewards would remain constant.So, yes. You do have a valid point in calling me out for not providing sufficient information and using “mere hollow words”. But do you really believe anyone would read through all the information if I would have put it online? This is already the shortest I could do. I have no problem providing very detailed information and making everything completely transparent. But I think that does not necessarily need to happen in a first pitch that only has the purpose to get the attention of the right people.I wonder if anyone reads this reply. Nowadays, most people don’t even finish a headline anymore.Cheers",

We are promoting a technology that can actually transform many developing nations. Not just the Philippines or this particular region. It is a truly sustainable form of power generation. Not just renewable. Why? Because it creates large numbers of good and well-paid jobs for farmers and workers in rural areas. Not everyone wants to be an engineer, a lawyer, or a doctor. Many politicians seem to forget that. The countries that are now buying solar farms or wind parks from large international companies do not realize that they neither hold the patents on the technology nor that it promotes a significant increase in jobs. Too much lobbying, unfortunately.",

On a side note, it seems this forum has somehow developed a 'it's a scam until proven otherwise' approach to most project proposals. I don't know if I need to apologize for that, but for security's sake and with what's going on in the crypto space, you really need to do some convincing. However, QuoteWill anyone in the Bitcoin forum read any of it? Would anybody be at least remotely interested? What do you think?I doubt. But it's probably enough that you've tried.Anyway, you've mentioned that DBP has committed engagement in your project after you've proven by way of a working pilot project that it works in reality. Do you have any proof of this? If this is true, I think you should instead present this proposal to the top energy companies in the country like Aboitiz or Meralco or even San Miguel. Try to ask for an audience with their official representatives and pitch your proposal. For sure, they are knowledgeable enough to look through the details and ask you relevant questions. That would be a lot more productive than convincing anybody in this forum about your project.",

But I'm not an authority to determine whether this is all feasible or not. On a side note, it seems this forum has somehow developed a 'it's a scam until proven otherwise' approach to most project proposals. I don't know if I need to apologize for that, but for security's sake and with what's going on in the crypto space, you really need to do some convincing. However, QuoteWill anyone in the Bitcoin forum read any of it? Would anybody be at least remotely interested? What do you think?I doubt.

Eventually a comment from someone who sounds like an adult.There are many ways to get this thing off the ground. That this forum was the fundamentally wrong approach became apparent to me after the first three hours. No hard feelings.If the project would have been anything else but a way to produce sustainable energy, it would have never crossed my mind to pitch it to the BC community. I got my first coins way back in 2013. I can't remember how many times I had to defend the technology when sitting with hardcore save-the-planet people. If anyone reading this post would truly understand what a slap-in-the-face of all those guys this project could be, I would probably not face the SS that I am facing here.\"Bitcoin Miners jump-start a sustainable energy pilot in rural Asia that will create jobs, reduce carbon emission, and provide green electricity\"Never mind. Actually, I can't really blame anyone here. The whole crypto scene has become such a mess and has caused so much suffering and loss. It's just all a very sad story.I should have pitched it a few years ago. It could have been an amazing marketing push for BC.",

If you believe that you really have something to say, then say it, regardless of the possible outcome. After all, you don't really invest a lot in offering your ideas here. But I agree with your realization that perhaps you've come at a wrong time. And there's no one to blame really. Hundreds, if not thousands, of projects have come by, even raised millions, only to fail in the end. This project of yours could have also made millions during those years when almost all crypto projects sound promising. Now, lessons have been learned. Or so I hope.",
