If you find a price difference of 30% and so on, the best you will get is 1%, which is more like a waste of time or a profit that can be generated through spot trading.",

Back to the initial question, it's not about getting around capital controls but simply the lack of interest from Korean investors to pay that much compared to others, they got burned twice, the FOMO is no longer there, so there is no premium anymore. Add on top of this the constant regulations, the fact that you no longer can withdraw coins to non-verified external wallets and you get the picture.",
