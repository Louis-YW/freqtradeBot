I think your opinion of state approach can workout fine because let alone the federal government to attend to bitcoin matters is currently not their priority neither is it on their  to do list. At state level, the state government which is very much closer to the people can look into such bill and speed up the process through the state house to passing a motion for the bill to be adopted. I was thinking it could be a good target at the university stage because at that age the students would be able to assimilate the bitcoin teachings in a wider spectrum and perspective compared to the secondary and primary students who need not much but the basic foundation of bitcoin and how it works. What is just left is for who to make the move.",

Don't forget that, we are in a third world country, where some informations and innovation are scarce commodity to get, so the general population will only make do with what they have privy to. On like the first world countries that have this innovation like bitcoin at it's door step, so we cannot compare our awesomeness level with them. Just give it some time, bitcoin will penetrate deeply into the fabrics of our Nigerian society.",

Take a look at the number of Nigerians that are in this forum discussing bitcoin today. Even though I know we are not up to 1% of the country's population, you can see that people are still adopting it. However, people complaining about the adoption or not knowing about it is not only happening in Nigeria, as bitcoin is not legal currency in most countries, so any country you go to will encounter this type of case as it’s not the local currency and not everybody will like or be willing to use it.Talking about Nigeria, I have encountered news that Nigeria is among the top countries that use bitcoin and invest in 2023 so far. So I think we are also moving gradually. Adopting the currency in these countries is a gradual process, and you know how governments operate. Everybody is scared because once you take your own money, they will investigate and make a small move. They will say you are not abiding by the country law, so gradually people will get to know no more about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.",

What you said is actually true, I would have put it the way you did. That's just it. But in the aspect of Naira, dollar, and Euro you said was not taught in school that Bitcoin should not be also studied. I disagree with you on that, because Bitcoin is very broad compeard to naira/dollar and euro these currencies are centralized and have nothing to study about. But Bitcoin, blockchain technology or crypto currency is a decentralized system which makes it to be unique and needed to be focused. Crypto currency has come to stay. it's a leading currency in the world which is gradually dominating. No matter how and what people choose to focus among all that you listed above, I still think  Bitcoin is the father of crypto currency. Bitcoin is blockchain technology and also crypto currency because without Bitcoin as a source, I don't think there will be any blockchain tech.",

Why?, Nigeria operates a federation pattern of leadership and not confederation, power is centered on the federal and it distributes resources, as well as competence to the state level. The adjustment of the academic system of any state and inclusion of any subject is a testimony of the approval of the federal government through its minister of education. The state minister is under the federal minister and doesn't have the veto power to implement a subject as controversial as bitcoin study, knowing fully well the stand of the federal government on it. I don't see it happening soon, but I'm quite optimistic and prayerful cos it will be of great benefit to us all if it finally happens.",

Blockchain engineers2. Blockchain analysts 3. Blockchain developers4. Blockchain scientists5 Blockchain security experts and so on and on..If naira is not taught in school as a subject or studied as a course, and if dollar, pounds, euro is also not taught or studied in school, then I don't see why bitcoin should be introduced as a subject to be taught, or as a course to be studied in our schools, what needs to be introduced as a course to be studied in our schools is BLOCKCHAIN -  The technology behind bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. I think I would agree to this point you made. Bitcoin is a Crypto currency and as such is a digital money which I think would be a little bit cumbersome to be implemented as a course study in school and learning about it separately would mean a rivalry against the local currency which the government would never give into. Bitcoin is part of the umbrella body of blockchain which comprises of so many other chain and all of them are under the blockchain technology.As you have said, the blockchain industry has given rise to many study which here we can say is a course that should be taught in the schools because I can firmly call them career path because of the nature of their importance and inputs in  the blockchain technology industry.",
