  "content": "Translated Topic in Pidgin Language: De Crypto Anarchist Manifesto - Make all of us read amOriginal Topic: The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto - We all should read it Author: GazetaBitcoinFollowing de bitmover topic, another okponge article wey we must read na The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto wey Tim May write.De essay first dey public in 1988 (4 years before Eric Hughes' article A Cypherpunk Manifesto) for de Crypto '88 conference and e describe de extraordinary vision Tim May get over some aspect wey come dey real 30 years after.De manuscript explain how technology wey dey center on cryptography and reputation system go change de world as we take know am, including governs, taxes or economic control:\"Computer technology dey on de verge of providing individuals and groups wit de ability to communicate and interact wit each oda in a manner wey dey completely anonymous. Two persons fit exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without dem ever knowing deir true name or de legal identity of each oda. Interactions over network go dey untraceable, by de extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and temper-proof boxes wey come implement cryptographic protocols in a way wey e dey nearly perfect say dem no go fit temper wit am. Reputation go dey very important, asin very important in dealings dan de credit ratings of today. Dis development go change completely de nature of government regulation, de ability to dey tax and control economic interactions, de ability to dey keep information secret, and e go even change nature of trust and reputation\".We go certainly appreciate May's vision in crypto wit Jules Verne's vision for science-fiction.Wit just small words, him talk so many actual technological developments, like smart contracts, Tor, Bitcoin technology or de reputation system (use for example on BitcoinTalk for de Merit and Trust systems).De reference to de \"True Name\" fit dey inspired from Vernor Vinge novel. \"True Names\" (1981), wey be fine piece of art.Him also foresee de appearance of de black market and de governs fight to stop information to dey reach de people.\"De state as usual go try to slow or stop de spread of dis technology, say na national security concerns - de use of de technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and de fear of societal disintegration. Many of de concerns go dey valid, crypto anarchy go allow de trade of national secrets freely and go allow de trade of illegal and stolen materials. Anonymous computer market go even make possible de repugnant markets for assassinations and extortions. Various criminals and foreign elements go be active users of CryptoNet. But e no go stop de spread of crypto anarchy\".De essay end wit \"Arise, you no get anything to loose but your barb wire fence!\" Americans really know de barb wire fence, na part of deir history. Dem be separate de western cities from de cowboys with barb wire, wey want freedom come dey cut de wires. Na de call to fight against de governs corruption and oppression. Against secret agencies effort to shut down information. Make all of us continue Cypherpunk work and dey fight for freedom!",
