  "content": "I’ve been watching many streamers on twitch and youtube for more than a years. I always craved to play gambling everytime I watch them winning huge amount. I find there video streaming very encouraging most of the time because I feel like I can win too everytime they are winning. We all know that Drake is the most famous streamer on this industry but before Drake, There’s a lot pf streamer that is popular on the slot category on twitch. I prepared some data below on how much viewers interested on gambling streams compared to typical online games streams.As you notice in the chart, Slots Channel got more viewers than other famous games such as Fortnite and CS:GO. This starts during pandemic which many streamers shift from online gaming to the onlime gambling category.Many famous Casino is now doing partnership on different streamers. So in conclusion, Streamers contributes a lot on the increase of popularity of online gambling.Chart Source: Twitchtracker.com",

Other than that there are many individual streamers are well who are just gambling for Fun and are actually enjoying the whole system while making some money through views. Anyways with the rise of Gambling ( online) especially during the quarantine this was bound to happen.",

So in conclusion, Streamers contributes a lot on the increase of popularity of online gambling.Chart Source: Twitchtracker.comI don't really trust these stats, especially since I've been browsing the various channels on Twitch lately and noticed that slots are one of the favorite categories of streamers from the \"just chatting\" section. Basically, these are beautiful girls who lead their streams with clear goals (to increase their audience for other social networks, including paid ones, if you know what I mean). One of the easiest ways to create content for them is to play slots, which they do from time to time. I think most of the audience in this case looks not at the slots but at the girl.",

However, other players struggle to complete their goals, but it's great as long as they are having fun.If money is not involved, people that stream for just fun will reduce, even if not to zero, streamers can not just be streaming and devote that much time for nothing in return. Streamers see it as a means to make money, we should not just neglect that fact. Some streams are streaming just for the purpose to get more views and they also earn money in the process, but such streamsers will also still accept offers from casinos and earn more money. Just let us take it like this, what will be the reason why a streamer should not accept such offer when they are even streaming for money.",

They have huge bankroll to bet many times compared to normal players that has limited bankroll.Not all streamers is sponsored because many of them are just streaming for views or referral commission earnings from there viewers.

I think it's something rather natural we'd see, and I think there's still room for growth for it since we'd probably still see development from the streaming industry. Ofc, there's some part that probably wouldn't be accurate, but i think it still speaks of the state that casinos and streaming are in general. Though tbf, rather than slots as a category it's more closer to a chatting stream imo with the reactions every now and then about the results.",
