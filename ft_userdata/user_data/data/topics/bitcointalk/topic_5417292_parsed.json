Electrum still opens in the background but it doesn't respond until the dialog box closes. But when the dialog box closes, so does Electrum. Please has anyone encountered this before.",

If it did, when was the last time and has anything else changed on your system since then?Are you on 4.3.2?What OS / hardware?As others have pointed out it's rare, but also as they said following the instructions and then rebooting the machine can't hurt. -Dave",

If running the clear-cache command doesn't solve the issue then you may need to reinstall the wallet as suggested above but make sure to backup your wallet first. I don't see why this won't work!",
