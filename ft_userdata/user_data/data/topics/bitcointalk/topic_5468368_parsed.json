For this seeding event we are following the same approach we had for Crash and Double.As part of our fairness we generated a chain of 10,000,000 SHA256 hashes where each hash is the hash of the hexadecimal representation of the previous hash. Being the last hash in the chain: 80bea5b63f9afdf51527f58b0467082a6b0dfe7f94c3bf9bb8f03e5e226152f1Script to calculate Crash  point:Code:const { createHmac } = require('crypto');const divisible = (hash, mod) => {  // So ABCDEFGHIJ should be chunked like  AB CDEF GHIJ  let val = 0;  let o = hash.length % 4;  for (let i = o > 0 ? o - 4 : 0; i < hash.length; i += 4) {    val = ((val << 16) + parseInt(hash.substring(i, i + 4), 16)) % mod;  }  return val === 0;};const calculateIfIsBonusRound = (provablyFairHash) => {  return divisible(provablyFairHash, 72);};const calculateCrashPointFromHash = function (hash) {  // In 1 of 15 games the game crashes instantly.  if (divisible(hash, 15)) return 0;  // Use the most significant 52-bit from the hash to calculate the crash point  let h = parseInt(hash.slice(0, 52 / 4), 16);  let e = Math.pow(2, 52);  return (Math.floor((100 * e - h) / (e - h)) / 100).toFixed(2);};// these will be the 10M pre generated rolls to be usedconst hashChain = ['random1', 'random2'];const gameHash = hashChain.pop();// It's the hash we're gonna be using of the result of a yet to be mined block on the blockchain #792,123const blockHash = '';const hash = createHmac('sha256', gameHash).update(blockHash).digest('hex');const crashPoint = calculateCrashPointFromHash(hash);// if it's bonus round you get double payoutconst isBonusRound = calculateIfIsBonusRound(hash);console.log({ crashPoint, isBonusRound });We’re gonna be using a BlockHash that hasn’t been mined at the time of this post, we’re expecting to use Bitcoin block 809,654 this to prove we have no influence over the outcome of the game. Please guys feel free to quote this post so this will be all set in stone.Looking forward to show you guys Crash II very soon!",

      "body": "Great domain name, congratulations. You will need to put more detail into your thread. I recommend:- Creating a thread design with more information about the current and the future.- Adding more details about Crash \"II\" and how it differs from other \"Crash\" games in the board.- Buying a copper membership which lets you post images. I also recommend having the game on blaze.com instead of redirecting to blaze-1.com. It's a little suspicious and blaze.com is a much better domain than blaze-1.com, which seems like a phishing url from face value. If you decide you want to advertise on the forum, you can look in the services board for a campaign manager.",

For this seeding event we are following the same approach we had for Crash and Double.I think it is very bad form to link to http://Blaze.com and not tell the users it redirects to https://blaze-1.com/ - this creates all kinds of negative impressions for the users. How can they know it is not a scam.Also it appears the game is offline / \"experiencing techincal difficulties, so trying it or testing it is impossible.",
