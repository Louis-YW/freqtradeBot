Every successful trader have strategies they are using. But you have to make sure that your strategies are working for you. If not working and see trading not easy, better to move to holding. But all successful traders have trading strategies which are helping them to make profit.",

There's no need to seek validation when your strategy is working so you keep on doing it and try to be productive as much as you can.So, whatever is that personal strategy that you've discovered, you continuously use it repeat if it's profitable and test until it fails then change it if it's only bringing you losses.",

I myself am only copying other people's positions for the most part, but it is always up to me whether I'd stick to it or I'd stop it if I feel that my position isn't the best. Of course, you're not always in the greens all the time so it's best to gauge the market before employing your strategy or other people's strategy.",

You should also monitor the details to justify that it works or else you will just be losing more leaving only with pride about keeping it and using it more. Don't go emotional about your creation. If it doesn't work then trash it, make something new, or rely on others' strategies because some of them do work and were tried and tested already many times. Plus, it saves you some time.",

Because market will likely take all temporary profit away if you can not close your position at right time especially before big movements.Personally, one strategy is considered as good if you obey all your own rules for that strategy, and you have net profit or net loss after more than 3 months. If after 3 months, it is good, you can continue to apply it in next 3 months. If net result after all 6 months is good enough, that strategy is good to use, at least for yourself.Even if it is good, you should never put all capital into one account that is used by one strategy. Trading is risky than investment so you should use very few part of capital for trading.",
