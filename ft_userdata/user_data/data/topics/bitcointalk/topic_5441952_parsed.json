When it comes to trading, without knowledge, your ardor and your ideas are also going to be disappointed.The easiest and most working option, if you are a beginner, should start with Bitcoin. Buy and hold. But if you're hoping to stick to a trade-and-hold strategy with altcoins, then this path will lead you nowhere.Quote from: King GK on March 01, 2023, 09:24:37 PMSince cryptocurrecy is gaining more popularity can you quite your job to bounty hunting or take bounty as a full time job despite the fall in cryptocurrecy Your advice please........And never again believe that you can live completely on the profits from the bounty, these are illusions.",

      "body": "Yes, that's quite similar to what I did when I first started out. Whenever I received an airdrop with an existing value, I immediately sold it for Bitcoin, as most of these airdrop tokens can become worthless over time. After that, I primarily held onto Bitcoin, regardless of its price, unless I urgently needed some money.As for trading, I believe it can only benefit you if you truly understand what you're doing. Trading isn't as simple as buying low and selling high because you're competing with other individuals who may be more intelligent, corporations that have greater access to information they can use to their advantage, people with more experience, connections, or wealth than you.Therefore, you can't just jump into trading right away, especially if you're unsure of the process to become profitable in the long run and make a living out of it. But hey that's just me.",

Holding is an investment whose risk is minimal compared to trading whose risk is higher. If you invest in Bitcoin as an example and hold it for a reasonable length of time, you will highly likely gain something from your investment. All it needs are your patience and the investment should be done at a reasonable price.But you need good expertise in trading to gain from it. You must be speculative, managerial and even lucky to consistently gain through it. The chance of newbies losing all their money in trading is high unlike in holding (investment).",

I do this way to gain more benefits from the values of the coins/tokens. How many times have I heard this question, but now --there is something different with your question. There is a complex one that depends on individual circumstances and risk tolerance for both options, it depends on different strategies that may be suitable for different people. Trading in crypto can be a profitable endeavor, but it requires a significant amount of time and effort to be successful. Traders must have a deep understanding of market trends and be able to quickly adapt to changing market conditions. While holding it can be a more passive approach to investing. This strategy involves purchasing coins with the expectation that their value will increase over time, especially bitcoin not altcoins or those new coming projects like hyping their fancy tokens.",

The two options were good and advisible preference to make, all that is needed is to understand how it's been done, but i will add to this that you shouldn't hodl altcoins for long, they may fail atimes if the oroject does not work as planned considering many of their kinds gone already, if you're to hodl, then focus on bitcoin, kearn about trading as well, it's another fast means of making profitable investment within a short period.",

Both are subject to approximately the same criteria.In a changing world, we will all keep what we choose from reliable stocks or cryptocurrencies forever, but the reality is that very few stocks / cryptocurrencies are worth holding for decades, and experiences also prove to us that fewer investors are smart. enough to enable them to buy the shares of these companies only and ignore others or choose a currency over others.In general, if it becomes clear to you that you were wrong in your analysis from the beginning or that the reason for which you invested in it no longer exists, then perhaps you should not hesitate to abandon the stock / cryptocurrency and end your losses before they worsen.",
