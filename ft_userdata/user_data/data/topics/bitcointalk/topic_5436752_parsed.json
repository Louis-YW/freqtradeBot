  "content": "Every man is meant to have self discipline, because when you have self discipline as a man you will  work towards your goals and definitely achieve them, disciplining yourself as a man also comes down to taking  decisions better for you without the influence of a third-party and then not easy being influenced by things around you.Relating it to business discipline as a business man involves setting business standards and adhering to them,",

Cellular memory is what lets people grow old. Their cells forget how to remember how to operate, thereby becoming old and worn out.Take time to discipline yourself to focus on getting your cells to remember to live. You just might live longer and healthier that way.",

We can develop a skill as an adult, to understand our weakness and strengthen, the temptations of anything bad can be removed. Especially our perception about willpower can hold such a great possession. Knowing that if we fail in something that a backup plan can be made and help you move forward with goals.

Yes bro,  discipline is very essential and once you discipline yourself you will be respected and you will become a man of integrity with a decent reputation. As a man your reputation is more important than any other thing, because when after you are long gone your reputation will pave way for your children and other generations to come..A man without discipline won't have integrity and a better reputation and it might equally affect your children and other generations because a good name is better than riches.",
