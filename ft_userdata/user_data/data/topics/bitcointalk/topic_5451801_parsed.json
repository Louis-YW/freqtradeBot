Do you know what \"blockchain library\" means? I don't get their wallet core product at all. Is it part of their multi-blockchain support capability?

It is understandable though since they got bought by Binance in the end.Slightly off-topic but OP's images are not showing on my end. I guess it is because he's using imgur. OP, you might want to use other providers if you want to show some images in the future since I'm seeing similar things on other threads (as reported by other users).",

Do you know what \"blockchain library\" means? I don't get their wallet core product at all.Suppose Trust Wallet is a car, the Wallet Core library is only an engine. Without chassis, tires, etc. In order to drive it you need to implement and integrate it on your own. In the same way, you can't do anything with only an engine.Electrum wallet, on the other hand, already gives all of the parts so the user only needs to build and then use it. The thing about Trust Wallet, their tires, chassis, and any other parts are unknown besides the engine. So that is why I did not categorize it as open-source software.Quote from: joniboini on May 13, 2023, 01:36:09 AMIs it part of their multi-blockchain support capability? Which other codes are missing from this (apart from the UI for example)?Yes.What the library mainly does are:Quote from: https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/wallet-core/integration-guide/wallet-core-usageWallet management-Creating a new multi-coin wallet-Importing a multi-coin walletAddress derivation (receiving)-Generating the default address for a coin-Generating an address using a custom derivation path (expert)Transaction signing (e.g. for sending)Everything other than that is a closed source.",

Trust wallet has been criticised several times by many people but this 1min read had made me see some reasons with them to go closed. I will research on this more and see if there is a way to vindicate Trust Wallet. It can be closed and still trustworthy",

However, if you're not comfortable with the new update, and the current version is compatible no need to update yet, unless the new update has a warning or new security features, then do the needful and update the app, also, remember to back up your private keys.",

Not sure how close it is with their published app either since we can't verify it. Would be better if they also open up the security part if they really want to improve their security to avoid zero-day bugs being exploited imo.Quote from: rby on May 13, 2023, 10:35:35 PMIt can be closed and still trustworthyI'd not put them as trustworthy as others.

After reading the update documentation, that is another way I verify the authenticity of the update. Since, the developers prefer OTA software update. If I were the developers, I would implement it such that the updates are automatic.Reading reviews will give you clue of the update. I have seen so many times where an update is less preferred to the former version.Quote from: joniboini on May 18, 2023, 02:23:16 AMQuote from: rby on May 13, 2023, 10:35:35 PMIt can be closed and still trustworthyI'd not put them as trustworthy as others.

I will also not chose a closed source wallet over an open source any day.",
