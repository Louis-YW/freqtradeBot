  "content": "FireDAO was launched on the Arbitrum One mainnet on February 17, 2023, which is a social DAO based on PID and FID soul-bound accounts. The team behind this project has been working relentless for two years. The tech team has been funded by the RainbowCity Foundation and dedicated to this project with all talents in their area of expertise. Now the registration has reached over 950 and the number is steadily increasing. https://app.firedao.co  . With more effort and hark work, new implementations will be released soon next week. What do you think of this project ? Will it become a great project that benefits all users ? Please let me know your thoughts.",

Your expectation was too high. It's also pretty much the same like BABT that already used by binance for its users. i see nothin special from the project that you have mentioned above. Can you tell me which thing may be wrong with me?  I would like to call that galxe arbitrum version.",

They have both similarities and differences. It is true that FireDAO has so many features that are not unique to Galxe but the differences are obvious as well. Although both on Arbitrum, Galxe aims to build an open and collaborative credential data network that is accessible to all developers in Web3 while FireDAO is more like a social DAO emphasizing the tokenomics that are accessible to all users. The standard of utilizing on Galxe is higher than that on FireDAO which makes all potential users more available. Speaking of specific features, Galxe might be more advanced because of their abundant resources but FireDAO is optimizing the best use within limited resources now, with a bigger vision of building a more complete and sustainable system. We don't mind what we are called but will focus on what we are doing. Anything helpful is encouraged and welcomed. Please enlighten us if you have more constructive advice.Quote from: Hiveonm on March 05, 2023, 09:57:49 AM\"I haven't heard of this project, nor have I seen any promotion.

Of course, your concerns make sense and I am not saying it is not necessary. The security has been our on priority list since day one and we'll make sure FireDAO is one of the best DAOs in the future.",
