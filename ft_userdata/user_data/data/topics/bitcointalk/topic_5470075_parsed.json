Then you just have to obey all the rules in this forum. By reading the guidelines and rules of this forum. So that you understand what you can do and what you can't do.So for starters I think you should spend more time to read the forum rules slowly. After that, start exploring the boards that interest you. And because this is a bitcoin forum, of course you also have to learn about Bitcoin and crypto. After that, start discussing more actively in this forum. Don't hesitate to ask if there is still something you don't understand. But try not to repeat the same question unless your previous question has not received an answer. The point is, don't spam and don't go off topic.",

I’m just sure that those who are really interested in the forum, crypto, and community life will cope with the first steps on their own, and we see good participants.

I don't see that zeal in you to learn and grow here, if not by now, you should have understand how to go about in this forum. I wouldn't give you any article to read or advise because a lot was given to you in your previous thread, so ho back to that thread and read every article that was provided for you.

This is the way you can learn and grow in the forum. From your post history, you have asked similar question before and the thread has about two pages. I doubt if you went back to the thread to read all you have been told. If you did that, I don't think you will still duplicate such questions. You have to understand that this forum has zero tolerance for spamming. I want to also add that you should avoid plagiarism and the use of bots to make posts. Plagiarism will lead to a permanent ban, therefore ensure you reference the sources of your posts. I hope you will spend time to read the information you will get from this thread.",
