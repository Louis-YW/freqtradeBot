      "body": "Electrum is actually one of the best software wallets, so for online storage it is fair but considering how you’re planning to hold for long then the best advice is to use a cold storage method. Electrum can also be use as an offline wallet if you use an airgap device. Here is a link on how to set up electrum cold storageYou need to be careful when setting this up so you don’t make mistake, if you’re planning to use an old PC then you should remove the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and then reformat the hardware and install a new OS. Or better still get a hardware wallet like passport or Trezor",

      "body": "Electrum is normally used as a hot wallet. In that scenario its security depends on the device it's installed on and how well you protect the recovery phrase and password. For extra security you can purchase a hardware wallet and use Electrum as the interface. A hardware wallet is especially recommended if you hold a large amount of Bitcoin. You could also use multisig or install it on an air-gapped device. If you follow best practices, use common sense, and read the guides in the previous comment you won't really have much reason to worry.",

And from the looks of it, you are doing DCA and accumulating BTC bit by bit. There is no problem with that; just be careful on what price or position you will bring a bitcoin. For example, if you visit a chart for bitcoin, the price drops rapidly and instantly, so that is a good time to bring more bitcoin and wait for the long term. I think this movement is part of the upcoming bull run of bitcoin, and that's a good opportunity to buy BTC. So you better watch out when you are buying your holdings, as of now BTC is doing a lot of market movements.",

One of the most important things an investor can do before investing is to choose a more secure wallet. If the wallet is not secure, no matter how many bitcoins you buy there, there is a high chance that those bitcoins will be lost. Choosing a wallet first before investing is more important and investors who choose a wallet with more security first before investing are very wise.

It would be better if you just copy the seed phrase manually, such as writing it on special paper or something similar and storing it in a safe place. I even tried to remember my wallet seed Phrase. Even though it's easy to remember. But a few weeks later I forgot some of it again. So I prefer the classic method of writing it manually from then on.And my advice is that not many people know that you have a lot of assets in your wallet. Even if it's your best friend. Because I think it's very rare for people to be trusted nowadays.",

Continue the good decision you have started here with Bitcoin in terms of saving through DACA. And as you accumulate, feed yourself to delve deeper into the concept that Bitcoin has and don't stop learning it.And it's also right that you chose to use Electrum because it's one of the main tested software wallets that can hide our bitcoins, as long as you always keep updated on the version that will appear in that wallet.",
