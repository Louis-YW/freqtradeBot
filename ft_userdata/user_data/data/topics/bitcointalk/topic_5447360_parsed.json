Actually 58% of the total burnt is included in the total supply.I previously focused on the question of the \"distributed\" 40% figure which is that 7.5% if ignoring the total burned, it doesn't even represent the remaining 30% of the distribution (assuming this is a developer locked amount). So I assume the distributed total is over $42%.Sorry about the previous calculation.",

Am I right?",

      "body": "^Yes, about the numbers you are right. However, it cannot be confirmed that it was distributed among traders even though official information says so.It's hard to identify the address of ownership, say about my previous assumption of a total 7% being locked up or reserved by the project team because in my mind it's a red flag for the project to let external entities hold the lion's share of the supply.",
