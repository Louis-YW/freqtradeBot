Their Christmas is ruined while the hackers are celebrating theirs in advance.Those who have interacted with NFT Trader platform and have forgotten to revoke access before this incident happened were most likely got drained with those highly valuable NFTs.Web3 still has long ways to go in terms of security. So far it's the most important of all the blockchain trilemmas that needs to be addressed seriously and for years it still has vulnerabilities.This is truly heartbreaking indeed for us to see these highly valuable NFTs being compromised and drained by the hackers.As security measures were in place, it seems that the hackers are just one step ahead countering that roadblock and bypassed it.",

I feel sorry for those folks who have their NFTs as their investment and have gone in an instant because of these hackers. There's no way to take them but will these platforms wherever they will be sold could do the same as what stolen cryptos can, and that's to block the addresses so that they won't be sold and the hackers won't be able to dispose and use them?",

I am also wondering about this, when it comes to NFTs since each token is unique it should be impossible to obscure its tracks and anyone that may want to buy it will know it was stolen and that such token could be tracked back to them, so what kind of value those NFTs could hold? This is different than what we see with regular paintings and other forms of art that are stolen, because even if the art community also knows which pieces have been stolen, a transaction that is completely anonymous can take place and no one will know who has that piece of art on their possession.",

They forget that hot wallets are prone to hacking and big amounts should be kept in cold wallets for long-term hold and security.
