If you are aware of their background OP, you can also tell yourself why? Though Shiba Inu has in good business already but being known as a meme coin, that can be uncertain thinking for a long-term investment. That can't be considered as the potential coin as sooner or later, that can be like other meme coins IMO.",

Why thinking of investing into it? There are many coins out there which are safer to invest with than meme coins. Maybe you can try and buy some DOGE and SHIB because like you said it is down already but for me, meme coins are just for short term profits and not a good long term coin to hold.",

Memecoin are mostly scams and we all knew that what drives the price is basically on hype. So make sure you can risk only money you are allowed to lose and not your hard earned money.",

In this case, we need to analyze whether meme coins will be able to recover quickly when the market turns bullish. But since the bear market is not over yet, the value of these coins will continue to decline.",

If you are expecting them to pump during the same time Bitcoin will then why not just go directly invest with Bitcoin. Security is not an issue with it and so is the trust rating. While these memecoin could just vanish in a blink of an eye. You won't want that feeling of losing just because you made a mistake. Memecoins may be cheap but that's still money you are spending and it's more worth it if placed in the right coin.",

To be honest for me those are just shit-coins. Just look at how the whole meme-coin hype started last year. Elon Musk made a few tweets about Dogecoin and that was it. After that Dogecoin pumped and a lot of people wanted to make some quick and easy money by creating a meme-coin themself. Creating a new ERC-20 or BSC token is really easy and so we had like 100's of new meme-coins appearing each week during the height of the meme-coin hype.99% of those are all dead now again obviously and only a few of them like Shiba-Inu are still there.The longterm trend for meme-coins is downwards in my opinion because they are completely useless.",

I give up trusting these coins, not just because they are shitcoins but it was because earning money from them is even impossible. Just look how Dogecoin changed its price during the bull season, not even it had the chance to surprise us but seem to be manipulated. From that moment, I'd see no fortune for these coins as I'd rather take ETH, or SOL instead.https://medium.com/the-capital/the-potential-future-of-meme-coins-in-2022-b773541debdfCould be realistic or not?",

I just dont believe there is anything that can increase price now. I am not talking about several percent increase, because that can be achieved by whole market mood change, but about doubling investment. I dont believe there is someone who is ready to spend money on meme coins pumps, and there are people left that trust to invest money into memes.",

To answer your question, it is worth looking at how many meme coins exist and how many of them managed to grow enough to bring significant profit. It doesn’t take a big mind to understand that there are hundreds of them, perhaps thousands, but how many of them we know, which are well-known, there are only a few of them. Therefore, this is a lottery with a very small probability of winning. If you are a lucky person and want to try your luck, then you can do it, but do not have high hopes for this investment, it will be like a lottery. Now when the market is in a drawdown, it is better to pay attention to bitcoin, or if you really want to invest in altcoins, then look at the top ones, I think that in the future this will bring more results than buying at random meme coins.",
