Of course, who wouldn't want to cross that trend line and have a break out run again, but with the current sentiments we have, sooner or later something will break about before the end of this month.",

Not sure though how many open call and open put positions are there, perhaps I need to look at deribit. But I would rather say it's better to not anticipated that $29k surge, just saying.",

But I would rather say it's better to not anticipated that $29k surge, just saying.After several occasion of little pumps for sure next to that is dump so I guess this current good trend happening is temporary. But who knows maybe next month if demand will go up we can say the $25k-$30k reached up again.If that price mark reach then maybe we can say that this will be the little indicator that we will have a healthy last quarter of the year and we will might never experience to see bitcoin go down at $15k level.",

      "body": "If we talk about short term bitcoin targets, it could have a chance to reach $24k-$25k because the price now is at $23k which is more positive than yesterday.But I am not sure if in the next month, the price can be at $29k as that is not easy to break every high price wall and that means, bitcoin needs more support from outside.If in the next 10 days, bitcoin movements can be good and different than before, bitcoin will have the opportunity to back to $25k first and then the price can try to increase step by step to $29k.The chart can say many things, but we need to check on what happened to the market and decide what we need to do.",

In other words, if we succeed in reaching levels below 30k Long-term resistance, these levels will not continue to hold for periods, and breaking the resistance barrier at 23k with 28k to above 30K seems very difficult.Therefore, I think that we may break the $24,000 barrier, but we will soon return to levels between $17,000 and $23,000.",

Even though we're only talking about 10 days here, given how quickly price fell from this level, it should be able to rise just as quickly now that a trend reversal looks confirmed.For slightly longer-term, by September maybe, then I think $37K is realistic before a considerable pull-back, which would also be the 0.382 from $69K to $17.6K. I otherwise still think price can reach $49K (0.618) before the end of the year followed by a correction back down to $25K to $30K levels, probably a 50% drop. This would be the same as what happened in 2019 and most didn't expect to see.",
