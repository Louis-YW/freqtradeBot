I don't know if I'm the only one who got it since nobody is talking about itWhat makes it awkward is the error from host not anything else",

It's the same error message but for me i got it while i was navigating the forum exactly when i tried to post a reply It happens usually but not that severe as it will be okay after a refresh or two. This also happens when you click the \"all\" to show all replies on a thread, making a search, or just browsing. Or doing anything that loads huge data from the server or the server having heavy traffic on that specific moment.",
