Who would you trust the most for trading tips,An old trader who has had better days and mostly still relevant because they have a strong reputation for the fact that he has been trading for a while, or would you trust a new trader who is hot in the market and fresh with new strategies?The answer is that you don't rely on anyone for trading tips. You should learn and think for yourself, HODL or not trade at all. Taking tips from others rarely works well, it can only succeed for so long and in the end someone or both parties feel like an idiot, especially in volatile cryptocurrency markets. It's easy to pick stocks and shares in the long term, they go up and up and up because money printer brrrr then when someone is wrong, everyone is so wrong that they don't care about who they got their tips from. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is another ball park, because it is a legitimate market. The price is unpredictable because people are unpredictable, just as are whale forces (hedge funds, banks, corporations, high value individuals, all of whom are around the globe). TLDR: No one will ever be right consecutively, so just don't take tips.",

Similar with the old trader who might not have had a successful trade in years. In general I would always be cautious when it comes to trusting strategies from other people. It's better to check and analyse strategies ourselves than blindly trust someone else. If I had to choose between the two I would go with the older experienced trader. Being around in the business for many years means that he has seen plenty of bull and bear markets. Maybe he developed a sixth sense to identify the big cycles and can better protect my coins. Even better would be to use both their advice and bet big when they give the same recommendation.",

The old trader possesses consistency and that is one major factor needed in trading and then the new trader might have some new ideas to get from. So I would say one could combine both and use it. But the best strategy in trading is that strategy that has been working for you",

But don't assume that the strategies other people use will also work for us. We have to look for our own trading strategy.

Also remember that new traders has not such a good experience as compared to those traders who are involved in trader for so many years.

Always invest the money where you think is good and beneficial. In this manner if you make losses, you will learn from it and you won’t blame others for the loss. Definitely you can learn how to trade from experienced traders, but don’t put your money on their picks. Regarding strategies, they never works the second time, else everyone have just followed the strategies and would have became rich by now. So take time, learn and use it in the market.",

He can just take a few trades himself and go golfing for the rest of the day. Why waste your time to teach new people to trade? Obviously they do it because they want money from their coaching. However why teach trading, when you can just trade and make more money that way?  Hence why many of these trading signals from \"gurus\" are nothing but scams to lure new traders.And a new trader will never make you profitable long term. They usually make good money in a bull market and when the markets peak they end up losing all their money. Its very easy making money in a bull market, anyone can do it. The trick is to survive the bear markets which most people can't.",

But, if you need something like an advice or something similar then going to an old and experienced trader will do the trick but as for getting tips on how to trade or on which stocks you should trade then it's no longer advisable to meet anyone for that kind of help.

Market is always changing not all strat are working all the time especially when big banks or institutions already know that strat. We have to bear in mind that they're the manipulator, that's why we have to find new strat, a strat that knows where the institutions are going to buy. However, we really don't have to trust our money to them because it's our money, just get some knowledge from them.",

It's hard to rely on other especially if we are talking about money. Old traders has the necessary experience to do successful trades and know what to do in every situation they face, They can easily change strategy if they want if the strategy they are currently doing flops for a certain reasons. Those new traders who are doing hot wins sometimes are just carrying tons of luck and be confident enough to brag about it and give advices to public. Trust yourself, Listen to them but don't get too attached to them as if you are following every thing they teach. It's nice to have both worlds and apply it to yourself and finding out yourself on how you will execute it. If you trust others, You will certainly blame them if you fail to do it and that is why you need to trust yourself and make yourself accountable on every move you are doing.",

You can not apply a strategy and get same good results forever. With different market trends, one strategy will give you different net results.In addition, at points of trend turning, most of strategies will fail but unfortunately, if you over trust and don't be careful, you will lose capital at those points of time.Don't trust any veteran trader because they have many years of experience in the market. Being a veteran trader does not mean he is a successful one. Especially you should not trust a veteran trader from other markets but want to give advice in cryptocurrency market.",
