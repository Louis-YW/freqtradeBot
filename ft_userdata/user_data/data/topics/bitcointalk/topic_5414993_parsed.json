If you've got a better way of determining if a team is good (except a whitepaper - such as functional or well written code) that might be enough to invest in a project.",

People were just used to this stupid stuff called plagiarism, why will they copy others work without coming out with thier own idea of something new, as for me i will rather assume a higher percentage on those kinds of project as scam, and you need to know how you research upon their kinds because they know how to hype and manipulate reviews, if they can do that with their whitepaper then nothing being whiite or transparent again about them than manipulating skills, they can go to any length in doing that using different methods.",

You got one thing wrong, plagiarism is not an undesirable behaviour among newbies. this applies to everyone, regardless of experience. I don't mean only this forum. that is not desirable in any industry, why would it be acceptable in crypto?even if the idea is very similar to an existing business, it can always be made to be unique with an emphasis on the improvements it offers. if someone can't even put in that much effort, I would say that the whole team deserves a red flag.",

Actually yes since if they cannot give any detail explanation towards where there project heading in the future then maybe we can conclude that the owner of the project just want to rush things and plan to scam people.

Scammers do a copy from successful projects and use this for their project making to believe that they can trick people and yes, many investors got it because they are lazy to read the whitepaper and that was the truth, only a few bothered themselves and spend time reading it. But, those critics make use of this to detect projects that are less potential and close to scams. Grammars and spelling are one of the common things to be found to an unreliable projects.",

How come both the projects have the same idea realisation until they are one? Suppose two projects are working towards a common goal but their way of working should be different from others otherwise which one you will choose? The proof of concept is your own and if it's original it can never be same so it's definitely a red flag for those projects.You can have some references from others while framing one of your own white paper if you don't have idea about it but as you say copy paste then what's the advantage of those projects who can't clearly conceptualize their own idea and framework?

To evaluate a project, you need to consider many factors, not just the whitepaper but once you have plagiarized, stealing other people's ideas is no longer believable. Even the whitepaper they can't create, they certainly don't intend to develop the project seriously. You should stay away from them without further consideration.",

The whitepaper of projects that have the same essence shows that the project does not have its own characteristics. Because the whitepaper is a reference for investors regarding the objectives and functions to achieve the program, so when investors are interested in the project because there are things that distinguish it from other projects. Well, this is where the original value of a project can be seen from the whitepaper. No wonder there are so many projects that copy whitepapers from other projects the results don't last long. My suggestion is that the project should have an advantage that distinguishes it from the others even if it is only 1% difference, it will still be a reference for others to be interested in.",
