  "content": "I would be very happy, if someone with mining experience can explain to me how miners are selling their coins (e.g. to cover electricity bills).Maybe you can also guide me to an article explaining this process.❶ \"How do miners sell their Bitcoin?\"ⓐ Do they just have a usual account with a centralized regulated exchange like Coinbase, Binance or Kraken?ⓑ Do they sell OTC?ⓒ Is banking an issue? Bank might dislike crypto related activity.❷ \"Are you paid premium over market price?\"I read a couple of articles claiming that \"virgin\" (=freshly mined) Bitcoin are sold for a premium over market price:  https[Suspicious link removed]cs-freshly-minted-virgin-bitcoins/  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/op-ed-will-regulations-put-a-premium-on-virgin-bitcoin  https://cointelegraph.com/news/virgin-bitcoin-most-in-demand-crypto-that-is-regulated-differentlyIs this a rare exception for miners to be paid a premium on their freshly mined Bitcoin or are there common arrangements in place to buy your coins for a premium. So I was wondering, if there are any marketplaces where virgin Bitcoin are traded as a separate category from normal Bitcoin?",

I don't use any mixer for virgin BTC since it's clean and came from the pool.I guess that is why they mix or trade BTC in P2P exchange due to privacy. Also, I think some country before ban mining, so possible those who are secretly mining want to withdraw a few BTC to pay bills and the only way they can do this is to trade them in a P2P exchange or use a mixer to make sure they don't have any traces that they are mining.",

Peer to peer trading in itself is a \"bad\" transaction history according to chainalysis. Plus some of the coins I acquired on Bisq have an \"bad\" history before Bisq. I assume future regulation might become more strict. This could be a potential risk for my investments. Therefore I would like to diversify the history of my acquired Bitcoin to reduce risk of future regulatory tightening. Using coinjoins also makes Bicoin \"bad\", so it does not help me to become more resilient in case of regulatory tightening. https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-kyt/",

The question is just how likely it is and I don’t see any reason to do such a regulation since it would mostly affect normal people and not criminals. Of cause the government could spy on us. The question is just how likely it is that the NSA exists, since I don’t see any reason to spy on your own population since it would mostly affect normal people and not criminals.Who suffers under anti money laundering regulation? Few criminals and many normal people.What about money does it help rich asset owners or people on a paycheck & renting? Some may think the people in power optimize society for the benefit of those not in power. Others may think that the people in power would like to stay in power and pressure the powerless to obey them. In oder to stay powerful they may use regulation to starve of threats to their power.  Quote from: hZti on November 11, 2022, 08:05:21 PMI can only agree with this statement and already the question itself reveals to me that Bitcoin itself was not fully understood.Is this a hint on fungibility and censorship resistance?",

That doesn't mean there won't be any activity at all, though. It's a favorite option in decentralized exchanges, no wonder why.

If this is Irkutsk, then you can pay for rent and electricity with cryptocurrency. According to the documents, you pay in rubles, but you give away the cryptocurrency at a more favorable rate for the owner of the site where you mine.",
