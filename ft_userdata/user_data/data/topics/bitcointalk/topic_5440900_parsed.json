      "body": "The truth remains that Nigerian politician will remain Nigerian politicians in the sense that they all have similer characteristics. Having your pvc and voting on the election day does not gaurantee a stop to the Nigerians present predicament. Again, Nigerians are not certain of the new incoming President, if he will be the right leader for Nigerians. That is why we should vote wisely irrespective of the religion and tribe because if we fail to vote wisely we all will see another shege even worst than we have seen.Im my conclusion, i think and urge all Nigerians to vote their choice candidate peacefully and say a big NO to election malpractice for the betterment of our country",
