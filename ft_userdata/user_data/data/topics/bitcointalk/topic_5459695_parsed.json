Rolls will come in a small jewelers style boy while singles will come in a small protective bag and inside of a sealed black envelope. As stated in post there are two payment addresses, 1 for each lot and both addresses are listed with said respective lots.",

These bars are small so only the first 10 will be hand stamped. Mintage of 250. I typically keep them or give them to friends or sell at a premium. The bar is 1 gram in silver weight ,next to a standard size copper 1 oz bar. The holo looks as if it is raining bitcoins into a pile of Caribbean Treasures.",
