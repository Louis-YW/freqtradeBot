Any help, suggestions, and/or recommendations will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  Using eth is really a pain in the ass due to fee. But right now, its much more cheaper compared before that its really 5x of payment. I think the only way is to find a perfect timing when to use the network or when its not congested to have a small fee when doing transactions. Or else, use another L1 that has very low fee like matic, polygon, or avalanche.",

The fees was just permanent. it can't even be avoided. You can imagine to swap or bridging your asset. you need to pay a high fees as well. The only way if you shall use ethereum blockchain when you wanna send ethereum. this is a little bit cheaper compared with using altcoin for the transaction purpose.",

Other different side chain solution is just possible if the dapp you are using supports but that's always not case on ETH since you will still need to do on-chain transaction for P2P transaction nd other activities on ETH. This is the consequence for the over valuation of the ETH tokens. This is only minor for those early investors but very expensive on new user on ETH chain. Honestly why still use ETH blockchain?",

There are plenty of chains to choose from and there's an increasing number of chain interoperability implementation.Totally agree with your statement, there's nothing we can do but wait for gas costs to drop, and it's true, gas declines usually occur when the market is bearish. Maybe once ETH 2.0 is fully rolled out, we'll be able to see gas costs much lower than they are today. For now, instead of using Ethereum, I prefer to use BSC.Why not use FTX to make ETH transfers? they ease every token delivery, for example BTC and ETH, even for other networks, they make it free.",

I often delay or cancel transactions and prefer another time where the transactions on the blockchain are not too high. So usually the fee will go down a little.

And if this continues to happen while if we force the transfer the costs are very high, wait for times like now when it is bearish because the gas fee for this network is commonly more affordableÂ   But once more, if this is too long waiting, just count on how much fees to spend and how much we can get, if that is stillÂ  profitable I commonly will continue the transaction.",
