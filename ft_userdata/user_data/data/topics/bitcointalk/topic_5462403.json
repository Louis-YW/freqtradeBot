      "body": "I don't think it should be called a Giveaway while players need to play with their deposited money and there are other restrictions as well which should be maintained by a player to participate. The minimum bet is 1000 Satoshi which is around $0.29 at this moment and players have to play over 2x multiplier. So, you should name it as contest instead of giveaway.",
