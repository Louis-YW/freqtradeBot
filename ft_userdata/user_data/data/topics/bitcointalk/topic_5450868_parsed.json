      "body": "I have learned to use the word self-custodial wallet instead of non-custodial wallet since users are directly in control of their assets, which makes it something personal.Trust wallet is said to be a self-custodial wallet, but I have also learned in this forum that they are not open source, which means it's not really the best wallet to use. Why do you store your crypto in Trust wallet in the first place? Having a staking option simply means they will want you to give away control of your assets and hand them over to them, promising you a little APR, which you will get when you unstake your coins or tokens.I don't actually know the best multi-wallet out there since you are talking about staking coins. It's probably not a Bitcoin coin; it should be some kind of altcoin. I guess Metamask is safer than Trustwallet, so you can use Metamask instead and use their staking option for coins that allow staking. But I will also advise you to do your own research.Since this is not entirely about Bitcoin, I will also advise you to move this topic over to the altcoin discussion.",

In fact most of the third party sites doesn't offer real staking. They just call it staking. It isn't staking as participating to consensus. And Trust wallet, that OP was talking about is self-custody wallet.But my answer to OP would be that if you can stake by yourself (meaning that you have private key to the wallet you are staking), i can't see any reason why shouldn't you stake your coins.",

I've been from there for so many years to analyzing if it's okay to hold it. Nothing is wrong with holding if you don't trust the wallet because if it's a custodial, you are aware that they won't give you the private keys. And just take the profit from holding it but if you think that you've got no problem staking it from that wallet, your decision follows.",

Instead of holding your coins in your wallet that gives you control over your funds and coins at all times. So to me, staking is profitable but with a high risk, of possible loss of the entire investment to a third party who has control of you coins and wallets.",

It's important to note that higher rewards can potentially impact the token and its long-term price. Additionally, the inability to unstake at any time may hinder the ability to sell the tokens in the event of an unexpected price surge.
