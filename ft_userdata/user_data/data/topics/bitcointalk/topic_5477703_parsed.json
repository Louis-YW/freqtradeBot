  "content": "BorB is the world's first commission-free contract trading dApp is airdropping $50,000 worth of B and USDT tokens. Go to https://dapp.borb.fi/ and make a trade of CFD/FPC contracts with a minimum of $1.B - the House.The main application of B as a utility token is in the Liquidity protocol where it is used as access to provide liquidity.Derivatives trading is peer-to-peer by nature. In BorB, it's a bet between a trader and a pool owned by the house. BorB is built on a decentralized house model using the B token. Anyone with B tokens can add funds to the pools and place themselves on the house side of the trades.Each B token correlates with liquidity in a ratio of 1:1. It means that for 1 B you can supply up to 1 USDC/USDT to the pool.To maximize capital efficiency and maintain high APY for all B holders, we have limited access for deposits. Depending on the daily trading volume, you can supply:Trading volume (24h) ≥ $0 - $100K | Ratio 1:1 (1 B = 1 USDC/USDT)Trading volume (24h) ≥ $100K - $200K | Ratio 1:2 (1 B = 2 USDC/USDT)Trading volume (24h) ≥ $200K - $400K | Ratio 1:4 (1 B = 4 USDC/USDT)Trading volume (24h) ≥ $400K - $800K | Ratio 1:8 (1 B = 8 USDC/USDT)Trading volume (24h) ≥ $800K - $1.6M | Ratio 1:16 (1 B = 16 USDC/USDT)Trading volume (24h) ≥ $1.6M - $3.2M | Ratio 1:32 (1 B = 32 USDC/USDT)Trading volume (24h) ≥ $3.2M - $6.4M | Ratio 1:64 (1 B = 64 USDC/USDT)Trading volume (24h) ≥ $6.4M - $12.8M | Ratio 1:128 (1 B = 128 USDC/USDT)and so on...As soon as the daily trading volume reaches the previous supply limit, it doubles along with the ratio.",

      "body": "Ive checked their socials it seems none interaction with a lots of OG which I followed like more or less 50 good influencers sharing good projects. Its not that its not good but also visited the site, quite simple UI design and seems lack engagement. By the way, itts that real money we need to use or testnet tokens? Also why the volume is for whales only the range of lowest is from $0 to $100k it seems expensive activity.",
