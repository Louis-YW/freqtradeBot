Anything less opens the door to the development of a dangerous surveillance tool.\"Emmer said that the bill would bar the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC, prevent the Fed from using a CBDC for monetary policy purposes, and require the Fed's CBDC projects to be transparent.CBDCs are digital versions of national fiat currencies that operate on private blockchains.He noted, \"After all, America remains a technological leader not because we force innovations to adopt our values under regulatory duress, but because we allow technology that holds these values at their core to flourish.\"Emmer said that Reps. French Hill (R-AR), Warren Davidson (R-OH), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Mike Flood (R-NE), Byron Donalds (R-FL), Pete Sessions (R-TX), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Young Kim (R-CA), and Ralph Norman (R-SC) cosponsored the bill.The Fed has said it is \"exploring the potential benefits and risks of CBDCs from a variety of angles,\" which includes research and experimentation....",

Emmer's website: https://emmer.house.gov/2022/1/emmer-introduces-legislation-to-prevent-unilateral-fed-control-of-a-u-s-digital-currencyQuoteWashington, D.C.— Today, Congressman Tom Emmer (MN-06) introduced a bill prohibiting the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) directly to individuals. “As other countries, like China, develop CBDCs that fundamentally omit the benefits and protections of cash, it is more important than ever to ensure the United States’ digital currency policy protects financial privacy, maintains the dollar’s dominance, and cultivates innovation. CBDCs that fail to adhere to these three basic principles could enable an entity like the Federal Reserve to mobilize itself into a retail bank, collect personally identifiable information on users, and track their transactions indefinitely,” Emmer said. “Not only would this CBDC model centralize Americans’ financial information, leaving it vulnerable to attack, but it could also be used as a surveillance tool that Americans should never tolerate from their own government.” “Requiring users to open up an account at the Fed to access a U.S. CBDC would put the Fed on an insidious path akin to China’s digital authoritarianism,” Emmer continued. “It is important to note that the Fed does not, and should not, have the authority to offer retail bank accounts. Regardless, any CBDC implemented by the Fed must be open, permissionless, and private. This means that any digital dollar must be accessible to all, transact on a blockchain that is transparent to all, and maintain the privacy elements of cash” “In order to maintain the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency in a digital age, it is important that the United States lead with a posture that prioritizes innovation and does not aim to compete with the private sector,” Emmer continued. Bill can be found here: https://emmer.house.gov/_cache/files/e/3/e3f3f683-d983-4456-9f34-8ac493730582/6724255AB4BCC4F46F5F41DAE08F63BD.emmer-045-xml.pdfSeems refreshing for a bill to not be hundreds of pages of legal jargon. Emmer's attempts will be futile, unfortunately. The central banks are too powerful for their own good. They exist to maintain the interests of the federal government. And, it is within the interest of the federal government to introduce CBDC's as an attempt to resurrect their highly inflating currencies.A lot of these bills are grandstanding and political posturing anyways. But it acts as a way to mark something for the record so the rest of the Congress has the opportunity to sign onto a bill if they support it. I'm assuming there wouldn't be much support.",

People in America can use whatever money they want. Why? Because if they make payment in literal, snorting, squaling pigs rather than money, and the government or anybody else doesn't accept their payment, the debt is cancelled per the Uniform Commercial Code.The problem is that the people simply don't know how to use common law in court effectively.",

CBDC’s are just a fiat shitcoin with a finite supply, they will create them & just mint more whenever they feel like it. A CBDC is just spyware for the government to track everything you spend your money on. Bitcoin is an inflation fighter, hard money where you are in control. CBDC’s pose no significant risk-to bitcoin long term.",

Perhaps the fed isn't the issue, the politicians are.Politicians are definitely an issue. But if the FED was gone, and the US Treasury were in control, there would be a much easier way for people to direct money affairs by getting their representatives to put an honest Treasury Secretary in place. Below is the real issue.The Constitution allows for only gold and silver to be made into money. If you stretch this, you can issue gold and silver backed paper. But the problem with gold and silver as money is that there isn'e enough of it to maintain money with a growing population... especially considering the industrial uses of gold and silver.The FED idea was used by government because it is based on a whole different idea. Government is allowed to contract with outside, private companies. And these companies don't have limitations on using only gold and silver. So, now we have fiat money that can be expanded across unlimited population size.The problem with the FED idea is that the FED is loaning money into existence, and is collecting double in return for the money - not including the extra amount they get from interest on the loans. Half of this double loan repayment is going directly into FED owners private coffers. It gives the private owners money to manipulate the world, provided they don't push enough of it onto the market to inflate it beyond what the people can bear.The point is that we are giving the world to the owners of the FED little by little, simply by using FED fiat money. They owe us the money back. So, they are trying to move the money system into CBDC to greatly confuse the fact that they owe us countless $trillions, and to maintain their control of money into the future.The answer is to get rid of the FED, and to take back the money FED owners have stolen from us, militarily if no other way.",
