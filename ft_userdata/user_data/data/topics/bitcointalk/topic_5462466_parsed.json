All these exchanges listed PI coins is called (IOU) which means that no deposit and withdraw possible and holder will get token with 1:1 exchange rate when it goes live. Remember that Arbitrum IOU rare was 16$ before launch but after launch price was low than 2$..Now the PI unofficial market rate is below than 0.3$. If its trading was possible then you would not make a thread here. anyway it's on you but if you want this rate then wait for official listing which is seem to be not happen in short time.",

If someone is interested let me know your offers.Pi is still under enclosed mainnet which means you can not transaction pi coin.  except from pi wallet to wallet but not listed for trading in any exchanges. Morover the price you are trying to sell is high @$17. Do not be decived by the hype. There were many mined coins that has a huge price before open mainnet dey fall to smaller price. Example was Satoshi which later was called CoreDao which the amount was $650 in metamask in testnet and became $5 in open mainnet which has fallen to 0.399 today. So it's unpredictable if you sell and regret later or sell and never regret.",

So, whoever wants to sell Pi coin will be ready to do so at $0.2 or lesser, the quantity you want to see also affects the price,  I have no idea why that will be the case.",
