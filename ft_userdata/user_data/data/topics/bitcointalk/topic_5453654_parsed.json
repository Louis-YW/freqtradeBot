Cardano is an old coin that hasn't done anything serious since its creation. It has strong patrons behind it, roughly like Ripple. If you want to make life better for the people who are developing Cardano, you can invest in this project. But I am not sure that you will get good profits, because the coin has made huge growth in the past, and now it is time for it to be trashed, as it has been repeatedly with similar projects such as eos or xem.",

One about about bullrun is that we cannot predict the exact range limit it will go or how far it will reach, but what we normally work on is the new set on bitcoin all time high and this also makes every other cryptocurrencies move in the same pattern except for shitcoins.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on May 22, 2023, 11:07:13 AMI do not know too much about Cardano just that it is current top 10 and many rave about it, would be good to hear thoughts on this both good and bad. It can be among the top rated currencies but yet conduct your own personal research about the coin and know their current stand in the crypto market before investment, no one here will give you a guarantee on any coin or vouch for them because we are all on the same level of taking risk investing in them.",

I have been hearing about this coin for long now but never picked interest to invest why because I have been reading some of the post over here talking about altcoin not the right choice of investment instead should venture into bitcoin investment. If you wanna buy and hold then you should be able to bear the risk associated with the coin maybe deep down me would suggest of buying ETH or BNB, ADA is a good choice but you should study it very carefully.",

It's a burden for investors who still kept buying these days. I also have doubts about buying the token again.The bottom of its price back in 2020 was $0.02 it must be rewarding still for those who bought at such a price and are still staking to this day. The price as of now ($0.36) was also the peak in the 2018 bull run. The token must be on the right track though. It could spike to more than 10x if it follows the same movement in the bull season.",

It just needs a hype and that is more likely once bulltrend happen probably on the next Bitcoin halving. Its market price still is following sudden pumps especially with Bitcoin so I guess that is an enough reason why it is considered as one of the good alternatives and also, not quite sure if there will be further improvements for the coin itself. But if this to just look for other crypto investments, the good ones I guess are APE and MAGIC. These tokens are usually having quite of large price increase and also moves faster than ither crypto market prices which for me is an easier way to make decision wether I'd be on short or long biased.",

Cardano(ADA) is still a rock on this market and what that means to me is like solid. But this is from a perspective without having a deep look on its roots and whatever is happening there already. It's just solid numbers looking at tracker websites like CMC. But if that's your basis of choosing it as it might multiply by 10x, no one knows.",

And if ADA does 10x most likely whole market does 20x. so i wouldn't personally pick ada. It has followers yeah but that's seems more like a cult. I know that BTC and ETH holders have been considered as a cult but least eth has some super brains behind it Ada just has money and i can't see any clear vision in it. I know for a fact that some of the best coders out there that have rejected insane amounts of money to work for ada. They rejected it because they don't believe in it. So why would i. I don't even code but that tells me enough.",
