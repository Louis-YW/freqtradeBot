      "body": "would you mind further elaborating? what is Celsius that you are talking about? Is it a wallet? if so, did the 20 Eth appear out of nowhere after an update since you mentioned \"as recent update\"? what do you mean when you say \"file a claim for it\"? it would be good to clarify what exactly is going on or what exactly is it you are experiencing.",

It’s painful to have that kind of huge balance inside celsius while you can only receive part of it best is 20% for that amount.What are you thinking for not filing claim that moment Celsius file bankruptcy? Are you offline for a long tieme while this bankruptcy on Celsius happening?",

About a month or so ago, they told me that they receive a notification about proof of claim and even asked me if the process would get done quickly so that they would get back their money soon, but I let them know that it could even take years.I hope what you received was not a scam email. Be very careful.",

I would ask you to email the support of Celsius and wait for the official reply or DM them on Twitter.
