That is a way to know a website is likely a scam or not. I further my investigation. The exchange domain was registered last year, 2022. Code:Domain:ixexchanger.comRegistrar:GoDaddy.com, LLCRegistered On:2022-06-30Expires On:2023-06-30Updated On:2022-09-12I chat with their customer representative, see the chat:     According to our chat, I want to know how old the exchange has been existing, the customer care wrote 2020. But the domain name was created just last year.Avoid, it is a scam site. Edit: You even knew the site was a scam before, according to you trust page. I will give you a neutral trust for that. Likely you are here to scam.",
