There's no project interested to launch in this shit. Claimed to have 50+ VCs and funs. Who are stupid VCs make a collaboration with this shit? Just no.AptosLaunch is the #1 Launchpad on Aptos and what you write shows that you did not look into it properly.- Sure the UI can and will be improved, but it is not \"very bad\". - what you write about useless Token is just total FUD. Holding ALT will determine your IDO allocation,you can put it into a compound staking contract (one of the first on Aptos), this token reward pool is refilled by DeFi Roulette (powered by Aptos Dragons) and there will be other sources in the future. + there are many other use cases like voting, VIP Tiers with lot of benefits, you can read about it in the Docs.- the price dump does not determine the quality of a Project, incase you missed it:most altcoins dumped a lot more. ALT has trading pairs with APT (Aptos) so it makes sense that the $ price dumped after APT did.Look at what was achieved so far in such a short time, other Launchpads did not even list on 1 CEX, some had to delist.AptosLaunch is already listed on KuCoin, MEXC, and got trading pairs on DEXs like Pancake and Liquidswap.What you write about \"Aptos was building a good blockchain\" does not make any sense either.Aptos is still undergoing heavy development, same as the ecosystem projects and AptosLaunch is one of the first projects ( with Aptos since testnet )  and one of the highest quality ones with a huge community.Let's talk about the token price in about 6 months",
