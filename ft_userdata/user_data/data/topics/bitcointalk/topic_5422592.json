If you try holding them for long even if your position was initially profitable, you end up losing all your profits QuoteThe problem is they cant delist high leverage tokens with so short notice people have bought a lot of them.This is not the first time they delisted them anyway, people really need to first learn where they are going to put money instead of making rush investments while ignorant.QuoteI know people who have invested like life savings in exchangers and now it's all gone.Because they were so stupid to trust centralized exchanges. Next time they will learn to use noncustodial walletsQuoteIf some low Cap new coins we can understood but leverage tokens Are the dublicates of biggger coins Like eth btc If nothing happens with btc or ETH dot trx then there should be no reason to delist dot or trx.The point is the very high volatility in the crypto market. Even Bitcoin gets so volatile at times and people lose a lot of money. Delisting the shit leveraged tokens is the nest solution.",

They're not meant for long-term investment so keeping them long isn't advisable anyway. Short notice is really terrible but yes, we have to take action before the said schedule otherwise you can no longer sell your coins anymore. But as long as it is on our personal wallet, it can be safe. We can still make a trade of it in other exchanges.",

If someone has been buying these shitcoins, it is their own fault for buying garbage that nobody else wanted.QuoteThe problem is they cant delist high leverage tokens with so short notice people have bought a lot of them.Well that's one of the problems with centralization. They can do whatever they want and change any rule they want at any time without prior notice.QuoteI think the MT gox situation was nothing what we see nowdays people Will start riots probably goverment must Force exchangers like binance to protect customers from losses.lol the shitcoin market is not nearly big enough to involve enough people to even cause a tiny unrest let alone any riot that needs government intervention. Besides, most people know what they are getting into when they buy shitcoins on centralized shady exchanges like Binance.QuoteIf some low Cap new coins we can understood but leverage tokens Are the dublicates of biggger coins Like eth btc If nothing happens with btc or ETH dot trx then there should be no reason to delist dot or trx.The leverage tokens Are extra risky so it have to be with longer notice.That's actually a good reason to remove them since as you admit they are shitcoins that have copied bitcoin.QuoteBinance is last exchanger what people trust If binance Will follow the ftx style to treat customers then people Will be very sad and disapointed.They will but not for long. This wouldn't be the first big CEX that goes bust.QuoteThat's why i see only way to goverment to step in and bail out all lol never gonna happen bro...QuoteThe question Are about public security and human rights.Everyone tells you not to jump into the well, you insist on jumping in and after reaching the bottom of it, in the darkness you scream for help!That's not how things work. You shouldn't invest in shitcoins in first place instead of wanting government to bail \"you\" out because of some right that doesn't exist.",

      "body": "That's why you don't need to buy coins that don't have a clear project. You already know that several coins are already popular and are the choice of many traders or investors, such as bitcoin, ethereum, bnb to buy. So you don't have to take the risk of buying those coins that are not clear because of the occasional delisting from the exchange. We can't blame the exchange for why they didn't tell us the delisting time. But as far as I know, when an exchange wants to delist the coins, they will notify all members and give them time to withdraw and transfer the coins to another exchange. So even though it seems like only a short amount of time, the members can immediately withdraw the coins to other wallets. Actually, this is a risk that we have to face when we invest in crypto and we have to know about it.",

Shitcoins are only  good for short term speculation, hit and run, get rich (or poor) quick, pump and dump.Even the exchanges don't have the stomach to list them for years, why would you DCA them? It was a fail strategy from the start.Only DCA big coins like ETH and BTC.",

I think that's better for you, not necessarily bad.
