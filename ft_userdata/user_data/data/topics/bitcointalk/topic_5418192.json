  "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum remain stuck in a range with no clear direction during today’s trading session. The crypto market’s uncertainty has been smashing on long and short positions, but one sector is blooming under current conditions. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $19,360 with sideways movement across the board. Ethereum is displaying similar price action in this choppy environment, with most cryptocurrencies in the top 10 at a loss or lateral movement.2022 Crushes Bitcoin And Global MarketsAccording to a report from the trading desk QCP Capital, this year has been the worst performing for investors with a cross-asset portfolio. If an investor-owned Bitcoin, stocks, and gold as part of their strategy, their capital would be in the red.As seen in the chart below, the only assets recording gains are those in the energy sector, with crude oil and natural gas taking the lead. The former recorded the best performance in 2022 with a positive 34%, followed by a 4% in crude oil (WTI).The crypto market has been the biggest loser under current macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded 66% and 72% losses, respectively. In traditional markets, only the Nasdaq 100 records a similar drawdown of 40%. QCP Capital wrote:Outside of energy, the breadth and correlation of underperformance is stunning – every single macro financial benchmark is underwater in real terms (…). Today, with every category of fixed income returning negative real returns – there was essentially nowhere you could have hidden out this year and beaten inflation.https://cryptonews.com.co/bitcoin-news/best-bitcoin-and-ethereum-strategy-in-2022-this-report-answers/",

For some this is not good as their portfolio is in red, nevertheless for experience and smart investors, this is a great opportunity to just restock sats in your wallet because the price of bitcoin is around -70% from it's all time high, so it is at a discount.So the best strategy is DCA, and I would say is very safe even for newbies to implement as it is very easy. QuoteDollar-cost averaging involves investing the same amount of money in a target security at regular intervals over a certain period of time, regardless of price. By using dollar-cost averaging, investors may lower their average cost per share and reduce the impact of volatility on the their portfolios. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp",

Whilst for Ethereum, lowest was around at $900 and is now at $1,344.In fairness for the oil industry, during the height of pandemic, they're the biggest loser. And now that economy is becoming back to every country, demand is increasing, and OPEC has limited the barrels per day which resulted to them as mostly wins and will surely expand the gains that they're getting now.",

If the pattern is consistent you can make a decent profit. Sadly not everyone has the patience or self-control for that. A bear market is not uncommon, just DCA as mentioned above if you still believe in the market and has no funds or time to trade weekly/daily.",

You can wait until the price is back to $19k or even lower if you want to buy it or you can also buy it now for small money to see how it goes.I think the first thing is to identify first if what term will suit us. In investing, there are two main terms here which is long term and short term. If we are into longer terms then the DCA strategy would be perfect for us since in DCA you won't really minding the fluctuations but you are forced to buy a coin at your set dates.For those who are into shorter terms then they are the ones that will need an analysis even if the coins that they invest are already safe. They need to take advantage of that fluctuations. Lastly, if we are sure that btc and eth is going for a pump then why wait? If you are interested of earning immediately then you can start buying now.",

So in a DCA way of investing trusted crypto are the best way to make a profit which is safe for everyone and could you have control over your losses once there is. However, many investors prefer to hold and store value than use their coins as a normal transaction. The best strategy for me is to keep holding and keep growing your porfolio.",

The recent pump could be a sign that we will have a good month next month (November). Because it's really a coincidence that the pump happened on the last days of the month and I believe the monthly candle is about to close. For me, it was testing the $20,000 level of  Bitcoin and bears succeed to break the $20,000 level and it's very positive for me.",

Hence, if you are an investor of crypto (particularly BTC and ETH) the strategy that might work to have a possible huge gain in the future is buy at this cheap price and hold for long period or until the price reached a decent amount for you to sell. It requires having a long patience since we don't know when we're going to wait until bullish season occur or like most investors predicted, until the next halving.",

If they save more bitcoins when bear market take effect then its good for them and somehow this is good to hold knowing bouncing back is normal traits with bitcoin. But even though it has a traits like this they also need to do their own research about volatility since maybe from researching they can save time to use on researching more wild crypto contents.",
