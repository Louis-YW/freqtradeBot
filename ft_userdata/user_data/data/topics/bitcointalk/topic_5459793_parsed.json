      "body": "If you write your book in pidgin,it means that you wrote the book for only a particular people because it will be hard for you book to sell beyond the shores of those who don't know how to read pidgin or those who don't understand pidgin. Think vast and use the common English language that is the most spoken language in the world. You don't know where you book will get to tomorrow.Quote from: lagosnoir on July 14, 2023, 11:06:53 AMHave you read books written in pidgin English?

The novelty of the idea fascinated me but I am not sure of the commercial viability.If you’re not so sure if its commercial viability, I would advise you write the book with pidgin and also a translation of it in English. The translation doesn’t not to be in audio format, but should be written to follow the audio format of the pidgin. With this way, those interested in the book and not in pidgin will buy it, also those that are interested in learning pidgin, it’ll be a good avenue for them also. Don’t feel discouraged, just go ahead with your planned project. QuoteHave you read books written in pidgin English? Will you buy a book written in pidgin English?I would definitely buy if the book suits my tastes and the topic of the book is catchy for me to learn a lot. Although I prefer Ebooks but I wouldn’t hesitate to get one if it’s written in pidgin.",

It's quite simple once you understand the character of others, what the audience needs and deliver it to them with full potentials, not holding anything back, the citizens would like you to be straightforward inwhatever you're doing. People tend to value important information, no matter the procedure it would be transmitted. Writing books in pidgin English, that idea is welcome afterall it's the language used by motor park agberos, so I'm acquainted with it.",
