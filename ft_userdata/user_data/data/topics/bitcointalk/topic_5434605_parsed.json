  "content": "Hi,In the past I was actively trading at KRAKEN - some months with 7-figure volumes, and I'm aware of how to use their site.  TLDR: Due typo on KRAKEN's site deposited to the wrong chain. (PHA-Phala <> PHA-Khala)KRAKEN admitted the error, explained\"We are very sorry and understand this situation far from ideal.\"Offered 1/10th of the (dollar) amount as compensation in... fee credits (KFEE)And for the coins...\"Our developers will attempt to recover these funds but due to the complexity of our infrastructure and the security measures we have in place, this can take several months.\"Why this topic: As an alertPeople could lose coins due to KRAKEN's error and with no-fault from the client's side to get screwed. It's not about the ~1000 USD in 'lost' coins; I already wrote them off from my balances. But a principle matter. Regaining client trust. After the FTX/SBF fiasco, this is the most valuable coin.Imagine if the transfer was for 10K or 100K. Or that 1K worth of coins is fatal for me. There are a lot of people and situations where 1K is critical.At the same time, Coinbase are making tools like:\"Coinbase announces new asset recovery tool for ERC-20 tokens\"https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-announces-new-asset-recovery-tool-for-erc-20-tokensScreenshots to the KRAKEN PRO & KRAKEN Site texts: https://imgur.com/a/0vupUlV---What KRAKEN did: Remember: the client has no-fault in this case1. Fixed the typo2. Offered 1/10th of the USD equivalent in fee credits3. 'I'm continuing to chase up your case' for over a month already. ---How should KRAKEN reacts IMO: 1. Fix the typo2. Compensate the client, as the client has no-fault in this case; With the same amount of coins or the USD equivalent at the transfer time. 3. Internally resolve/recover the coins with their: \"Our developers will attempt to recover these funds but due to the complexity of our infrastructure and the security measures we have in place, this can take several months.\"---I will update my KRAKEN support ticket with a link to this topic - if KRAKEN wants to add anything. -----Longer version: What happened (screenshots linked):  1) I wanted to deposit Phala At KRAKEN and because Phala could be transferred over multiple chains (PHA-Phala, PHA-Khala, PHA-Ethereum/ERC20)Following KRAKEN's instructions from their PRO KRAKEN platform: \"You can only deposit PHA to this address on the Phala Network. Deposits of other tokens or on other networks will be lost.\"> deposited PHA-Phala2) But after some time, I noticed that the deposit it still not credited. 3) Went to Kraken's website to check what is going on and found this on Phala depositing page: \"Only deposit PHA on the KHALA network. Deposits on any other tokens will be lost.\"E.g. somebody from Kraken's team made a typo while configuring the KRAKEN PRO (Phala <> Khala). It happens; we are all humans. But what is wrong is KRAKEN's reaction after it. Screenshots to the KRAKEN PRO & KRAKEN Site texts: https://imgur.com/a/0vupUlV",

And can you provide screenshot of the said statements made by kraken's admin? Given the frequency of this mixed up chains is quite a lot, Kraken should probably start considering to have some pool to reimburse the fund immediately with what they have from the reserved pool and whem they fixed these mix up --months later-- the fund they recovered would be placed back to the pool. It's almost ridiculous how their member has to suffer a lot of opportunity-lost from the price fluctuations while they tried to fix the problem that they've admitted as their mistake.",
