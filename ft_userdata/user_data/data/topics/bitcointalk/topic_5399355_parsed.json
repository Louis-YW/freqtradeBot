Prices may change. All prices will rise closer to the game's release.If the market will go further down, then there is not much point in buying these punks now. Just for memory. Or for fun. If the war between Russia and Ukraine does not end soon, then this may lead to the fact that the market will continue to fall.Although, of course, there is a chance that the developers will make this game despite the market situation.         I got a little familiar with the project and their website. And the situation looks a little strange - for example, if I want to buy a key from them through the application with which one random punk opens, then at the moment this key costs 21 bucks. But you're selling common punks for $3. What's the point of this ? The key costs 21, but you're gonna sell your epic punks for $20. Is there some kind of trick here? Why so cheap ?",

Why so cheap ?There are no tricks, this nft platform is at an early stage of development, so for now there is such a paradox. But, while this may sound like a small advertisement, it seems to me that such cheap prices will not last very long, so the first buyers will certainly have a little better luck.Quote from: Krabat on May 20, 2022, 06:12:35 AMCool punks dude! But I didn't see any of your legendary punks in stock. They are not here? You say that the sale price is from $40, but you don't have them on the list ?The legendary punk was bought a few hours ago. I'm not sure if legendary punks will still be available, but everything can be. Maybe later there will be one or two. For now, you can look from what is available - the epic ranc, ultra rare, and further down the list - rare and common.The collection for sale will be gradually replenished, but mainly due to more average ranks. The number of legendary and epics will always be limited.",

The website says it's in the third quarter. Admins have the exact same answer. No specific dates have been announced yet. I think that by the middle of summer rhis game will  be launched!!! As for the second question, I still find it difficult to answer. But in any case - higher ranked punks have much more combat resource than lower ranked punks. For example, these are the characteristics of a regular punk compared to the characteristics of a legendary punk. As you can see in the column \"total\" - the legendary punk has a total resource of more than 5 !!! times the resource of a simple punk.On average, the general characteristics of any legendary punk are about 5 - 10 times higher than those of a punk with common rank.Based on this, having high-ranked punks is - always - better than lower ones.",

Now the cheapest and at the same time not the most powerful legendary punks on the site have price starting from 65 $ and then much higher. The average price of the ten cheapest legendary punks on sale is now around $150 (ranging from $65 to $200). And then even higher. But now there are quite a few left. Apparently, those sellers who have them are not in a hurry to sell. And this is completely understandable. In summer-autumn, prices will rise more.",
