  "content": "Everybody here has seen the Iranian Hulk Sajad Gharibi match against The Kazakh Titan Djumanov Almat Bakhytovich, these two are fierce rivals as internet sensations for having huge bodies like incredible hulk they finally settle their differences in the ring but unfortunately it's not the kind of fight that we want to see because it's too one-sided and it did not live through the hype Obviously, the Iranian Hulk Sajad Gharibi match signed to this fight unprepared and with zero boxing skills, even an amateur boxer can beat this guy with Hulkster, watching this fight made me think that promoters are just exploiting their popularity and these so-called internet sensations just want to have a quick buck.Should we allow or support internet sensations to fight in the ring I'm ok with the Paul brothers but these two other so-called internet sensations are making a mockery of boxing.

Watch official matches if you want to see real action and don’t expect good quality of fight on an exhibition match. This is just like a sparring for the professional to beat amateurs televised.",

They would put it in pay-per-view or just locally televised. It's not really mockery, boxing is a fist fight that could be done anywhere but there are beings who trained hard for it to go pro. Anyone can box, but our expectations should be lower when they are known for the sport. I would not be much affected by it.",

Though the fact that the match went on goes to show that it was a possibility for the match to have traction and for people to pay for it. If the so-called \"entertainment\" they were looking for was one small laugh from me after seeing that immediate K.O. then they got it. Otherwise I wouldn't really support these kinds of exhibition matches, maybe against retired pros or experienced ones, but this kind of matches? Hard pass.",

It is done for entertainment purposes and obviously, for these two giant walking muscles to make some quick moolah. Now if it was advertised as an amateur bout following all the rules of the sport and they did this kind of clownfest, that is the time when I would be complaining and obviously call for them to stop this nonsense. It's good that no major bookies took this under their events because a lot of people would be insanely mad given how foolish the guy in blue acted. Even amateur flyweights can drop this guy down.",

So the result was quite expected and I am sure majority of the people put their mkney on Djumanov Almat Bakhytovich as it was a boxing match. Also such fancy matches are money making machine for both the organizers and the players. They all have earned couple of millions and had a good night sleep after the match.",

You could argue that's been making a mockery of boxing for 25+ years - I know they call it \"wrestling\" but in reality it's all just theatrics in a boxing ring. I don't see any problem with it, if all fighters are aware of the risks and willingly want to participate then leave them to it. As we see with the popularity of the WWF contest every year, some people just like to watch this as a form of entertainment rather than a professional sport. There are serious tournaments and there are mock fights, follow whatever you like and it doesn't hurt anyone else. The real saps are the people paying for tickets which ultimately ends up funding the huge wage packets they get in return.",
