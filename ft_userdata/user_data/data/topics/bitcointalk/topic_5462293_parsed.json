      "body": "There are already several similar solutions, based on the preev.com idea. All sites offer at least the possibility of entering and calculating the value of a custom amount of Bitcoin. From that point of view, I don't see the usability of your website in particular. Also, how useful is the sound notification, for every price change of a few cents? This happens constantly, who really wants his browser to beep every few seconds?The live chart page is not loading, I don't know if it exists or if there is another problem.",

Stay updated on market shifts with sound alerts for price increases and access to a handy table of the latest 24 price changes.https://btcprice.live/Before opening the thread your site is down??? When your site will go live and will be active to check the BTC price. I hope it will be something like preev.com waiting for the live of your site and hopefully think it will not be too late.",
