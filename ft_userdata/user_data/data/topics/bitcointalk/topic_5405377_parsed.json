I try as much as possible to avoid sections where my intention may be misunderstood, for example I'm mainly on this forum for the passion/talents, but when I notice that posts that should be making people happy and hopeful are doing the opposite, I tend to assume they are not as passionate as I'm, so I avoid such sections as much as possible... unless it's necessary to post there. Besides, I love where humble people are and detest pride. I try as much as possible not to see people (even those below me) offended by posts, so I do that where they will be less offended",
