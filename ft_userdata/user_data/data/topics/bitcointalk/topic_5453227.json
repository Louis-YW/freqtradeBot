  "content": "yehey another imgur topicAs you've probably noticed, images from imgur.com no longer work on Bitcointalk. That's why I've downloaded 801,550 images from imgur, which were embedded on the forum. Downloading took 3 days using 4 different servers, and another 3 days to process the data. I used the links from my unedited posts archive, which means I'm missing all images that were edited in later.After some cleaning, I'm left with 5 directories:Code:4.1M    ./img.imgur.com35M     ./i.stack.imgur.com < this one is still working1.8M    ./www.imgur.com132M    ./imgur.com146G    ./i.imgur.com146G99.9% of the images come from i.imgur.com.I made a .zip for each user. It includes all images related to that account (including quoted images). After extracting the .zip file, \"list_of_posts.html\" shows links to all images, posts (some of which have been deleted) and archived posts.Example:tmp.loyce.club/imagebackup/459836.html (note that the image links don't work without downloading the .zip).Replace my userID by your own:Code:tmp.loyce.club/imagebackup/USERID.htmlOn top of that page, you'll find a link to a .zip file. Or replace \"html\" by \"zip\" to go there directly.If there's no file with your userID, that means I found no embedded imgur-images for your account.9999999999 is for posts without userID.Update: if someone wants the full data, just ask. No need to download all separate .zip files.Bonus: images posted/quoted by most different accounts (full disclosure: I counted 1 more than needed for each file):Code:292x

As a Twitter user noted, Imgur has been used for years to upload photos without an account and post links to different kinds of sites. Removing those images might result in a lot of dead links all over the internet.The changes are going to take effect this Month on the 15th.",

(...)I expect a lot of people to not fully realize how valuable what you've done is; nice work!Having a copy of these images safely tucked away means that the Imgur issue can be worked on without rushing things.I hope theymos settles on an approach that involves URL substitutions being made by the image proxy, because that would fix things forum-wide without anyone having to do anything.",

That would perhaps force a new scraping. Scraping everything again would be the only way to know for sure, but I'm not going to do that again. At one page per second, it took me months to download all old posts.Quote from: Husires on May 19, 2023, 12:18:48 AMCan you display the images by topic ID or is it a little difficult?I could, but I don't think it's worth the effort. It would mean creating another set of .zip files (~150 GB) and takes quite a while to sort it out.Quote from: Timelord2067 on May 19, 2023, 01:36:26 AMSo, I delete a 20Mb gif from a post of mine (quoted from someone else) and that is then deleted from the ZIP file?No, I can't update the .zip files. That would require rescraping all posts.",

Considering the amount of resources that you had to use, and the amount of space that it currently takes on your server(s), can I kindly ask you for a way to download those files and act as a backup in case something bad happens? At this stage where the forum is at the moment - regarding deciding what solution to employ - I see having a backup of this archive as a really important thing to do.",
