  "content": "Do You Know The Basics of MixerReason of Compilation: I was checking the stats of hacks took place in the 2022 year and there i hear a term \"MIXER\" well i started to look into all the Questions related to MIXER that came to my mind. watched some videos. So, I thought i must made a post of what i learnt and may be it will benefit you. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE ALL SHOULD KNOW ABOUT MIXERS. That's what i am going to write here in short way.IntroductionWhat is a MIXER?\"As name suggests mixing up of things but in cryptocurrency case. it's the mixing up of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. It uses many cryptographic techniques to hide user's personal identities who are involved in digital/cryptocurrency transactions. These transactions take place after some delay which is beneficial for anonymous transactions.\" Why do we need MIXER?The one who prefer anonymity to his/her transactions, needed MIXER. But we have been taught that transaction took places on CEXs and DEXs are total anonymous than what need of MIXER remains there. Well Answer is, no transaction is anonymous. all of the transactions can be traced. How? Let start from basics. We can check the address of sender and receiver by searching the transaction address on the \"EXPLORER\". But wait, third person can only see your sending or receiving address not your name or personal information. Well he/she can. How? That's some technical reading purified to general terms. We can simply search the address on the google and anywhere in the whole internet the address is pasted you can see that place in the results and can find any personal account associated to that address and on the technical way, The one who want to know the personal identities of sender/buyer have to deal with the exchanges to get them give you the data you want but that's not an easy task unless you belong to regulatory organizations run by government. How Does a MIXER works?Let's understand it by an example. IF a user \"A\" wants to send BTC to \"B\" then instead of sending Directly. \"A\" will use mixer in which the mixer platform will mix up your assets with the existing assets so that no one could track the origin of assets and send them to user \"B\". Let's say if the organization does not know from where the assets are coming and to where are going then there will be no case to study there. SourceType of MIXERThere are 2 types of mixer which are Centralized and Decentralized. Centralized is the one controlled by single entityCons of Centralized MIXER1. if that single entity faces failure then the whole system will shut down and the amount of money that will be in the pool of that system will also be shut down and no one can access that pool to pix thing up until the  centralized platform restored. 2. Whole control are under that single entity. if that platform compromised or hacked by third parties than whole of your money will be gone. Decentralized MIXER developed by many peer-to-peer entities who make pool of assets and then your assets are mixed up to eliminate the trail of your money. Pros of Decentralized MIXER1. There will be no cons as of CEX Mixers instead there is less fees here. you only have to pay 0.3% for the 0.01 BTC and if your assets is less than that than it's free of cost while on the CEX side you have to pay 0.6% to 2.5% of you assets. Examples of MIXERSThere are many MIXERs are there in the market. For example COINJOIN, TORNADO, SINDBAD, Yo!Mix, Mixtura, etc. You must be wondering most of them started there journey on BITCOINTALK.  Like Coinjoin, Sinbad, Yo!Mix etc. If there are more, do let me know. ChipMixerChipMixer is one of the most used mixer in the market which used the terms of chips that will be equal to the amount of your total assets that you want to mix to remove trail of transactions. ChipMixer is a Centralized mixer which is controlled by single entity. For more details of Chip Mixer you can visit there official thread hereCOINJOINCoinjoin is the decentralized MIXER which means you would need lot of peer to start mixing up your assets plus it has some extra protection layer SinbadYou all must be aware of it, there is bounty running on this platform, It's either a decentralized or centralized i am not sure but after visiting the website i think it's decentralized platform with quick interface where you just have to insert receiver address and add delay time with liquidity fee and boom you are good to go after some time your transaction will reach the destination without leaving any trail. You can further read about SinbadYo!MixIt's an Centralized MIXER which has multiple benefits over others in some ways and vice versa. Well it even deletes all the logs to remove trail of money. You can further read about Yo!MixMixturaIt's also an Centralized platform to mix crypto assets which have it's own benefits.There are many Mixers in the market. Coverage of all of them will change the context of topic so i will just insert the link to all the mixers running in the market covered by LeGauloisThese are the list to all the BTC MIXERsThings That you Should Know About Mixers and BitcoinOne thing we should know that everything transaction leaves trail and can be trace. So what factor make payment system of bitcoin or any other asset anonymous if one can be traceable. That's why some people tend to use MIXERs. Some thought of it as illegal platform but it's not unless you are not laundering. Secondly there are those people who just are certain of the idea not to be found by others or there countries do not allow it. what ever the conditions are for you. So you want to use MIXER/tumbler, But there are 2 Cryptographic technique that are applied on MIXERs for security purposes. Deep Analysis of all the MIXER on the List mentioned above is too lengthy to discuss so just shed light on the two main cryptographic techniques to get idea. those who do not know what is cryptographic technique or what is cryptographic can read this post by Hamza2424Two Main Techniques are:1. obfuscation-basedAs the name suggest obfuscation means unclearness in the transaction. It also known as decoy-based mixers. The biggest drawback of this technique is that, tools like OXT can easily get all the data of transactions and can draw graph of it. These graphs make it easy for others to draw conclusions and predict that either this person is using MIXER or not how? this can be understand by watching this vide0 As for easiness, you can see in the picture below these spider web like lines making graph of transactions trail made by MIXER. In this video person took the example of HACKER's Transaction Detail that looted BTC from Binance. Source2. zero-knowledge-based (ZKP)Zero-Knowledge-Based Mixer uses the cryptographic technique of Zero-Knowledge-Proof (ZKP) which means also unclear things. The most advantage of this technique is that it removed the option of making any tool to draw graph. Which in return will cause barriers for the ones who want to trace you down. Detailed overview of ZKPs can be read here. Conclusion:Overall, these are the basics of MIXERS and the terms used in MIXERs that you should know about. On the other hand, MIXER do have good use-cases if you use it for good purpose just like visiting the DARK WEB is not crime while doing Illegal activities is a crime in the same way MIXER' usage is not prohibited but doing illegal activities are Prohibited. Disclaimer* This post is just for educational purposes and i am not advising anyone to try MIXER or interact with it in any way.Edited* I reposted this topic on this thread because of more broader approach so that everyone can benefit from it. Secondly, i uploaded this topic at my local community but i quoted it there because i cannot move my post from one section to another section so i just created a new thread here.",

There are different decentralized mixers, they charges different fee. There are different centralized mixers and they also charge different fees. The fee depends on the mixer that is providing the mixing service. An example of a centralized mixer is Chipmixer and it changes no fee, but you can donate.",

It was by far not a review of what you wrote, I am sure that you still have mistakes there, some are getting pointed out I see. But no problem, if you pay attention to what people will say and you'll adjust your post accordingly, you'll get it right after some time. After all, it's a learning curve also for you.Some possibly interesting points:* Chipmixer is donation based, so if one reads the FAQ he can easily mix his coins for free (only tx fees to pay)* Centralized mixers are trust based - from the trust they'll give your money back to the trust they don't keep logs. Also, it's good to know that some mixers' web page is behind CloudFlare and even if they don't keep logs, CloudFlare will probably do.",

Ok, I know from the start I'm biased here when it comes to a list of mixers, for obvious reasons, but I'm still curious how and why did you pick those three as examples. Let's go over the fact that you previously ignored the biggest and oldest, which makes this look like writing a review on e-commerce websites without amazon, but again, out of pure curiosity why those 3? I've never used them, I can see they are not the oldest around, not the cheapest, it's obviously not alphabetically order so...Don't get me wrong, I just want to know to understand what people look at when reading or exploring a website what made them more attractive than others, and had you pick them from LeGaulois list?One more thing, Tornado for example is not for BTC so you might update the lists by differentiating the coins they support",

Don't get me wrong, I just want to know to understand what people look at when reading or exploring a website what made them more attractive than others, and had you pick them from LeGaulois list? hello stompix, actually reason of selecting those was just to give examples. my target was not to briefly explain the, because there list with basic information was already on the forum. Secondly, the context of my content was originated from the mixer of Sinbad, because i was reading a report of hacks took places in 2022. and most of the hacks were performed by North Korea-Linked Hackers. and in there report they said many mixers were used to launder money by those hackers and sindbad was also one of them, (Note* i am not accusing any platform for anything. it's just something i read on the report and trying to discover more about here) Putting the image and source link if you want to read for yourself. SourceWell after reading and researching more, 10 questions came to my mind related to the activities of North Korea-Linked hackers (NKLH) and Sinbad and FTX scenario to which i want to get answers well on my own obviously. but i thought i should also write those things down and post it here. so i will maybe come up 10 more contents based on those 10 questions maybe 500 words or more. it doesn't matter for now. So i hope you find the answers to your question why i wrote these mixer here which have less reputation than others. actually i want to keep the context in a manner. Please correct me if my planning is wrong hehe.",
