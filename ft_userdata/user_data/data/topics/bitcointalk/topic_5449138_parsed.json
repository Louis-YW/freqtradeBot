  "content": "I stumbled on a thread created by @nutildah (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448111.0) and I was shocked and sad at the same time as this might be calling for a low-quality posting which I'm not ready for.I believe we as humans should always strive to be a better version of ourselves, English improvement is not an exception, and I don't think BTT should take it away from us. I've been improving my English for years as an editor and book writer, and I've participated in many strict fora, of which one of them takes polished English writing as a requisite for post-approval before I joined BTT last year. They also recommend \"Grammarly\" for English improvement.\"Grammarly,\" an English software recommended by even schools has always been my English tutor and guide for the past 3 years, which has tremendously helped me, and of now, it hardly corrects 2-4 errors in what I write (including punctuation marks) because I was strict with its tutoring. Should I now retrogress my English writing because of BTT?My average score on computer-based English tests is now 94%, so the forum should know that there 'must' be some exceptional writers. Some people coded the AI's English, and it's not from the heavens. So, it will be unfair to tag the post of a few exceptional English writers on the forum AI-generated when they are 100% innocent.I was sad with the results seen when I decided to use two of the links (https://writer.com/ai-content-detector & https://x.writefull.com/gpt-detector) posted by @nutildah to test two of my written posts. The first post tested 100% and 99% human respectively. But the second post (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448086.msg62104267#msg62104267) tested 47% and 23% human respectively. This is absurd and unjust!Personally, I love writing, I possibly don't know why I would want an AI to write a piece of cake for me. But thankfully, some people kicked against the idea, yet I want this to be a case study for the people concerned in the forum.Peace!",

Even the best posters who are native English speakers don't necessarily write every post using the precision in punctuation, spelling & grammar executed by ChatGPT. If a user's native language isn't English (as can be evidenced by their posting history), and they suddenly start posting in flawless English, it means one of two things:[...]One indicator said by nutildah is if the improvement happened in one night from a messy English to a flawless ones. I didn't look at your post history, but if I may draw a conclusion from your post above, your main language is not English and you're gradually improving your skills; vocabularies, grammars, phrases, slangs, etc. On that case, I don't see why you should feel shock or saddened with the thread, given it barely matched your criteria, nor that I find any part on that thread that encourage people, implicitly or explicitly, to deliberately \"retrogress\" their english writing on BTT just to avoid being detected as AI.The forum always encourages improvement. There are literally threads filled with suggestion for non-english speakers to use a translator and then to double check the grammar with grammarly or other similar software to let them post something that's close to a perfect english. So thinking that the forum would prefer you to \"downgrade\" your english is somewhat baseless.",

This is my corrected version of the sentence above.Â  I know I did improper grammar in the first example. I know that stream of consciousness was misspelled.I simply ask you if I did a google search and found this belowhttps://astrologicalpsychology.org/james-joyce-stream-of-consciousness/Which allowed me to spell it correctly did I cheat? Â  Do I give it a credit for showing me how to spell stream of consciousness correctly. Not needed in the first sentence as I did not get proper spelling. I would argue any correction made via a google search or a spell check simply does not need to be listed as a source.Â So if I write all of the above and ask an AI to polish it up am I cheating?Which btw is why I did a deliberate choice to write stream of Consciousness style when I blog.Â Please compare the first sentence with thousands of my posts and you will read do that style often.The last part of this post was stream of Consciousness :Â I do not spend the time to check all spelling and grammar as I want to get the idea out as it unfolds in my head in real-time.",

Their silliness started when chatAI acted as a source of quality improvement, but it turned out to have a negative impact on the authenticity of the posters in the forum. I agree that the people behind the skills who use AI must be eradicated.If you want to look smart and proficient but not from the original results of your own thoughts or writing, in the end, that person will be left behind by those who are still pouring out their content and ideas so what's wrong with never stopping learning?Quote from: Lucius on March 13, 2023, 04:04:07 PMFor any signature spammer or for anyone who just wants to look \"very intelligent\" such things are a real blessing, especially for those who have alt farms with which they abuse sig campaigns. Let's say that this is perhaps the lesser evil because as you say, it would be really tragic if what some call \"advance in technology\" actually turns out to be something that will further distance people from each other.",
