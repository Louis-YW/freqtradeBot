They won but were voided. Multiple books paid within hours. It took Betnomi a month to settle after lying (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5279745.msg61221853#msg61221853). Never could confirm the amounts were correct as bet history remained unavailable. T&Cs state SOW requests for deposits above $5000 (https://betnomi.com/aml - source of wealth section). Mine were nowhere near. Still sent a P&L slip from a UKGC licensed site anyway but \"gambling winnings are not a source of funds\". Literally never seen that before. I don't have any other source listed in the terms.My proof of address and ID was accepted though and shortly after, direct access from the UK was rescinded. That it was offered in the first place was a breach of licence (\"the license holder is not authorized to offer its services in the territories of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, France, Netherlands, Australia, UK, Spain, Saba, Statia, St Martin, USA - https://licensing.gaming-curacao.com/validator/?lh=21553d5c3ce834363384f6d90dca0bcf). Again, contrary to T&Cs, where they defer responsibility. Lost access to account after that.Have spent months waiting for an email from the Curacao regulator and I got a copied and pasted post from here as an serious response. And months for a reply to The Pogg as a ADR, who had to drop the case as Betnomi stopped responding to them. The deposits by the way have been held all this time, not to mention the winnings.So that's voiding winners, no confirmation of settlement, breached license, no withdrawal, no ADR response. Pretty good.Images: bet history: https://i.imgur.io/jn1nmIn_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumTransactions showing there was activity: https://i.imgur.io/84ZUnEu_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumVerification: https://i.imgur.io/zBwzQ7i_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumhttps://i.imgur.io/M8gEoha_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumWithdrawal rejected straight away: https://i.imgur.io/fHcA675_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumhttps://i.imgur.io/guhBdfl_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumhttps://i.imgur.io/1qp9rMQ_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=mediumDucking The Pogg: https://i.imgur.io/htVtnVL_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium",

      "body": "We have responded to your accusations on our main thread multiple times for several months, even though you endlessly spammed us. This will be our final response concerning this case. First, you engaged in fraudulent betting activities on our website, and we took the appropriate actions and requested a simple KYC, which you have been unable to complete to date.Second, you filed a complaint against us with the Curacao gaming authorities, which is right in this regard, so great job! We had a lengthy conversation with the regulators and addressed all their questions. Since you filed a formal complaint, we assume you would continue to engage with the regulators to resolve the issue and raising any objections if you have one, but that sounds like too much work for you. You instead take the easy route and accuse the curacao regulators of being irresponsible and copy-pasting responses from forumswhich is an exciting charge. You then immediately started filling complaints with ADRs and whatnot. This is a rather disturbing thing to do; you have a pending case with the regulators, and since that is not going your way, you bowed out and tried to flood us with complaints from everywhere. For a single case, we have to interface and discuss that with three different entities with whom you reported the case. If this were a court of law, a judge would throw these away without even looking because no one has the time or resources to dispense in such a wasteful manner.  Again, if you have any objections, we are happy to work with the Curacao authorities whenever they reach out to us; outside of that, we are not interested in responding to every entity with whom you made a report. After looking at your Trustpilot reviews, it is clear that you are pretty much an extortionistStep one: Engage in fraud on sports betting platforms, hoping they don't noticeStep two: If they ever do, accuse them of being a fraud or a scam, turn on your excuse generator, and make as many pointless excuses as possibleStep three: If they resist, get to work!  Put out an endless stream of negative reviews and complaints with multiple organizations concurrently, forcing them to bend to your willStep four: Pray with fingers crossed and hope they bend the knee and finally payoutStep five: Cashout and repeat on another platformIt's a nice hustle, but unfortunately for you, we have seen this too many times, and we will not let this cycle continueat the very minimum, not on our platform. We will close any fraudulent account regardless of your pressure tactics. Trustpilot account reviewing every sportsbook you ever used as a SCAMThis is outside our purview, but little advice for you; if you find yourself in a situation where everyone and everything appears to be the problem, it is wise to look again; you may be the problem.",

Looks like there's a pattern of crying fraud when things don't go your way, see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5317524.0 and https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5419897.20 and this stone cold classic where you doxxed someone like a psycho https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5289045.0.   Since you've form for releasing private information, and are stalking my Trustpilot, hope my address or ID doesn't just get released by 'accident'.The fraud was winning some (some not all) bets. Sorry. Don't have a sportsbook if you don't like losing. Now we've cleared the first lie, the second; any regulator that sends a literal forum post as an official response is not much of a regulator. Anyway, they stopped responding in January (https://i.imgur.io/dAjhWfy_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium). Not my purview, but if you gonna lie, be more creative. A licensed UK based ADR is more rigorous and you know it, because you wanted no part in helping them. Poika5: I have bank statements of my own savings with income now and then from gambling sites, misgivings about whether the data will be safe aside. All stuff I use regularly in the UK to verify for bills, credit etc. But even if Betnomi accepted them, I would still need to see my bet history first. I have my own screenshots of the bet slips, and the results are higher than the balance. I believe they've hidden my bet history because they knowingly underpaid. Now it's too late for them to back down and they're trying to justify it.If I'm wrong, there's an easy way to find out.",

      "body": "The idea that your Bet history has been deleted is ridiculous and an outright lie. There are clear rules governing data retention, and besides, the transaction history isn't just stored in our system but also in the system of the odds feed provider, so stop making such obviously false claims. Betnomi does not store such data in its system regarding ID and other user identification documents. A reputable and trusted provider handles our identity verification process like most websites do.  In this specific case, the sports feed provider voided the Bets because their risk management system and team identified them as fraudulent.After an initial conversation with the user, we requested the provider change those Bets' status from Returned/Voided to a Win to resolve the situation. However, we need to ensure the user doesn't come back and repeat the same thing and hence the request for the user to complete our KYC process. Interestingly, he has been unable to complete the KYC process, and we will maintain our stance on the situation. We were fair enough to reverse the decision of the provider to void the bets in the first place. Your inability to complete the KYC process is what's in the way and nothing else. It's interesting how you keep saying other websites paid out that Bet. If you have websites that are paying out your Bets, why do you need to play on so many websites when you have problems everywhere? From what we can count, you have negative things to say about 7 Sportsbook, from limiting you to blocking your withdrawals.Why not play at the same place that pays you out? Of course, you cannot do that because they immediately block you after determining your pattern of behavior. Some platforms, such as ourselves, have a better risk management system, are familiar with these patterns, and can easily identify them straight away. The bottom line is you are provably a fraud.",

I also noted that according to ToS, Betnomi asks for source of funds only if deposits are above 5k which is not the case.Anyway, if OP is unemployed, he can still provide gambling winnings as evidence that support his \"affordability\" in relation to his bets with Betnomi. UK Gambling Commission may request source of funds as well. Yet, they are fine with bank statements with gambling profits as a source of funds. See no reason why Betnomi will not accept it. What a bookie is checking with ''source of funds'' are the legitimacy of deposits and the affordability of the user to place bets, having a regular job is irrelevant.",

Show it.Not looking so ridiculous now. So what's the consequences, Betnomi can just get away with not paying, and that's it? Makes the whole accusations thing pretty toothless.@betnomi has explained in detail about your accusation, the current situation and what steps you need to follow. Even then you are busy discussing different things without paying attention to that. If you are the original owner of the account and have not done anything suspicious then there should be no problem in doing KYC. I will wait to see what solution comes to your accusation.Or we can go round and round about the KYC, that's an option also.If you want to solve this problem then you should help them too. Yes it's true they are holding your funds in their system, but they are also offering you a solution. You can also follow the KYC option if they don't give you any solution even after doing KYC then definitely complain more against them here. Then this accusation against them will be more solid.",

For a $1800 deposit, again lower than Betnomi requires. In what decade do you suggest I complete it in?",

Because it has become a system for gambling websites to force users to kyc at any time. So it remains to be seen how your problem will be resolved, as you have already complained against them in various places.",
