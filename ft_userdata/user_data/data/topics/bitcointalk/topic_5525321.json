To me, you appear like a slate without having anything to show yet..Mind you, you may need to start engaging in the forum to build reputation and prove you're worthy of your claim as a developer and how good you are in technical skills. Trust me, if you are really good in what you do, clients will start looking for you.",

Just like other field, you'll have hard time landing jobs without some related experience. But there are some program which help you to get knowledge or experience, such as https://brink.dev/programs.",

Im not going to give you any specific advice, but I will tell you what Ive learned from my own experience in this space.Ive been in crypto for a while now.  Seen some crazy stuff - huge gains, painful losses and  made some good calls, made some bad ones too.  You cant predict this market, thats for sure.  But more than anything diving deep into this technology has been an education.  Now I understand blockchain and smart contracts way more than I did a few years ago.  Does that make me an expert? Heck no.  I still got lots to learn.  But if Ive gained one thing from my time in this wild west, its perspective.  Sure I want to make money, but Im also fascinated watching this technology take shape.  Where will it go next? How can I get involved? These are common questions that beginners often ask. But ultimately, only you can answer these questions for yourself.Another important thing Ive learned is that crypto is not for everyone. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme. And it takes time, effort, and patience to succeed in this space. If you are still interested in getting involved, I would recommend learning as much as you can about the technology. There are a lot of resources available online, and there are also a number of communities where you can connect with other people who are interested in crypto. I would also recommend being realistic about your expectations. Start with something small and simple, and build your way up. This can generally be applied to anything we start for the first time.",

In this case crypto, so you can try doing a couple of projects on your own like your own shitcoin on a chain, open source contributions, and/or code review as well if possible. There are also start-up IT companies out there that are more crypto oriented so if you're able to find one you can jump start yourself from there since startups are usually great in terms of making you move (rushed a f most of the time though).",
