  "content": "So my take on having an expensive gadget like a phone!!Why would anyone buy an iPhone 15 or any good phone, costing above 500k, solely to fit in or want to make everyone feel they are rich? The only time I could agree to buy such an expensive phone is when I want to use it for business or to create content that will give me money because of its high camera quality. Otherwise, I can't buy such costly phones. Some people buy these phones due to peer pressure because their other friends have them and they want to too. I would suggest that, if you do get one, utilize it to create content for social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram until you gather a significant audience and become eligible to earn from it.I understand that some people enjoy luxurious items, which is perfectly fine if they can afford them with their hard-earned money. My concern is why some people go to great lengths to get these expensive phones solely for the sake of fitting in.",

If your money is enough to get one, I don't think it's a bad thing.",

Yeah, that's because they indeed have the money, and it's not really bad what those kinds of people chose to do with their money, and you can't be against them or question how they are spending the money. The reason is because they have built for themselves a plentiful source of income, which is constantly replenishing their pockets and bank accounts with money.People that should be cautioned  are those common men and women who do not really have any good business; neither do they have their company or any real job that is paying them at least $3k per month. Those are people that should be cautioned for spending so much money to buy the iPhone 15, meanwhile they still have a lot more important things to do with money. For example, they need to establish themselves so well that they will not really be affected if they take out huge amounts of money to spend on luxury. QuoteOtherwise, I can't buy such costly phones. Currently, you might not have a need for it now, but there's a financial stage you'll get to, and you will want to get it. Call it show-off or whatever.",

Previously I used to say that I can't spend big money in buying iPhone, but a time came when I developed capacity and I had the money and there was need for me to get an iPhone, I got myself the iPhone without stress and when I started using the Phone I saw a big difference between an iPhone and android. You cant criticize what you don't have simply because you can't afford it at the moment. If you are an iPhone user I don't think you will make this post. Poverty has made us think that life is supposed to be managed and not to be enjoyed. Sometimes people buy things for prestige and you can't take that fact away. If you can say thigs what will you say about those buying Lamborghini and other exotic cars and drinks. Let every man live their life according to their means.",

But I will do better next time. My reason for posting this was because of an incident that happened this evening.I don't have any wahala with anyone that wants to buy an iPhone 15 or any time of phone.

If you don't want to buy an expensive phone like that, then you should speak for yourself and stop speaking for everyone. You're not in their pocket, OP. So you don't know their net worth, and you should not be concerned about the money people spend on their personal items. What might have been more interesting to talk about would have been the disadvantages of spending on expensive gadgets when you don't have a sustainable business, or some other topics. At least that could be relatable but judging the iPhone 15 users is wrong. Since they have the money to buy an iPhone 15, then I believe they have the means to take good care of themselves, which is not a problem.",

I've been with someone that said he cannot use an android phone again except iPhone, then bought an iPhone of 100k+ but he cannot afford money for subscription, he only active on social media once in a month.   I even advise him not to bought the phone but that is what he wish.",

Owning an iPhone 15 would be nice after I've invested the money and then I use the interest in getting the phone. For those who are getting iPhones, it's cause they have the money, but I'm not them and they're not me, making it a personal endeavor.  Whoever wants to fit in must have their reasons. Oppression literally kills, so I won't judge a person even if they're getting it to belong. But where I'd begin to judge a person is when they sacrifice something that's really important just so they can have a few friends. For example, sacrificing your health, or your education.  Whoever can't accept you without a phone shouldn't be your friend. If something bad happens to you after getting the phone they would still insult you saying you're trying to live a fake life and stuff. Regardless though, an iPhone can also be seen as an asset,  so if you can get one.",

I'm not trying to undervalue our naira but in just trying to check something when you called that as a big figure. It's actually to some people but the truth is that we have lost value of our currency. Some few years ago, IPhone 6 was selling for ₦35k but today due to naira increased, it is now around ₦75k, that's almost times two of what we use to buy them.Concerning the volume of money to buy iPhone, I think we all have what we love, there are people I know that when it come to dresses and fashion, it's zero like their fashion sense is zero but if they hear about a gadget and accessories, they can empty their saving to get it, that's how some people view iPhone. They want to have the latest update and feel what it's to have the latest updated version of new device, so don't blame them for liking what they love.But there is this mentality Nigerians have, they think that anyone that hold a 3 eye camera iPhone automatically have money, that's a wrong perspective, it is killing the society because everyone now eager to hold iPhone to impress people that they have money but deep down, their account balance has nothing.",
