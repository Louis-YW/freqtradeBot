PS. i would say sorry for having to bringing it here for everyone to see eddie, but you are the one that just ignored my multiple attempts to reach you on telegram to try to straighten this out... you should not favor the diamond players only, and stop shafting the lower levels, like maybe i would not have a problem with it, if it was called the plat 4 + vip top monthly, but it is not, its called the VIP top monthly, and Gold level, is most definately a vip level.",

I'm not a VIP member and I'm far from being a huge bettor. Nevertheless I'm interested as to what will be the reward that the OP wanted to get it?So again, Stake has the final say who they wanted to reward, and unfortunately, the OP didn't get it.",

As others have mentioned, you should have showed proofs that you are; ranked at gold VIP in stake platform. If you've finished on the higher tier of the race, it would really be a problem to the gambling platform to ignore giving your rewards especially if you are eligible of it and if this story is true. Not to be biased but Stake is quite having a good name already, why would they even put dirt on their reputation just because of something they are the ones who offered it in the first place? You may also contact their support 'coz delays are possible (but never experienced it when it comes to their bonuses, fortunately). Provide support to your accusation and for sure this community will help you out if and only if this is true.",

I believe there are so many players wagered million dollars in December due to the Christmas promotions in Stake. You are still in Gold level and assuming you are close enough to Platinum 1, it means that your total wager is no more than $250k so far. Honestly, I have never wagered more than $200k in a month at Stake even though I'm now at Platinum II. So I'm curious about your claim that you have wagered more than other players who received the top monthly vip players. Does it mean that most top monthly players during in December has wagered less than $250k? I doubt it.",

Your complaint if properly looked into might likely be a situation of terms and conditions but however, I will suggest you show evidence because this is just a mere write-up which literally does not portray itself as evidential fact. For you to be able to do that you will have to register as a copper member so you could be able to upload pictorial excerpts as I can see your account is a new bie. With what you are saying, it is more of an accusation against stake which stake would need to clarify things as it is associated with them but before all these, we will need to see evidence as it will guide through to know if your claims are genuine.",

Do you read the game/reward terms and conditions because some amendments are made at some point base on the number of participants to make the best user get the reward?
