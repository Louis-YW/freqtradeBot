  "content": "ok, so im sure you are all aware of this reward that stake offers, but they have a reward that they give out that is called the top VIP players of the month reward. now i am a gold VIP rank at stake, and i was screwed out of that bonus. i finished in the higher end of the top vip players for the month of december, like i had a higher standing then more then half of the people that received the reward, but they refused to give me the reward, saying because i am not at vip level platnium 4. this is completely obsurd, considering 1. the reward is called the \"top VIP player of the month\", and Gold level, is VIP, like the reward is not called VIP platnium 4+ players of  month, so this is just not right for them to refuse to give me the reward, like i literally finished in higher standing then more then half of the players that got the reward, which was confirmed by support of my standing... that is classism at its finest, like they say no bets will go un noticed, meanwhile they turn around and do this to me. this is unfair, and i just thought that i should bring this here , so that everybody can see how fake and biased stake actually is. PS. i would say sorry for having to bringing it here for everyone to see eddie, but you are the one that just ignored my multiple attempts to reach you on telegram to try to straighten this out... you should not favor the diamond players only, and stop shafting the lower levels, like maybe i would not have a problem with it, if it was called the plat 4 + vip top monthly, but it is not, its called the VIP top monthly, and Gold level, is most definately a vip level.",

I'm not a VIP member and I'm far from being a huge bettor. Nevertheless I'm interested as to what will be the reward that the OP wanted to get it?So again, Stake has the final say who they wanted to reward, and unfortunately, the OP didn't get it.",

As others have mentioned, you should have showed proofs that you are; ranked at gold VIP in stake platform. If you've finished on the higher tier of the race, it would really be a problem to the gambling platform to ignore giving your rewards especially if you are eligible of it and if this story is true. Not to be biased but Stake is quite having a good name already, why would they even put dirt on their reputation just because of something they are the ones who offered it in the first place? You may also contact their support 'coz delays are possible (but never experienced it when it comes to their bonuses, fortunately). Provide support to your accusation and for sure this community will help you out if and only if this is true.",

I believe there are so many players wagered million dollars in December due to the Christmas promotions in Stake. You are still in Gold level and assuming you are close enough to Platinum 1, it means that your total wager is no more than $250k so far. Honestly, I have never wagered more than $200k in a month at Stake even though I'm now at Platinum II. So I'm curious about your claim that you have wagered more than other players who received the top monthly vip players. Does it mean that most top monthly players during in December has wagered less than $250k? I doubt it.",

Your complaint if properly looked into might likely be a situation of terms and conditions but however, I will suggest you show evidence because this is just a mere write-up which literally does not portray itself as evidential fact. For you to be able to do that you will have to register as a copper member so you could be able to upload pictorial excerpts as I can see your account is a new bie. With what you are saying, it is more of an accusation against stake which stake would need to clarify things as it is associated with them but before all these, we will need to see evidence as it will guide through to know if your claims are genuine.",

For the reward you claim was scripted off from you, the title given to the reward/game does matter. Do you read the game/reward terms and conditions because some amendments are made at some point base on the number of participants to make the best user get the reward? Terms and conditions are what's important in any game or reward hosted by a casino.
