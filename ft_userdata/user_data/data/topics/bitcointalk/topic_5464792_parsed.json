      "body": "Because Nigerians are paying the evil fee, do not think all newly registered accounts from some other countries in Africa are paying it.Not only the countries in Africa that will pay the evil fee. There are some other countries among, especially Asia and any other countries with people that are spamming on this forum, irrespective of the country that they are.You can try and use VPN to avoid the fee (but know that some VPN are blacklisted). Or newly registered user can go for Whitelisting:Remove Proxyban (evil fees) - email to get whitelisted for freeIt is very possible that not all countries in Africa that will pay the evil fee, but theymos and moderators can best know the African countries that will pay it.",

      "body": "Not only Africa boss. Other countries from other continents too still have to pay, if there's a high degree of evil points associated with their IP. This evil points comes when spammers are banned from that IP which will also affect its surrounding Ip. When new people tries creating account from such banned ip, it is then required of them to pay the evil fees( few Satoshi). Just as @Charles-Tim has said, you can use a good VPN to register, but if it's IP's also has been blacklisted try another VPN. Or you can try the email whitelisting that is if you really want to join the forum for good reasons and not to spam.Heres are some working VPN you can try Proton mail Thunder vpnNorde vpnTurbo vpn",

This will let you know if spammers already used that ip and the IP has some evil points associated to it. After that you can then email for whitelistingQuote from: LoyceV on July 20, 2021, 03:59:04 PM How to get your Proxyban removed?I can only whitelist you if I know you exist.",

It makes me wonder: why would you want to create more accounts?  That was rhetorical, this is what I think: you've had several other bounty spam accounts banned, and now your IP address has collected units of evil. So when you try to create more accounts, the proxyban anti spam protection is doing it's job and stopping you. I won't whitelist any of your accounts.",

Yes it is normal to be suspicious but then, I'm learned and I understand what you are trying to point out.Mind you, from Bounty Detective group I'm being asked to have at least 40 activities before I could earn from their bounties.To achieve that, I discovered there are other platforms here that do same thing they do and also to reach that benchmark, I have to engage this community and learn along side.My articles has never been a copy and paste mate.

Even if you use a VPN, you can't be that jobless to start trying it for all African countries.Personally, I don't see a fair use for the proxy ban when some new accounts could still be whitelisted, and people using VPNs to open new accounts. Good moderation would have done the job as in all forums, even with the stricter ones I've seen. This proxy ban approach would have made some skilled and genuine people abandon their accounts due to the evil tag. Paying for an offence they did not commit is gross and they might never think of coming back, while many of those who committed the evil become more experienced with the forum and use VPNs to open other accounts.Talking about VPN, it reminds me of the stress I went through when I opened my account. It could have been easier for me if I had known about VPN registration then. It took me about a month in a bid to whitelist the account, and all the suggested accounts to be mailed were mailed but none of them with \"protonmail\" responded to the mail. Not to talk of trying to query the person to know whether to accept or decline the request.Thanks to @sfr.edits with a Gmail account, he was the only one who replied after a while and even apologised for the lateness. It was after some back-and-forth email exchanges between us that made him eventually whitelisted my account.",
