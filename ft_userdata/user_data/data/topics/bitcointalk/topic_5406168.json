  "content": "Hi, over the years I have opened various accounts with Blockchain.com ....never sold or bought via their exchange....just imported private keys/BTC from cold storage & then sent them on wherever I wanted. Today I went online and it said the verification rules had changed & I needed to verify my account, but because I have multiple accounts it wouldn't let me verify the ones I tried. Now, after reading some threads online, I think verification is only needed if you want to trade on their exchange and isn't needed for storing BTC or sending it to a third party. Does anyone know if this is correct? TIA.",

Quote from: https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/4538509612572-Common-questions-about-our-updated-verification-requirementsFor increased order limits in the Blockchain.com Wallet, as well as the ability to place card orders or deposit funds from a bank account, a Verified account is required. A Verified account is also required in order to use the Blockchain.com Exchange.But I will not recommend blockchain wallet due to many reasons, going for better onces like Electrum is a good option. Email is not required if a wallet is truly noncustodial.",

TIA.If you have imported private keys/BTC from cold storage then you can still spend those coins without having to return to Blockchain.com account or access to it as long as you still have that key and there are still some coins in that address.and Yes, you dont need to pass KYC if you want to use Blockchain.com account or recover it.",

It's this topic that should be moved. See bottom-left link \"Move topic\".As said, your bitcoin should be used with a better wallet, like Electrum (just make sure you download it from https://electrum.org and verify it)If you have the private keys it may go easy, you just restore your wallets directly in Electrum and no need to ever touch blockchain.com again.(I didn't understand what is the \"cold storage\" you think you're using and where you get the private keys from, so maybe I've got part of my answer wrong).Make sure your computer doesn't have viruses.Also, if the amounts of money there are significant, consider buying a hardware wallet, generate a new wallet on that one and transfer your funds there.And if you have questions, ask here, one by one, until everything is cristal clear.",

Why on earth would anyone use the blockchain.com to import those wallets? This is probably the least secure method you could choose.
