  "content": "I asked a question a month ago but no response, probably because most of you do not care about multi-asset mode. This is the question: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5433093.msg61546702#msg61546702It is about other exchanges that support multi-asset mode, I have been using only one exchange for it for now, the other exchange I want to use for it said that I should have at least $50000 worth of asset on their exchange before I can use multi-asset mode, but on the first exchange, I can use even $50 to make use of the multi-asset mode. Coin marginCoin margin means you have to open position with a particular coin, like bitcoin. Which means you will earn bitcoin if you make profit. Bitcoin as the profit.USD marginUSD margin mode divided into 2:Single-asset and multi-asset modeIn multi-asset you can use supported coins to earn stable coins if you make profit from the position opened. You can add more unstable coins the exchange support for multi-asset mode which would be left on the future trading account and it would be added as stable coin that can be used to open a position. The profit is in stable coin.In this time like this, I prefer to just deposit bitcoin to earn USDT. Is there any other exchanges that support it than Binance? OKX support it but only when you have $50000 on your exchange account that you have with them. You can reply this on the link thread given above. The main reason for this thread is to know if you as a trader like multi-asset mode? Or you just prefer to go for coin margin instead and open position for individual coins? Why do you not like multi-asset mode as I think most of you do not go for it?",

Your earnings were in BTC and when you withdrew your profits it was also in BTC. The issue with this was obvious what happen back in Nov 2018 and during Covid crash.When BTC goes down and you are long your collateral uses value and your position also losses value. So you are losing basically 2 times. With stable coins it fixes this because you don’t have to worry about it. Plus using something like BTC as collateral for many long alt positions also would be risky since it would be very difficult to track liquidation levels.",

      "body": "The use of multi-asset mode can vary from exchange to exchange, with some exchanges having stricter requirements for users to be able to access it. The $50000 requirement you mentioned is likely to be a measure taken by the exchange in order to reduce risk for themselves, as well as to ensure that users who access this feature have a certain level of experience and knowledge about trading.Coin margin is a popular option for many traders as it allows them to directly earn the coin they are using to open a position, which can be more straightforward for some users. On the other hand, USD margin mode (single-asset or multi-asset) is a way to trade crypto assets where you are basically trading with stablecoin (USDT) base, hence your return will also be in stablecoin. It can be useful for hedging the crypto assets against the volatility and also opening more positions with less capital as margin.As for your question, some traders may prefer to stick with coin margin mode as it's a more traditional and straightforward way to trade. However, others may prefer to use multi-asset mode because it offers more flexibility in terms of what assets can be used to open positions and what assets can be earned as profit.It's also worth noting that there are many crypto-exchanges available on the market, with different features and trading options, Binance is a popular one, but you can also check other reputable crypto-exchanges such as Bitmex, Bybit, KuCoin, etc. to see if they offer USD margin and multi-asset trading option, as well as checking their requirements and fees before sign up.",

You can see how bitcoin and altcoin increased recently, I have them on the multi-asset account, but just little amount for trading. If it is during bear market, multi-asset mode will be more risky.Quote from: mendace on January 10, 2023, 07:35:58 PMThe use of multi-asset mode can vary from exchange to exchange, with some exchanges having stricter requirements for users to be able to access it.

Multi-asset mode is more risky because altcoins are part of the coins and the market can become very volatile at anytime. Probably they may do that for their own safety but not the safety of their users.Quote from: mendace on January 10, 2023, 07:35:58 PMIt's also worth noting that there are many crypto-exchanges available on the market, with different features and trading options, Binance is a popular one, but you can also check other reputable crypto-exchanges such as Bitmex, Bybit, KuCoin, etc. to see if they offer USD margin and multi-asset trading option, as well as checking their requirements and fees before sign up.That is certain, I do check trading fee before I sign up on an exchange, it is very important. I also check bitcoin withdrawal fee. I have been using Kucoin for like 3 or 4 months now, it does not support multi-asset mode. I can not just be registering on individual exchanges to look for the exchanges that support multi-asset mode, that is the reason I created the last topic I referred to above, for people that are using the exchange that support it to let me know about the exchanges.",

Obviously, it's best to use a crypto exchange with a lesser fee, and as long as the feature that you are looking for are available on them. I think it's possible to check a feature of the exchange without the need of registering on them. You can just do a research either outside or on this forum but having a thread here like what you did should help you as well. Other requirements like their limits and then the KYC should also come in mind before it interferes us later on.",

Trading is risky but if a trader will gain or not depends on how good the trader is. After a long severe and significant bear market, a good trader can go for multi-asset mode in a way he will just leave the coin on unstable coins and trade USD margin. In long term, the trader should make some profit if he trades probably.",

      "body": "I think the multi-asset mode is really a good option in trading considering that you can keep your profits at a same value and not lose when the market is getting low and you are not trading. But every option, single or multi asset mode, has the risk. If you are good at trading then you will end up with good profit despite the market condition and price movements. So this totally a personal preference because if you are good at something specific and making good profit from it, why should you move to other option unless you are loosing in it.",

When we keep dividing everything we make sure our money is going into different assets in such way that they will be profiting us based on that particular projects progress. If we rely on single asset and having all the money on it then it poses a high risk because all your fate depends on only single asset and their progress. At least in multi one we will be able to stay nearby BEP considering every project will performing up and down all the time. They will be able to balance out perfectly so as to keep up with the market needs and stay in plus. In the long run lets say we have 50% btc and multiple alts distributed amongst the other 50% then obviously btc might be able to recover the all the losses that may happen in the alt side of crypto. This is just theory based assumptions but it has to be considered likewise, it could be reverse of this.",
