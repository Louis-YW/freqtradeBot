What do you say.No one actually knows on what would happen in June which all the thing we can do is to speculate or anticipate on what are the things that might happen.We've bearish for all month of May which i had seen that most people on the market had expected for it to be a good one but it do goes on opposite direction on what we are anticipate but well its a very commonscenario that things do happen into this market do really move on a random or unpredictable way.No one could precisely able to know nor predict on what would be the marketconditions be like on next months thats why each analysis would neither be effective or simply fails.",

      "body": "Few forces will face each other in next weeks:1- \"Sell in may and go away\". I heard about it for the first time in 2015 when I started to trade stocks. I've never been able to take a vacation from May until the end of the summer because I'm addicted to the markets, but I always promise myself that next time I'll listen, because usually the summer months are either boredom or downsides.2- BTC is about to close 9th red week in a raw. this have never happened before. 1 green dildo is more than expected. Especially that fear and greed index is as low as during covid panic sell or oct 2018 (panic sell from 6k to 4k - bottom before pump to 14k).3- FED rising rates and expected global recesion that bitcoin have never seen before. We may be faaar from true bottom especially that markets can bleed for next 15 years like from 1966 - 1980 when we last time had 10% inflation in US.",

I'm not thinking that same way with you. It is still going to stay as it moves slightly up and largely down because that is still the trend until a huge news is going to hit the market and bitcoin correction up can happen but now we are staying on the speculation table as the June pass out.",

      "body": "Many projects have now lost 95-98% of their value, a good time to buy. Long-term investors don't care if June is up or down. There will be growth, there will be profit, there will be a fall, they will buy more cheap coins. Investors are prepared for whatever happens, speculators are more likely to panic and sell on dips, what shouldn't do. In any case, use the fall of the market as an opportunity to make money, not to count the losses. I buy well-known major projects that are now rapidly falling in price, when the market enters a bullish phase, these coins will show themselves on the positive side.",

What do you say. look at all the coins most of them are affected by the bitcoin price which is dropping a couple of days ago. I believe that buying this point of time will not harm our capital most of the coins are now dropping and it means all of them are discounted from thier price during bullish market, just buy good coins and stop looking at them everyday just look at the coins when market become bullish again and you will surely earn, i am holding altcoins from 2017 till present but i still feel frustrated when i look at my fortpolio today all are dropping and the value is really frustrating that is why i suggest to stop looking at the coin today and begin to look at them during bull season begin.",

What do you say.I can't even say anything about this, this prediction will not come true. We didn't even know what will be happening with the bitcoin and altcoins market. It seems like that if crypto may face a small recovery but this time it's too good to be true. Even during a few months ago and bitcoin was always experiencing the dump. Saying if this will recover or rise in june was a non sense thing even if that may be possible to happen. I just remind you bitcoin has been changing some months that have positive chart into the negative chart.",

      "body": "Judging from the current market in particular BTC/USD is trading in a range of $28,326.61 to $29,335.03, and that represents mild volatility over the last 24 hours. Trading volume has decreased by 28%, totaling $29.91 billion, while the total traded market cap is around $549.65 billion, and that results in a market dominance of around 45%.and we can also see on the 4-hour chart. it is clear that there will be a continued decline.it can be concluded that the decline is still strong and seems to be targeting $27,500. so in early June maybe the bear market will continue. but we don't know for mid june and end june. I hope market conditions will recover and improve.Even if we look at the weekly chart we see 9 consecutive red candles on BTC/USD. which shows how strong the bear market is this year.",

So I think, how about you?",

The global market was also facing the same issue like bitcoin. I don't wanna being too optimistic with the market. It's better to realize about the fact and try to take the opportunity from the market. People understand it so well.

What do you say.Precisely now is a good opportunity to buy. Coins that I think are very good are Bitcoin and ethereum because these coins are more convincing for any long-term investment. Until the target we want is achieved that's when we sell everything. But if you ask if the June market will go up I can't guarantee it will happen because this is tantamount to predicting. Even if according to chart data, there is no definite sign that the market will rise in June. but who knows it could also be a reality.",

What do you say.The price of altcoins continues to drop against Bitcoin. Currently, bitcoin price is consolidating losses near $29k, not recovering its support zone. There is still a 10% drop in ETH and it is trading below $1800. There are other major altcoins that are also surviving, and it's almost certain that none will outperform Bitcoin. Keeping hoping that things will work out once again, not sure when the market will start to rise, June or afterward. There is no specific month or date yet, so keep track of the market movement until then.",

What do you say. The answer to this question is as vague as the question.A new month coming does not change everything. Nobody can predict what will happen but judging from recent trends, a bear market may continue or the chances of a flipping to happen soon is also there. But of course none of this is clear right now and it is best not to dwell on such thoughts because they end up draining your mental strength and physical strength.Of course we should all hope for betterment, the war to end and not another pandemic to happen, but things are fragile and we need to be prepared. This starts with being diligent in what you invest in, not to invest in shitcoins that make a lot of noise.",
