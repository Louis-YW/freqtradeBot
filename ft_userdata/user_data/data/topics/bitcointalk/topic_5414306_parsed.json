  "content": "What if prisons were given license to operate a casino will it be safe for inmates . A similar incidence happened between 1932 and 1967 in  Nevada State Prison. Despite not having licence to operate the casino existed for over 35 years and ever since then nothing of this kind has ever occurred. QuoteThroughout its 35 years, various wardens either tolerated the casino or considered it a worthwhile distraction for the inmates. This changed in 1967 when a bill in the State Legislature to prohibit prison gaming was defeated in the Senate. Shortly thereafter, the State Prison Board used its authority to close the casino. The sandstone building which housed the casino was demolished.It is interesting to note that this casino had no licence and wasn't recognised by the Nevada gaming authorities but the inmates ensured there was no cheating there by creating a self policing system.",

And it you look at it, that was the time wherein casinos are controlled by the mob and I would say that they have much influence in the gambling industry in that era that prison warden could have been \"bribe\" to let prisoners gamble. And who knows, maybe there is a mafia boss incarcerated in that prison and so he just wanted to have some fun inside.",

I imagine it would do.If you knew someone inside the prison leading a better life than you from the money they have that they could take out of the prison with them, maybe that's reason to commit a crime for when you get released with more money, having not paid for much while inside.Aside from that if it was more informal and pooled (like poker is) then I don't think there's much wrong with it - but then it probably couldn't be made illegal either without a very specific bill.",

If it's a crypto gambling site then it can operate without having any license but they will need to build a good reputation over the years which is not as easy as to have a valid license.Haven't we seen such gambling idea in Undisputed movie series?",

Also, it would really be still subject for possible contrabands which might be exploited inside prison and everything else.",

But it you look at today's standard everything is wrong with that decision. Those inmates need rehabilitation and not that past time of gambling inside.Anyhow, it's good that when the next warden steps up, he completely took control. And then when laws enacted regarding legitimizing gambling, prisons are not one establishment included.",

And there are many ways to do it even though it is strictly prohibited, but gambling in prison is very prone to fights and even murder because of debt cases.

But since playing cards, coins, chess or checker boards, and others aren't prohibited inside, they could easily be used for gambling.But for a jail to operate a casino, I don't think it's a wise idea.

Although prisoners will usually find ways to gamble with each other, it is best that gambling remains banned. Granting a casino license would be pathetic. While they're at it, they could open a hard drug dispensary with a counter where prisoners can buy cocaine, fentanyl, etc. Prisoners are serving a sentence, and part of the punishment has to be aimed at reintegrating them, but I don't see how allowing licensed gambling would help either one or the other.",
