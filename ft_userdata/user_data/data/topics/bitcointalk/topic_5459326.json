      "body": "Success in cryptocurrency is adoption by institutions and by majority of people. But ofcourse we're still far from this possibility. So if we would base at the present, I think we are in good progress given that more people and countries are considering this technology's usage. With regards to my success in this industry, I'd say I'm still far from that feeling of satisfaction. For me, being successful to anything is the same as meeting a point wherein you will be satisfied but not contented ofcourse. And if it is individual's success in this industry, then it would also be tied with profit. And with regards to profit, many for sure have suffered from loss due to unpredictable price movements and wrong decisions but be sure to learn atleast and to look forward with what's next for cryptocurrencies.",

There are many projects that I work on and continue to be involved with new projects. Getting an Airdrop from every new project gives a lot of advantages, I got it several times and almost never missed one. The important thing is to be consistent and keep abreast of new projects. Because of the many profits that I managed to get I started doing some trading and investing in the recommended projects. Many success stories of people in crypto and many more who earn thousands to millions of dollars in crypto. Who wants to try and stay consistent he will get the result.",

Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular have changed many things in my life. My perspective on the world has changed. My perspective on money and its history has changed. Cryptocurrencies have changed and improved me for the better. Of course, I made money from cryptocurrencies, but first of all, I think I gained an identity because the world is no longer the old world for me... I am eternally grateful to God for meeting Satoshi and his idea of Bitcoin.",

We're all grateful and happy that there's this Satoshi Nakamoto that we never knew how he/she looks like and if they're a group of people that has made this technological revolution and innovation. I've also earned and it helped me financially with cryptocurrencies. But I admire more those that have made a lot because of being early on this space and even the late ones that have believed there's still an endless opportunity regardless of how early or late you got in.",

For me, the success is measured by ROI. I have a decent amount of investment into cryptos and I also hold millions of dead tokens from various old ICOs. So for me, it's return on investment. The technology is fine, but there are many tokens available in the market today which are technically superior than bitcoin. But Bitcoin is still ruling the crypto market. So I assume a lot of people don't give a shit about tech, rather they care more about returns.",

But i totally understand that in third world countries, or in somewhere where you can't trust the gov or banks, holding your own wallet, sending money and using DeFi is quite a game changer. Well i have benefited by making money but i don't really think that's the main point of cryptocurrenies. Just a side effect for them being volatile and me getting in early. And it's not like everyone will get money from it. Many of the people will lose everything just for investing wrong time to wrong coins.",

In terms of development, it hasn't really helped much, but in financial making decisions and related stuff? Vastly helped me to learn a lot. Just the fact that it made me aware of investing and what to take note of is a big thing already imo. It's also personally teached me about losses, hard ones, which I wasn't really familiar with (but I was kind of aware of) back then when I was still in college.",

Some can just have reach their dream goal of having a hundred million dollars, and call themselves successful already. Some can call themselves successful if they manage to give their family a house and lot plus a car. In cryptocurrency, TBH I can't measure my success into it because I'm very far away still from reaching my goal. What is my goal? Just simple. Holding a single Bitcoin in my wallet. I know it's hard (at least for me), but I believe that I can reach that one in the near future. Right now, I guess my measure of success is at around 20% only. I'm still far away from my goal like I said.",

In my understand if someone can be called success in crypto when he will able to make bunch of money from crypto. I have used money as a way to determine how success someone is in the crypto currency. It's caused by crypto is about speculative asset and money. I don't wanna put tech as measurement caused by it's not all of people actively using tech available in crypto. I do believe if mostly people is willing to earn money from using crypto. that's why i called crypto as a tool to generate money online. No reason for me to call someone who adopted crypto's tech as a successful crypto user. I prefer to take how much money that can be generated by anyone rather than tech in crypto.
