The number of people who want something for nothing is basically infinite and that means it will create infinite demand for eth till those people lose everything they got. On the other hand, those \"new\" blockchains have been trying to dethrone ETH for years and none of them succeeded. That means ETH is doing it right while others don't.",

I expect something big will give a big change to the ethereum started from its migration to the POS and many more. It's too early to say that if we will see the destruction of ethereum soon. The fact that if the network can get the new update and that depends on the miners, i think that it's better waiting for the next update that will come late of this year. After you have seen the update and you can judge what will be happening with ethereum",

Ethereum fees have been very high for a long time, but until now it still persists.besides, many people thought that even under these conditions, ethereum was able to hold its place. if everything returns to normal, the price of ethereum will be higher than it is now, and even more popular.",

Will the challenges of new technologies and new public chains cause ETH to decline rapidly?ETH as a blockchain might be declined.But not as a currency.ETH has more marketcap after Bitcoins.How can such a coin be destructed ? It’s the love for ETH , that many people are fond of it and still uses ETH.Regarding the new technologies, many prefer using ETH, in many ways. So I highly doubt that this might happen.I myself is also holding a couple of ETH along with Bitcoins.",

Will the challenges of new technologies and new public chains cause ETH to decline rapidly?You see lot of transactions on ETH blockchain despite the high gas so it's not going to end up soon and there are lot many underlying things onchain which will keep it running.There are many people who still holds this coin and will be supporting it after btc but it can't take btc place ever.But Vitalik is not so dumb minded as you see he comes up with something technically new to make some changes but they didn't work as expected like the latest Berlin hard fork also didn't have effect on gas so there are problems but will not end up ETH so easily.",

Will the challenges of new technologies and new public chains cause ETH to decline rapidly?In terms of price, likely. But in terms of its own chain and what it has contributed to the whole crypto ecosystem, I don't think those things are enough to destroy it utterly. It took a lot of years until it has been built very well and until now, it's still 2nd on the rankings for the entire market. Wait until the new news comes out for its 2.0 and people will be optimistic again, specifically those that have been looking at it as something that it doesn't worth it anymore.",

Will the challenges of new technologies and new public chains cause ETH to decline rapidly?It is difficult for that reason Ethereum is experiencing a decline going forward, the only cases involving mining critics who are dissatisfied with the results, participant restrictions have to be done for some reason, and new technologies and smart chains are things that must be faced in the challenges ahead, this is just a problem small ones that never made Ethereum lose the trust of people, because this coin has reached a very good level of utility under bitcoin, so it's hard for people to ignore them",

These days people are able to using the multiple blockchain and just because ethereum was not scalable enough compared with its competitor and it doesn't mean whole demand already migrated into the new platform.

Reduced popularity in DeFi How? Ethereum blockchain has most numerous DeFi tokens.

Will the challenges of new technologies and new public chains cause ETH to decline rapidly?I don't think so. I don't own any significant amount of ETH myself, which is a sad thing for me btw, but i still think as an objective observer that Ethereum is still the king of all altcoins and it's introduction was probably at least as important for the whole crypto space as the launch of Bitcoin before. Ethereum was the project that introduced the smart contract functionality and this piece of tech is what makes all the stuff that we are having today like Dexes, NFT's, yield farming, staking and so on even possible.I also think though that the switch to ETH 2.0 really needs to work and that the fees also need to significantly go down then because i also use BSC mostly nowadays because the fees of ETH are just too high for a small fish like me.",

Will the challenges of new technologies and new public chains cause ETH to decline rapidly?Ethereum will not decline rapidly if Bitcoin can increase slowly, because the bigger impact of the decline on Ethereum for now is in the Bitcoin dump, so if Bitcoin can hold up very well and can increase slowly over time, then Ethereum will too. getting better and slowly improving in the market, regardless of what you say even though that has some truth in it, but I think the effect of that kind of thing is still very little for Ethereum at the moment.",

This same scenarion on Ethereum which a lot of competitors' blockchain is lurking to steal its top spot but Ethereum is still a solid project due to its real decentralized nature so even with the cons that you mention, Many investors still trust this coin due to its well-known brand. The only that will bring down Ethereum is a serious security breach that will cause a loss of funds like what happened to their DAO before but this scenario has a very low chance to occur.",

The market situation itself is still not good and still waiting for bitcoin to increase, so it looks like ETH can still survive, and there is a possibility that ETH 2.0 can become a new trend in the future. But everything is still unknown and still needs to wait, and in the meantime, we are also still seeing how the market conditions in the future.",
