We have intervals of 2 mins, 6 mins, 25 mins, 4 mins, 17 mins. As you can see, it's random.",

I have checked multiple forums, i never found an answer as to why the 10 minutes calculation exists after a decade of Bitcoin existence..Don't you think this is a myth? Considering it has been more than a decade that we are using the same bench mark. It’s not a myth. Just like what Charles Tim said it is usually more or less than 10 minutes, the difficulty is adjusted by each node to fit the new time taken to confirm the block. And this adjustment is followed for the next 2016 blocks before another difficult is calculated again. The formula is actually time / expected time. You can look at it up here https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/difficulty. As of yesterday this was the difficult epoch according to O_e_l_e_oQuote the current average block time for this difficulty epoch is around 10 minutes and 12 seconds. This is the difference between 144 blocks a day and 141 blocks a day. This is a difference of 3 blocks and therefore 3 MvB at most, and not nearly enough to explain the >100 MvB of unconfirmed transactions we currently have.",

After a block is mined, it takes time for other miners to find out about it, and until then they are actually competing against the new block instead of adding to it. If someone mines another new block based on the old block chain, the network can only accept one of the two, and all the work that went into the other block gets wasted. For example, if it takes miners 1 minute on average to learn about new blocks, and new blocks come every 10 minutes, then the overall network is wasting about 10% of its work. Lengthening the time between blocks reduces this waste.",

If someone is willing to pay more than you, then someone else will get confirmation first than you.Bitcoin transaction fees fluctuate, you need to monitor fee recommendations before transactions. You can work around this by trying to broadcast transactions that have low fees, but only if you're not rushing for confirmation. Use wallet that supports RBF, it will help you to increase transaction fees when you need your transactions to get confirmation faster.",

I can't believed currently, the highest priority is ~165 sat/vb or $6.81 as per mempool, that's crazy numbers and it will sure affect those who are doing small transactions (not LN transactions).As for the question of the OP, currently the average time is Quote ~11.9 minutesAverage block timehttps://mempool.space/",

So average time taken doesn't represent anything it's just the average value of combined mined blocks meanwhile if we take note on every block it will be completely random and you can't do anything about it.Actually, that's not entirely right. It is possible for a Bitcoin block to be mined in as little as a few seconds or as long as several hours, however it is quite rare for blocks to take less than a minute or more than an hour to be mined. The Bitcoin protocol is designed to adjust the difficulty of mining blocks approximately every two weeks, in order to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes. However, due to the random nature of the mining algorithm, there can be significant variation in the actual time it takes to mine a block.",

If you want faster for block confirmation for sending Bitcoin use higher fees sending and under 10 minutes transaction will complete, but if lower fees your transaction delay and take longer time for compliting.Actually need one block confirmation have been enough for success Bitcoin sending, but in Binance you can withdrawing yet if transaction not completed confirmation but available with trading or convert to other balance.",
