      "body": "Yes, this is another proof that people who spend their time trying to predict future BTC prices on Twitter are just wasting time, and ours if we take some to read them  News are random in many ways, and so is their impact on the price of bitcoin. Not to mention that a few whales can also have a little fun with the price of the day.In any case, it's been a very positive start of year for Bitcoin until now, both in terms of price and volume. I'm not one of those who think it will be $1 million in June - like the former CEO of Coinbase and his recent $1 million bet - but I don't pretend to know what the price will be in the future myself.I don't know if this positive effect on the BTC price will last, I wonder if it's just a fad related to the current US and European banking problems, or if we're headed for a new higher threshold. The boomerang effect is also possible, and no one can say what tomorrow will bring.",

February might be just so-so, but this March is very different from any other March year in a bear market.So now the market is $28k and people are predicting that we might see it jump at the end of the month to around $30k-$32k if this bull run will continue. Of course this green looks positive because anyone is putting their money on the market because they don't like what they are seeing right now, which is banking crisis.",

And with that, we just leave it that way. There are a lot of negative things going around us, specially in the US and it seems that bitcoin is the biggest winner right now as people are more willing to invest this month alone.",

This may likely be driven by news or any event that could positively turned to the glory of bitcoin but lets watch as to see how the movement goes, whenever it's green we feels to be all green and everyone is happy wishing it should remain on a constant Bull without knowing when candle changes we could also experience the Red side of it, so as a trader be very vigilant as this may not be a potential Green.",

But overall, other assets have never done something that has been ever done by bitcoin. Yes, it's positive and green now, and much more likely that it will continue until it breaks another barrier which is the $30k. I now see people mocking those people that have mocked us before and never listened to advice that they should have bought when it's still low. Also, there have been people that are mocking those that have said they're waiting for the dip like around $10k-$12k. I don't want to say that they should have been mocked but many of those folks took it literally but it's gonna be a never ending argument. We've got prices on our head on when we shall buy but hopefully, all of us gonna get what we all wanted with bitcoin and soon, we'll see the actual another crazy bull run for it.",

At least so far in Q3 Bitcoin is up 70%, so I imagine there will be another green quarter to follow.
