      "body": "The founder of WikiLeaks is considered one of the few specialists in his field. He has developmental skills and experience that enabled him to found WikiLeaks and confront international powers. Bitcoin helped the founder of WikiLeaks to fund his project and this was a mutual benefit as he contributed to spreading awareness of the Bitcoin culture in its early days.On the other hand, I do not think that he will be handed over to the United States, especially with the current crisis between America and the West against Russia, which receives Assange on its soil.",

      "body": "Julian Assange is from Australia. Extradition doesn't sound like it applies to him. But they wouldn't need him to be sent to the US for now. To some, he is a freedom fighter.
