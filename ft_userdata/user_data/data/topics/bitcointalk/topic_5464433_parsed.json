  "content": "Hi I just wonder if there are any other site where we can check the broadcast time of a TX.For example i know that blockchain.com store that information for example for TX 12f34b58b04dfb0233ce889f674781c0e0c7ba95482cca469125af41a78d13b3Code:Broadcasted on 16 Apr 2023 12:23:05 GMT-6But mempool.space replace that informaction with the mined block timestampCode:Timestamp ‎2023-04-16 00:29So the questions is if there any other site that store that information.Regards!",

      "body": "AFAIK, there is no way to find the exact broadcast time of a transaction in the Bitcoin network.The broadcast timestamp you see on your wallet interface is just an estimation because the time taken for your node to propagate to other nodes across the network depends on factors like network congestion, latency, and the number of hops it takes to reach different nodes.",

      "body": "There is no way of finding out and the transaction broadcast timing. The timing that you see is basically the timing for which it is seen by any of Blockchain.com's node. This can be wildly inaccurate depending on the extent and the speed of propagation.For certain transactions which are not very well broadcasted, the timing will be inaccurate depending on when the node sees it.Even the block timestamp is not accurate. Blocks can drift from the network adjusted time by quite a significant amount. There is no way to enforce accuracy of timings on the blockchain.",

The time it will take for the broadcasted transaction information to reach a blockchain.com explore node vs mempool.space node will most likely vary.The lock time information is what matters.Any reason you need to know the exact time a transaction was broadcasted? Because I personally don't see any use case",

I just want to know if there are another page that show the time of \"first sight of some TX time\".What i want is to know another source of that information without matter how acurate or inacurate it is... i am pretty aware of the network propagate time and network issues like those that were mentioned.Thank you.",

Because I personally don't see any use case  I agree with you, usually that information is worthless, but i get some curious about some transactions the other day and i am doing some research, if you are interesting i can let you know when i publish it.Regards!",
