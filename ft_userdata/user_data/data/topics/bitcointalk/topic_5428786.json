  "content": "So this is more of a general question, not necessarily a loan request.Yes ,I do need a loan of about 0.6 btc, but before I make any request I want to know a few things.I have collateral, but it is scattered in more than 1 altcoin wallets, I'm considering exchanging them for a single type of altcoin.Also, as per my old request that I locked, I have a wallet with btc in it, it has been consolidated, but most of it was spent to solve my original issue and make some investments. Currently it has only 0.00070782 left in it.So my question here is, what kind of altcoin is acceptable as a collateral?And also, if the collateral is approximately 110% of the loan amount, is that good enough?Again, I'm mostly looking for answers, not necessarily the loan, that can wait, it's not that urgent.Thanks for any clarifications",

I could maybe accept it but chances are that the shitcoin dips and I have to liquidate you before I get to ask for some extra margin or even recall the loan.",

Someone could pretend to be willing to give you the loan just to run away with your 110% collateral (i.e 0.66 BTC worth of ETH) right away. And btw, since you're already thinking about liquidating your altcoins, why not just sell everything to BTC (which is what you need)? Why the loan?",

Why the loan?I'll be careful.My thinking is that I'm probably never going to buy any altcoin again and maybe I'll need it some time latter. Maybe for another loan or some quick cash.So I'm thinking I have the possibility to repay a loan now, but maybe at a latter time, maybe next year or in any undefined period of time, I won't.Maybe I just will sell everything to BTC and be done with it, still not sure yet.Anyway, thanks for the advice",

If you really want to speculate on altcoins again, see these depressing graphs first Yeah. I'm just going to exchange everything into bitcoin in the end.Better to be informed before making any kind of decision.Thanks for the graph, will look to over it, and I'll decide if I ever want to speculate on altcoins again.Thanks to every one who responded to my post, got some info out of it. I'm locking it now.",
