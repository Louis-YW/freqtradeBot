Maybe due to ordinals bitmap thing happening and probably the reason of the increase in tx fees. But if you are a retailer might as well hold it and if you got a litttle fraction of bitcoin since youll only spend couple of dollars for small gains. So better to hold it for a very long term.",

And I don't convince that people will be more interested about it if this continue to happen since for sure every transaction they do it hurt them so bad that's why hopefully there's a institution can way find way that can create other alternatives that can help bitcoin to lessen up the congestion and fees since if this would really happen for sure many people would love to adopt it and possibly try those opportunities what they think that can offer to them by adopting cryptocurrencies.For now since situation like this occur maybe we can see not so high increase of users since they would provably consider if they can earn and will not lose anything nor struggle to handle something that they can't afford to do on multiple times",

Just last month, we had some of the lowest fees across the board at 3-16 sats/vb and we'll have such times again in the near future once current backlog is cleared.

How do we get people and businesses to adopt bitcoin more if both users and merchants spend so much value on fees? The cost in traditional finance is 10x lower.",

While the forum members and small traders are getting frustrated with the amount of fees that are showing up on mempool. Our OP comes up with an amazing theory! He might have forgotten that just holding Bitcoin does not mean the price of it will go up. Without trading Bitcoin's price will remain constant and would never hit ATH'S. Bitcoin was created to help people gain financial freedom not at the cost of high transaction fees. At the moment only whales and those crazy ODRI holders have made it impossible to make any kind of transaction on the Bitcoin network. This is a deliberate attack as per my understanding and something needs to be done otherwise they would continue to manipulate the network.",

If these fees increase to 3.25, then literally, the return from the block + transaction fees will equal 6.25, which is the same Bitcoin that is being mined at the present time as It does not greatly affect demand, especially for services that have to pay fees, no matter how high they are. Therefore, increasing fees may not be a positive indicator for those who view Bitcoin as an investment or a tool for cheap money transfers.",

What's happening now is better solved than appraised. Fees or no fees, Bitcoin will always be appreciated and transactions will continue to go on. About the high fee dissuading people from making transactions, I say that is a lie, if the money is for an urgent need, the transfer would be made. Mind you, those who have a sizeable amount of BTC in their wallets don't care about the transaction fee. Are you not watching the Meepool at times to see how people pay more in multiples even when the transaction fees are low?This is not just a valid point for anyone not to spend their coin unless the coin is so little and below $10 which would also be wickedness to be happy that people can't spend their money. I believe this Mempool congestion issue is a problem indeed, an issue that most Bitcoin enthusiasts are even complaining about, it's better that a road is easily accessible rather than congested, what's the point if it's not easily accessible?Contrary to your view, have you also thought about many people that was supposed to use Bitcoin for transaction but changed their minds to use altcoins due to this high fee issue? I don't see how this is a win for Bitcoin, maybe the increase in the market capitalization is what deceives you, it is for a pure investmenet reason, not forcibly.",
