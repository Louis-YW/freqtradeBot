Are they commodities, currencies or utility tokens? I do not know. However, what I know is the SEC certainly also does not know what they are because they do not have clear guidelines. It took a judge to make a ruling for them that XRP tokens by themselves are not illegal securities.",

Most of this shitcoin hides as utility token to dodge the law while they have the feature of a security token. I’m actually surprised how Ripple manage to win the court battle against the SEC while the SEC itself is handling the regulation on shitcoins.

The judge is not only incompetent but also corrupt? If you were paying attention on what has been happening in the cryptospace, it was CZ, Brian Armstrong, Jesse Powell, the Winklevoss and the other founders of cryptospace projects who were asking the SEC for regulatory clarity and guidelines to make their exchanges and projects more compliant. However, uncle Gary would not accomodate on their request and instead began cracking down on the cryptspace.It took a judge to make a ruling to make everything clear for the SEC.",

W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).”Source https://watcher.guru/news/us-sec-will-appeal-judge-ruling-that-ripple-xrp-is-not-a-securityRipple did not make an official response, however, their Chief Legal Officer shared his thoughts on social media.The SEC does not have the “right” to appeal just yet which is why they are asking permission to file an “interlocutory” appeal. Ripple will file its response with the Court next week. Stay tuned.Source https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1689400889046667264In any case, I predict the judge to make another favorable ruling for Ripple.
