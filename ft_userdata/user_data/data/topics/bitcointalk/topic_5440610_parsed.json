Pushing too hard sometimes don't mean your going to get excellent result, sometimes you might not even get any result at all. Being productive is a go idea, your hunger for success too is a good idea, but as humans always create room to absorb little disappointment, patient they say is a virtue, the reason why there is \"Time\" in human nature, is so that everything will not happen at once, the human life is a marathon race not sprint.    Life is a journey.",

Nobody is here who wants himself that he is down, everyone is working for success in the world where we see every person struggle day and night for their dreams. While we have seen some people we have seen that they only struggle to survive and they got a time meal and they didn't have money for the second time meals, so they are just struggling down again and again daily. And also we have seen some people who have more money and still, they are trying to even make it more and more. Do you know how the world is different? If someone doesn't have money he is trying to get the money but if someone has money he is also trying for it. This is just out of mind.The main thing is everyone is trying to live a happy life, and everyone wants his life fully surrounded by comfortable things. So, it is very difficult for everyone but it is a race of life and luck and everyone is trying their best some put 100% into it to get to the top position and are going to wait for a good time.",

We have seen some people who work very hard till the ends but they faces some problems and some pressures whether it is from their family side and from their offices etc. and from their relatives. But they tend to work hard again and again.I mean mostly fortune works, as I have seen most of the people who work hard according to their will power and they way of life but they failed to achieve their target as their fortune didn't give them any hope, and due to their bad fortune they loss everything and even they lost hope in the last stage of their work and thus they quit very sadly.",

Sadly, loads of people are yet to understand that everyone on the surface of the earth is spending his own currency of TIME, people don't even know that, who you choose to spend your time with is relevant both to your pursuit and to your life entirely.There are loads of things you have to achieve and the version of humanity you have to become is dependent on time, therefore, so much depends on how you decide to spend your time and with whom and where.Going to school requires time, buiding requires time, training an offspring requires time, more than other resources time is the priceless of them all and its not going to be valuable if you don't place value on it. Every other thing is replacable except for time spent. Don't joke with your time.",

The world is really a better place for everyone if properly planned, no one waits for manner to fall from above as anyone who does such will wait till eternity because it will never come. Most times, I have come to realize that the reasons why people fail is as a result of fear and not being too open to creativity of new ideas like they're quite afraid of failing. Inasmuch as life is concerned, failure is part of success as sometimes failure unleash some potentials in a person because when you fail it will enable you to restrategize and come out with more concise solution about a problem. Another thing in life is confidence like you need to believe in yourself in whatever thing you're doing rather than having a doubtful thought.

Waiting for a convenient time to make that move that'll change your life for the better can mean relaxing on your comfort zone, and in that cozy place, the opportunity might not crawl into your lap, so in essence if you want to get something done, that means that you have to leave the comfort zone and work towards it. It's said that nothing good comes easy and there's no food for a lazy man, so we don't need to wait for opportunities of a better life to come to us, we have to make the move and reach out to opportunities, because there's a chance that you're not the only one that needs the opportunities.
