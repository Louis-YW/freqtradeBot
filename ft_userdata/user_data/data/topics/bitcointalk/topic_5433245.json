  "content": "This is an opinion by Matt Smith, an operations officer for the United States Air Force and an assistant professor of aerospace studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln as the article[1] stated.Titled FOR THE U.S., BITCOIN IS A NATIONAL SECURITY OPPORTUNITY, NOT A THREATThe article stated two pointers:1. DIGITAL CURRENCY CAN NO LONGER BE IGNOREDQuotePart of the most recent NSS, under the “Trade And Economics” section, states, “[the U.S.] will explore the merits and responsibly lead development of digital assets, including a digital dollar, with high standards and protections for stability, privacy, and security to benefit a strong and inclusive U.S. financial system and reinforce its global primacy.”Despite being labeled “magic internet money” and “rat poison” over the last decade, the rise of Bitcoin secured its credibility and since then, has gradually made its way into committees and boardrooms consisting of members holding the highest positions of influence. It can no longer be ignored. The aforementioned excerpt of the NSS provides important insight into the executive branch’s current view of the growing significance of developing digital assets like Bitcoin.One driver for this growing interest into digital assets is undoubtedly the U.S. national debt, as the nation currently runs a $31 trillion deficit with no sign of slowing down. Senator Rand Paul recently acknowledged that “the greatest national security risk is our debt” after the release of a single, $1.7 trillion (or roughly 95 million bitcoin, in today’s value) spending package. The mountain of national debt is certainly a cause of concern.2. THE U.S. CAN ADOPT BITCOINQuoteHowever, there may not be a need for the U.S. to invent a domestic digital dollar as Bitcoin fits the criteria that the NSS details. Bitcoin is the hardest form of money and provides the highest standards of protection to individuals. It is the most stable digital asset as it continues to release a new block every 10 minutes, and is the most inclusive monetary protocol as it allows not just individuals with social security numbers and two forms of government-issued IDs to access its benefits, but its open-source protocol grants protection and services to everyone including the 1.4 billion unbanked people across the world while the Lightning Network promotes efficient transactions, arguably the most important dimension of a globalized economy.As more individuals, companies, banks and countries are forced by the market to pay out loans in bitcoin instead of notes, holders of the largest bitcoin stacks will naturally gain more influence. Its built-in deflationary nature and absolute scarcity features ensures that 100% of the work and value created by people is enjoyed and never diminished through monetary debasement. Lastly, Bitcoin’s enormous defense system discourages bad actors as the cost of attack has become too great and thus forces peaceful and mutually beneficial agreements.In every sense, the Bitcoin protocol perfectly aligns with the core values of the United States and its national security strategy. Contrary to what some senior officials claim, Bitcoin does not generate a national security risk. Instead, ignoring the Bitcoin network would significantly impede the U.S.’s ability to pay its national debt, “outmaneuver [its] geopolitical competitors” and weaken the country’s economic instrument of power, which aims to leverage the country’s wealth to influence the behaviors of others. Thus, further delaying Bitcoin adoption is the national security risk.I agree with the opinion of the author, instead of creating and spending billions of dollar in creating infrastructure of CBDC  the US can just adopt Bitcoin since as the article stated, it fits that criteria the NSS details.  But I bet the people who is in authority will reject the idea because they will definitely think that they will lose control over the finance system of the government but I believe adopting Bitcoin as an alternative mode of payment won't harm the financial structure instead it opens lots of opportunities and business venture that can help the economic situation of the country.Upon reading the whole article this leave me thinking, is it possible for the US to think the same as the author and accept Bitcoin as a National Security and not a threat? Personally I doubt that since financial institution are hostile whenever an entity disrupt their traditional epic fail system.[1] https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-national-security-for-u-s",

So you know for a fact that if El Salvador was able to accept Bitcoin without hesitation, I think the time will come when they will also accept this matter of bitcoin.",

Now even if they ban it, the true bitcoin lovers will still find a way so in the end we win again. I heard China tried to ban it a lot of times and India too but both failed to stop it lol.Remember this, it is not secure because it doesnt get attacked, but it is secure becz it generates immunity by being attacked all the time",

I believe they won't ban it and only become accepting Bitcoin at wider scales. Legal tender is like an exaggeration but not actually necessary for Bitcoin existence and adoption.Currently, it is still quite challenging to get bitcoin legalized by the government. Developing countries only get semi-legal regulation, that is, it is only allowed as a commodity and nothing more. There are also several developed countries that openly reject bitcoin, such as China, and other countries, such as El Salvador, which accept bitcoin as a legal means of transaction.Each government has its own rules. Bitcoin will indeed still be accepted globally, but there will be limits that cannot be crossed or it could be included in the gray area.The existence of bitcoin adoption at this time is still not really needed, but with the development of time and increasingly advanced technology, Bitcoin is becoming an asset that may require adoption in several sectors, you need to see how the government can provide proper regulation for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin will not be a threat to anyone, if they feel threatened then someone is wrong with their system.",

      "body": "crypto being a national security threat, is only true if it was to truly disrupt fiat.for instance instead of speculating to a price of dollar. if crypto exchanges speculated to \"min wage\" where by 1btc of 1600x min wage means $16,000 in us and $380 in africa. where by this would be \"fair value\" for the world, where each coin no matter location is worth 1600 hours of labour.. but would disrupt the forex of fiat, because africans would sell for dollar and then use forex to buy african currency to then buy 33coins. and rinse and repeat. which would cause disruption to the forex exchange rates between us and africa until us and africa went 1:1this disruption has not occured.nor has mass population vetoed using fiat to only transact in crypto..so i see no \"national security threat\"as for some replies in the topic saying \"why would they invest in crypto\" or \"they should just use bitcoin and kill fiat\"well no.. central banks want to fully control the products they create(fiat) by using crypto as a replacement of fiat still plays at the whims of 'value discovery' of mining and world speculation 'price discovery'. plus crypto has no 'minus' meaning they cant do debt on the bitcoin blockchain.so they want their own system of accounting that can go into the minus and they 'premine'/mint any amount they like, under their own choice. to be able to control and offer debt and QEthey will obviously invest in crypto for their own business deals internally. its already been noted the central banks all linked to BIS have requested a 5% ability to invest in decentralised coins which the BIS is going to finally allow just 2% investment (in their recent response) to begin in 2025aswell as a near limitless investment amount in stable coins and centralised coins that meet certain criteriahowever these small investment amounts will not provide banks security to never go full 2008 again.. banks wil still go bust and ask for bailouts",

It's not make sense if government doesn't want to accept Bitcoin because people can use it to money laundering, but they forgot fiat can be used to laundering too by paying through cash, so it make the banks can't trace where the money is going to.",
