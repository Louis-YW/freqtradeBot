  "content": "I have doubt if Joe Biden is ok . This is not a case of Republican or Democrat. The US President recent appearance can be liken to be his worst so far. His forgetfulness and cognitive decline are in an all time high. Will president Joe Biden have the strength to tackle the campaign trail in 2024?In Joe Biden recent appearance a case study of diplomatic visit to Vietnam and now in UN shows that he is acting on a script. In my own bias I think he is told what to do and if you watch closes no carriage as a lead man in his outing. The big question is Joe Biden running the country or someone behind the scene is in control?",

Joe Biden is going to turn 80 years in two months time, so it is understandable if he is experiencing symptoms that comes with old age. He is the American oldest president for now and my concern is how he would contest again in 2024, I think that will tell on him and he may not be very active to run the American economy.",

Don't you recall that several months ago, it was discovered that during a political appareance the President has holding a sheet with instructions on what to do during such event?To me it is obvious he is getting help from his staff to keep the image of a fully aware and functioning president, even though it is a uphill task. If these things continue to happen,.then they will only help Trump to get into the Oval Office.Biden may not be okey, but he is okey enough.",

      "body": "I noticed one thing In the current American presidential power, the internal conflicts are less in many parts He would have been impeached after he became president.One of the areas where he seems weak to me is that in terms of foreign policy, America is having a very bad time right now in terms of foreign policymaking His rival states continue to pursue diplomatic activities with one success after another.Those who can control their people are smart. The current president is a smart person because I think he is still right, and I think he will be a candidate in the next election.Due to his age he looks unwell, but he is not well he is kept well he is now the president as a passerby actually his loved ones run the state Considering this aspect of governance is definitely ok and will take his success forward, but there is a conflict whether he will win the election.Because they understand America's own interests, they don't want people who hurt their interests. If America can protect their interests, which candidate will win.Finally, old age can never hold a man back because if there is youthful energy in the mind then he is young even though he is old and the current president is such a person.",

We can't compare Biden's public appearance to that of Obama, triumph is also better IMO. I watched Biden today whilst giving support to Ukrainian president, (zelensky), he was looking frail to me.

If Trump behaved in a more moderated way during his first term, then we could have exploited his foe during the 2020 campaign and eventually he could have ended up winning the election. So Biden is not the perfect candidate and he may be older than the ideal age for a president to be, but the fact he got elected is also Trumps fault to some extend.",

It is important to recognize that there are numerous capable individuals within the country who can effectively lead the nation. It is unfortunate that many countries worldwide are led by elderly and frail leaders when there are younger and more capable individuals available. The current state of politics in recent times is concerning due to its perceived lack of wisdom and effectiveness.",

Because I have read and listened on internet that the Trump movement or the \"MAGA\" movement has some cult characteristics, we could argue whether that is true or not. But we cannot deny that anyone, even intelligent and self-aware people can fall victim of a cult and a charismatic leader.There has been many examples of it through history and Trump is very aware of the power he has over the Republican base, to the point other politicians he is running against, do not dare to openly criticize him.",
