Bsc and polygon network is really a wise choice as they both have fast transaction and a low cost network fee as well, later days you can also add more EVM-compatible networks, for their are many users of various network.

You can hold a signature campaign if needed in this forum, btw welcome to the forum and I just visited your site everything looks good  First id like to say thanks for replying to our post were glad to see were being received so well.A lot of sites may be decentralized but im not aware of any others that solved for the latency of 100% on chain gameplay the way we did here at YoCash. That’s why when playing on the YoCash platform you can always rest assured your gameplay was a 100% fair result with no way for anyone to tamper with the results because it all took place on chain.As for the bankrupt question i dont see it in the cards, this is a decentralized platform/project with very little overhead. Even if the company behind the platform disintegrated everything would work just as it does now. If for some crazy stroke of luck a user/users hit the max payout on a large bet over and over again enough to drain all the casinos funds then sure but the probability for that could be worked out to represent about a 0% chance.",

We look forward to you giving the platform a test drive and giving us some honest feedback.I did notice you mentioned deposits. With YoCash you never deposit funds. The YoCash platforms functions much like uniswap or other DEX where you connect your wallet, approve a spending limit, but then instead of swapping tokens you play verifiably fair on chain games of chance with the winnings of each bet in your wallet as you win them.",
