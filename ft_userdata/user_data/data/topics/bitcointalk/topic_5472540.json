Not really.Technically when large amount of bitcoin is transferred on-chain, it has absolutely no effects on bitcoin price. However, where those coins are going and/or what the FUD says about it can have a considerable effect.You see, we can't know if a coin is moving to an exchange or not for sure and even if we did we still wouldn't be able to say if it is going there to be sold or not to affect the price.But if enough FUD comes out that can affect the weak hands into making an irrational move (panic buy or panic sell) it could affect the price.Honestly I don't remember any cases that a silly news like this (usually coming from whalealert and garbage groups like that) had any significant effects on the market.",

I did in the past bullrun since there were a few bots that were built exactly for that purpose.During this time I became more and more interested in trading and read up on it and was often confronted with bots like this.A well-known example would be the Whale Alert-Bot.Quote from: krishnaverma on November 02, 2023, 06:47:09 AMDo you feel it has good impact on Bitcoin  prices and a regular trader can benefit from this data. Ofc, such sell and buy orders from whales can influence the market for a short time. I leave it to be seen whether this is necessarily a positive impact.   Can a trader benefit from it?Tbh, I don't believe in it, it actually didn't give me any advantage in my trading time that really gave me an edge. It sometimes drove me crazy when I was outside and received a notification and didn't have a short/long on at the time. Classic case of FOMO.That was also the reason why I separated from it again.",

No. The only impact it has is on social media where they are posted with the intention of stoking interest from the readers and getting reposts to attract more audience. In truth the purpose of the transaction is unknown and that uncertainty will not change the sentiment of traders.Even if it does have an effect, it will be small and short lasting.",

You can't make money on this, it has no real repeatable impact on the price. Usually such a whale has an agreement with a large buyer or plans its sale so as not to move the price too much. The only thing that may affect the price is a massive FUD attack from the largest mass media portals (like cointelegraph), which will spam about such a transaction.",

They do really impact a lot in the price to be honest. When huge amount of Bitcoins are transacted, it creates movement in the market, so when you notice such, consider that as the good time to buy the coins. So at that time buy the coins and hold. Now when the price rises just sell it finally.",

Do you feel it has good impact on Bitcoin  prices and a regular trader can benefit from this data? Why would I do that? For me, it's just a waste of time. There is no need to track someone sending his own money from one wallet to another for reasons I don't even know. It is like going to the bank to monitor how many customers withdrew large sums so that you can determine how healthy the bank is.  I have seen many posts in this forum and social media with news of people moving large funds and as much as I can remember they did not affect the market. These transactions could be exchanges moving funds to another wallet or it could be an individual moving funds to another more reliable wallet. I am not a trader but I heard that the market can respond to even insignificant activities. So traders can check them out.",

No it really its not actually important to follow since they cannot move the market if that's what you mean. Maybe try to focus on your trade or learn more from your own stats since this could bring you more good result than following those whales which doesn't give any contribution on your earnings. If they move some huge balances to other wallet it doesn't mean that bitcoin will dump, Although its crazy that sometimes manipulators use this but if you see how market react for sure you will find out that its really nothing.Bitcoin market got huge volume if some of the try to sell or accumulate for sure it cannot affect anything so try to relax yourself if you are bit worried about their possible movement since they are just the same like us and the only advantage those guys have is they had a lot of money to spend on their trades.",

It’s useless to track not only because their money won’t give benefits to you which is a waste of time but also the purpose of transfer is unknown so you will just paranoid most of the time. It’s watching someone’s wallet account and assuming by yourself what he will gonna do.We are already passes the era when a single whale can give huge impact to the crypto market since crypto has much thicker liquidity now. Also there’s a lot of exchange transactions when they are moving their coins to different wallet.",

You provided a correct information that whales can do their trades through OTC market but it is not OP question.It is related since OP also asks about its effects on the price. Considering many \"big players\" do their trades away from centralized exchanges (OTC trades) you can say that it does not directly or significantly affect the price regardless of the size of the coins that were moved. That's because the price is mainly decided on centralized exchanges and when a whale trades elsewhere they don't really move that market.Imagine if you contacted me on bitcointalk and sold me 1 million bitcoin and I sent you $35 billion wire transfer!! That won't affect the market at all. But imagine if you had sold 1 million bitcoin on the 4 top exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Bitfinex, Bitstamp). That would easily crash bitcoin to $20k levels.",

Do you feel it has good impact on Bitcoin  prices and a regular trader can benefit from this data. The whale effect is often a setup built on a trap, and I never day trade based on whale movements. Because Bitcoin whales are notorious for bluffing. On cryptocurrency exchanges, buy and sell orders can be created at prices other than the spot price. Whales who want the price of Bitcoin to rise or fall can build a wall at the target price by entering a very heavy trade order on very high volume exchanges.For example, placing a 500 BTC buy order at a price lower than the spot price could create a support point for Bitcoin. If the whale is really bluffing, it will cancel the order when the BTC price approaches the buy level. Because of the unregulated market, I prefer to trade based on technical and fundamental analysis.We should watch the Whales and follow their trades, but we should not trade based on these trades alone. We should always make our investment and trading decisions after doing enough research and using technical and fundamental analysis methods.",

If they are moving the coins from A to B in terms of just moving the coins to a different address in the fund it's going to do nothing to the price. If they are moving the coins from A to B in terms of a private sale it's going to do nothing to the price.If they are moving the coins from A to B in preparation of selling on a public exchnage it's going to do nothing to the price till the sell.And so on.I know someone sitting on 500BTC give or take from back in the day who just moved it to a new multisig address due to a bit of panic about not being able to find one of the 4 keys needed to sign (2 of 4) Not a 'whale' but the move was mentioned about 2014 address coming alive for the 1st time in years.
