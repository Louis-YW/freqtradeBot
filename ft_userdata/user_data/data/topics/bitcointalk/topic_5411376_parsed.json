I would not be surprised if merged will be coming with zero impact to the ethereum itself. People over reacting about merge while they didn't know if that will not give any change to the price of ethereum. Changing the consensus meant it will make miners get less domination. So, did you see what happened with bitcoin? The rumour about mtgox is still being talked anywhere. I didn't even expect any pump to happen soon. We are facing a huge dump very soon. The pattern of bitcoin has been showing it. The world is not yet going out from crisis.",

I think though that we have seen the first impact of this news already. That was when the price of Ethereum went up pretty quickly to almost 2000$ like two weeks ago or so when the news become public that the merge was successful on the testnet and that it will go live earlier than expected. Since then the prices keep on dropping tough and ETH was below 1500$ a few minutes ago. So i would say the first big effect of this news is already gone again. I think that if the merge is successful the price will go up a bit but not that much. If it fails though then i think the prices will drop significantly.",

But if ethereum can raise its price and release the pressure from the bitcoin price drop, it will be a good start for ethereum after the ethereum merger. But it's still hard for ethereum to be able to raise the price. So you have to be more patient because as long as the price of bitcoin has not increased high, the price of ethereum has not been able to increase either.",

People think that merge will reduce gas price, but unfortunately Vitalik confirmed that it won't effect it. So just like most of people, I think this merge won't have that much effect, too. Although actually many surprises can follow, like Ethereum hard fork is possible. On the other side, I hope the merger can attract massive investment in ethereum based protocols.",

Although there's for sure going to be a huge effect for them but let's just focus first with Ethereum because whenever it goes up, they would just come to follow and also go up. The general market would also be affected by its change but we don't know how it's going to be look like. Right now, we see that everything is red and that's what we have to mind for now and the merge will come eventually and if it happens, the effect will be shown then.",

No, I can't. This had been discussed for a long time and the value of Ethereum was moving back and forth even with the news scattered all around different crypto base articles. There's no telling where it would go because we haven't seen it yet. This is the first.Now, expectations are high for some investors and it might boost its market but there's a part of it that some would just be willing to wait but never add more Ethereum in their bags.

Even if the merger will have a positive effect, it will hardly affect the price of ETH for the better, because the whole industry is in a bearish phase right now and the process of switching from one algorithm to another will not change this situation, the market will not suddenly become bullish.
