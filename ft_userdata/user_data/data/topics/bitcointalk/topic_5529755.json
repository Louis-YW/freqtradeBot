Bitcoin also gets more exposure as many institutional investors showed off their bitcoin adoption, and spot ETF made them should have backed it with real coin. ETFs adoption may be also attracting interest from people to reserve some portion from their 401k or IRA to the Bitcoin.",

But it is also not free from manipulation because the more retail is attracted to release ownership to whales, the more opportunities for manipulation they can use as a weapon.",

Also enabling institutional investors should add further stability, with institutional investors being presumable less fickle than retail.That being said, I do have mixed feelings about Bitcoin ETFs, but that's another story.",

Put shortly, there's no need for ETFs and everyone is better off using spot markets.",

With Bitcoin Spot ETFs, there are new mass purchasing demand that plays important role to support Bitcoin price.It shows in Bitcoin: Bull market correction drawdowns that are clearly less severe but are smaller than previous market cycles.",

If a market does not have market makers and market manipulations, it will be lack of momentum to move up and down, so it will be a very boring and likely dead market that won't be attractive to anyone, and new trading, investing capital will not pour into that market.A dead market has no chance to everyone, and nobody wants it, so manipulations is very necessary for a lively opportunistic market.",

What's your take?I think bitcoin etfs could introduce both scalability and new risks. With more institutional investors, we might see less extreme volatility as liquidity improves. However, institutions also have the power to manipulate prices through coordinated trades. It really depends on how regulations evolve and how retail investors react to these new financial products. I'll be watching closely to see it etfs actually help bitcoin adoption or just become another tool for big players to control the market.",

But I do not see how it can lead to manipulation.Yes, that is a good thing, especially if the number of Bitcoin ETFs with real Bitcoin purchased by providers has 1:1 with the original Bitcoin, this will be very positive in the future, because if you look at the development of Adoption, there are indeed quite a few institutions entering Bitcoin slowly and many are still trying to enter Bitcoin to invest, and that is a natural thing because this is the initial gate for institutions to enter Bitcoin.He said this is manipulation because institutions have media that have more money so they are able to manipulate news that has an impact on prices, things like what I think, maybe if we talk about money, no one can control the movement of Bitcoin prices because of its large market cap, but if they control the news to create panic and/or create Fomo, they can do it.",

      "body": "We all should agree that bitcoin is unpredictable and as such, anything can happen during the shortrun and longrun as well. The obvious fact is that bitcoin ETFs would definitely have some impacts on bitcoin's price, it could be short term stability and an increased manipulation in the longrun. I said Short term stability because, Bitcoin ETF is another indirect way people can invest in bitcoin without have to deal with bitcoin directly. Since they would be dealing with traditional institutions directly, that direct effect this form of investment is supposed to have on bitcoin's demand and supply would reduce, thereby making bitcoin's price somehow stable, but for a short while because bitcoin is designed to be volatile. But on the other hand, the manipulation may exist more among the institutional investors who have a significant control over large ETF holdings.  Major sell-off or buying by this investors will impact the market greatly. So it is a two way thing, therefore we should expect any in an unpredictable market like bitcoin's market.",

Without ETFs, there wouldn't be billions of dollars pouring into the market and I don't think bitcoin would be as popular as it is today.I agree on somethings here but have disagreements on most here, first I think it’s manipulation that makes bitcoin less volatile, before the whole ETF saga we all saw how explosive bitcoin was and how volatile bitcoin actually moves, right now market moves base on the buy or sell pressure other investors see from this institutions or whales. As for the ETF effect on bitcoin, I can’t deny the fact that it has definitely bring in more demand or adoption since it’s approval as many who were basically not comfortable buying and holding by themselves actually got in through the spots ETF. But does it mean without bitcoin ETF we wouldn’t get such attention? I say No, because the bitcoin past trend or stats shows how it’s growing organically in demand without ETF, in fact over the last decade it seems to be the most popular asset prior to even ETF approval",
