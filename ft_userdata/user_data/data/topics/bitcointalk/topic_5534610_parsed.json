And that's why we have seen the price going down again.So I don't know if you will treat this as positive development for crypto space as it seems that the US is going to buy Bitcoin. And that their current Bitcoin and other crypto assets will turn into their strategic reserve. A far cry from what we are looking or expecting at, US going to buy millions of Bitcoin to be their reserve, but it looks like this is not the case.",

And that's why we have seen the price going down again.\"Buy the rumor, sell the news\" and what's happened in recent days are far less than people expectation, disappointments in the crow are very easily understandable and explainable.It's time to sell if you are only going short term with Bitcoin, but if you are going long term, it's still a very good news, but as said less than expectation. According to \"Buy the rumor, sell the news\", price possibly was already reflected expectation of this news weeks ago.QuoteSo I don't know if you will treat this as positive development for crypto space as it seems that the US is going to buy Bitcoin. They just hold their bitcoins seized from criminals, and nothing more at the moment or in near future. I don't consider it's bad because they announced holding means they won't sell those seized bitcoin at least in next four years with Trump as their President.Plans of purchasing more bitcoins for their strategic reserves, we will have to wait a while long time.",

Now there is little negativity circulating around the market as the people did not get what they were expecting at the summit. The only thing positive about the reserve is that we know that the government approved the holding of bitcoin as they want to be part of it, but that expectation that the US government will be accumulating bitcoin has been quenched yesterday, which is what I suspect is affecting the market currently, but we will pass that stage very soon.",

We've already seen Brazil approving its own BTC reserves, so it seems like a race is forming. Brazil is not the most prominent example that preceded the United States in establishing a reserve of Bitcoin, as El Salvador took a bigger step by recognizing Bitcoin as a legil tender. There is also the Gulf region, whose economy is considered more prosperous than Brazil and El Salvador, as the Gulf region is witnessing important transformations regarding cryptocurrencies, as interest in these digital assets is increasing and financial technologies are developing at an increasing rate. Despite warnings issued by government agencies regarding trading these currencies without a clear regulatory framework, investing in digital currencies continues to attract the attention of individuals and institutions alike. The United Arab Emirates is considered one of the leading countries in the region in terms of adopting digital currencies, by developing digital wallets and licensed trading platforms. Initiatives such as the launch of D360 Bank with a capital of up to 440$ million, and the Saudi Digital Bank show the countries commitment to building a strong infrastructure for financing digital currencies.",

This procedure may take a few months, but it will certainly have a major positive impact in the long run.The strange thing is that despite all these positive decisions issued by the United States since Trump's term until now, Bitcoin and the market are still in a state of decline.
