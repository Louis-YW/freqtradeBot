By only owning ETF's, you are not going to really enjoy the full benefits of bitcoins like the privacy and self custody, you still will have to pay maintenance fees which somehow is not different from the regular bank charges always complained about.",

      "body": "Investing in ETFs compared to Bitcoin actually has disadvantages such as freedom and Bitcoin we cannot control completely. And investing in an ETF means we don't own the underlying asset directly, in this case bitcoin. This means you lose certain benefits, such as the ability to spend our bitcoins directly and some other points. As is usually done with our own Bitcoin holdings with complete freedom. Additionally, ETFs typically require higher fees due to brokerage fees, and this is obviously a bit different compared to actual Bitcoin.And there are definitely advantages and disadvantages, and it is best to carry out thorough and detailed analysis and research before making a decision and also as a consideration.",

Haven't actually had access to it since then. I need to get access to that again haha. I should figure out how to do that and move it to an IRA and put it into a Bitcoin ETF.",

So, technically, you momentarily own nothing of the two until the day you liquidate the fund for your cash  Maybe I am being too ignorant and these funds, but I don't see any good advantage these ETFs hold over owning Bitcoins in a personal wallet except just transferring your financial responsibility to someone else.",

QuoteI've always invested in BTC using a private wallet but with Fidelity's offering I feel fairly safe and confident putting a portion of my 401k into it. I had to check a few boxes that I accept the risk but other than that Fidelity authorized the transaction.When Bitcoin got developed, it was just in singular, which means Bitcoin alone, nothing like FBTC, Bitcoincash, ETF and some other annoying ones I don't want to mention. If you are investing in something else that is not just Bitcoin, then you are not investing in the real thing, but as long as you are aware of the risk and comfortable with it, there is no problem. I just prefer the real one, which is only Bitcoin. Anything other than that is either centralized or could have very unpredictable results. If it's Bitcoin, there is no way to just easily control the technology because if it were possible, then the government would have done it.",

However, I think this is going to become more popular than we would like. Just like people use custodial wallets and buy Bitcoin on centralized exchanges, they will buy Bitcoin in their 401k or equivalents when the option is implemented. I have a pension plan, not a 401k exactly because I don't live in the USA, and I don't have Bitcoin there. The Bitcoin I do have is managed by me with my private keys. It makes the most sense.",

A 401k takes out money pre tax driving down the tax burden and maximising returns. Most companies also match employee contribution! Free money. When entering retirement and taking a draw from the 401k, the person would most likely be in a lower tax bracket.Additionally  investments within the 401k can be rebalanced without a tax event.After tax money in the context retirement would be best in a roth ira. Why?Here's why.quote from google: Although you pay taxes on the money you put into a Roth IRA, the investment earnings in the account are tax-free. Also, when you reach age 59 ½ and have had the account open for at least five years, withdrawals are tax-freehttps://www.google.com/search?q=do+you+pay+taxes+on+roth+ira+gains&rlz=1C1CHZN_enUS987US987&oq=do+you+pay+taxes+on+roth+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBggCEEUYOTIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCjE5MDAzajBqMTWoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8Or you can just pay a shit on of taxes you don't have to",
