If it were that easy, everyone would do it. They don’t because it’s an obvious scam. I wouldn’t recommend even allowing this software to touch your personal cellular device.",

There's no such thing as a mobile mining app. Any software that can really mine on a phone is just a CPU miner and can mine 20 times faster on a PC. This is not true, you've been able to mobile mine on Verus for 3 years now. cell phones use a different type of processor called ARM chips and they can generally do the same thing as x86 chips but a lot more efficient. For an example mining Verus with a CPU you will use 150w where you can produce the same amount of hash with 10 cell phones at about 50w.",

Nothing in the list was real mining. Verus can be mined with any CPU just like I said.You can mine with xmrig AArch64, on a MAC or an iphone (also x86_64), and recently with cpuminer-opt, still a work in progress. That is real mining.The point I was making, and went way over your head, is that a CPU Is a CPU whether it's in a phone, tablet, laptop, workstation, server or game system.If the software exists to mine it can mine on any of them. Phone only mining is a scam, period!Edit: How much have you made mining Verus?",

      "body": "Mobile mining never really took off because there is no guarantee that the mining would only be possible on the mobile device.An algo wouldn’t be able to limit the mining to say Apple Ax chips. So anyone can come out and just build their own software and be able to mine with a computer CPU and basically have an unfair advance. Hence why there are no mobile mining coins out there because it just wouldn’t have any point really.",

Well, now you can buy a lot of inexpensive phones on the secondary market to use them to get rewards, but greedy people use their personal phones for this.But another thing is that there are no profitable coins for mining or the promises of the development team may not be fulfilled.",

For 35-50 dollars you can buy many used phones with a 4-6 core processor and 32-64 GB of built-in memory from the inexpensive Chinese brand Xiaomi or others. You can order batteries from Aliexpress today. Older Hiomi models can be disassembled and the battery replaced at home, unlike new Samsung and Apple.",
