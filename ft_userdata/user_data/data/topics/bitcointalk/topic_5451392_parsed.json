  "content": "QuoteThe Fed, through the FOMC or Federal Open Market Committee, adjusts rates depending on the economy's needs. 1. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too quickly, and it's likely that inflation or rising prices might occur, the FOMC will increase the fed funds rate.2. MarketsBitcoin Falls Slightly After Fed Rate Hike.BTC was down about 1% after the U.S. central bank boosted the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the central bank had omitted language signaling additional rate hikes at upcoming meetings.By Jocelyn Yanghttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/03/bitcoin-falls-slightly-after-fed-rate-hike/QuoteBitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped slightly to below $28,500 after the U.S. Federal Reserve did what was widely expected and raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps). The increase sends the federal funds rate to a target range of between 5% and 5.25%.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $28,350, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.Despite the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, the FOMC  which is the Federal Open Market committee is the agency responsible for dollar rates and other interest rate hike, under direction from the Feds. It also holds Bitcoin traders to ransom with this power it wields over the crypto in controlling the market to avoid inflation and crash of markets like what happened to FTX. The dollar, USD, is a dominant value in the market and with Bitcoin being a strong competition, it is a no wonder it pends to become legal tender in the U.S.This is also a how to control inflation and hike of prices of commodities and service too, which is what FOMC stands to adjust after its announcement.When there is an increase of the interest rate, the value of fiat money is reduced. This will mean a decline in any crypto market investment as well.*Is same effect of FOMC policy felt on other crypto currencies, alt coins including stocks and shares, around the world?*How does Bitcoin adjust to the market after this kind of meeting and announcement by the FOMC affects interests rate of fiat and devalues it(Bitcoin) ?Let's shed more light. Let's discuss!",

Please note that Bitcoin can't function in isolation, the decentralization of the coin is not beyond its payment operations and benefits, it doesn't cover the market pricing and how it reacts to demand and supply during the bull and bear sentiments.And decisively about your queries, external factors affect it because Bitcoin is paired with the USD to establish the price ($29,400, for example), and this is the most valuable paired price reference by any individual and financial institution all over the world which makes it powerfully.Anything that is happening in the US would definitely be having an impact on the USD, and in turn, be impacting the value of Bitcoin whether it's positive or negative. So inflation and interest rates are not an exception. Also as you know, the FED is powerful in making measures that affect those mentioned factors, their decisions will always affect the price of Bitcoin regardless, unless it's no longer paired with the USD which is the major BTC-paired fiat currency.",

While the FOMC's policies and announcements can have an impact on the broader financial markets and investor sentiment, it is unclear how much of an impact they have specifically on Bitcoin's price and value.",

The markets take some time to interact with the news, and we definitely have to wait until the week closes on Sunday to see the impact of the Fed's decisions on prices. The confirmed information so far is that raising the interest rate by 25 basis points has been included in the current rate, but trends that there will be no further interest rate hike is what we will see its impact in the coming days.The continuation of the current bullish wave may end with a price above 35,000 before the end of this month.",

Saying that regulators control Bitcoin market is an overstatement. Their actions might influence it, but there's also a lot of other factors that cause price change, most notably halvenings. There's no entity in this world that can decide precisely what the Bitcoin price will be tomorrow, because Bitcoin's supply is distributed among millions of people and it is traded on a free and global market, and we are already at the point when most of coins have been mined.

When the fed rate is hinted as going higher in the near future due to inflation then risk on assets like stocks and crypto will go down. Same is true if it’s the opposite.Last week you could of bought some 1 month government TBills and you would get almost 6%. This is risk free. So many people will sell their stocks which are risky and go for government bonds instead. Another reason is that people will have less money to spend to buy crypto and stocks and hence why it will go down.Bitcoin and stocks will rally when they start to cut rates however.

Let's discuss!What the Fed does affects the economy in general and therefore also affects bitcoin, but the fact that the price of bitcoin has dropped by 1% after the announced quarter point hike may have nothing to do with it. A rise or fall of 1% is within the normal volatility of the bitcoin price, it is even low volatility.Quote from: umbara ardian on May 06, 2023, 09:21:25 PMBitcoin's value is largely determined by the market forces of supply and demand, and external factors such as inflation and interest rates can have an impact on the value of the USD, which in turn can affect the value of Bitcoin when it is paired with the USD.Bitcoin is not directly controlled by any central authority or institution, including the FOMC or the Federal Reserve.

I would also add that central bank policies affect the price but not only because of the bitcoin-fiat countervalue but also because if central banks flood the markets with money, much of that money will end up in financial assets such as bitcoin, and conversely, when there is tightening, it is normal for people to sell financial assets, such as bitcoin, to obtain liquidity, which in turn causes the price to fall.",

While it is fully acknowledged that bitcoin's ability to contribute to settlement of payments, or transactions, is very preeminent, it also acknowledges the fact that this crypto market is too small to make a big voice in the system. global financial system. The speculations about them are many and do not really meet the desires that many people, organizations and countries are aiming for, I believe we need a lot of time to find the real values. useful not only in the blockchain field but also in many other fields towards a global development environment.",

BTC price usually goes down when the interest goes higher and goes up when interest is lower. Although, I've noticed that it's generally for the short-term, and Bitcoin price either goes a little bit up or down or returns to its original price. I know a community in my country that lives stream the price of Bitcoin, a few minutes before the announcement of FOMC.

This is not a btc or cryptocurrency regulatory agency but they are related to policy of government on currency which affects the interest rate. The outcome of such decision will not have direct effect to bitcoin because it is decentralized but it could have gradual effect based on the power of investors who could take investment decision based on the liquidity available on high or low interest rate. Such excesses or decrease is what may influence investment in crypto.",
