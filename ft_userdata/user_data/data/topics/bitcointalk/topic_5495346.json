In conversations with relatives and friends, I mentioned bitcoin a few times, but I never seriously gave anyone investment advice in bitcoin. Because I don't want to be blamed or responsible to anyone because even I myself have no guarantee that my bitcoin investment will be successful. I also don't seem to care which of them has invested in bitcoin because each person has a life and each person has their own choices. I don't like others asking about my life and vice versa, I do that to everyone.  Bitcoin today has become so popular and we can easily see it everywhere. If someone is really interested and wants to invest, they will learn about it themselves without having to ask anyone to convince them.",

I advised him to invest in bitcoin, but then he only looked at risk and not profit, he didn't want to take risk, I tried to convince him many times that investment in bitcoin has high profit as well as risk, (at that time bitcoin was worth 20K to within 30K) but he did not understand in any way. Then I realized that there was no point in explaining it to him, so I gave up trying to explain it to him. And I continued to invest like myself.My friend was surprised when the price of Bitcoin broke its all-time high before the halving and then only regretted it. He got confused and said I'll invest now i.e. when bitcoin price is above 70K he decided to invest, LOL. Then I told him that now there is no profit in investing, now the price of Bitcoin is very high. I told him about investing after a few days and after the price of Bitcoin slowly fell when it reached 60K I told him to start investing. He is now investing according to his ability using DCA method.",

The only one time I was thanked for telling someone about crypto investment was a year ago, an old friend who did have some trust in me came for help, instead of helping him I told him to risk some money, NAD right away I told him that he can lose it all, still he insisted. It was not even about Bitcoin, I invested the money on alt and he made 5x of the money, and I gave it back to him, he was very happy, what I did notice was that he was ready to lose that money, most people today call everything a scam, including Bitcoin, you will have peace of mind if you keep it to yourself.",

It's unlike my parents, they do want to invest and they know the implications and consequences of bitcoin investing and they're not mad at all and they've agreed to hodl for the long-term, I'm talking about retirement age kind of long-term which is a lot of time to be invested into and I just wish them that they'd get the most profits when they finally sell.",

I first gave information to a friend of mine who did not know what to invest in, about the areas he could invest in, and then asked him whether he was making the investment long-term or short-term. After getting the answers to these questions, I presented the options to my friend. The point I paid attention to is that I did not try to persuade or pressure my friend to invest, I just told him what I knew.I said that Bitcoin always brings profit in the long run and reaches more people every day. Then I gave him a few ideas to learn about graphs and cycles. Finally, I warned my friend to remember that investing has risks.",

We have strategized on the top goals and carrying those that are willing to embraced change. We should emphasized on successful results and not giving you because everything comes with solid plannings. Cryptocurrency is not a get rich quick scheme and we have turn on specific goals for ourselves in the system. I've persuaded one of my very close colleague to invest in bitcoin and today he's one of the happiest man alive because he's in stuck in profits after bitcoin breaks the ATH (All-Time High).",

It is like it is in our nature to go against what is being said to us. So I have seen some cases where you tell someone about bitcoin and they just end up not believing it or something. It is exhausting to have to convince someone that does not want to be convinced.QuoteI don't like to be blamed for something because I've forced them into it, that's not really my style.the funny thing is even if you just mention it in the passing and not really force them to do anything they will still say that it is your fault they invested in the first place.",

On a contrary I was the one who was introduced bitcoin investment. Since the person who introduced me to bitcoin investment is not here in the forum, I feel like speaking up for myself. Yes I have said thank you to him countless times. He is my friend who is doing far better than me today financially because he caught the vision on time. He kept disturbing me to invest in bitcoin back then but I was reluctant. The they I finally made up my mind was the best day of my life and I won't forget it. I have talk to few others but none is committed to investing at the moment, but am hopeful they will come around one day just like I did. Since it's something that they will be the primary benefactors, I don't have to make it look as if I have personal interest in it.",

Some of them were appreciative and have come back to thank me because I exposed them to information about an opportunity that many of their peers have no knowledge of. But because you can refer someone to an opportunity and they never follow it up, I always let these people know that they also had a role to play in their development because they acted on the information and referral that they received by doing their research first before investing.",
