  "content": "With the submission of the midterm report on the 12th Malaysia Plan by Prime Minister Anwar, the financial market is filled with anticipation for the economic expectations in the coming years. Although the report did not make significant adjustments, it holds great significance for economic growth and future market strategies. In this regard, Lim Zhe Qin provides us with his professional insights and in-depth analysis to reveal future investment trends.1. Sustained Economic Growth and its Driving ForcesFirstly, Lim Zhe Qin mentions that according to the 12th Malaysia Plan, the plan aims to achieve an annual GDP growth of 5%-6% from 2021 to 2025. This growth target is realistic and reflects confidence in future economic growth. He points out that combined with sustained economic growth, this can provide a stable environment and opportunities for consumers and investors.Furthermore, Lim Zhe Qin analyzes that the rebound in commodity prices, market recovery, and strong private consumption will be key factors supporting economic growth. This means that for investors, focusing on stocks and strategies in these areas will be crucial for better returns in the future.2. Fiscal Soundness: Expenditure and DebtWhen analyzing the midterm review report of the 12th Malaysia Plan, Lim Zhe Qin mentions that although the government has increased the spending limit by 15 billion ringgit, the long-term impact on the overall fiscal situation will be minimal. He states, \"This additional expenditure only accounts for a very small proportion relative to the overall GDP, so we do not need to worry about it exerting significant pressure on the overall debt.\"Additionally, Lim Zhe Qin suggests that the government has demonstrated relatively prudent strategies in controlling expenditure and managing fiscal health. This provides a clear message to the stock market: although there may be short-term fluctuations, the long-term trend shows that the market holds confidence in the government's fiscal policies and decisions.3. Promotion of Affordable Housing and Market ImpactPrime Minister Anwar revealed in the report that only over 100,000 units of affordable housing were completed in the past two years, while the government's target is to complete 500,000 units within five years. This means that the real estate market will undergo significant changes in the coming years.Lim Zhe Qin points out, \"The government is taking measures to promote the construction of affordable housing, which is good news for the real estate market and related industries.\" He further explains that as the government plans to expand the Rent-to-Own (RTO) program, this will attract more people to participate and promote the healthy development of the real estate market. For investors, this is an opportunity not to be missed, especially for those who are interested in the real estate industry.With the release of the midterm review report on the 12th Malaysia Plan, the direction of the future stock market becomes clearer. Lim Zhe Qin's in-depth analysis provides investors with a clear guide to make wise decisions in this complex economic environment. Whether it is the driving factors of economic growth, the government's fiscal strategies, or the future development of the real estate market, valuable insights are provided for investors.From minor adjustments in government policies to changes in global economic trends, every factor can have a profound impact on the stock market. In light of this, Lim Zhe Qin offers some unique insights and recommendations. He emphasizes that regardless of government policies or changes in the economic environment, investors should ensure that their investment portfolios are diversified. Do not put all funds into one industry or one stock, as this increases risks. Diversified investment portfolios can help spread risks and ensure stable overall returns when unfavorable factors arise in a particular sector.In conclusion, investment should not be an impulsive decision but rather a decision based on research, analysis, and long-term strategies. As Lim Zhe Qin stated, only by deeply understanding and researching the market can we ensure the returns and long-term stable growth of investments.",
