No one else who is running Bitcoin Core needs to connect to another specific node, since they are running their own.

You cannot use this server to allow other people to connect to, however. The clue is in the name - Electrum Personal Server. The way this server software works is that you have to tell it in advance the addresses or extended public keys you want it to watch, and it performs a full blockchain rescan for these addresses/xpubs. Other people cannot use this with their wallets because the server hasn't scanned the blockchain in advance for their addresses. The upside to this is it is very lightweight and does not need much in the way of resources.If you want a server other people can use, you would need to run something like ElectrumX or Electrs, but these require much more resources.",

It's a bad idea to run it publicly as it'd expose you to DoS and maybe also other attacks.

This is called \"running a public node\". In this setup, anyone can connect their wallet to your node to send and receive transactions.To make your node public, you need to open the relevant port on your firewall and configure your node software to allow incoming connections. The exact steps for doing this will vary depending on your operating system and the specific software you are using to run your node.Once your node is configured to accept incoming connections, others can find your node by looking up its IP address. This can be done using a website that maintains a list of public nodes, such as https://bitnodes.earn.com/. Alternatively, you can advertise your node's IP address on forums or social media, or by sharing it with friends and contacts.There are several benefits to running a public node. For example, it can help to increase the decentralization of the Bitcoin network by providing additional network nodes that can be used by other users. It can also help to improve the security and reliability of the network, since more nodes means more redundancy and fewer single points of failure.However, there are also some potential downsides to running a public node. For example, it can require a significant amount of bandwidth and storage space to run a node, and you may need to upgrade your hardware to handle the additional load. It can also expose your node to potential security risks, since it will be accessible to anyone on the internet.Overall, whether or not running a public node is a good idea for you will depend on your specific circumstances and goals. If you have the resources and are willing to accept the risks, it can be a great way to contribute to the Bitcoin network and help to ensure its continued decentralization and security.",

Outgoing connections, alone, are enough to make your node public. Also, you don't have to mess with firewalls (if speed isn't a concern). You can download and upload blocks via Tor, and listen to incoming connections with no firewall configuration.

Furthermore, you can hide your IP with Tor or i2p, if that's a concern.In terms of hiding your IP address, you can indeed use tools like Tor or i2p to conceal your node's IP address and make it more difficult to identify and connect to. This can help to improve the security and privacy of your node, but it can also make it more difficult for other users to find and connect to your node. Ultimately, whether or not to use tools like Tor or i2p will depend on your specific goals and priorities. Or am I wrong?",

So it is a possibility that anyone who can intervene with the provider you are using, might see the IP address in behind.As for Tor, if you have done it correctly, there is no way anyone could know the real IP address behind a service. Do note, if you use Tor over VPN, it could be good or it also can be bad. See https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN.",
