It sounds a bit crazy that you can make more than 30% of the investment capital you deposited, back in profit in a year.  I am also getting security certificate warnings about your site, so I do not know if your SSL certificate are legit? In any way, it is nice to see those potential profits, but can we trust the calculations?",

Op, if this site is on alpha test, I think all the features should have been incorporated for a proper review and testing. Just that way you can not be able to get much feedback and as you can see, there are no much replies here because your website contains no much information or options for one to navigate through for a successful review here. So I think you should not expect much from who ever replies your thread here with respect to your website design.",

IMO, If these really happened without any problem (lose) and gettin 30%/years is quite to smooth since we all know from one of our history investment casino threads: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5239794.msg54203954#msg54203954Casino Investment still get some lose (while people think casino business is always profit) + potential the site is closed as well.",

      "body": "Welcome to bitcointalk forum @darkheroo, hope you stay active here because there are so many things to check out.So I checked out the predictor website and it is currently showing a 2x less profit amount than what I can see over a period of investment that I have done.Investing 1.0BTC on BaB, remove the dilution fee of 0.02BTC (2%) and remaining 0.98BTC is the actual amount for investment. Over the last 10days of my investment without any change happening to my bankroll value, the amount is now 0.995 BTC.So the difference here is 0.015BTC gains and that happened over 10days  -which make a daily rate of 0.15% and translates to a yearly rate of 54.75% - correct me if I am wrong.Note that this happened while there was a 400BTC massive withdrawal from the bankroll. Maybe if the bankroll was more stable, this number might be smaller.I expect this number of become a more stable over the next few months and we can determine a range between which it varies for people to get a better idea of.Offtopic : there is also a site called bustastats.com which notes the APY from BAB and Bustadice, seems to be dead since March 2023.",

I appreciate your transparency about the alpha status of your site and your plans to improve its accuracy. I'm also curious to hear what Devans thinks about your site, it would be great to have some insights from the platform's creator. Keep up the good work, and I hope your tool continues to evolve and provide valuable information to potential investors. Best of luck with your project!I compared what I could potentially gain if I were to invest in their casino, but it turned out to be smaller than what I'm currently investing in, which is unrelated to gambling. The current investment I have is a business with a physical location outlet, and the owner is well-known in our town. They offer a 30% return on your investment capital after a month, and the minimum investment required is quite low. Nothing, I just shared. I thought that the return from the casino would be larger compared to a traditional business.",

Which is why I will update my findings from my own investment to assist the OP in preparing a better calculation algorithm. Once I hit the 1month mark I will re-calculate the daily, monthly and expected yearly income and then see the trend. If we keep doing this update every few months we can chart and plot the changes over time and eventually get a good data.For now I think that by the next week my 2% dilution fee will be cleared off the book by the incoming money.",

It could be helpful for the gambling community if you create your own thread with your investment experience. Two forum members had shared their investment experience on the forum. Both of them had invested on Yolodice (closed casino) and one of them had invested in Bustadice (Bustabit sister site).

      "body": "Users above said their result came out to a 54% annual yield but when I input 1 BTC to a year I get the result of 0.33 BTC profit, that amount to 33% annual return. Which sounds insane but still is different than what others had as a result. Makes me wonder how this site works out the calculations. I also wonder if there was a single year where investors in a dice site had returns of 33% in BTC. Normally some data should be used to calculate returns but I don't know any website having data on dice side investments other than dicesites.com, and even for them I'm not sure if they make the whole raw data public.",

So even though these numbers sounds pretty impressive a first glance, that percentage could get adjusted for the sake of the long term sustainabilty of the casino and investors.",

      "body": "Well for a minute your site made me a rich person. I am not sure how you calculate that but I hope it's not just fun to play project where we insert some values and we see a high amount of yield in return. That looks good but that doesn't feel right when it comes to investing real money. After putting in 0.05 BTC for just 3 months, the calculator shows around 0.0036 in return. That is a very high yield given the period of investment and also the amount. However, now it making me go on the bustabit site and actually look for the real answers whether I am going to get that much profits or not so that I can invest. It is way way better as compared to shitty sites where they claim 3-4% daily returns, the ponzis. You have just given me some nice idea to make my investment worth it. Thanks for the tool and idea.

You are already there in dicesites.com, but you didn't find the answer that you're looking for to your other question? But if you can't see the raw data there, then the answer would be no. They try to make it private but it's understandable since those data's can be sensitive.",

You can't expect such returns anywhere, let alone in a dice site that takes public investment and could very well turn negative. At that rate you would become a millionaire in a few years even with an investment of 100$ initially. Hopefully OP is going to find some more realistic ways to make his calcolations.",
