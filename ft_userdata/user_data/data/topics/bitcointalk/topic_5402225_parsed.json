One positive thing I can see from this though is that some people will get scared and  maybe start realizing that their money stored at Coinbase is not as safe as they think it is.",

As I posted elsewhere many tech businesses don't do layoffs when they are doing well. It's the keep them around just in case we need them mentality. In this bear market, you can't just keep some people.I know someone who was just let go from Gemini. As she put it: Now she gets to spend the summer living off her severance package while doing nothing. As opposed to getting her regular paycheck to do nothing. The project her group was working on ended sometime in late 2021 with the deployment in early 2022. For the last 3 months she joked that her job was head youtube video watcher. So them letting those people go was not a surprise to any of them. BUT had this been a bull market they probably would still be there waiting for the next project while watching videos......-Dave",

As I posted elsewhere many tech businesses don't do layoffs when they are doing well. It's the keep them around just in case we need them mentality. In this bear market, you can't just keep some people.It's probably closer to the idea of airports needing more staff in summer and retail needing more staff in autumn/winter.It probably also depends where these layoffs are happening too, you probably won't be needing as many customer service representatives at this time but just enough of a workforce to keep the business flowing/functioning.Quote from: Rikafip on June 13, 2022, 06:44:12 AMQuote from: Bitcoin_Arena on June 12, 2022, 11:11:15 PMI didn't very much follow the whole Coinbase IPO  thing, but I guess not, so many people would want to buy stocks that are just dropping nonstop.

They publish financial information really far apart to actually look attractive to investors while they are making profits in a bull run. I think I've said before that investing in coinbase is essentially speculating on an asset already being speculated on. They also don't seem to be doing much to innovate either and are quite a basic exchange.There's the other side to this though that their stock might do like tesco did in the UK (they essentially made huge profits during the pandemic and gave a lot of that money away to their share holders paying a dividend yield of over 30%). Some other companies I've seen in the past have paid a dividend yield of 10% of profits regardless of how much their stock is actually worth (and in the European market, that's often 10-20% of the stock's value).  I'm keeping quiet about buybacks because I don't think they're as useful",

New tokens coming out are down to a trickle and a lot of crypto space is in a holding pattern. You can justify keeping people around when there is something coming, but if you can't see anything coming for new work / projects they are going to be let go.It is a micro view of the tech industry in general. Intel / AMD / Nvidia / ARM always have a new thing coming so there is always work for engineers as there is a lot of work for programmers in places like Microsoft / Adobe / Google etc. But smaller shops that are more project based routinely have layoffs.Now what I think is more important is the percentage. Buenbit cutting 45% of it's workforce is not a good thing. Bullish letting go 10% is not that big a deal. -Dave",
