  "content": "Someone should create a trap account that advertises itself as someone who sells forum accounts so we can once and for all mark the account buyers, I don't know if it's a weird solution but if we can also cull the account buyers itself then we can ultimately discourage the selling itself because if the buyers are afraid that they might be dealing with a narc then that would mean that they're going to have second-thoughts about buying an account which in turn lessens the demand which discourages sellers. It's also foolproof too if the one who does the entrapment is smart enough to lead on the buyer to their main account which is the likely thing that's going to happen.PS. I don't know if this is the appropriate board for this so bear with me, I know how to move the topic so just tell me where.",

Account sale is something that could be too hard to stop because anyone can decide to sell his account for another better jobs after feeling tired of the forum or doesn't want to associate themselves with here.",

I also doubt it will lead to exposing their original accounts. This account buyers won’t stop no matter the scheme deployed. The buying of account doesn’t seems to be prohibited by the forum rules just like it is frowned upon by members because of the scam, so this isn’t a Meta discussion but rather scam board discussion",

      "body": "Catch which account buyers? Are they a group of people who are just waiting for the sale? Oh no, they are not. Most people here know about this forum as a means of making money, and those who gave them that information have educated them that if you can get a higher-ranking account, you will start getting paid for that account. Now, the person who was introduced with the mindset that accounts can't be getting started looking for means to get a higher rank account, and this person can't be a group of people; they come to look for accounts to buy based on when they get the information. So we can't catch all of them at once, and more people who are going to buy accounts will also continue coming. If there is even going to be a solution, it should be that there should be a close watch attached to old Bitcointalk accounts that are inactive; that's those accounts created in the years 2014–2018 and 2019. If the users are no longer active, at least a few such accounts should be created, and a close eye should be on them. Based on my observation of the accounts that either got a neutral tag or a red tag for account buying, it always appears that most of those accounts are very old accounts that the owners don't make use of again, which makes them prey for hackers, and they already got the required merit airdropped to them to make them rank. If there can be a close mark on such accounts, seeing anyone with a long post sleeping and waking up, we can always question the credibility of such accounts for the owner to prove ownership. If that can be taken seriously and inside 10 bought accounts we can be sure of catching 5–6 of them, then the rate at which people buy will definitely reduce, but it can't be stopped because not all those buyers are aware of how much the forum is against it.",

Take for example, I busted a large account farming and in other for them to get their revenge on me, they decide to come to the forum create an account sales thread and then list my account there or just create the thread waiting for anyone (let’s say the undercover person) to message them and during the course of their discussion my account was showed to the person(the undercover) and eventually he comes to the forum and create a thread against my account for being sold or hacked, how do you think I’ll be able to defend myself? If anyone wants to go undercover so that they can fish out account that are being sold then they can do it quietly and not make loud noise about it, because if you make it obvious then scammers will just take advantage of it and use it to punish those that have hunted them in the past.",

What seems to me is that there are people who have hundreds (if not thousands) of BTT accounts and know that by selling them they can make a very nice profit. Whoever touched that mafia found themselves on their target (including me personally), and fighting them is like fighting cockroaches and bedbugs, they are very resistant and keep coming back again and again.The only thing we can do is to really work to discourage those who want to buy BTT accounts by tagging sellers, but also buyers who do it publicly. It would be best if the forum clearly prohibits such things and those who offer such services are permanently removed from the forum.One example of the fight against the Account Mafia",

The account seller puts up an ad and asks anyone interested to chat them on telegram or some other platform then they complete the trade there. In this case the user does not reveal their forum account throughout the trade, they just need to send the payment to the seller and wait for confirmation.What could work is to try to identify accounts which are owned by sellers and tag them. But the farms are so big that even if you tagged a hundred it will not make a significant difference and you cannot be certain the seller owns the account till you pay at which time I believe they send you the proof of ownership (emails and password).Overall, it's not worth the stress you will go through and you will not get cinclusve results.",

It’s better to create account and rank up naturally by posting constructive post for a better chance on campaign acceptance. Account selling is not a major issue anymore.I agree with this, nowadays campaigns ask you for a minimum of merits in the last 120, or at least tell you that you have to be active, things like that. So even if you buy the account, you won't be able to monetise it from day one, although it will probably cost you less time. Monetizing an account that you create from 0 is going to cost you at least 9 months, while a purchased account can start to be amortized in a month. That is if the person who sells it to you doesn't scam you or if some DTs don't realise that it's a purchased account and red tag you, so for me it's not worth it either (apart from the fact that it's ethically incorrect).",

I know that despite this, users still buy accounts, but only a few can manage to stay completely out of the radar and not be caught either due to change in posting style/pattern, language improvement or downgrade, etc",
