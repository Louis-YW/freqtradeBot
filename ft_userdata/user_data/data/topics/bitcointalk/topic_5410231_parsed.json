I also lost $50 or $100 there, I don't remember.This is either a scam or various schemes where users like you lose money. It is better to spend your time studying the cryptocurrency market.",

If you wanna sure involving in such pump and dump case and then you shall prepare yourself if you are facing a huge lose. Whales and some groups were actively pumping some coins. Im not even feeling doubt about that. Remember about when GME pump was happening in the past. This scheme was a scam. The group owners have been buying more tokens. You can lose your money in a few seconds.",
