  "content": "For the OGs and some more experienced Bitcointalk users this is nothing new.However, for all the hundret-thousands of newer accounts it may be suprising to know that you can still read all posts made by the real Satoshi him/herself.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3Profile ID #3 it is. #1 was used for admin stuff only, #2 does not existFor me it was still a nice revelation to fully understand that this forum was created by the Legend. The person that changed modern history more than 14 years ago by publishing the Bitcoin whitepaper (for reference see: https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper). A strange thought to be in a slightly abstract way so close to the source of it all.Even more amazing is the fact everyone can read his/her first thoughts and comments on the early implementations of Bitcoin right here.In a sense every forum member (currently over 3.5 million!) is part of crypto / Bitcoin history. Congrats. Two questions: 1. Were you aware of this simple fact? - If yes, have you ever read a Satoshi post before?2. Did you ever take a look at the Bitcoin whitepaper? - If not, will you do so now?",

Bitcointalk is an important part of Bitcoin's history because many activities of the early days have taken place on Bitcointalk. It's not only Satoshi's Bitcointalk Account but also topics like Bitcoin Pizza, for example. Some years ago, xtraelv made a good compilation: The most iconic bitcointalk threads. History on Bitcointalk.Most likely, we are still early but all members which have been active, while Satoshi was still active here, have been really early.",

And with almost all of them gone, it is definitely an honor of the forum, and to everybody else who's still here, to still have them around until now despite the obvious decadence in discussions. It seems it's only theymos who's remained active, though. BitcoinFX, the first user to have responded to Satoshi's first post, although last logged in just a couple of months ago, hadn't made a post for several months already. On a side note, it is interesting that it took more than 2 months before Satoshi's welcome post, his/her/their first post, had a reply. BitcoinFX did it.I took a quick look at the earliest users, at least the first 50 of them, and it seems nobody is here joining discussions anymore. But it's interesting to note that a number of them have made their last log in just months or a year or two ago, even days ago in the case of DannyM, despite them making their last post many years prior. They've probably changed hands already.",

That's where satoshi posted. After a while it migrated to forum.bitcoin.org, which was also created by satoshi, I believe. Satoshi was last active in 2010. On August 01, 2011, theymos announced that the forum is moving from forum.bitcoin.org to bitcointalk.org. This migration happened after satoshi already disappeared. Quote from: theymos on August 01, 2011, 07:07:34 AMAt the request of Sirius, who owns bitcoin.org and the server this forum is hosted on, I have moved forum.bitcoin.org to bitcointalk.org. This is the final result of a long email discussion among many developers, exchange operators, etc. I have always been opposed to the move, but Sirius wanted to act according to consensus.The forum was the only thing on bitcoin.org except for a few static pages, so I don't feel like we've lost too much by separating from it.",

Or some of those who took time to mine Bitcoin very early because Bitcoin showed some signs of a promising future are the same people who didn't really take care of their coins. They're throwing away hard drives, forget private keys, didn't keep a back up, give Bitcoins away, trade them for whatever cheap stuff, and so forth.QuoteQuote from: Darker45 on December 29, 2022, 02:18:14 AMThey've probably changed hands already.Not sure if some of these early Accounts have changed hands because if so, it wouldn't make sense to log in only from time to time and just keep observing.

Oh yeah, it is indeed possible they've been silently lurking, observing the forum, or perhaps it's their children or other family members who've got the passwords. If the former, unfortunately, them just logging in and not responding for years probably means there's no more discussion worth chiming in. But I guess it's good enough that after at least a decade, they still haven't really left the forum. Perhaps there's still a reason left to drop by every now and then.",

It is. But I doubt anyone (not even Satoshi) could have imagined that bitcoin would be worth thousands of dollars one day back in the days when it was still trading for a few bucks. The network's features, the way the blockchain works, and the problems it was set out to solve are just one side of the coin. Those things were there when bitcoin was worth $6, just like they were there when it exploded to $60.000. The speculative price or the \"premium on top\", like franky likes to call it, is not something that can be predicted.",
