  "content": "Considering how Royse777's casino promotion ended in him being tagged by several DT-members, I'm curious what the community thinks of the following:A week ago, Gianluca95 (Trust:  +5 / =1 / -0) created a signature campaign with \"Trusted and Safe BTC Mixing\" in the title. That's a very strong vouch, without any proof whatsoever. Gianluca95 refers to their ANN thread, in which it was mentioned 5 days before the signature campaign was started that there's no reason to trust this site.The user (Shaker_finance) who promotes the site shows red flags that I've seen many times before. Typically, this is how a scammer respond when someone doubts their legitimacy. Some examples:Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 04, 2022, 01:58:16 AMTrusted and safe bitcoin mixing solutionsI don't trust sites that claim to be trusted. That's up to the users to decide.Quote from: https://loyce.club/archive/posts/6050/60503669.htmlUnlimited max amount: Send any amount and mixing will go smoothlyQuote from: Shaker_finance on July 05, 2022, 01:11:16 PMFor unlimited amount - we have reserves and able to serve big amountsIt sounds like they don't want to share yet at what amount they'll pull an exit scam.Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 07, 2022, 12:23:38 AMThose are stats from our tests. Try to make mix you will see that they're dynamic. The problem is that we almost don't have users yet that's why stats are fixed atmHardcoded \"live mixing\", I've seen that before. Needless to say: that mixer pulled an exit scam.Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 07, 2022, 08:08:17 PMSgning is not safeHe's either hiding his lack of funds, or he found a massive vulnerability in Bitcoin! My money is on the former.Quotewe will deposit soon around 40-50k$ on forums deposits, including wwh-club, exploit, xss and some others where we have advertisement or planning to have it, arranging this moment with project investorsRight. Some third party future action is supposed to convince us now that the site is safe.Quote from: LoyceV on July 11, 2022, 11:45:05 AMQuote from: Shaker_finance on July 05, 2022, 01:11:16 PMFor unlimited amount - we have reserves and able to serve big amountsQuote from: Shaker_finance on July 07, 2022, 08:08:17 PMSgning is not safeCombining those two statements is a very big red flag. Signing a message is an established method to provide proof of funds. Claiming you have \"unlimited\" amounts and refusing to prove even a tiny 10BTC balance doesn't inspire confidence.Quote from: LoyceV on July 14, 2022, 11:21:47 AMQuote from: Shaker_finance on July 12, 2022, 01:12:47 AMsigning is not safe that's correctBitcoin mixers rely on trust. Lying is the one thing a Bitcoin mixer should never do. I've seen signed messages from addresses holding thousands of Bitcoins, and they didn't get stolen.Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 14, 2022, 05:25:06 PMclaiming unlimited and 20 BTC was actually the same to usRight....Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 14, 2022, 05:25:06 PMSpeaking for exploit, if you think it's not trusted that doesn't mean it's not trusted, people have 0.5-1 mln $ deposits hereI've seen this before too: using large numbers to convince people, instead of a simple signed message. Anyone can make up a large number, not many people can sign a message from such an Bitcoin address.Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 14, 2022, 05:25:06 PMI can't say how much time to wait, summer at the moment and part of the team at the vacations.There's the excuses, always nice to see the team goes on vacation right after launching.And there's the character attacks:Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 14, 2022, 01:31:12 PMI understand that you are serious guy trying to make 1$ advertising chipmixer with your signature but we can do good without your adviceQuote from: Shaker_finance on July 15, 2022, 01:14:02 PMonly you lie here, I say how it works~you won't even go and check it because it's easier to flame on my topic and get 1-2$ for advertising chipmixer lol...Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 15, 2022, 01:25:38 PMwhat's not clear here ??!!!!! You lie here only and try to interpret my words absolutely other way for some reasonYou are piece of shit spamming on my topic, ~ I try to be polite with people but not with assholes ~stop this bullshit flood on this topic~you start behaving aggressiveThis kind of language typically comes from scammers who see their \"business model\" evaporate. I've seen it so many times.Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 17, 2022, 09:31:52 AMI don't care what you think at all and I'm professional until people start behaving way aggressive. ~ Toxic commentators are nowhere welcomedAnd there's Trust abuse:When this site scams someone, which I think is quite likely to happen, will Gianluca95 take the fall for them and get tagged?Just 3 days ago (4 days after Gianluca95 started the signature campaign), he left Royse777 the following positive feedback: QuoteTrustworthy user that have always worked correctly. A great signature campaign manager and a great communicator. I like his style. Forum needs more member like him.I don't know what to make of this.",

According to what you say and what I have seen in Ann, there are many points that make me distrust the mixing service, but if we are talking about the campaign manager, we would have to see, for example, what degree of involvement he has had. If he has presented himself as a potential parter of the service, for example as it happened in the case of Royse777 or he has simply been hired for the signature campaign.We also know that there are many people in DT who do not necessarily have the same vision of things. So he can be tagged by some and defended by others.With all the respect I have for you, it seems to me that this question you are asking comes more from a certain empathy towards Royse777, than from a purely objective analysis of the situation. BTW, I've just seen that Gianluca95 left positive feedback to Royse777 recently.",

      "body": "This could be misinterpreted due to your sig and cause a huge flame war between that company and yourself. That being said, I believe you have a genuine care for the forum and it's participants so it's a non issue for me. My feeling, you think a site is going to screw someone does not mean that they will screw someone. What we have seen in the past doesn't mean this site is the same. It could 100% be the same, I'm not saying that. Until they do scam, there shouldn't be a thread like this right? It's a really good subject to bring up and I'm super curious as to what everyone else is going to say here. On one hand, by saying you/me/us feel this site is going to scam, you are looking out for the communities safety. On the other hand you are being libelous and damaging that sites reputation without any proof the site has/will scam. So is it better to accuse and say sorry later? Or better to let a company be until they assrape someone for a huge chunk?Far as Gianluca goes he has been launching a bunch of small 1 week campaigns which are useless to the companies. I'm not sure if he is just thinking of his pocket or has a genuine thought that a super small 1 week campaign helps a company. I don't know if he would reject an offer from a company at this point. He has yet to prove himself is what I'm saying. In the past, if a red flag pops up, it has been fine for a manager to close the campaign and all the animosity is towards the site not the manager.Quote from: Poker Player on July 17, 2022, 03:47:15 PMWith all the respect I have for you, it seems to me that this question you are asking comes more from a certain empathy towards Royse777, than from a purely objective analysis of the situation. This is interesting as well. I had no bad feelings towards Royse myself until I stared reading their replies in the Bitlucy thread and in their thread on the subject. Royse was responding full of anger and attacking users and I felt attacking myself which is why I washed my hands of the situation. You guys can like or dislike whomever you want, but still have to be objective when having/giving your opinion. I liked masterp til the scumbag stole 5 bitcoins from me.",

It's literally the only ICO endorsed by theymos!Seriously though: this is exactly why people lose their money on Twitter when someone's account gets hacked again.

A+ Forum member!Quote from: LoyceV on July 17, 2022, 03:36:49 PMWhen this site scams someone, which I think is quite likely to happen, will Gianluca95 take the fall for them and get tagged?I didn't want to give any attention and feedback to Shaker Finance, but after doing some research and asking simple questions, they started with insults.Just to make it clear, I am not affected at all with words coming from other people, but I made legitimate questions, suggestion and his answer was insults.This is a clear red flag for me so I decided to give them temporary red flag as a warning to newbies to be careful with this website.I never said they are 100% scam, but they are high risk and everyone should be careful using this website for mixing coins.I am thinking of starting new topic dedicated for Shaker Finance, when I collect more information.Quote from: yahoo62278 on July 17, 2022, 03:51:37 PMOn one hand, by saying you/me/us feel this site is going to scam, you are looking out for the communities safety. On the other hand you are being libelous and damaging that sites reputation without any proof the site has/will scam. So is it better to accuse and say sorry later? Or better to let a company be until they assrape someone for a huge chunk?You are being a bit of hypocrite here because you recently gave Royse777 a negative feedback intentionally without having any proof, and claiming he didn't ''clean his name''.So if someone calls you a piece of shit and stupid retard that is not reason to think that some website is potential scam, but when you are constantly beating the dead horse with Royse, you can give him negative feedback... that is your logic.Check topic first, take a quick look at where you've tried to call me liar few times when I explained you on forum deposits and delete this message you've just created. Reasonable response to aggression",

Royse had claimed to be a partner and the site had some questionable issues pop up. Rather then answer users with a cool head, Royse decided to be a big asshole to anyone who had questioned them. Same as this mixing service if ya ask me, just plain unprofessional. Then Royse opens the thread explaining their side. If you bothered to read the thread, I was very empathetic and was supporting them at 1st. Then, Royse decided instead of answering a few questions and trying to clear up my concerns, to attack me and basically say I was stealing their business. I'm sorry but that company contacted me, I didn't contact them. If ya act like a baby, i'll treat ya like 1. Royse fucked up and instead of handling the heat, they decided to make it personal. If they wanna act that way then I have no more use for the situation. Maybe an apology from Royse should happen.dkbit98 we are off topic here and if you have a problem with me and need to start a thread, by all means do it. Or pm me and see if we can figure out your issue. Otherwise get off my nuts.",

If that is the problem, then there is no-problem, the mixer have approached Gianluca to run their campaign here for them, they have told him that they are trusted and safe, and he has included it in their campaign thread, there's been nothing to the contrary since the campaign launched, have there? If they indeed as your feelings tell you, screw people, then all Gianluca needs to do is to close the thread, and take what he said about them down, he already told us he isn't affiliated with their service. Gianluca is endorsing the company that has hired him, that is why he has included \"safe and trusted\" in the thread, he has not compelled any member to use them. You said this a while ago in another thread LoyceVI think you hit the nail on the head. Twice in your two responses in this thread. I have not given you merit because I am out atm.Quote from: Shaker_finance on July 17, 2022, 04:42:31 PM-snipYour ways of answering make me distrust you, as yahoo62278 told you before. That is no way to respond if you manage a business. You have a lot to learn from this one:  SCAM EXCHANGE MONITOR: BestChange",

Signature campaign is actually marketing activity and it's only aim is to get as many click as possible. And yes we want to become trusted mixer but it won't happen within 1 week or 1 month.
