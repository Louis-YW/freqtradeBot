  "content": "During the 2021 era bitcoin price flourished and many investors made lots of profits, out of love for our family and friends it’ll be improper not to tell them about crypto. Even when they’re asking so many question and ready to invest into the market to earn like every other person did. Though I could remember, sometimes last year, telling the writer of my project who asked multiple questions about bitcoin not to buy bitcoin at 50k as he may not gain profits yet. Some of us may have inspired their loved ones to invest into bitcoin. What do you have in mind to tell them about the falling price of bitcoin during the Xmas Dinner? Coin market cap made an article about this and how to explain things in details for them to understand. Beginning with the Terra fall, Three Arrow Capital, Celsius, down to FTX who tried to save the market, but ended up tearing the recovering bitcoin price apart. Don’t forget to add the Russia-Ukraine war as an attribute to the bear market.What are your contributions to the right answers for people who ask questions like why the market price is so affected during the festive period? They’ll be lots of questions to be asked by our family members who invested into cryptocurrency last year, how do we get ready for them?https://cointelegraph.com/news/xmas-dinner-table-what-to-tell-your-family-about-what-happened-in-crypto-this-year",

      "body": "I generally follow the rule of not giving investment advice to any people, including loved ones. I can share my thoughts if they seem interested, but I always mention the risks (e.g. that there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will recover from the bear market only because it recovered from previous ones, there's no guarantee that it will recover fairly fast, there's a real risk of the investment going down for some time). After all, why would I give any reason for others to blame me for the money they lost? People should make their own decisions about investments.",

I avoid to tell people where to put their money both family members or friends, I am not a financial advisor, after all. I mostly talk about the technology behind Bitcoin and how it helps to transmit value in a decentralized way, but I don't talk about speculation often.Last time someone asked me if it was a good idea to buy Bitcoin to speculate, I told them \"I don't know\". Anyone buying Bitcoin for short term or mid term gains is supposed to be ready for high fluctuations of price. So I do not need to think what to tell my family about this bear market.",

Be it BTC, or any other investment.If you think differently then figure out why if you were treating BTC / crypto as an investment you would discuss it any differently then investing in something else.-Dave",

And I'll let them know that, according to the history of Bitcoin, there are always a bear markets and bull runs in the cryptocurrency market.so after the bear market period, it will lead to bull run which occurs due to halving in blockchain, which happens consistently every four years. I'll let them know that they shouldn't worry too much about the current market situation that is already leading to an end. I will calm them with some works like they shouldn't let the fear of losing be greater than the excitement of their winning because we are closer to our profit period.",

Perhaps if I recommended this crypto investing to a friend, then I can explain that there are a lot of factors that contributed to the current situation of the market. Great emphasis on the Terra scam and FTX funds' misappropriation as I believe these two are the greatest movers of market sentiment that sent us to where we're at right now. If not started by Terra, and not ended by FTX, we could have a great sideways market but eh, they just have to ruin the fun for most of us.",

They knew about the possibility of the bear market before they joined, so as they are experiencing it currently, their consolation is that the person who inspired them to join is experiencing same market effect and hasn't quit.

What needs to be said I have said before they invest, not wait until now to say.For sure you want to give an advice but it won't be that easy. Doing so would somehow create an idea that you are encouraging them towards this industry. Problem has something to do with market price volatility which could yield to huge profit loss if things wo 't be handled properly. So I somehow agree with this idea of either choosing people who you think has potential, and avoiding to do such in order to not encourage them right from the start.",

These three accidents brought down the entire crypto market, and if anyone asks, we should explain the story behind the dump. There are more Binance rumors floating around.

Market conditions fluctuate a lot so you have to be careful in deciding because it is your money, and you are responsible for managing it, including investing in the coins you want.And if market prices are affected so much during the holiday period, it may be because people want to have cash so they sell their coins for fiat to spend. But surely there are many reasons why the price fluctuates or gets affected. And another piece of advice is to buy bitcoins at a price you can afford and hold on as long as you can until you see the price can go up very high, then sell immediately to take that profit.",
