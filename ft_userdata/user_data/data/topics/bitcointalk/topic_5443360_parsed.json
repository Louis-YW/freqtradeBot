There are a few reputable reviewers here, like GOSU and GamblingBro that have reviewed casinos from time to time.After all, gambling is all about luck and house edges hence it's a business for making money.",

It’s normal that they will want profit from customers money by means of loss. They don’t need to do this shitty algorithms to scam players just to have a profit because they already have the house edge on all of the games which guarantee their win in the long run. They just need a good marketing and promotion to let player stay in the casino.I watch this video long time ago. He might telling the truth about the casino he is working before but there’s no assurance that other casino is doing it too. Gambling doesn’t promise any profit at all that’s why casino always say to bet responsibly.",

      "body": "Do not forget that casinos are more or less a business oriented organization. So therefore would want to make more profits to running the casino and also salary payment to her staff. Just like every individual, gamblers or bettors would want to make profit from gambling on casinos same it is applicable to casinos too. No one wants to loss. I some times feel the same way you too feel about casinos intentionally doing what they could to strap gamblers of their hard earned resources all in the name of gambling for fun. Although not all do it intentional but believe me you, they always want More gamblers to fail do they could make more profits to their coffers.  I think sometimes the issues of account ban and suspension must likely be that the casino might be running short of funds do would probably generate more funds from that act of theirs in banning and suspending accounts but they would not say it for us to know rather they would find fault and do the dirty job on people's account and funds.",

It's pretty much simple than you are thinking as of. Well, play on casinos where you can verify your bets; if you are familiar with provably fair, so it shouldn't be an issue for you.

As you mention some of the games are provably fair and the site can't manipulate those ones, but games like slots can be manipulated because users can't verify the bets in those ones, and since the casino has a license we don't have any option than trust on them.My recommendation is to play games where you can verify the bets.",

We are going to make some wins somehow and lose over time. It's not scamming but it's just designed for us to lose. I think people though are starting to learn that more than half of the people here I guess are going for sports betting. That's a gradual escape from luck-based games.  One thing that the video was saying is true even in online casinos was that the more you lose, you become a VIP. Yup ultimately you are a winner.",

Oftentimes, whether it's online or land-based casinos, the house edge lets a novice gambler who enters their casino platform win first.    Until the house edge sees that the gambler is entertained and they see that he enjoys winning all the time until it becomes a habit of their gamblers.

Casino makes profits, if that wasn't a sure thing they wouldn't exist.And obviously when someone is winning irregular amounts of money compared to other users they are being investigated how are they doing that. Could be a hack or any number of things.And suicide calls. I don't understand in what level company would need to react to them. Only thing you can do really is to report them, if you are taking them personally you will just go insane. And not just casinos get them, if you are big enough you will get all sorts of crazy calls and letters.Even the cryptocobain got his share of this.",

And if you know you are going to lose, then why gambling in the beginning? My point is that you have to understand how casino operates before you put your first bet and if you lose then maybe it's not your lucky day, or you may want to check how provably fair that casino is, or at least their games.",
