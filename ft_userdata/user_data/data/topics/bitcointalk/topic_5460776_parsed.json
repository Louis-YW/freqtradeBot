Thus your trading understanding may have reached a broad knowledge stage, as you mentioned geopolitical issues that can pressure currency and increase commodity assets. Forex trading, as I know, usually buys foreign currency and indeed this is much easier to do because we can see developments in the world economy through several events as a reference for the right time to go short or long. But if that's what you mean, why should you invite the community to join your group.Unless you are trying to provide evidence of the success you have had and maybe some people will trust you. In recent years in my country there have been many fraud cases involving investing in forex and until now there has been no resolution from the leader inviting people to join it and most of them escape responsibility.",

Are you here to learn something, or are you here to organise a group in another location to study business? In a forum, you can ask as many questions as you want to learn everything there is to know about cryptocurrencies and business in general. Regardless of the situation, you will always receive at least 90% of the answers to your queries. Because many forum users are not who you might assume they are, many of them have been active on the site for a long time and continue to do so in order to answer any questions new forum users may have regarding cryptocurrencies or managing your finances.I didn't see any reason for you to be looking for people to join your group for any other discussion or information because everything here is excellent for everyone, and I believe you should think carefully before posting anything here because most people will assume that you aren't in the forum to discuss worthwhile topics and many people will assume that you are in the forum to attract people's attention and con them. Even though forming a group is not a bad thing, it is best to do so with people you can trust and with whom you have a good relationship because if you try to work together to achieve financial goals without first getting to know each other, there will eventually be a misunderstanding.",
