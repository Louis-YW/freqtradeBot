  "content": "Join the rebirth of Uniswap’s first swapped token Jacky Chan Dollar ($JCD) in 2023: Beyond memes and metas to the start of DEFI in 2018.Defi history in the making! The best meta/narrative of 2023!Uniswap represents a break from the control of Centralized Exchanges over the custody of our digital assets. In the decentralized world, it was this decentralized swap that unlocked the ability to trade tokens and have self custody over them on the Ethereum network. This is where it all began for DEFI! We could not have landed on a better narrative just before the upcoming bull market.The escape from the matrix began when $JCD became the first token to have been swapped on uniswap. The first test token to have liquidity added was Hay, but $JCD was the first one to be traded. This is the grandfather OG token that started everyone on their DEFI journeys!That was 5 years ago. Fast forward to 2023. The first token to have liquidity added by the founder of Uniswap was $HAY as well as the the third token, based on Ashleigh Schap, another co-founder of Uniswap.Shortly after these two tokens had been revived, Jacky Chan Dollar $JCD followed suit. The token name is taken from the engineer who designed the entire UI of Uniswap five years ago. Jacky Chan, a bona fide Uniswap co-founder, is a crucial piece of the Uniswap history as well as crypto.Our current logo for $JCD.Jacky Chan was the top holder of $JCD since the beginning, which was the majority of the supply. He is no longer holding them all and they have been redistributed to the community. Now, the community of $JCD has taken over the supply and the future of the token, and they have all decided to add to the liquidity of the token to encourage bigger trades and more volume! Just as Uniswap broke the chains of CEXes for many, $JCD has the potential to help the masses break free from tokens that require a meta or a tweet to pump. This token has the royal pedigree along with $HAY and $SCHAPP to reach multi millions if not more over the long term. This is the meta above all the metas, as well as the meme to rule them all.Join our DEFI blast from the past through our social media:Website: https://jchandollar.com/Twitter: https://twitter.com/JChanDollarTelegram: https://t.me/JChanDollar",
