Brain wallets are inherently insecure, and this is an incredibly insecure one at that, given that this brain wallet is generated from an empty string. There are public databases out there which show tens of thousands insecure brain wallets, along with their associated generation string, which have been used in the past, and there are individuals out there with private databases with hundreds of thousands more potential brain wallets generated from things like words, common phrases, song lyrics, book/movie quotes. These individuals set up bots to monitor all these addresses, used and unused, and as soon as any coin is deposited immediately sweep it to their own wallet.",

It doesn't happen very often that larger amounts of coins, like >500k sat, hit those addresses. Well, those 0.9BTC recently were quite some surprise to me as it's a long time ago that the equivalent of a five digit fiat value was sent in coins to such addresses. I can't wrap my head around how to be so reckless and uninformed.Anyway, I don't monitor the thousands of addresses of vulnerable brainwallets or keys derived from publicly available data. It should be common knowledge by now that such \"wallets\" are stupid and a recipe to loose coins.I don't think it's necessary to pamper such a minority of \"victims\". It may sound cruel, but you can't rescue everyone. People involved with crypto coins need to respect and take responsibility for their doing. Your safety net is to learn how it works, learn best practices and don't try to invent some likely stupid procedures that others have already fallen victim to. I may sound snobby. I made mistakes, too. I try my best to learn from my and other's mistakes.",
