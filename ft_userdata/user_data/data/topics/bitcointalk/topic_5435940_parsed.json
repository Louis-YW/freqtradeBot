Rather than buying merit (AFAIK starts from $5/merit), merit fishing on Wall Observer or doing certain task (such as sign with PGP/bicoin address), merit/account farmer could choose host small giveaway instead. For example, if @Mitch212 were to deliverer his promise, he could got a good deal ($25/20 merit or $1.25/merit). And the cost could be reduced to almost $0 if he decide to make his altcoin as winner.And i also agree there's no sufficient proof about connection between @Rbah and @Mitch212.

Even if $25 is given away in that thread there needs a tamper proof and transparent method of selecting the winner. Quote from: Ratimov on January 19, 2023, 10:40:45 AMOf course, these are not direct accusations, as circumstantial evidence is presented, just some thoughts for reflection. In addition, Rbah has written very few posts in order to conduct a full-fledged posting analytics, but the account is extremely suspicious and already has several similarities with the previous organizer of such a lottery.You did nothing wrong by creating this thread. To a degree we can negate the problems created by lack of information in that giveaway thread because the creator is a newbie but to not make it clear in the OP how a winner will be selected is not good. What is worse is that most members lined up to participate without even asking for clarity and many of them were here a long time.For those that do not know, I am running a free lottery and you can enter there if you are interested:  JollyGood Free Lottery #1: FURY vs USYKI have added $25 to the prize and Ratimov has kindly donated $25 to the prize therefore $50 will be given to the winner.

As may have been noticed by others, I did not join for those precise reasons.In that thread we get to post #6 before a suggestion is made on how to select the winner and the OP replies in post #7 that he will spin a wheel or maybe ask a trustworthy member to do it. There is no clarity on exactly what is happening but the benefit of the doubt is given because they are a newbie. To a point I can understand that but it is down to members participating in the giveaway to ask the most basic of questions.Quote from: LoyceV on January 19, 2023, 11:53:54 AMQuoteWhat is worse is that most members lined up to participate without even asking for clarity and many of them were here a long time.I joined.

I did mostly because I was curious about how things will develop, being aware of Mitch212's scam, which had a similar giveaway, in September 2022. Both were made by users with low ranks, both had no rules stated from beginning.However, unlike Mitch212, Rbah did not get (so far) benefit of too many merits. So far, he received just 1 and, I believe, until he'll pay this is also the only merit he'll receive for this giveaway.I agree, this giveaway seems fishy, yet I would advise to not jump to conclusion. Until this very moment no scam was done. Most likely, we will find out the truth in less than 4 days from now on. He may be too new here or not too thorough to properly organize his mind and this may also be a reason for which he did not post any rules yet. So far, all I saw in his favor is his statement from post #7:Quote from: Rbah on January 17, 2023, 12:33:25 PMthe way i was thinking is to add the user with his address in a wheel and who ever it lands on get the prize or i could ask someone trustworthy to roll it I don't mindI believe that, if the rolling will be done by someone with a good reputation on the forum, nobody will complain about fairness in choosing the winner. Of course, the most important aspect, even in this case, is that we need to see the winner receiving the prize. Let's just have patience for a few more days then, certainly, things will clear up.After all, we've all seen a Newbie paying back 1000$ in BTC; it can also happen to see one paying a prize of 50$.",
