Do some reading about the different technical indicators and chart patterns from sites like Investopedia, babypips.com3. Watch YouTube videos regarding technical analysis. Do not follow financial advice, but rather learn how they carry out technical analysis live. Some of the YouTubers are just shills trying to get referrals so be careful4. Start practicing the different strategies which you think might best suit your trading style using demo/paper trading accounts (available on different platforms such as tradingview, MEXC, OKX, Bybit etc.)5. You can now start practicing using real money, but money that you can afford to lose. Practicing is the only way you can completely learn how to analyze and trade.",

Apart from technical analysis, you need a few more skills to succeed in trading. I am going to list them down and I hope you work on them before venturing into trading. Risk Management - Managing Risk requires some basic skills like how to use stop loss, position sizing and always maintaining a disciplined approach.Fundamental Analysis - Tacking news, regulatory changes, and technological developments fall under it.Patience - You would need a lot of patience. Controlling your emotion is very compulsory otherwise you might take a wrong decision.Financial Management - You will need to work on budgeting, profit/loss calculation, and risk allocation",

Since you are new to trading, you need to gain a good understanding of trading first. Apart from acquiring a good understanding of trading, you need to apply that understanding practically. To put your idea into practice, you need to have an account on any exchange. After opening an account in the exchange, you can put your idea into practice by depositing some amount of money there. Thus if you apply the concepts in practice step by step you will become a skilled trader.",

All the brokerage firms making buzz about the tools they have about the price prediction and so called trading view. You pick any app over the internet, everyone will have trading view and basically they become expert in the field immediately. In reality all they have is open source UI and algorithm which runs same set of information and gives the results to us. I don’t know but you don’t even need to worry about the TA to be done by all yourself. The Call and put options / way of trading is even crazy. The software tells you how many of them buying and selling and they tell us to follow the same. Isn’t this is spooky?",

Trading is only profitable for very little part of traders like 1% to 20% of all traders. Do you want to be 80% to 99% of failed traders?What percentage of day traders fail?It is only about trading.

I don't know if you think there are any specific analysis to make before starting trade or owning some Bitcoin. Of course, you would have to have made and agreed to a formal way to invest in the coins you want to use, I believe an account on the exchange you want to use should be registered and proper KYC verified.The device to use is another aspect, either it is a laptop, desktop or phones and tablets.Finding like minded traders willing to direct and teach, invest to get some coins. Grow your knowledge by doing personal research and joining communities as these. You good to go! It begins with the quest to understand first.",

Technical analysis is nothing but predicting the future of market movement and ofcourse everybody knows that it's impossible to predict the future with accuracy but still it plays a part if the fundamentals met the criteria of an asset for example here we talk about bitcoin which has the price history of over 10 years and we are assuming its future growth based on it.Technical analysis is simple and complicated too depends on how much we include it into our decision making. And TA is not really mandatory for someone to be a trader however they will understand the concept when they are into the market.",

This is very important and you can also learn this by just watching those guys who are also providing technical analysis.I think it's the RSI that is the easiest to learn as it can be used in all TF. The moving averages are just to see where the trend's direction is. When to buy and when to sell is the next that you need to determine and with the help of indicators still, you will be able to decide when to execute buy and sell.",

Not a lot of people can understand it completely which means that it is not going to be a simple job.I think it is better if you could focus on what you could do, and that means we are talking about making as much profit as you could after you learned it. How do you understand you learned enough to trade? Well, there are two ways, one is you will learn it by seeing, like you would write down on a piece of paper when you will buy it without buying it, and then check later if you were right. Second is spending just a tiny amount to trade and see if you could.",

Although  this one isnt really that solely focusing out on crypto but rather its on forexbut it is really just that overall the same on how technical indicators should be used or when it would be used and other stuffs. The real deal or target on here is to get that sufficient information on things and even on candle reading which it would really be that crucial once you do dive in into crypto space.Just remember out that you shouldnt really be rushing out yourself on making money because this is usually the primary mistake of someone who do make some rush up just because they are really that too eager on earning money which is really that very wrong.",
