So, what happens if the Spot ETF application are denied? What happens when the hype around the next Halving blows over.... will we still see those ATHs that are predicted?",

So, what happens if the Spot ETF application are denied? What happens when the hype around the next Halving blows over.... will we still see those ATHs that are predicted?   Yeah, it is all guessing, no one knows for sure.  To me the ETF is icing on the cake since it just opens up another avenue for people to get into the ecosystem.  And as far as the halving, well, every other halving resulted in higher prices due to stable or increased demand and a cut in the new supply by half.  By their nature forecasts, the fore implies it should be something in the future, not what they see out the window now.  As you say, there forecast isn't much use.",
