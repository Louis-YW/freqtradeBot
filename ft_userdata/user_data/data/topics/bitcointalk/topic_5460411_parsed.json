But if you send the coin that is tracked to a mixer like Whirlwind and you mix it, that is no more anonymity as you want to achieve privacy. That is privacy. Mixers are used for privacy reasons.Quote from: Forever101 on July 20, 2023, 07:15:09 AMAs technology don improve, e dey possible to track Bitcoin transaction back to where e don start with their IP. You can always use Tor instead of using IP address directly to connect to your noncustodial wallets. You can do that on computer. Orbot makes that possible on phone. But mixers are still very important to achieve privacy.Tor for anonymity.Mixers for privacy.Quote from: Forever101 on July 20, 2023, 07:15:09 AMAs e get good side na so e still get small disadvantage, them don associate the mixer stuff with money laundry and some other illegal act.Let us take Boko Haram and bandits in Nigeria as examples. What are they using for survival? Is it not Naira and fiat in general? Another example are the people in public offices. What are they using for embezzlement? Is it not banks. Another example. Is naira not connected to money laundering? Money laundered are mixed with legit money, using legit businesses to make the public not to know. Fiat is more used for online criminal activities.If some people use mixers for bad activities, it is what is related to money. There is nothing related to money that bad actors will not get involved. It is also worth knowing that mixers are not a disadvantage for good users. You used a reputed mixer and you will not be scammed. That is not a disadvantage because it helps people's privacy.",

      "body": "Privacy is the paramount role of a mixer. And add it to weti my colleague as said, and my own understanding of mixer. Mixer is the turning of coins among users. Examples:  A sends coins to a mixer and provided two addresses. One for sending the coins and the other to receive back the coins from the mixer company. So the one wey im go received the coins is the B Address which is own by the same person. So after sending the coins from the A address to the mixer and he would also send the B address to receive the coins back within 48 hours. This is the privacy of using mixerBut some people use mixer to avoid tracking, because in mixer there are different addresses received mixed coins at a time. So if you are tracing it.",

This is the privacy of using mixerIt can take less than 48 hours or more than 48 hours. It also depends on how the mixer works. You may even be able to set the time yourself ranging from 0 hours to days or weeks. The longer the time set, the better it is. You can also be able to set more than one address to receive the mixed coin.",

No doubt mixers are good at mixing bitcoin and keeping them out of trace for personal safety and security. Most bitcoin holders do this so that people do not see the volume of their assets and funds as they  have it as their store of value. This invariably means that they would need to protect their assets from public view and letting no one know much about their transactions wallets holding such funds as the case may be.",
