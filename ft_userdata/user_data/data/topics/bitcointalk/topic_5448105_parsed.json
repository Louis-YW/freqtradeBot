      "body": "Changing the Twitter logo to the Dogecoin coin symbol was just Elon Musk's long-running April Fool's joke. Now Twitter has its former logo. Because of this joke, the price of Dogecoin rose decently in the first days of April, but in recent days it has been steadily declining. Now CoinMarketCap shows a drop in its price of 8.82 percent. Such a joke can turn into big price problems for this coin, since the relatively rapid fall in the price of Dogecoin at the present time, when the rest of the cryptocurrency is growing, can provoke a panic.",

Is there a change in the Twitter logo for a long time, or for the people who invested in that currency because of this thing?In general, it is a lesson for you, do not invest in a long-term psychological investment, and if your investment is due to Elon Musk's tweets, it is better to stop investing.It may be an investment opportunity for some, but you must be aware of what you are doing. Invest short-term and withdraw your profits as soon as they are realized and do not get greedy.Otherwise invest in bitcoin.",

I also thought so but the fact is that due to Elon changing the Twitter logo to Doge, the price of Doge has increased by 20% in a short time. For traders this is something big, it doesn't matter if it's just an April fool or a fad the important thing is that they can profit from this incident. but currently the price of doge is slowly decreasing and approaching the initial price because the price increase due to hype is temporary.",

Therefore, we cannot say that he took advantage of Twitter to make profits, and I do not think that if he wanted to, he would do it in this way.What I wonder about is why people continue to invest like this. You cannot blame Elon Musk if there is a real loss.In short, stop investing emotionally and rushing into this golden opportunity, which everyone knows about.",
