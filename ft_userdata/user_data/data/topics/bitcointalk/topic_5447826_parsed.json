      "body": "I'm quite confused, you already agreed that it was a scam transaction and many people already told you the reason on that thread. If that is really the transaction you're referring to, why are you asking it again? What changes your mind? Did the sender convince you with something? You can also bump that thread if you want to ask more about it, even though I don't think anything will change.",

      "body": "If you are using a lightning network when sending BTC the receiver must be also connected to the lightning network if not the receiver won't able to generate an invoice or address of his LN wallet.Unless the sender trying to send BTC via LN to Bitcoin address? It won't work, the LN address is a long text and the sender should request an invoice from the receiver before the sender can able to send BTC.You might not yet understand how the lightning network works. I suggest check this big list below about lightning networks.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5345664.",
