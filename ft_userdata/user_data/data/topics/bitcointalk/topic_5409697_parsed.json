  "content": "To improve DT2 selection, the topic from DireWolfM14 and his pool suggestion is so far the best discussion I consider. My personal suggestion is to make wider margin. Net inclusion 2 is better than 1, 3 is better than 2 and so on.  Quote from: theymos on January 09, 2019, 06:03:26 PM#3I will periodically (maybe every month) be reconstructing the default trust list to include everyone who matches these criteria: - If rank was determined solely using earned merit, then you must be of at least Member rank. - You must have been online sometime within the last 3 days. - Your trust list must include at least 10 users, not including ~distrust entries. - You must not be banned or manually blacklisted from selection. - You must have posted sometime within the last 30 days. - You must have at least 10 people directly trusting you each with an earned merit of at least 10, not including merit you yourself sent. These \"votes\" are limited. - You must have at least 2 people directly trusting you with an earned merit of at least 250, not including merit you yourself sent. These \"votes\" are limited.QuoteI plan to instead choose a random subset of about 100 eligible users each time.In current DT system these random subset of 100 eligible users become the DT1.My proposal is to add another layer with the current DT system for DT1 Election which is to allow these 100 eligible users to update their trust setting every month.So the random selection makes the users eligible for DT1 but each of them are not DT1 until they do not update their own trust list with the selected remaining 99 users. One must add or tilde (~) others in their trust setting to become DT1 for the remaining days until the next random subset selection.The current DT1 system became a lazy achievement for some, some are easily manipulating it, some do not involve because they do not either add or tilde (~) a user to avoid DT drama. If someone wants to be in the DT1 network then let them fully involved.I do not know how hard it will be to reprogram but I wanted the work for Theymos as less as possible.Choosing random subset of 100 users are already done but instead of making them DT1 from the selection write a set of code that will check if the individual user added/tilded(~) remaining 99 users.Code:Current user cu = logged in user;Array cua = Current user's trust list;Save the random subset in an array rsa (random subset array);Have another array dta (defaultTrust array) to store DT1 users;Check cua have everyone from rsa excluding himself    YES, cu will be added to dta;return dta;A loop will be needed but depending on the programming skill the loop can be optimized (mainly in array processing) for the code to take less resources.Instead of running it on onLoad of the index page you can set a corn job which will execute after every x hours or x day.The benefits:Elect only users who have strong desire to be in the DT1 list.Since it requires a must vote for all selected users, no elected DT1 user can stay in the border line where they skip it by not adding or tildeding(~) others.Every month after the selection, users will need to add/tilde(~) new selected users to their trust list again, this eliminates lazy DT1.Since elected to be in DT1 become harder it should eliminate easy manipulation.The disadvantages:Selected users will need to update their trust setting every month to be elected for DT1It could create more drama since no one can stay in the border line. You tilded user A, be ready to be tilded by user A.May use additional resources from the hosting if it allows to run in onLoad of the index page.Update: Considering response from users so far, a proposal to reduce difficulty.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409697.msg60748710#msg60748710",

That doesn't mean I want to include them by myself, nor does it mean I think they deserve to be excluded. I don't want to dig deep into all feedback and Trust relations of 100 forum accounts each month, that would take me days to do a thorough job.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 13, 2022, 04:26:37 AMThe current DT1 system became a lazy achievement for someThat's okay: it's a forum, not a full time job",

There are already people who disagree with raising the net inclusions by one degree, I understand that making it much more restrictive is not going to be popular. Regarding the DT1 proposal I don't know what to say, I guess partly because I have never been to DT1 and have not been overly concerned with how it works, although I have an idea. So I leave it to those of you who are in DT1 and know the system better to discuss it.",

Often the people who have the most desire to become DT1 are the people least appropriate for the role, and their motivation to become DT1 is to allow them to game the system, retaliate, boost their friends, etc.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 13, 2022, 04:26:37 AMSince it requires a must vote for all selected users, no elected DT1 user can stay in the border line where they skip it by not adding or tildeding(~) others.If the only option is to include or exclude, then I would wager that most users would simply exclude everyone not already on their list by default, resulting in mass net exclusions for everyone. If I've not added someone to my trust list already in the last several years, then simply forcing me to pick include or exclude isn't going to change that fact and make me suddenly start including them.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 13, 2022, 04:26:37 AMIt could create more drama since no one can stay in the border line. You tilded user A, be ready to be tilded by user A.Exactly. You will end up with every DT1 user distrusting >50% of other DT1 users, which would (under the current exclusion rules) result in nobody being on DT1.I still strongly support raising the threshold for DT2 inclusion as you mention at the start of your post, though.",

The main reason why we want the new trust system to be revamped is mostly because of ongoing drama (accusations and counter-accusations between DT members about trust abuse cases and alleged manipulations)Maybe the period for mandatory inclusions or exclusions should be extended to at least 90 or 120 days so that someone is not pressured to unnecessarily include or exclude users. Personally, I take very long to include or exclude users, even scammers (I am mostly active tagging and flagging them). Does that make me a bad DT Member?",

I'm okay with not being on DT1 though.I have a different idea: Currently, anyone with enough earned Merit can vote for the DT1-election by inclusing users on their Trust list. But if they exclude them, that exclusion is ignored for DT1-election and only other DT1-users can take away that user's DT1-status (while the user can still vote in favour or against other DT1-members).Why not let all users vote against DT1-members instead?If exclusions would be counted for the DT1-election, users with many exclusions wouldn't reach DT1 in the first place.This would make political elections very interesting too. Especially on Hillary vs Trump, where many people voted one person because they didn't like the other, they could both have ended up with negative numbers of votes",

In addition, opinions will still differ, and writing reviews for everyone is very fussy.In addition, it’s not enough to modestly put yourself forward in the DT, because this is the opinion of those people who trust a particular person, and not their own desire, isn’t it?",
