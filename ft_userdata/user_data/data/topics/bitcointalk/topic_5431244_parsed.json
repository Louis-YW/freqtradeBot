The following are some of the Immune Boosters in the forum. Merit the day I got my one merit, I was excited to participate more and today I am active to some extent and likewise to some newbies who received their first merit in the forum and the excitement that follows. Investment I might make a mistake on it, I am thinking that it is the highest because most bitcoiners are here to discuss their investment on bitcoin both on the bear and the bull market in the forum. The forum gave them update on all movement from different boards. And this forum nwas created because of bitcoin so any other thing is added onto it.  Signature Campaign this is one of the immune booster where users participate to get extra bitcoin and add it to their investment.[/list] If not the above energy boosters in the forum, many users would have used their energy in another profitable platforms or using here as a chatroom.

Energy boosters (which was used) or incentives which keeps one attracted to the forum is more appropriate.The most potent reason why many members visit the forum daily, is the potential of earning from it. It is the reason users seek out merits to be able to rank up, and the reason members post to be able to build your activity or meet up with the requirements of a campaign they are on.I can predict that if all means of earning on the forum is shut down, the traffic here would drop by almost 90% within the first week.This is definitely more a beration of the members here, but how human nature is. We commit time to things we benefit from; knowledge is a great benefit, but an extra incentive is needed by most to push them to seek out knowledge.",

But hey, if adding a Merit system means we get even more witty banter and insightful discussions, then bring it on!  As for investing and campaigning, I don't think it's everyone's beeswax. After all, there are plenty of folks out there who are into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for entirely different reasons.",

      "body": "I think the only booster as you called it, is the knowledge we learn here.  Aside what you listed above, member's knowledge about bitcoin boosts on daily basis. When I'm in the midst of bitcoiners my responses standout and they tend to listen to me more than any other person in the room. Many people who are not members of this forum don't know the features of bitcoin and its usage. When you use terms like open source and closed source wallet in a conversation a lot of bitcoiners who are not members of this forum  may get confused. So it's not just a flex, but it effects uniqueness in us amongst others. If you read this forum to some extent you will be happier to learn new terms more than you were after getting your first merit. Those who don't learn in the forum may leave the forum even before earning their first merit.",

Quote from: Ayebabara on December 07, 2022, 10:31:58 AMThat means you here for money not any other thing. Time is coming that the forum will know you really belong if money is the problem to you. Though many users here are for that purpose but hey are hiding it but it is obvious that you expose yourself. If you want to advance in the forum you need to read as I have been doing since almost a week or more. Read more so that some of the questions that will be asked would be gotten through reading.I think the OP is contradicting himself. He gave himself away on this topic, and despite his fear of discussing it earlier, the truth came out.OP, there's nothing to be ashamed of if you need money. It's a shame that people will resort to unethical means in order to obtain money. Start doing everything gradually. You are sure to achieve your goals. I don't know if you need rank or experience, but by reading and studying, you gain both.But as a pill to further motivate you, I'll give you the merit. I hope you correctly heard the wishes of the forum members.",

I have no other thing in mind than to believe that this is an alternative account, many members tend to pretend as if merits doesn't matter, mean while merits brings you closer to your next ranks and higher rank means better payout joining signature campaign, this is just the fact.There is nothing wrong with learning and earning, I believe this is the definition of Bitcointalk forum, in fact there is more to learning on here than earning. If you want to stay motivated on the forum it's better to love what you do, even if you have all the merits on the forum you will get bored as time goes on, keep learning and work more on yourself, only do what makes you happy and you won't ever get bored. As for investment Bitcoin is the most certain, less risky and future reliable, there isn't much to talk about investing in Bitcoin but altcoins have a wider range of discussions since there are just too many altcoins out there and believe me, it's a wild west.",
