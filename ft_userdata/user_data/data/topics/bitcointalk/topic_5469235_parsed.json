  "content": "Hi Moderators, I would like to report a user who is spamming the bustabit – The original crash game thread. This user made 18 consecutive replies without any valid reason. I was considering using the 'Report to Moderator' feature, but reporting all 18 replies (and counting) individually would take too long, so I decided to post this instead.Quote from: TryNinja on October 04, 2023, 09:00:17 PMFYI, I believe you can report a single post and just add the context to the comment field \"user made 18 posts in a row and on this same topic, spammer\"I'll take your advice. Locking the thread now.",
