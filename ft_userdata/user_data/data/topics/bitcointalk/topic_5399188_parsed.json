But, in terms of affordability everyone can't depend or power their mining rigs using Tesla. Rather than serving as an influencer, Elon Musk could've thought in such a way as his customers.Two Tesla owners have been using their cars to mine cryptocurrency, where one used his car to mine $800 per month. This is quite a good sum of money out of mining. Right now two of them were identified, and following this we can expect more Tesla owners follow this method.Tesla used to power cryptocurrency mining.",

If he makes some awesome batteries in the future, and his initiative to offer free energy to his customers actually takes off, and becomes the way of doing things, I can see his technology actually benefiting Bitcoin, rather than hindering it. At least in the long term. Quote from: romero121 on May 18, 2022, 11:19:47 AMRather than serving as an influencer, Elon Musk could've thought in such a way as his customers.I think this is a bit unfair. I know the general consensus is that we should all hate Elon, for the effect he has had on Bitcoin, and its adoption. However, Tesla owners are doing this merely to profit for themselves, they don't have shareholders or anyone else to convince. Tesla on the other hand has to maintain its green energy reputation, since they're trying to convince people that their cars are clean, and the future. That's not easily done when they're publicly supporting Bitcoin, that has been dragged through the mud about its energy usage, even if it's not entirely accurate reports, its public perception that matters to him, not the truth. Plus, he's much more than an influencer.",

Today only I came across this and I find this a better way of green mining. How is this green mining?First, the source of energy comes from somewhere, if it's oil or gas it's definitely not green and if it somehow winds or hydro the station would get the same energy as your house 1 kilometer down the road, so you could simply mine at home.Second, the waste- you have to drive your car to the charging station, which means you're wasting electricity, not green- charging wastes electricity as you fill the batteries, there is no 100% transfer of energy, a round number would be 10%, again not greenSo no, there is nothing green about it and it's just one guy wasting tons of electricity because he affords to do so, as vapourminer said, a few of Tesla's clients got a free lifetime supercharger when they bought their car.",

If it was sourced from the GRID? is it from renewable energy sources or from the fossil fuels power generation facilities. it is not certain that's why it is not totally a green mining process.",

Mining uses electricity, and the same goes for Tesla cars, so it's not really an improvement. Only if somehow the car is charged with electricity that comes from eco-friendly sources, whereas the electricity as home or a building dedicated to mining comes from sources with higher carbon footprint. I think the cunning part is that Tesla comes with free charging, so basically the electricity for mining might be free for these people, while in any other way they'd have to pay for it.",

That's true at the moment, although that's why I said that in the future we might actually benefit from this sort of technology. Electricity can be generated via green energy, mining resources can't. Obviously, to be able to do it we'll need to use our existing resources. However, utilizing things like solar, and hydro plants could potentially increase the amount of green energy being used. The way the world is going, there's enough funding for this to become a reality. Again, we aren't any where near it, and I do think the closer we get to it, the quicker this green energy buzz word will sort of die down. However, I do expect massive amounts of progress in terms of converting a lot of places to green energy. Bitcoin, and other industries will benefit from that, and we shouldn't really be hostile to the idea. It's the best approach, it's just everything has been blown out of proportion, especially when it comes to the amount of energy Bitcoin uses in comparison to other industries.",

It is a weird use only if you ignore the free electricity.I don't think this free electricity for electric cars will last long. But until people have free electricity or some other of subsidies from government/companies to have a electric car, we will see people abusing the free electricity system.I am impressed by the processing power those Tesla vehicles have. It is possible that in the future Tesla or some other manufactures will add something like NVIDIA LHR (Lite Hash Rate), reducing the hash rate of the equipment.",

Not fake, it started as one guy doing something unheard of and then some taking advantage of cheap energy, although for an ASIC mining is really not such a breakthrough because of the overall huge consumption it would make you travel to the station every 4 hours.Anyhow, this was debated a few times, including in another topic, and the first event is from 2017https://electrek.co/2017/11/29/tesla-mining-bitcoin-model-s-supercharger-power/And for everyone thinking of doing so, let me quote myself again:Quote from: stompix on November 04, 2021, 07:14:46 AMBesides, imagine having 10 3090 in your trunk and an asshole crashing into you at a stop sign.",

But, since it is free electric they did remove one of the more expensive short term costs of mining.AND if they were really getting $800 a month on the high end and could keep it up for a couple if years even if BTC price dropped and difficulty went up and so on.

There could be a more efficient way, but there is currently no cleaner way of doing it. For example, if you do solar and wind, that could be causing a bit of a drop in efficiency, and it could cost more than oil or gas for example right now, but it is unlimited. Sun is not something we are going to run out of, and if we ever do then energy is the least of our worries.Instead, we still use oil because it's cheaper and more efficient, which we will run out of eventually anyway. Hence, even if it's inefficient, renewable energy is the way to go for every single thing.",
