Obviously they will connect wallet to check it ans once they do then thats it. Scammers will likely take advantage of this, as many rushes to get their Op tokens to sell.Some scammers will likely almost copied or identical dapp for this so make sure that you are visiting from their official site and not just a copy cat website.",

I don't like commercials on TV and radio and I immediately switch to another program when they appear, and I wish the thing was as simple as with ads that appear online in various forms. I’m not claiming that all ads are bad, but Google and its service have long been known as a phishing paradise, and it’s not something that’s just annoying, but also potentially dangerous.",

Any mistake made when hitting a phishing site will still lie with the owner of the computer.Yeah we can't totally blame Google for such phising attempts as we also need to take responsibility in these things before clicking on any link as our security lies in our hand and we need to be aware about it.Even if we talk about the forum also then there are many scammers trying to make people fool through many ways like selling their fake service but members give then negative tags and others can be aware about it to stay away from it but if you are ignorant about it and still fall for these scams it's your fault.So be wise enough not to fall for these kind of things easily.",

They will take an action if there are various reports on such scam ads link, and Google only cares about the money they will get from those fraud ads but they didn't care about their users.  So, in a case like this, we can help to shut down the site by reporting them, just Report Phishing Page.Airdrop phishing sites aren't new on Google, so we must be careful upon clicking suggesting ads there.  Ads blocking apps or stop using Google Chrome much better solution for this, it's shame that big company names can't even filter those scams ads.I used the LibreWolf desktop app, it has DuckDuckGo for the browser and is safe for browsing.",

Not only scams like this but also phishing sites and fake links from websites, download applications, and so on. And it's true, we should go directly to the official group and website.But unfortunately, not everyone understands this and many are still in the mindset that everything can be searched, obtained, and trusted from Google pages. We can't limit them and even Google doesn't care or doesn't know if the link is a scam or not. What we can do is notify like this and report the website to Google to be banned.",

Search engines like Duckduckgo is better, using Google or other common browsers can display you ads that belongs to scammers. Ad blockers can be helpful also against ads, ads generally should be avoided. This is not a new means to scam, but it is not a surprise if heard that another person is scam as he clicked on link ads, just because people are always people are they are full of ignorance.It is better to also be careful of Google products because the means of using their products to advertise creates ways for scammers to display scam people, example of such products is the Google play store which do list scam apps.",
