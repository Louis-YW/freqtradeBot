  "content": "For the first time in 20 years, the U.S. dollar has been surging so much that the Euro sinks towards parity with the Dollar, currently trading at €1/$1.01, being almost equal. This is a threat to both Europe and USA, since imports are now much more costly for Europe. The exchange rate is also driving oil prices up, since purchasing a barrel of oil valued at $100, now costs €98-99 for Europe, while a few months ago, the same barrel would cost €80-90 at most.Goldman Sachs warned that the Eurozone is on the edge of recession, especially with Russia's decision to cut CNG supplies to Europe, resulting in huge surges in prices.  While the war in Ukraine hasn't affected USA as much as it has Europe, it has magnified oil and gas prices, punishing European consumers with the surging living costs.What are your thoughts? Will Euro's value fall lower than the U.S. Dollar? One thing is certain though, we're going to go through a tough time in the very near future.Sources: https://fortune.com/2022/07/07/us-dollar-euro-nearly-equal-value-economy-inflation/https://www.ft.com/content/48c7041f-1fa4-42ee-99f6-4a5955668fb6Edit: Thanks LoyceMobile, I meant to say that U.S. exports are much more costly for Europe, bad phrasing.",

Today I read an article in a local newspaper that in Germany they have already started to implement energy-saving measures by turning off public lighting and traffic lights, reducing the heating of water in public swimming pools to the point that in some districts they have completely turned off the hot water in schools and gyms.For the EU (especially some countries), the euro is now proving to be a bad solution, and the ECB is under fire from all sides, even from the German central bank and their governor. Quote from: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-04/lagarde-s-task-toughens-as-nagel-fires-salvo-on-ecb-crisis-toolThe days of European Central Bank teamwork heralded by Christine Lagarde may be ending as a Bundesbank warning shot on her crisis policies evokes its prior role as a thorn in the presidency’s side.The public salvo on Monday by German official Joachim Nagel, cautioning on the dangers of an anti-turmoil tool, is raising the temperature just as discussions intensify on a key pillar of the ECB chief’s plans to raise interest rates. I look at the whole situation from another perspective, which is that exactly what is happening now is part of the war being waged in Ukraine - and that the EU will pay dearly for all the sanctions. I will not say that it should have been different, because one should always side with the one who is attacked and who is weaker, but such actions often have a high price, and it seems that everyone will have to pay it.",

It is coming, there is no doubt in that, I'd say it is here now but everyone is still drunk on spending and the hangover hasn't quite hit yet.Well, all of the inflation was somewhat to be expected because of quantitative easing that happened years ago but it's not easy to tell exactly how much inflation is due to QE in combination with the COVID social welfare state countries decided to set up in combination with the war.It's important to note that even in a bitcoin-only world that wars breaking out would cause you to lose purchasing power due to limited supply and either consistent or higher demand. But, price stabilization occurs once the war ends and production increases back up again, ie supply increases. When the war in Ukraine ends, it's not as if the purchasing power you have with EUR/USD or whatever currency will return back to pre-war days so your point is probably correct, but the real reason inflation is so absurdly high is because of the war so you can't minimize it's contribution.",

Which is not something we're likely to see anytime soon.A strong FOREX dollar reflects greater buying demand in contrast to other international currencies. There is also another aspect to a strong dollar which implies reduced printing of the asset. That's the type of strength we need in the current day economy.",
