Second is that I do not mind to gamble on KYC or non KYC casinos, what matters more to me is the services they are rendering. I do not know about that site, I noticed it has been registered for a long time since 2005, but still I have not heard about the site before and I have not used it before. I will prefer to use a known decentralized exchange like Bisq for it, but I mostly send the coins I already have on a wallet which is the usual way for me.",

But first, what is your position on this project why there's no official announcement here in Bitcointalk, and why did you not provide this information in the first place, I have to research the project so I can verify if the site is legit or not, checking the telegram channel they have a lot of members but the members of the group did not reflect the popularity of this project if you have contact with the admin you should recommend to start marketing this project, and you can start by creating official announcement here.",

Obviously no one will try use the service you are offering/casino. There are a high chance that you are somehow connected from oobit.com given that you are doing a campaign for it and promoting it in this thread. Doing a proper ANN thread would be more effective since you can post most of the information there about oobit.com and hopefully get a traffic like what you have here. I believe that no one here would use an unknown platform especially if it involves depositing or buying.",

A. I'm not the site owner B. you pay transaction fee everywhere C. I did used it to buy $100 and paid $5 fee is that too much? That is too much considering that you can buy the same amount of coins with only a little fee on some other exchanges. Other centralized services are already established, and won't need to do anything to prove their legitimacy. As some other people have already pointed out, perhaps the site isn't really doing too well to begin with hence why people aren't interested on it one bit. If Oobit offers something else that no other exchanges have done before then perhaps we can try it, but at this point, what separates it from the rest in the industry anyway to make us use it?",

In some gambling sites, there is moonpay service on them where you can buy a crypto if you don't have any but I am not sure if moonpay requires you to sign up and needs a KYC.If yes then this one here is better. It's less hassle and values the privacy of the users. We can use a normal exchange but that will be a hassle as well because you will need to use your crypto wallet for this. I mean it's not really a direct buy and you will also need to pay more for the fees. But indeed, gambling must be done in low amounts because it is risky.",

But for 1000 units it says I'd get 950 meaning 5% will be deducted.BTW, 16 units (local currency) is almost $5.So, my guess is that the fee is 5% and the minimum is $5.Also, I was expecting the email address will be only used to get payment notifications, but I've received multiple emails from the service that have nothing to do with the payment (price alerts)!
