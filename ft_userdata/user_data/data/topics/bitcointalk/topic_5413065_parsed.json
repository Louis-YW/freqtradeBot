Everything crypto related is expected to gain more attraction as the popularity of crypto itself increases, so it is highly expected. Already you can predict for yourself that cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular, the popularity will rub off on blockchain gaming.",

Gaming in the blockchain needs further development as so many gaming blockchains are still experiemental game for now. I would not be surprised to see that if blockchain gaming will be evolving into a better thing from day to the another day. In my opinion as long as the development are still active and blockchain gaming will always be evolved from time to the another time. It brings a new concept that doesn't owned by ordinary game but yet blockchain gaming is not perfect at this moment caused by there are so many flaws.",

      "body": "The crypto gaming industry has a great chance to grow a lot in the future. In 2021, the GameFi and Play-2-Earn projects showed impressive growth and gathered a large community. The main problem with these projects is that they sometimes have poor tokenomics and very little utility when the project interacts with some NFT tokens. The community doesn't see much utility in that, so projects have liquidity circulation problems. Players take more money out of the project than they contribute or at least reinvest. This causes the price of tokens to drop very quickly and interest among the core community to disappear. The industry is still at the very beginning of adopting.",

But in reality, these games are just like the same and the new trend might just be that it's changed because there's a sort of reward such as real money which we've seen in NFT games. Also, virtual reality or the Metaverse is likely what is this blockchain gaming all about. Certain changes could be there but in the next years, we might see another type of trend for these games again.",

There has to happen a lot in terms of intuitive graphic interfaces. Even people who know about cryptos have to study new technologies, but it needs to be way more intuitive system then we have now. Some how coded in so people don't need to care about learning and keep the focus on collecting of what ever it will be like then. Because surely collectables will be just a small part of the surface of what will happen.",

But blockchain gaming is still in its early days, but the future of this emerging field seems to be extremely promising. Many popular traditional games are being ported to the blockchain, with potentially more to come. And blockchain gaming doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. Now, imagine that we're in 5 years time. I have no idea how blockchain gaming will evolve today, but one thing is sure: there are many players in the game world and they will definitely grow in the near future.",

Thank you.I also have the same thought as you, many people play games for their hobby, but if there is a chance to play games and earn money, it will attract more millions of gamers. The blockchain gaming industry has so much potential to tap into, developers aren't going to give it up anytime soon. But in order to attract real players from traditional games, blockchain games must be really quality, not only aimed at making money but also creating a game with deep entertainment to be able to attract gamer.",

Devs spend millions and years creating gaming. Gamers spend weeks and months and switch for other project. Blockchain gaming is something long lasting imho. Gamers are like gamblers, they need everything now or yesterday. They want to play and have fun, but not struggle doing calculations of tokens, trades, value and etc, and learning what is blockchain and etc. Even now, metaverse - game involved innovation, is not very demanded. We see lots of projects, but I dont see any real and deep interest in them.",

Hopefully developers and players will not be discourage on what happens in games before that enter here in crypto and not succeeded or how Axie price turns out to be after it’s  huge pump. There is a need for continuous development and marketing to keep the game interesting and the players alive to play. Due to number of choices of where to play and some also have now play to earn concept that makes the gaming industry more challenging and competitive. But a good marketing strategy can be a great help to keep their players and make it popular.",

I believe that players from all over the world will have the ability to connect with each other, whether they are mobile gamers or computer gamers.

In this game, you can collect land by buying it from players. Over time, you will get multiple benefits because the $SAND crypto asset which is the token in this game continues to increase in value.so how not to be believed?",
