      "body": "Scamming through roulette is definitely possible. However, can I ask you to gamble a same size bet on all 36 numbers except 0 and see if the casino manages to bring up number 0 only in the very same game? If they do, can you please repeat it and see if they do it again in the next game too? I'm not favoring any casinos here and I know that such practices do take place in roulette, however not all of them would do it.  As well, it's not the casino specifically but the game provider that does this and if that's true, we should never play games from such game providers because they'll only try to loot your money by making you lose every single bet. Even in the game of cards (be it blackjack, poker, andar bahar, etc.) I have witnessed that most of the times, dealer wins. So it's possible that they have something behind the scenes that we don't know about.",

      "body": "Roulette has been my best casino game and it is very easy to play. What I do think about is that we are many that are selecting numbers to win or lose and we can not select the same number or pick the same number range, people will select different numbers and numbers in range. If I play like 3 times or more and I am losing, I may leave and not using the online casino roulette again and the casino itself. I have played roulettes on reputable casinos and I think the win and loss are not bad. But that YouTube video truly showed how Roulette can be manipulated if truly the roulette ball or pill can be controlled by a remote.",

Nowadays with the advance of electronics and science of materials, it has become easier for those tables to be manipulated without anyone ever noticing, not even the casino workers, since they could leak information to the public.That is why proper inspection and regulation is important, in the case of brick-and-mortar casinos. In the case of online casinos, people should go with those that support provably fair games and learn how to verify them.",

It's possible they can manipulated the outcome? yes based on how this game can be running live without dealer.They don't have to touch the ball at all. The ball is magnetized and the electro magnets in the wheel get turned on and off, making it avoid certain spots. For instance, if someone places a very large bet on a certain number, only that number will get magnetized in the opposite way to the ball, so it will go into any other slot, just not the one with the bet. They've been doing it for at least a 100 years. In very old casinos the tables had a button that turned a big magnet on to make the ball jump up. The dealer controlled the button and it allowed him to make the ball spin a bit more if it was already falling into a slot where the bet was. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TavAtAr9gIUHere's a rigged table from 1920 where they use coils to operate a pin that pushed a ball into a given side of the wheel. It wouldn't allow you to control the colors but was used to make the ball avoid the numbers where the biggest bets were.",

This makes sense because the casinos don't want to see many people who manage to win the game and earn a lot of money. Casinos will do things we may never know and can only guess.So in the roulette round game, perhaps it has been programmed so that not many people win. But I don't know if it's in a trusted casino, will they do it or won't they do something? But I don't think they would do anything to prevent people from winning at roulette.",
