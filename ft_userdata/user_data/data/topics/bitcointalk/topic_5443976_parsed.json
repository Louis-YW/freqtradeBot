I believe the lack of knowing yourself is one of the major problems ⚠️ You can understand the needs that prompt a person to ask such existential questions, but how do you expect him to identify himself, according to you. To know who you are means to study who you are, and this, in my opinion, is not easy for ordinary people and small-minded people.This question is existential and has been asked by mankind since the beginnings of history, and philosophy has tried to provide approaches to thinking about the subject, but it has never succeeded in providing complete answers about who we really are and what is the purpose of our existence.",

Without knowing the true identity will lead man astray heading toward Poverty and the most important in the life of man.What do you think?If some one walks up to me and asked who are you: I won't just tell the person my details. The world is full of evil and secondly if you walk to a person you have to introduce yourself. \"Who are you\" can also be a philosophical question that can come with different answers. Religiously, I don't know who I am because it's God that determines everybody's life. But if your knowing who you is associated to acquiring wealth because you know your worth, I am not part of it. I hear some religious preachers preach that everyone is created to be rich, and no one is destined to be poor. I believe not everybody is destined to be rich but everyone should live a comfortable life. Let everyone have their basic needs at least.",

Look at the movies that talk about giving people robot-like bodies, yet keeping their brains so that they are not complete robots. Even though our life penetrates out bodies way more than can be built into robots, still we can be changed.And change is what our Father in Heaven is doing for us when we die. Through the salvation wrought by God's Son Jesus, we will be saved for a new life in Heaven. The only requirement is that we believe this... and express our faith by how we live.That's the point when we really start to know who we are.",

Without knowing the true identity will lead man astray heading toward Poverty and the most important in the life of man.What do you think?Understanding oneself is a powerful tool for personal freedom. A vast majority of individuals, estimated at 99%, lack self-awareness, which leaves them vulnerable to exploitation by the 1% who possess this skill. Each person is created as a unique being with a particular purpose to fulfill, but many get caught up in serving those who have already discovered their life's calling To achieve a life of purpose and make a significant impact on the world, individuals must be willing to abandon all distractions and make necessary sacrifices to uncover their true calling",

The phrase \"Man know thyself \" has thrown people into confusion. I don't think I am anything except if I define some principles into myself. That is my perception of knowing myself. For instance. Assuming if I drink bear, I'll have health issues and go to hospital and spend huge amount of money and then all my friends love partying and drinking. Knowing myself is to subtract myself from such friends in order to save myself. There's no mystery about knowing oneself.",

Knowing oneself is critical because it provides proper direction and focus in life as one travels through the life journey. Many people have failed to understand their life's purpose, leading a haphazard existence without direction because they do not understand what they want, what they need to know, or the best path to take in life.Throwing this question back to myself as the OP in the title, my response will be; I've known myself to some extent, and I can be proud that I know where I'm leading my life. I've faced many challenges, but they haven't stopped me from moving forward and focusing on what I want. I simply believe that if there is still life in me, I will definitely obtain and achieve my life's goal. I would say that I know who I am and what I want in order to live a prosperous life.",
