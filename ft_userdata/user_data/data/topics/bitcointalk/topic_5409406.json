State governments is not a Global entity, and buying out all bitcoins for the name of bitcoin to die off seems pointless. They would also need majority to be willing to sell, including Satoshi.- Jay -",

Of course, this is excluding the increased value as those coins get bought up but a government could easily get slow this down of this by claiming to ban bitcoin completely or starting seizing some large exchanges and their wallets at the same time but still.But, coming back to OP's main question, why would a government do this? What is the economic reason to grab all the coins?Grab them and burn them, they will act just like Satoshi coins, and even if 100 coins will not be owned by the government their value will be sky high and we will be dealing with microsatoshi if not nanosatoshi.Quote so that the name of bitcoin will die off since no ordinary man has enough to disturb the marketI fail to understand how this is a bad thing.",

      "body": "A couple questions to your theory OP. I hold a part of that 21 million. How would the goverment buy my coins? There's many bitcoiners around the world who wouldn't sell if they saw aggressive buying from a party, in this case a government. It's the same kind of situation as if you owned a piece of land worth $100k and all of a sudden somebody came and offered $300k to buy it. You'd think they know something. Maybe there's oil or some other natural resource? Maybe there's a plan for a shopping center to be built and they want to flip the land for even more than they're offering you? Â What about people who have millions and don't need fiat now? If someone came and gave them 50k USD for a bitcoin they wouldn't sell and if the same party came a month later offering 100k they also wouldn't sell. Holding money that's safe from inflation and surveillance maybe more important to them, since they already have 10 million in real estate and another 10 in stocks. There's no single entity like a government or a company that would be able to buy bitcoin at this point. All they'd do is buy what's available on exchanges and drive up price to insane levels like a million USD because if you'd reduce coins on exchanges by 80 or 90% you'd introduce insane volatility. You'd have bitcoin swing to 100k and back to 50k daily.",

Even if we imagine that someone managed to buy all coins, Bitcoiners could just agree to print more BTC or start a new blockchain with the same code. This is one of the most expensive and unrealistic attacks on Bitcoin that can be imagined. It's better to just spin millions of fake nodes and disrupt the communication between nodes, launch an information campaign against Bitcoin, cut it off from traditional finance and so on. But why would a government do it? Bitcoin is not a threat to fiat.",

If the government(s) were not telling people they were doing it, just buying and holding it then as the price REALLY started to go up due to the lower amount of coins being circulated people would REALLY have FOMO and the price would just keep going up.Right till the very hard crash at the end.But I can't see any government bothering to do it, or being able to keep it a secret as they spent that much money doing it.-Dave",

Not all of them will be used by people on Earth. Many of them received from mining from block rewards and lost forever (by losing private keys in early years of Bitcoin network).QuoteAnd I dont know if another ones can be produced to add to the already existing ones. But as for the moment there 21m.It can be done by a consensus in protocol but it won't happen. I strongly believe that it won't happen because the current total supply creates value for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community don't have reasons to vote and increase total supply of Bitcoin.How is the 21 Million Bitcoin Cap Defined and Enforced?There are many Bitcoin forks but they are not real Bitcoin. There is a unique Bitcoin, the original one with ~ 21 millions in total.How Many Bitcoin Forks Are There? You will be surprised!!!QuoteSo if the state governments planned against bitcoin and buy all the 21 millions to among themselvesTo buy, they must buy it from sellers.

That will lead to increased price. In simple terms if a government started buying up bitcoins they would run out of fiat and paper to print more fiat way before they reach 21 million coins. 1 satoshi could be worth $1 million!Quotewhat do you think will happened to the poor bitcoiners?You should ask who would even sell their bitcoins to the government in first place.

Also if a particular government buys all 21 million supply from the market, then the price of the bitcoin will turn back to zero because there will be no seller in the market. So the market will be straight away crashed to zero. One basic parameter of bitcoin is its decentralization, once it's gone, the foundation of bitcoin will be destroyed. So no government would try to do such a highly costly adventure which will eventually turn back to zero. Bitcoin's price is based on demand. So if there's no seller in the market, buyers will eventually move out of the market and will look for an alternative. So probably a new coin will rise to fame if bitcoin is purchased by government and kept under safe custody. Overall, it is an imaginary situation which will never ever happen.
