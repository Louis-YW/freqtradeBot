  "content": "Hello All How Are you? Let us all know about Bitcointalk Bounty Campaign Manager today. Today I will only talk about those who have been working with honesty and dedication till now. Each of them has a lot of work experience and a High-Rank account.They are all the best which is why I am not doing anything in the form of rank so as not to insult each other. I just shared one profile and work experience after another. Please forgive me for any mistakes.I hope these managers play a very important role for those who own new projects and want to advertise their projects. Below is a brief description of them.ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡Manager name: CryptopreneurBrainbossYou can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!You Can Send DM Him On Telegram: @PedroBrainbossBMDescription: He is a highly accomplished person. So far he has worked on many projects and the projects are very popular with Bounty Hunters. He is a citizen of Nigeria and is extremely hardworking and skilled. He has changed his style of work a lot compared to the past which has resulted in much better results. He manages both social media and signature camping. And his work style is different from other managers.Manager name: HhampuzYou can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!You Can Send DM Him On Telegram: @HhampuzDescription: He has conducted many project camping so far and the type of work is very nice. He basically does all kinds of work alone and has a lot of reputation in signature camping. You can take something good from him if you want.Manager name: yahoo62278You can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!You Can Send DM Him On Telegram: @yahoo62278Description: He has worked on many projects in the past and for camping in his signature. He is not currently conducting bounty camping but he can give you good output if you want. He has a lot of experience and work ethic in managing bounty camping. He is a very old and skilled bounty and signature camping manager.Manager name: Royse777You can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!You Can Send DM Him On Telegram: @Royse777Description: If you look at the profile you will understand that it has played a very important role for bounty and signature camping. He has always kept the total budget of the camping in his hands while conducting the camping. The main reason for this is that most campaigns do not pay after the end. So its importance and contribution is enough.Manager name: julerz12You can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!You Can Send DM Him On Telegram: @julerz12Description: He is now working on many more projects than he used to do. Now he is working on one project after another. The best part about him is that he manages the camping with a total budget in hand. In the last few months he has done a lot of such camping work and distributed all the camping. He is very hardworking and works well.Manager name: MuratYou can Check Her Previews Work Proof Here!You Can Send DM Him On Telegram: @TokensfundDescription: He hasn't done much of a camping job so far, but he has a good member and a good job. He works most of the time without keeping the total camping budget in hand. Even after that he has a lot of reputation and fame. Of course he can be a good manager for your project.Please Noted: There are many more bounty managers I did not mention here because they have Red Trust and Low Rank account. I only mention those who have High Rank profiles and a lot of work experience. And I have not said anything in a small way to anyone. And I did not mention who is the best, they are all the best.Image Source: Copied from everyone's announcement Thread.",

Since there used to be a large number of High Rank members conducting bounty camping, at present there are very few High Rank members conducting bounty camping so I have only talked about them. And thank you I'm bringing some more corrections.",
