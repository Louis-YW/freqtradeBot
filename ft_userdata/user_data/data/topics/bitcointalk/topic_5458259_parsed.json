  "content": "Hulda Clark showed us years and years ago that cancer is caused by tiny bugs. Bugs, not viruses. And that the bugs are much smaller than the standard microscopes can see. These bugs are essentially parasites. So, it's not surprising that ivermectin and fenbendazole (anti-parasitic drugs) can cure cancer.Back in early 2011, a microscope was invented that can view living things in living color that could only be seen dead, with an electron microscope, previously. It's call the Microsphere Nanoscope, and it can see things much smaller than Hulda Clark's microscope. Where is this microscope today? Why haven't we heard anything about it? Could it be that the leaders in the medical are trying to hide the truth about cancer from us... for money making purposes?Synergistic pairing of ivermectin and fenbendazole found HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at preventing and treating cancerhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-06-30-synergistic-pairing-ivermectin-fenbendazole-prevent-treat-cancer.htmlDuring the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) \"pandemic,\" the powers that be made it a top priority to discourage and even prevent the general public from using ivermectin as a prophylactic, instead pushing masks and \"vaccines.\" Well now there is another use for ivermectin that is sure to put it right back in Big Pharma's crosshairs, and it involves the treatment of cancer.One of the \"side effects\" of taking ivermectin for COVID, it turns out, is that it also helps prevent cancer cells and tumors from forming. This could be very helpful for those dealing with the sudden onset of \"turbo cancer,\" a phenomenon that appeared not long after the launch of Operation Warp Speed.If \"fully vaccinated\" people who got jabbed for COVID had easy access to ivermectin, many of them could potentially find relief and healing from it.

      "body": "There are a couple of interesting things about this. One is that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was a favorite medicine for curing/controlling malaria, until it was found that cures/controls Covid. Before Covid, HCQ was declared one of the safest medications around by the WHO... safe even for children, and in high doses. Now, all of a sudden, HCQ is somewhat dangerous if not carefully taken under medically controlled conditions.Then, as we see in the OP post, animal parasite controller medicines cure/control cancer in people. But the WHO doesn't say anything about it.The point is, why should we believe the WHO when they say that artemisinin controls/cures malaria? Who is putting pressure on the WHO so that they keep on saying that HCQ is 'bad' so that they need to find a new malaria treatment for people? And why would you even believe them when they did such a deceptive about face with HCQ?Since many drugs are developed from plants (as you will see in the below article for artemisinin), drugs can be sort of safe when used as directed, and only for a short while. All the double-talk and incomplete info put out by the medical and the WHO is only designed so that the medical companies can make more money, without becoming liable enough to destroy them or wreck their \"good\" name.WHO: Artemisinin is a powerful remedy against malariahttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-06-30-who-artemisinin-powerful-remedy-against-malaria.htmlLast November, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a Question & Answer page about artemisinin providing partial protection against malaria infections.Artemisinin, a natural constituent derived from the Artemisia annua plant, also known as sweet wormwood, as well as its derivatives, are described by the WHO as \"powerful medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of Plasmodium parasites in the blood of patients with malaria.\"In order to effectively control malaria once it starts spreading, powerful anti-malarial medicines are necessary, of which artemisinin and its various derivatives are included. Known as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the WHO recommends these as first- and second-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and chloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria.Right now, the latter version is said to have infected four people in Sarasota, Fla. Transmission there was local, meaning the infected caught it locally rather than overseas – which has not happened there since the 1950s, according to health officials.While there is not yet a conceivable \"outbreak,\" so to speak, since transmission is low, it is still a good idea to keep in mind which remedies work best for treating malaria. And one of the most powerful is artemisinin and its derivatives, which include artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin.The WHO recommends pairing these derivatives with a partner drug to help reduce the number of malaria parasites, known as parasite biomass, during the first three days of treatment. The partner drug, meanwhile, eliminates the rest of the remaining parasites, rendering it the \"cure.\"Currently, the WHO recommends six different ACTs. Two of them are injectable – one with artesunate and the other with artemether – and these are recommended for cases of severe malaria. After getting these injections, patients are advised to follow up with an oral ACT regimen, just so long as they are able to tolerate it....",

Maybe the US and third world countries are starting to change places.Most Intensive Ivermectin Use Had 74% Reduction In Excess Deaths In Peru: New Studyhttps://www.zerohedge.com/medical/most-intensive-ivermectin-use-had-74-percent-reduction-excess-deaths-peru-new-studyThe paper's results, published August 8 in Cureus, found a 74 percent reduction in excess deaths in 10 states with the most intensive ivermectin use over a 30-day period following peak deaths during the pandemic. When analyzing data across 25 states in Peru, researchers found these reductions in excess deaths correlated closely to ivermectin use during four months in 2020.When ivermectin was available without restriction, there was a fourteenfold reduction in nationwide excess deaths. Once access to ivermectin was restricted by the government, a thirteenfold increase in excess deaths was observed in the two months following the limitation of its use. The findings align with summary data from the World Health Organization for the same time period in Peru.Ivermectin is a widely-known and inexpensive treatment against parasitic diseases. Scientists believe the drug can also bind to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limiting its morbidity and infectivity....",

I bet you could even rent one of those microscopes if you had the money. Such affirmation about the bugs would be easily proven if it was true. An electron microscope only views things that are dead, and it only views them in grayscale. This means that there isn't much of a way to properly interpret what is being seen.The Microsphere Nanoscope view things that are alive, and in color - https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Microsphere+Nanoscope&t=ffab&ia=web. You can even find pictures of what it views on Youtube. Search it. The principle was used as early as 2011, and the first actual Microsphere Nanoscope was put together as early as 2017. But even if it isn't quite as powerful as an electron microscope, looking at 'life' in color has benefits way beyond what the electron microscope can give us. So, why isn't it the rage? What is being hidden from us? If the bugs were true, no medical, AMA, CDC, Big Pharma would want to admit it. Why? It might prove that there aren't any viruses at all.Again, peruse https://openvaers.com/. If you peruse the whole site, and put all their info together, it will show you that there are a minimum of 3,600,000 covid vaccine deaths, and many millions of covid vaccine adverse reactions in non-death areas. This is info that the CDC tricked itself into having to give us. They started withholding some of the data in 2022, because it was too damning.Yet, the medical, the CDC, and governments are still advertising to get your Covid shot, that it is safe and healthy and beneficial and effective.You still believe the medical? Where's your logic? When are you going to wake up and see that things in this world are far from the way you envision them? You're only looking at the tip of the iceberg.",
