  "content": "So, I stumbled upon this CoinGecko article titled \"Household Electricity Costs to Mine 1 Bitcoin at Home, Around the World\" (https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/bitcoin-mining-cost), and honestly, I was pretty intrigued by it. They've got this report that lists which countries make mining 1 Bitcoin super profitable and which ones, well, not so much.Without further ado, the top 10 countries for profitable Bitcoin mining are:1. Lebanon - $266.02 (electricity cost to mine 1 BTC in USD)2. Iran - $532.043. Syria - $1,330.14. Ethiopia - $1,596.125. Sudan - $2,128.176. Libya - $2,660.217. Kyrgyzstan - $2,660.218. Angola - $3,724.299. Zimbabwe - $3,990.3110. Bhutan - $4,256.33And the most unprofitable countries to mine 1 BTC are:1. Italy - $208,560.332. Austria - $184,352.443. Belgium - $172,381.504. Denmark - $166,795.065. Germany - $163,336.796. Ireland - $159,612.507. Lithuania - $152,163.928. Netherlands - $137,798.799. United Kingdom - $130,616.2310. Cayman Islands - $128,222.04Here's a nice graphic.They did some pretty serious calculations to figure out how much electricity it takes to mine a single Bitcoin. They considered eight different ways people mine, each with its own hash rate, and then they looked at how long it usually takes to mine one Bitcoin using each method. They used a mining difficulty of 53,911,173,001,055.00 as a benchmark. By the way, this mining difficulty thing gets adjusted precisely every 2,016 blocks, and how often it changes depends on how many people are mining and how powerful their computers are. They used CoinWarz Bitcoin calculator to keep tabs on all that. Check out the article for more info.",

      "body": "Quote from: sesterceshop on August 24, 2023, 06:45:31 AMHousehold Electricity Costs to Mine 1 Bitcoin at Home~2. Iran - $532.04This is inaccurate. The price of electricity for homes in Iran is about $0.001 per kilowatt hour but that's for the home users and the KWH they'll use. A miner uses more electricity which means the rate will enter an automatic step-by-step price scheme where each time the usage surpasses the next step's threshold the price increases. I believe the ceiling is $0.03 per KWH though.Additionally big miners have to follow the regulations which have changed a couple of times over the past couple of years. Basically in these contracts they receive special rates for their farms which depends on a bunch of factors. For example it depends on the month, during the peak usages in summer their rate is equal to the export rate which I think is less than 5 cents; and in the rest of the year the rate is half that.Another factor is their source of electricity. If it is the national grid the rates are as I said before, otherwise they could use renewable energies, start their own power plant in which case they'd receive super cheap gas which can be as low as $0.0008, or participate in the building of new power plants using the gas flares to produce electricity and get it practically for free. Although this last one was just a news I once read, I don't know if the project was started or not.",

You can't just start a mining farm in these places and connect it to the grid, you have to explain why you are using so much electricity.",

Although this last one was just a news I once read, I don't know if the project was started or not.starting own power plant.. yes the fuel is cheap but the conversion to electric is notsame as gas flaring. it seems like free energy but then you have to include the equipment to turn burned gas into electric. also flared gas pipes only release a certain amount of dirty gas which is not enough to power a whale asic farm per flare pipethe trials of 'flare-mining' is small scale mining per site (less than a shipping container per pipe)much like this topics failure.. it fails to include the device/equipment and maintenance cost.. which is why it does not actually cost $266 to mine bitcoin in lebanon",

I hardly think any miner will stumble upon a Bitcoin on solo mining trip. I don't really believe that. Moreover there is less chance due to another fact and that's ever increasing cost of everything from the mining equipment, the maintainance, electricity is but obvious and moreover high price volatility. You never know how Bitcoin price might surprise you if it falls.  For example, the electricity cost in US. If you check the actual price then it is always higher in terms of inflation and needs to be adjusted. For every 4-5 years there is a cent raise in actual while more than 4-5 cent raise in the inflation value. This means in the years to come this is gonna be problem. Since electricity cost is rising but block reward is decreasing.",

And in other countries, too, there are restrictions on consumption. Consumption in Russia at the end of the year by industrial miners alone could rise to 2.5 GW. Further, it will take 1-2 years to develop the infrastructure.",

But I don’t know how this system takes into account the future increase in complexity and the emergence of new ASICs every year. Asik will die earlier, so it is difficult to verify these calculations.",

      "body": "Lulz - it's all complete crap.N00b thread wanting people to post - thus why he hasn't replied.So, here's a simple way to work it out (hopefully I've made no mistakes)The 'expected' hashes to mine a block, at the moment right now, before the next diff change,is of course called the network difficulty.So what is it?, simple, currently 55.6TWhich is ... 55.6x10^12 Diff1 diff = 2^32 Hashes1 Block = 6.25 BTCSo the hashes you 'expect' to do per BTC is 55.6x10^12 x 2^32 / 6.25Now to pull a 'reasonable' number out of the air, 25J/T - most home miners will be worse than this, few will be better than it.So the 'expected' W/hr to mine 1 BTC, this week, at 25J/T is 2^32 * 55.6 * 25J / 3600s / 6.25 = 265.33MWHrIf electricity is (high) 10c, that'll cost $26533 at 25J/TIf electricity is (fucking low) 1c, that'll cost $2653 at 25J/TNow, since I've done all this tapping away on my laptop, not at home, and not able to easily get at info, anyone feel free to point out any mistakes I've made Edit: and in case it wasn't clear at the start, this depends directly on the network difficulty, which changes about every 2 weeks,so any long term attempt at estimating it will be very wrong, even a short estimate of a few months will be noticeably wrong, after the fact, also.",

      "body": "Just for fun and for the sake of proving that this study is complete b.s, I will take the fist country on the list \"Lebanon\" which according to the study it costs only 266$ to mine a whole bitcoin.It costs 10c USD per kWh for the first 100kWh and then 27c / kWh so it costs $71,639 (using the most efficient gear out there as Kano pointed out above) to mine a single bitcoin and not 266$ , obviously I used 27c and not 10c because regardless of which miner you use, you will go past the first tier of 100kWh in no time every month, so you might save a few hundred dollars during the first tier, so that 71k might be 70k or slightly below, but ya, still way too far from being just 266$.It's also worth meeting that Lebanon generates around 500MW ONLY, while the minimum demand there is 3500MW, so the average city gets electricity only for 4 hours ( could be more or less depending on the demand which is mainly determined by the season), so basically, you can't even mine BTC in Lebanon using the grid, let alone do that with 266$, I think they got that number by visiting some \"English speaking\" website that has little to no info of what has been going on in Lebanon for the past a few decades, and they use the electricity price that was valid 30-40 years ago and then they reflect it on today's data, the end result obviously is complete rubbish.I know for sure the numbers are 100% wrong for Syria, Sudan, and Libya as well, I am also willing to bet it's wrong for the rest of the countries they labeled as (cheapest to mine BTC), so I won't even bother to research those, I 'l just stick to the claim that \"they are all wrong\" and wait for someone else to prove otherwise.",
