If theymos would be kind enough to assign a moderator, I can say that I volunteer for the role. I have been a member of this forum since 2013 and I am a native Greek speaker with activity in the Greek community. Most threads that were removed for spam in the Greek community were reported by me, global moderators can attest for this perhaps. Anyway, hopefully theymos listens. No need to dedicate this entire thread to me. If theymos decided to add a mod it could be me or anyone else really. It's just that someone active needs to help on the Greek subforum. Other members of th Greek community have also been saying the same as it becomes evident by recent threads.",

Things move much slower in the local board section, maybe owing to the language barrier for the admin.I'll like to see each local board moderated just as we have with almost every regular board. If there's enough activity to warrant grantingÂ  the users their own community, there should be some sort of moderation in place to regulate that community.",

And of course your community needs a mod, but for now you can still report those you founds not worthy in the community to the mod and when theymos see to it then he will decide. There are many english mods that are not active I don't know why theymos has leave them to remain there instead of changing and putting more active and vibrant user to act on that role. I believe your community also has more reputable people so I believe you should all put heads together to know what to do, just as we are seeking to have our subforum at a time will required mods to act on those board to be able to put post where they belongs.",

You just woke up recent weeks and you don't know that earlier this year, there is a Request for the moderator position in Greek board.Theymos must see it is needed and there is a procedure to get that position. Do you think you meet any criteria mentioned there?New moderator needed (Korean)Who is able and willing to moderate the Politics & Society section?Quote from: hilariousandco on November 23, 2014, 07:01:54 AMReport a lot of posts and be a very active member of the community and theymos may ask you eventually.Quote from: theymos on December 19, 2019, 08:22:30 PMThere will only be one moderator.Report history is the most important consideration for a moderator candidate. Over the forum's many years, relatively \"newbie\" members with good report histories have consistently done much better as mods than veteran, well-respected members with poor report histories. That said, not all reports are equal, so a simple report count doesn't tell the whole story. Also, in addition to report histories, it's necessary to consider factors such as the ability of the candidate to be neutral, their trustworthiness, etc. It's also nice to choose a moderator who people generally already trust/respect, but sometimes this is outweighed by other factors.If a poll is created, I will not completely ignore the results, but I will also not use it as a primary influence. I'm more interested in arguments people have for or against certain candidates.Here are the top non-bad report counts for the German sections over the last 6 months, along with the German boards which those reports covered (broader coverage being better).",

      "body": "One thing about moderation you should know, forum would Â logically hire a new mod if the work load of global mods is too much to handle the local boards, and said local boards having a lot of unhandled reports.Otherwise the best you can do is to keep reporting accurately and let global mods handle the reports, you could also explain in 1-2 lines as to why you are reporting such posts, that way mods would have something useful since they can't understand your native language to judge the accuracy of the reports.If you all do this constantly and if global mods feel they can't handle all these reports, they would tell admin that there is a need for a new mod. Until then I doubt anything happens.So if you are somewhat a trustworthy member, you'd need to spend hours in your local board to do that to prove you are up to it.ðŸ˜‰",

Someone speaking the language is needed to pin these posts and curate them. I see. As a workaround solution, you can always make the changes you think should be made, with input from the other members from the Greek community, and then PM the global moderators and ask them if they can edit and update the content in the sticky threads accordingly. I think they would do that. For everything else, just keep reporting what you believe isn't in accordance with the rules and hope that one day the admins will deem it necessary to find a new local mod.",

If one of the topics I mentioned was deleted after mentioning it here, the other stays because it's about cleanliness. If we look at the topic written in English about translations into Russian and Ukrainian, Hebrew board is definitely not a right place for it: if it was for Hebrew translations it'd been written in Hebrew or Hebrew'd been mentioned, but it is about English (written in it), Russian and Ukrainian. And there is no active members who would report it. So it is better that someone to follow that board on a regular base to delete what is obviously not corresponding (even if we talk about just cleanliness) to the board before it starts to be too old case.",
