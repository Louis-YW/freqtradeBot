You just woke up a long dumped thread with your lies. With these trading signals and their mysterious ways of trying to attract members to their channels, if they are too sure about their trade winnings, why not use their own money and do their trade, make the profit, and enjoy a luxury life instead of always looking for someone they want to teach and help make some profit in exchange for their service?",

Quote from: Nwada001 on July 26, 2023, 11:09:44 PMYou just woke up a long dumped thread with your lies. This thread is a simple scam that anyone who knows anything about numbers or investing can see. Going from $1K to $100K in a short amount of time, which you don't specify but I understand will be a month or two at most, is not impossible to do, just like it is not impossible to hit the lottery. Now if you try to sell that you have a system to get that 10,000% return you are a fucking scammer. This coupled with the buddy or alt from the same OP saying he has managed to go from $2K to $20K, which is a classic hook to lure the gullible.",

He will definitely invite close friends and relatives if it is profitable, but it will not always be profitable during trading, it is quite clear that spot / futures trading has its risks, it cannot change from $2K to 20K in a short time let alone $100K OP target.",

Those traders that don't want to learn the technical and fundamental analysis of trading that are looking for signals,you will end up in a big disappointment.OP is advertising or introducing forum members into a scam service which is very bad. Such people are out there decieving those newbies that are eager to trade without any knowledge. It is better that you don't trade and hodli your bitcoin because trading is not a compulsory thing for Bitcoin investors. Why are you after people's peanuts when you can become rich by yourself.",
