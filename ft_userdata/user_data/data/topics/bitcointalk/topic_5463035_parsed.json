  "content": "So, a senior citizen in one of the western countries makes a complaint that he preferred the 1950s when everything made sense and life was simple. He loves the analog times more than the digital. Despite this, he trusts Bitcoin self-custody, and that is the reason why he holds bitcoin. He complains that his bitcoin just sits in his hard wallet, and he doesn't even know what to do with it. According to him, his fear is that if he sells it during the next bull run, he will be taxed, and he doesn't want that. A question arises: Would taxes still be applicable if a time comes when exchanging bitcoin for fiat is no longer necessary?",

You're going to have to consult a local tax advisor for a definitive answer. Part of the question would also be is it worth worrying about? Without knowing what they got into Bitcoin at does it really matter. If you're sitting on a few hundred coins that you paid a dollar a piece for them back in 2010 does it really matter what you sell it for at the next ATH? It's going to be such a ridiculous amount of profit it doesn't matter. The other things to keep in mind is even perfectly valid 100% correct tax advice today may or may not be correct a year from now as rules regulations and laws change.-Dave",

There are thousands of online stores that accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, and there are also cities/countries where you can pay with Bitcoin. Quote from: Davidvictorson on August 12, 2023, 12:23:05 PMAccording to him, his fear is that if he sells it during the next bull run, he will be taxed, and he doesn't want that. A question arises: Unless the tax is insanely high, I don't see what the problem is that he pays income tax in any amount from 10% to 20% and then carelessly enjoys the profit he made. It seems to me that his fear stems from the fact that there is no evidence of how he came into possession of those Bitcoins, and in that case the fear of taxes is fully justified because it is no longer just taxes, but also some other things.Quote from: Davidvictorson on August 12, 2023, 12:23:05 PMWould taxes still be applicable if a time comes when exchanging bitcoin for fiat is no longer necessary?It depends on how his country treats payment with Bitcoin, and for example in the US every payment with Bitcoin was a tax event (if something has not changed in the meantime), while most EU countries have their own rules. In theory, every BTC -> Fiat conversion, whether it's about trading or paying for goods/services, would mean that there is a need to pay taxes - although on the other hand, I pay value add tax every time I pay something with BTC and it wouldn't be logically that I also have to pay some additional tax just because I paid with Bitcoin.",

A question arises: Would taxes still be applicable if a time comes when exchanging bitcoin for fiat is no longer necessary?If the time comes when exchanging BTC for fiat is no longer necessary, it would mean we are in the times where it has been adopted as a legal tender in that country or it is being regulated by the SEC regulators of that country.  That also means businesses and services can openly accept and use BTC as payment option for goods and services delivery. Well your friend is even lucky to have taken advantage of this digital age by HODLing BTC in a secure wallet, while many of us still dread to do so. He is also lucky that he is trendy, and am sure it wouldn't take him long to come up with a better way to reinvest the BTC, instead of letting his funds become taxed, just like that.",

That was imagined at some point years ago but I see it as a long shot. First, because bitcoin is valuable and will become more and more valuable and scarce, so people will tend to want to save it instead of spending it. And second because there are going to be a lot of alternatives to CBDCs and shitcoins and payment systems for day-to-day payments. Add to this that bitcoin as a hypothetical global payment system would have the problem of scalability, which is not clear that it can be solved.In short, the scenario you suggest is not going to happen, at least at the global level. If there are places such as El Salvador where it is declared legal to tender, then you will not have to pay taxes for it, but where it is not declared as such, you will have to pay taxes as it happens now and Lucius has explained well.",

If ever they couldn't find a way to put a taxes on Bitcoin, exchanging to fiat is a must. However, we always paying taxes everyday, we just didn't notice it. Just like when we are going for groceries, we pay taxes. So there's no one of us didn't pay a tax, some people who have authorities just wants to collect a big taxes.",

So, it depends on the country and how their tax is collected. but it sure will still be paid, just like you pay tax while spending fiat.",

If we move from Bitcoin to Bitcoin then also we will be restricted by the p2p platform limitations. Even local bitcoins were not spared when countries changed the rules and regulations. They also had to follow the KYC process. Thus if KYC is there then there comes the tracking of transactions. So even if there comes any other way to transact in p2p way then either it needs to be without escrow. That means you either transact with highly trusted person or have a decentralised platform. I highly doubt any of that is really possible in the current situation.",

My hypothesis is that as Bitcoin and crypto becomes more mainstream and drastic changes such as profit off of bitcoin sales not converted to fiat becomes a thing, most governments will find a way to counter this. Taxing crypto didn't seem. Possible but they found a way. I reckon they would find a way to counter it regardless especially since regulation is slowly becoming a thing.I think in a country where bitcoin is strongly regulated, government wouldn't want to mix out on those tax gains from bitcoin profit of users.",
