Far as member ranks go, the owner decided we are going to only offer this to Sr member and above for now. This may change at a later date.I guess that was the case as, its really been a long time and perhaps, you had to give yourself a break following health challenges at the time.Last I worked with you was when I was a member. You always happen to be the manager that give the low ranks (member) hope with a taste of the pile at signature. Still, it's only acceptable that you go with what your contractors want.Good to have you managing again and congratulations in between.",
