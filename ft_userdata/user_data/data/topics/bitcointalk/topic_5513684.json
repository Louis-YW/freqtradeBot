NYSE and CBOE are now Bitcoin ETF, no one wants to miss the train, we will still see more approvals by SEC in future. Bitcoin is winning and we bitcoiners are winners. Good news for bitcoin, the bad news is that in future majority of bitcoin will be in third party custody. I hope you don't fall for that. The odd of bitcoin price going to the moon is very high than going to zero. Keep stacking more sats.",
