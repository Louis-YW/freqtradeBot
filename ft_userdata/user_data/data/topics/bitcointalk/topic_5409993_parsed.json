After you get a summary information from them, you must visit a specific exchange for double checking.You info is still not correct. For now, if you check at Binance's Deposit & Withdrawal fees, they charge two different fee for Bitcoin and Bitcoin (Segwit). What you talked about is Bitcoin Legacy, not Bitcoin Native Segwit. I guess (I could be wrong) that they did not change anything.Old story. Exchanges get profits from users' withdrawal fees.Months ago, withdrawal fee for BTC on Binance was 0.0005 BTC/ withdrawal. not sure back at the days, they charge 2 different fees or only one, at 0.0005 BTCQuote from: tranthidung on January 05, 2021, 05:38:28 AMEach withdrawal will be charged with 0.0005 BTC as fee.",

      "body": "I would also say that this list is quite outdated. I see that there are some small as well as (at least for me) completely anonymous exchanges here, while at the same time there is no FTX exchange, which has a good reason to be mentioned when we talk about withdrawal fees.also, it is completely useless information that it is free to withdraw some trashcoin. Here we have the possibility to know only the lowest, average, higher...",

If you click on withdrawal on Binance, the fee would be zero dollars, but immediately you paste your address, the fee would be indicated below, just like in the below image. In deposit, legacy and segwit addresses are separated, but both are not separated if you want to withdraw and the withdrawal fee are the same.       Binance do not separate legacy and segwit withdrawal fee, even if it is separated, I expect segwit address withdrawal fee to be cheaper, not other way.",

Likely they only changed since 2020.December 2021, still 0.005 BTCMay 2022, reduced to 0.002 BTC but a typo with Native Segwit.QuoteBinance do not separate legacy and segwit withdrawal fee, even if it is separated, I expect segwit address withdrawal fee to be cheaper, not other way.Logically it should be like that but if exchanges, exclusively Binance, take a couple of years to integrate Native Segwit to their exchanges, everything is possible.",
