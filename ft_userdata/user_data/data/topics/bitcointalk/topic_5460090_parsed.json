  "content": "According to the postulation of a Marxist, who is of the opinion that \"politics is a determination of who gets what,  when and how \" this from a lame man's interpretation means that the involvement of the people in political affairs determins who in particular should the dividends of democracy be allocated to, when it should be given and how it should be given.    Ignorantly so many citizens has been neglecting their franchise all in the name of \"I'm not interested in politics\" in that same act they are also involving in politics but in a  negative way, abstaining from voting may emerge a bad govt. And in return when they make policies it includes everyone in the society. Also during allocation we often times discover that some region tend to be neglected in the same manner they have neglected their franchise.     So I ask, in your own opinion do you think politics should be the concern of every citizen.",

Yes politics should be the concern of all because it is how to share the scarce resources of the community or state and so everyone should be a party to it. This is why some other jurisdiction it is referred to as democracy meaning it involves the people. Governance is the business of the people but the challenge is that the few intimidate others and take over \"rulership \" by corruption starting from the electioneering. This is why this time around there are some much wrong doing in politics and so many malpractice are implore to stop others.",

      "body": "Yes, politics is every citizen's business in a democratic society. It affects our lives, rights, and the direction of our communities and countries. Being informed about political issues and participating in the democratic process through voting and engagement is essential. While not everyone may be deeply involved, a basic understanding of governance empowers individuals to make informed decisions. Political participation ensures that diverse voices are heard and can lead to more inclusive and representative policies. Ultimately, active citizenship strengthens democracy and fosters a society where everyone has a stake in shaping its future.",

We may all not be politicians but those in politics are there for us and are working for us, we are directly or indirectly affected by their decisions made, therefore we are expected to have the mind to develop interest in what they do and get carried along, we are expected to be well served by them, join and support every good intention they desired to work upon in giving back to the society, help motivate them and raise the support they needed from us towards nation's building and go against every injustice going on in the society.",

An unpopular opinion but it happens to be true -- the best type of democracy exists only when an educated population participate in producing the pillars of a free society which emphasizes individual liberties. Having an uneducated population participate in political matters is how the Marxists achieve their utopian socialist hellish landscape.",

If a country also does not partake in global politics and get it self affiliated to what is happening and try to influence it to their favour then the negative aspect of the global politics will keep hitting on the country's economy. The decisions agreed on the global comes down to the local, if world bank increase it spending, it is either it will benefit some countries in terms of loan and it is those that are influential and have presented very good reasons will get such on the shortest time while others are left behind.",

Politics should be a concern for everyone. You must not be over active in politics, but do not be completely ignorant of what is happening around you. I get angry at people who say politics of their country do not concern them just so they can sound cool and in control, to me it just shows their level of foolishness, stupidity and immaturity.",

I mean you can take Stalin's era as an example, before him, we didn't know that such evil could be contained in one person but Holodomor and Cannibal island and countless gulag prisoners proved otherwise, if the people acted early on before the paranoia set in, Stalin wouldn't be able to commit those atrocities. That's why I feel bad when people are apolitical, they don't want to fight for their right to a better living, they're happy that they can eat 3 square meals a day when all of us deserve more than that.",
