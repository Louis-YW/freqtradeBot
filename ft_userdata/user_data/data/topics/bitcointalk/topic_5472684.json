International journalist and Bitcoin enthusiast Max Keiser asked five questions on Bitcoin and its operation, of which Jones answered none correctly.Alex Jones Fails Max Keiser’s 10,000 Bitcoin QuizAlternative journalist and Infowars host Alex Jones lost the opportunity of regaining a 10,000 bitcoin gift that international journalist and Bitcoin enthusiast Max Keiser gave to him more than ten years ago. Keiser convened to allow Jones to recover this gift by answering a five-question Bitcoin quiz. However, Jones failed to answer even one of these questions correctly.The questions that Keiser asked Jones were, in order:How many total bitcoin are there ever going to be in existence?How often does the difficulty adjustment adjust?What’s the core hashing algorithm called?How often, on average, do new blocks appear?Is Craig Wright Satoshi Nakamoto?Keiser showed frustration with Jones’ answers, stating that he had given up on $800 million, while Jones acknowledged, tongue in cheek, that it was better for him to lose this opportunity.Jones stated:QuoteIt’s like people that didn’t win the lottery: I’m glad that I didn’t get the 10,000 bitcoin frankly, I’d probably be dead by now.Jones received this gift when bitcoin’s price was under $5, but the gift would be valued at more than $350 million today.Keiser’s FrustrationDuring the quiz, Keiser repeatedly showed his frustration with Jones’ lack of seriousness, criticizing his lack of knowledge when he was aware he would face this 10,000 bitcoin test.Keiser said:QuoteDuring the previous years when you could have been sitting on these 10,000 bitcoin you could have been studying bitcoin, but instead you chose not, and now here we are.Regarding the last question, Jones assumed it was a trick question, stating that Keiser would not give him 10,000 bitcoin now that its price had gone up so much. But Keiser said anyone reading the news could have answered the fifth question.He blasted Jones, stating:QuoteAnyone who reads the news would know the answer. That was the easiest question of them all. Look at your desk, it’s covered in piles and piles and piles of news articles, but do you read any of them?Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/infowars-host-alex-jones-lost-10000-bitcoin-in-max-keisers-quiz/",

      "body": "That was an entertaining read. Why am I not suprised Alex Jones failed miserably at this \"test\"? However not being able to answer any single one of these questions really goes to show Alex Jones most likely has no knowledge what-so-ever about cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin specifically. That is kind of strange, because which-ever conspiracy theory side you are on (Bitcoin is CIA vs Bitcoin is the end of traditional banks) - shouldn't that be part of his field of \"expertise\"?",

      "body": "Well, I think what Alex Jones did (said) about the things that happened and also what the supposed hidden agenda was for the kids in that school, was horrible and the parents should be angry at him for that. On the other hand.... awarding a Billion dollar award to them was just stupid, because he will never be able to pay it back. I know he has about $10 000 000 worth of assets, so just take all he has worked for and be done with that. Max made a good gesture and Alex Jones could have done more to get that money... but I think both of them were not serious about this publicity stunt.",

I can imagine what it was valued at then compared to now. No one will agree that such a technology will gain as much taction as it has today and also the controversies around the fact that it has the possibility of eliminating the convnetional finance system already in place",

Yeah, what the heck is all this about?   And did they consider the gift tax implications here?  A 709 is required and MK would be paying the gift tax on it which is 40%.  So he'd be giving 10000 bitcoin and then having to sell 4000 for the tax, but then would owe a capital gains tax on the 4000 so would need to sell another 1000 to pay that which would need another 240 to pay that which would need another 60....So in short he'd need to have around 16000 bitcoins in order to gift 10000.  And (as you asked), does he have that many remaining - 16000 - and if so why would he do it?",

Lol.  No.I am not so sure if someone like Alex Jones wants a lot of press these days when it comes to money. He is completely screwed since he is denied to use bankruptcy as an emergency exit out of the mess he has created for himself. I also don't know whether Max Keiser benefits a lot from being associated with offering 350,000,000 USD in prize money for a Bitcoin quiz to someone like Alex Jones  Whatever the case is, I guess the idea was that Alex Jones would fail at the Bitcoin supply question I guess, Max Keiser would have probably come up with some different answer that he deemed right or wanted to hear (rounding error or whatever).",
