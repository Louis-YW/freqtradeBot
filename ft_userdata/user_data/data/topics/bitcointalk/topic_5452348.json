  "content": "This is what we mean when it's been said that the more the attack the stronger the network becomes with bitcoin, we don't need to create fear in discontinuity for bitcoin adoption amidst the trending occurrence with bitcoin ordinals, but we must be positive in holding unto what we have believed bitcoin to be because transaction fee  issues won't last long but bitcoin will, this are recent edges achieved while since the onset of ordinals in March, bitcoin continue to remain unstoppable, irresistible and irrevocable best financial option.Here are few achievement that could be attributed to bitcoin advancement for more adoption as it remains unstoppable.1. A&M University in Texas has begin the introduction of teaching bitcoin in their classes as part of it curriculum scheme, it has included to enhanced bitcoin education just as in the case of El-Savador where bitcoin was firstly adopted and teaching bitcoin was made effective in schools. https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1653080821090205712?t=tBCeD2tFoU7o0mCOy-OfFA&s=192. University of Science and Technology in Ghana is also set to begin the introduction of teaching bitcoin in the school course curriculum as part of it efforts to encourage massive adoption through bitcoin education in the country https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1654218350740881408?t=jRUZI5Cw-a4ejDhF9xzy_A&s=193. Kids in Brazil making bitcoin payment through the use of bitcoin lightning network, high fee is never a concern or barrier when there's an alternative. https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1653150841782542336?t=sYNx1yFkAZOmfn8huTtK6w&s=194. Mayor of Miami got his salary continued paid in bitcoin amidst controversies on high transaction fee. https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1653529796352040961?t=G7Di_sRBff1zlN9OiMXLEw&s=195. About 13,584,367 bitcoin addresses last month were all added to the blockchain network https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1654260739664670723?t=BBWZq6Qg4eu3sPBTSF8RIQ&s=196. About one million addresses now hold at least one bitcoin in them https://twitter.com/CooliganFields/status/1655983018593353744?t=a7-_kD_MAUBCX6Fe0sw-0Q&s=197. Lastly hear this that was said of Michael Saylor about bitcoin, that when the fiat economy is no where to be trusted, the financial confidence comes in through bitcoin https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1653508990335172611?t=dzNJt-3V4W9lPLJNHwGCjg&s=19We must not forgot why we have shown interest in bitcoin the first place when the change in financial economy was needed before bitcoin arrives, yet nothing is changing about bitcoin than for good at the end, invest in bitcoin, hodl and avoid FUD, bitcoin has come to stay.",

The meme pool is still increasing and had never reduced to the limit we hope for it to reach. As at few minutes before now, It was about 540 sat/byte which might still continue increasing and decreasing. This alone had halt so many transactions from being confirmed since it was sent lower average. Some exchanges had stopped processing any transactions because of this same issues.",

This is a temporary problem that occurred as a result of some recent updates that caused an increase in transactions on the network.The network has gone through such a problem before and it has been overcome, so personally I have no fear for the future of bitcoin adoption. On the contrary, in my opinion, the presence of problems helps create a more suitable environment for adoption by solving the problems that society may face in the event of bitcoin adoption.",

As for the adoption of bitcoin worldwide, nothing can stop it,instead bitcoin is gaining more recognition by people everyday by day. The fact is that bitcoin is the new era currency and people have begin to have that insight of it, including the government and individuals due to lack of trust on banks and fiat currency.",

Nobody!!!What he cares about is what those satoshis mean in $! That's all!If BTC reaches 300k nobody here will give a crap that he has to pay only 10sat/b instead of 100sat/b now.I couldn't care for Bitcoin to be one hundred quadrillion, I ain't going to pay one million $ for a tx, even if that is 1sat/b.",

But now the fees have started to drop and slowly the network is returning to normal. The Bitcoin network congestion event in 2023 this time will be history. This is the impact of Ordinal NF and BRC-20 tokens that appear and make the network even more congested. Who knows how the network will operate? I'm not an expert, I'm just complaining when the congestion event this time is caused by a new phenomenon that is hype.",
