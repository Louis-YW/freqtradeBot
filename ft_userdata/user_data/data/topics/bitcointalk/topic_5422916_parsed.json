I already added the networks thanks guysYour HT token was based on ethereum blockchain and it can't be send to the HECO network as it was a native blockchain owned by Huobi. You need to bridge it if you wanna try to send it to the HECO network. There are some solutions for that1. Use bridge to convert your HT (ethereum) to the heco chain2. You can create account on huobi and then depositing your HT token. You can withdraw your HT to the heco chain address directly from there.",

I already added the networks thanks guysI think all the useful information that I have shared before can be put to good use for your knowledge, $HT that is on the Ethereum network cannot be transferred directly to the HECO network. I think the answer from @asriloni is enough to represent everyone's answers here. For the bridge itself, you can see the following tutorial provided by ChanSwap: https://docs.chainswap.com/user-guide-1/swap/eth-heco",
