If you're day trading in markets with lots of investors or regular traders (bull markets and forex) you don't have to do this as much as the volume of most of the day traders and speculators is insignificant compared to those that just need to quickly move things around.",

It's not going to be vital for too long if you ask me, in the near future we are going to realize that short term trading is not the purpose of it, and either using it or holding for long years is the real usecase for bitcoin but until that is realized we will have a lot of people who will keep using it.It's unfortunately not always right as well which means that you will make some calculations and you will end up with some problems for the long term as well.",

New strategies is born from time to time and we have the privilege's to asses the situation and choose what kind of strategy would be more effective and accurate for the given situation. We all have a bias strategy for each market scenario and I believe that most of us follow that kind of strategy every time since the accuracy rate and results satisfies us.",

No strategy will ever be a full proof one.The only thing that is going to help is buying low and selling high. Rest all indicators are going to only give a prediction and that too will end up 50% correct.Eventually what I have learnt is that day trading is tough, but in long term trading, just stick to what I said, you will gradually gain profits.",

It's okay if it will come to the point where everyone knows how to read indicators and most of the trading strategies. Still, a market is still a market for which people can read through the charts but it's not just the only thing to look at with it. It's volatility remains and if some sudden issues or news has come, that's a game changer on that and most predictions and indicators aren't always as accurate as they are. So even if the majority has the knowledge and strategies on trading, that won't make them exempted for losing.",

I understand what you are trying to say. You are saying if every trader know and understand an indicator then every one won't make a mistake to lose his money. For instance if every trader know that RSI overbought or over sold is exhausted, the everyone knows the reversal time, I believe this is an example of what you are saying but I use to think like that too sometimes in the past but I tell you it is not possible for everyone to understand a particular way of indicator just like it is not possible for everyone to be profitable or profiting every time or the same time, you must have winners and losers differently at the same time.

Upon trying different indicators, it comes to my mind that indicators might become an obsolete one day.Indicators don't become obsolete because they are already made like that to be like that for you to change it from default settings or leave it that way depending on your strategy and the way or time you use it on. For example I don't see what is obsolete in bb, SMA, RSI,MACD, fractals or parabolic SAR. It is only you to work on it to change the settings and the time frame you use it.",

In trading, there must always be a loser more than the winner or vice versa. There is no way that all are going to go in one direction as the market will lost its balance and will not be as good as before anymore.As for the question of the OP, my response would be yes. There will always be a bad trading strategy. It may work at first or on some other times but the rest are just simply a loss. Now is there a trader who will like to use it and just incur a loss? I guess no but we must move on and make another working start.",
