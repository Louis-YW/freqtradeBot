All transactions are public because the blockchain is public and everyone has insight into every transaction that has ever happened and will happen in the future. Given that most centralized exchanges have KYC, and that there are many companies that analyze the blockchain, it is not surprising that it is very difficult to remain anonymous if you use Bitcoin the way most do. In addition, it is a well-known fact that some top secret agencies were working on detecting and analyzing bitcoin users even 10 years ago, and for that they used very specialized tools.Quote from: krashfire on January 12, 2023, 03:51:42 PM2) How do we continue to remain anonymous while trading bitcoins?One of the ways is to use DEX (decentralized crypto exchanges - example Bisq) where there is no KYC, or to trade with people live (which is still a risk), or to try to find a crypto ATM that does not ask for any information about you (the downside of such trading is a large fee).Quote from: krashfire on January 12, 2023, 03:51:42 PM3) Are there cryptocurrency exchanges that does not require our ID to trade in large quantity? I know that there are some CEXs that do not require KYC up to a certain amount for withdrawal, but you must know that at any moment they can block you for any reason and ask you to verify yourself. There are some specific crypto exchanges in Europe where you can trade without KYC (physical stores), but this is still an exception that can be canceled at any time.",

Bitcoin is a public ledger, anyone is able to track bitcoin movement, be it government or private individual. There are plenty of block explorers available. You lose you anonymity when specific address can be connected to you, so i.e. when you buy something online with btc using your real name/address or when you deposit/withdraw to centralised exchange on which you've verified your identity.There are still exchanges that you can trade on anonymously, but usually they'll have some limits for non-verified customers.Quick google search:https://www.marketplacefairness.org/cryptocurrency/best-no-kyc-crypto-exchanges/",

Even you could do this if you knew the addresses and coins involved.Quote from: krashfire on January 12, 2023, 03:51:42 PM2) How do we continue to remain anonymous while trading bitcoins?You can't really. You can always be identified by your wallet, your username, your IP, many things. But P2P (trading with other people rather than with companies or intermediaries) is probably your best bet. Platforms like Bisq are safe enough and don't require KYC. You could, of course, be unknowingly trading with someone who intends to track or identify you. I trade majority p2p with people I've known for years. It's still a risk for sure, but that's a sort of trust circle that, if broken, they stand much more to lose.Quote from: krashfire on January 12, 2023, 03:51:42 PM3) Are there cryptocurrency exchanges that does not require our ID to trade in large quantity? None I know of that you could trust enough. If they claim they do, they're not safe enough for large deposits.",

Atleast somewhere today you must have done a KYC in your wallet which means some place has your real identity disclosed. Now if the bitcoin you hold transfer from that account or wallet for just once only government will be able to establish a trail easily.2. Don't transfer funds to any KYC wallet3. I think Kucoin still doesn't require any ID but it's only until 1 btc per day I think so more than that you'll have to give ID on every centralized exchange.",

Bitcoin is a public ledger. Anybody can track bitcoins.The hard part is knowing the owner of the coins and that's a job for the police. Also, exchanges are going big on KYC lately and that's making the cops' job easier. If you mine your coins yourself, nobody can possibly know that you have any bitcoins. If you somehow purchased your coins from an exchange or some other person than they will know about you if they want to.That's why people say bitcoin is semi-anonymous.If you want full anonymity then use monero.",

One way authorities can track bitcoins is through analyzing the blockchain, the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. By tracing the flow of funds through different addresses, it is possible to identify patterns that may indicate illegal activity. Additionally, some exchanges and other bitcoin-related companies may be required to comply with government regulations and share transaction data with authorities.To maintain anonymity while trading bitcoins, you can use a mix of different methods such as using a VPN or Tor to hide your IP address, using a new address for each transaction, and using decentralized exchanges that do not require personal information.Some decentralized exchanges do not require personal information or ID to trade, but the trade-off is that they may have lower trading volumes and less liquidity compared to centralized exchanges. Additionally, there are some centralized exchanges that claim to provide greater privacy, but it is important to do your own research and be aware of the risks.",
