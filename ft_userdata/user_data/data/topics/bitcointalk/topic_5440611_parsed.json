  "content": "I have preferred to use Kucoin on my mobile phone, it is one of the exchanges I have been trading now without forcing me for KYC, not requesting for like mobile phone number. I have used the exchange and it is quite good.The only issue I have with the exchange is the candle stick time range, I was unable to check some like 6 hours, 12 hours and 1 month time range in candles.I have used some exchanges that I can go to the settings to change some of the candle stick time range, I check Kucoin and I did not notice anything like that. Am I missing it, can anyone tell me if possible I can select time like 6 hours, 12 hours and 1 month time ranges on Kucoin mobile app.It is not a problem though, I can check that on other exchanges, but I just want to know if Kucoin supports that on their mobile app so that I can be using it directly.",

I hate exchanges site web version on phone, they are always not light to load and frustrating at time, if compared to using the mobile version directly.Quote from: logfiles on February 20, 2023, 10:37:18 PMAs long as you don't forget your trading password or aren't bothered by the so many time-consuming steps when trying to withdraw your fundsÂ  I use my trading password often, I can not forget it.About the second inconveniences, it is not a problem for me, I do not even see it as an inconvenience at all. If I go either long or short using future trading, I can set it in a way any money I transfer on my main or trading account to go automatically to my future trading account during liquidation. If I want to withdraw, you can see the trading account and the main account funds on the withdraw page and you can check both to withdraw money from the accounts at once. Only the one I do see as inconvenience is also an inconvenience on other exchanges, which is sending to future trading account.The only problem I encountered is when I transfer fund from one account to another, it may take up to 10 seconds before I will notice it on the account I transferred it to on Kucoin, like transferring fund from future trading account to trading account. Before, it gives me a feeling that I did something wrong, but I know how it works now and no more a problem, but it would be good if Kucoin software developers can do it in a way it can be like other exchanges because I experience this only on Kucoin among the exchanges that I am using and that I have used before.",
