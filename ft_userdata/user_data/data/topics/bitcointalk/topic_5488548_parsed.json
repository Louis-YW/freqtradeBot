  "content": "Bitcoin as a currency over the years have experienced tremendous growth in it value, scaling through different policies and trials. Bitcoin price as of 2009 was $0.09, imagine holding bitcoin from 2009 till date,that would have been a very huge portfolio.         As an investor you can't afford to think how others do, or structure your investment plans on the opinion of others. Investment as we all know is risky, because it involves financial asset.Investment is  like planting a tree that would bear fruit forever, this same way should be the pattern investors think, future prospects...           Reasons why an investor need to think, align and see what others don't see?    1)  investments  decisions are not your meal plan decisions, it involves resources to be put at stake, without proper decisions those resources can sink in a second.Most persons that is still calling bitcoin scam is as a result of wrong decisions they maid earlier.   2)  investors, bitcoiners that bought bitcoin as of 2010 when it was just $0.30, sometime didn't expect bitcoin would worth $72K  currently.   As Investors you need to be visualistic and optimistic, imagine what would be going through there brains now, Bitcoin has thought me what I haven’t learnt in any financial class at all. That's why I buy the idea of Warrent Buffet  \"investment outcomes should be expected after a decade\".     3)   Bitcoin is rallying to a new ATH some have grasp the opportunity and learnt from history about what is to  come and the bright side of this decentralized currency in years to come.Some are holding for;a) profit making in short termb) profit making in long term runUnder which category do you fall, if we call ourselves investors then we need to make right decisions and not rest on others decision,media and firms analysis.        Let say we have an investor who is holding bitcoin from $0.09 till now  just imagine the portfolio of that investor.        Making right decisions and being visualistic while investing in the right asset would save any investor that what bitcoin have thought me.    Today the bitcoin market have many big firms,investor and holders that  are expanding the ecosystem and the bitcoin network at large. A coin that was once sold at $0.09 is now $72K.",

He helped me to have different jobs related to crypto currency, and as he is an early adaptor of bitcoin, he experienced the first bull run of bitcoin, meaning he had bitcoin when it started, and I'm sure until now he has bitcoin, which is from way back when he started to get into bitcoin. Why? Its because he is not the type of bitcoin investor that will think of selling bitcoin in order to have profit; he is the type of guy that has a business mindset, and instead of becoming a luxurious guy, he keeps on investing in bitcoin or any crypto currency-related things. Even though we already graduated a year ago, he is still in the bitcoin industry because he built his own company related to blockchain technology.",

To be honest, I can't blame people that didn't see what bitcoin could become when it was worth less than a dollar. This was something new, something the world wasn't used to, something they haven't heard of before. It might even be possible that there are some early investors who didn't believe it would be this big over such a relatively short time. Bitcoin paved the way for the cryptocurrency industry. See how big the industry is today, even Satoshi, as visionary as he is, might not have seen that coming. What I have learnt about bitcoin is that you get better at it with experience. The next halving will be my second bitcoin halving. I know so much more about bitcoin today than in 2021. This forum made that possible, but it was also because I have more experience now. Now I can comfortably make a decision on my own with seeking for the opinions of others because I understand Bitcoin better, someone who doesn't have that experience won't be able to do that.",

I plan to hold my BTC for so long till my old age if God blessed me with a long life and I plan to do it in a different style, I will hold, but when BTC reach new all time high I will sell my bag and wait for a bear market to buy again, I will keep rotating this because I believe that my BTC will grow higher in numbers doing this in every cycle, I've been here for long now and I understand how the market works. You don't have to sell everything and move on with your life just because you made unexpected gains, learn to take advantage of the market cycle and it's very risky to be out of Bitcoin, price appreciation will always happen, those who sold earlier don't think about the future but the present.",

Investment as we all know is risky, because it involves financial asset.you know, it's easy to look back at how far Bitcoin has come and imagin the profit one could have probably made if he had investment at the time a whole Bitcoin was valued as low as $0.09.  I guess that's the beauty of time cause of some of us were aware of Bitcoin at it onset, it's very possible to look at it as a scam and unrealistic project.It's good for an investor to think outside the box and probably look into the idea behind a particular project as well as the teams involved in the project to determine the possible worth of the project in the future but such analysis isn't always easy due to a high level of disbelief by the majority of people when the project hasn't gained popularity. What I'm saying in essence is that, we only know that Bitcoin is of this current price today because this is the reality. If we are asked to give a twenty year prediction of the possible future of Bitcoin, some of us wouldn't be able to leave our investment up till that period and lets say we are to luck up our holdings from now till the end of the next 20 years, some of is cant even try that because we cant tell what will play out from now to the next twenty years and that's obviously the reality of life. Quote from: Bravut on March 12, 2024, 07:09:11 AM    Today the bitcoin market have many big firms,investor and holders that  are expanding the ecosystem and the bitcoin network at large. A coin that was once sold at $0.09 is now $72K.that's the just the power of time, chances and a bit of Patience. I can bet that most of the earlier people that invested into Bitcoin didn't see this coming but probably did it because they were in the crypto ecosystem or were just fascinated about seeing an alternative to the fiat system of the past and had to subscribe to what looked as an alternative. It's great to see the value of Bitcoin gaining this big and we only hope that it gets more bullish before the end of this halving.",

See how big the industry is today, even Satoshi, as visionary as he is, might not have seen that coming. At least I can speak for my friends who have started investing in Bitcoin over half a decade ago, making six-seven-figure incomes. However, I’ve also noticed that some of them couldn’t hold onto their Bitcoin, which I believe is related to the economic situation in the country at that time. Every person I know who held onto Bitcoin, even when it was challenging to believe in initially, had some extra income at their disposal today, which allowed them to retain their investment.Now that Bitcoin is gaining more acceptance and credibility each day, people are realizing the importance of investing in it online. Previously, it was seen as a less likely choice, but people are now making more deliberate decisions to invest in Bitcoin rather than simply spending or withdrawing their investments when they need cash. For example, a friend of mine shared that he made over $5,000 in profit from his initial investment, which was less than $500. He managed to invest in the right coins alongside Bitcoin, resulting in even greater profits.Unfortunately, even when Bitcoin became popular in my community, especially on campuses, I found it difficult to believe in and didn’t make much effort to understand the technology behind it. Then, I missed out on the opportunity to invest or learn more about Bitcoin in its early stages. But, I’ve since gained insights to Bitcoin and learned from my mistake. I’m now eager to invest as much as possible and learn more about Bitcoin.",

Let say we have an investor who is holding bitcoin from $0.09 till now  just imagine the portfolio of that investor. This is one of the driving force of some greedy and naive investors (beginners) because they heard that people profited from Bitcoin because they both it earlier, they immediately rush to acquire some shitcoins believing that it will rise and by such they will be as lucky as those who both Bitcoin in the early stage. For some reason I question most people who wish to imagine how much some people who invested in Bitcoin at a very low price would have now in there portfolio, why do you imagine that? its such an imagination that would drive some one to do some rubbish in the crypto space later blame it on Bitcoin. if you OP and those who usually imagine this kind of thoughts where to be in the 2009s in a position to buy Bitcoin which is a paradigm, would you have bought without the current knowledge you have now about it?. that is one of the reason why i don't see myself imagining such. Personally, if I was in the position to buy btc the. i wouldn't have bought because it's something that nobody has ever had an experience of it, and those who even took the risk maybe because they have an extra cash flow then sold after some rise thinking it would be the end but it kept performing till date. What I'm saying in essence is \"wake up from that dream mate\" stop imagining things that are impossible and take the present advantage to purchase some Bitcoin into your portfolio.
