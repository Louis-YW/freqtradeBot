As a result various institution including FED and many others, have been established to proactively implementing measures aimed at averting future economic meltdowns. Nevertheless, our current reliance on high standard of living, which requires substantial energy and petroleum products consumption to sustain it. Consequently the potential for fresh economic crisis can not be completely dismissed.",

If we are still poor, we must always have the desire and urge to find a way out of poverty. If we maintain an attitude of gratitude and unwavering happiness even amidst poverty, it shall augment our contentment, fostering acceptance of our circumstances instead of relentlessly seeking an escape from it. Today's society is very pragmatic and we cannot deceive ourselves that without money there will be another way for us to be happy.",

Maybe they need to see a state/people revolting already before they return to QE.That what you describe is a very extreme scenario, people back in the day already had weapons and there were not some much looting or killings. The looting today, specially in some cities in the United States is mostly because employees are trained not to interrupt or engage themselves with the criminals, because the merchandise or business maybe under ensurance and it is not worth the risk a physical confrontation against criminals just for some merchadise, one's life is more important. Criminals are aware of those policies and they take advantage of it to carry those speedy lootings, knowing they won't get stopped immediately. I am more optimisticin the future, though. If a economical recession was going to happen people won't push it into an apocalyptic scenario.",
