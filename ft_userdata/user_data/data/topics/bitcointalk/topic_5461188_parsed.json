This makes more difficult to find out real one and many of new comers trust these because they looks like real. Anyway fake Followers can be increased or bought easily even I saw some fake twitter promoting airdrops with blue verified badge as it's easy to buy and can attract newbies to be scammed. This one should be a warning to newbies and never fall in these types of trap. If you see something suspicious from an official account you must verify it if there something compromised or not.

Since this is a hot trend in the market at the moment, it was predicted that scammers would try to exploit this trend. If you keep an eye on various social media including Twitter, you will see these scams coming up almost constantly in the coming days. Because there are some crypto investors who invest in such scams hoping for quick profits, but end up losing their funds and exiting the market. So crypto investors need to be more careful and protect themselves from such scams.",

Check out the following results:The proof that I mentioned above is simple proof indicating that the X tokens that are being promoted now are scam Rugpull tokens. There are accounts that also promote the pre-sale of the X token. The token creator places his wallet address for the Twitter victims to send him their investment funds to buy this scam token, and there are accounts that promote X phishing domains, so beginners should be careful.",

We can only rely on people having good awareness after so many scams are exposed on Twitter.I too was wondering why the social media giant could do nothing about it. Many scam projects were encountered through twitter and they do away with their act so easily without any proper investigation from the media giant.I think they need to have a look into their policies for business accounts to undergoing some sort of verification before they are allowed to create an account and do advertisement for their products. This can help to reduce the effect of scam projects through twitter media.",

By listing these fake tokens on Uniswap, attracting investors, they will sell all the tokens they hold and take money from the market. It is true that when a new trend is created in the crypto market, crypto investors invest in those projects without thinking, they don't think for a time that these projects can be Rugpull. So X token is a perfect example of how fake tokens enter the market.",
