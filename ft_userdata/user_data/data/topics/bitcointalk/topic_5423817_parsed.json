The account being banned is @OP's fault because he keeps provoking customer support, instead of taking the conversation in a calm manner.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on November 27, 2022, 10:25:16 PMHow is this related to Bitcoin discussion?Please move to scam accusations or gambling board.Secondly, if you are going to share what happened in this forum, then don't direct us to read the details through your external link.

What do the terms between you and the casino say? Did they break any terms or are your earnings paid out accordingly despite the small amounts?  QuoteCancelled bonus Did the casino award you a different Black Friday bonus in the end? Giving someone a bonus and removing it while the bonus is being rolled over is scammy behavior. I am not buying their excuse that it was given to you by mistake. My opinion is similar to yours: they noticed a great chance for you to win and possibly withdraw free money, so they cancelled it.QuoteTerrible and racist support I am pretty sure that your use of \"fucking\" was not meant as a compliment. Let's not kid around. Haven't you heard that you need to be polite with customer support no matter how awful they are because at the end of the day, they can make it easier and harder for you? You didn't and now you are banned. Regarding the anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim remarks, your screenshot doesn't show the entire conversation. I would like to see it all to understand the context and make my own conclusions. You cut out and pasted three different sentences to get your point across. Show the entire thing.  @cryptoempires.io  Have you informed BetFury about this thread and asked them to comment here?",

From the link you provided and I read through the article, you didn't do any contributions from article or paragraph it. The only write up of yours in this thread is, \" Read the full article here\" all the rest characters are from the the website that means you just copy everything from th the site post here plus the link. So what was your reason of creating the thread? When I first read the thread, I was thinking that you have been scammed by Betfury casino company but I got different result from my thought. Why do you create the thread?",

I have no idea how much an affiliate is supposed to earn or expects to earn besides the numbers mentioned in efialtis' thread. I took a look at the topic Mahdirakib linked to above. Efialtis doesn't call it a scam either. I would consider the actions of the casino to be scammy if they breached a contract with efialtis or with you. But efialtis didn't mention that there was an agreement guaranteeing him a fixed amount for the players he referred to the casino. So we don't know that side of the story. BetFury seems cheap, that I am sure of. They don't value the work and traffic directed their way. But that's not necessarily a scam unless efialtis was paid less than what was agreed. If no fixed sums were mentioned, they are just cheap and not worth the time or effort.",
