  "content": "Since people do not seem to understand that reversible computation is the future, I seriously doubt that most people even have object permanence skills. Here is in fact a news article from a very reputable news source that shows that 10 percent of high school students graduates do not even have sufficient object permanence skills: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssjokgx0pUQI would suspect that far more than 10 percent of people graduating high school lack basic object permanence skills; after all, nearly everyone seems to be completely oblivious to how reversible computation is the future of computation, and the people who have heard of reversible computation have nothing sensical to say.Object permanence is the understanding that an object continues to exist even when you do not see it or sense it in any other way. For example, if a person walks into a door, that person continues to exist even when you do not see that person. I know that it may be hard for you to believe that people continue to exist even when you cannot see them, but it is the truth, and you need to accept the truth.Â  In fact, if you see a person at time s and then you see the same person at a later time t, that person has existed at all points in time from time s to time t. The set of all points in time when a person exists is a connected set. Here is an article about connected sets from topology so that you can understand that the set of all points in time when a person exists is actually connected. https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConnectedSet.html , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_spaceThe set of all points in time when a person exists is also a bounded set https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BoundedSet.html , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set. The point at which a person begins to exist is called CONCEPTION, and the point at which a person ceases to exist is called d**** (for simplicity, we shall avoid discussions about the afterlife). Conception and d**** are the only two boundary points https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) of a person's existence. If you have trouble with this, then you should enroll in a course on topology. After you learn topology, you will improve your object permanence skills. Object permanence skills are essential in a face-paced modern world, so I hope you take object permanence seriously.",

I believe we pretty much understand that already, it doesn't need any special skills.ðŸ˜‰However quantum physics suggest that there exist states of quantum particles where they can not exist until someone looks at them, it's a nonsense theory suggesting if you are not observing an object directly, the object doesn't exist, this could be the result of double slit experiment, because when you start observing particles, they change their behaviour.But that has not been proven yet and it could be the result of misunderstanding the infrastructures underlying the quantum world.",
