  "content": "The biggest misconception in the world of cryptocurrencies is that they are assets—specifically, a monetary type of asset. This is a misconception for a simple reason: within cryptocurrency networks or systems, there is no resource that can provide a benefit to cryptocurrency owners. And it is precisely this ability to provide a benefit that defines an asset. Let's look at a few examples of assets to understand this.With stocks, owners can benefit from the company's profits or capital. Profits can be paid out as dividends, and capital can be liquidated or used to repurchase shares.With real estate, precious metals, oil, wheat, etc., the benefit comes from the things themselves. That is, owners can use them for housing, making jewelry and electronics, obtaining energy or food, etc.Fiat currencies are a more complex example of assets, where the benefit comes from debt. Commercial and central banks create units of these currencies by lending to companies, individuals, and governments. This means the units represent debt. People then invest goods, services, and labor in that debt by exchanging them for the units with the aforementioned debtors. However, since debtors must return the units to banks, current owners of the units benefit from this. Because companies and individuals must sell them goods, services, or labor every time they need the units for loan repayments. And governments must allow them to pay taxes in these units. If companies and individuals do not make these sales, they will default. Then, unit owners will benefit by having the banks sell them the seized property of those debtors to obtain the units to close out unpaid loans.Within cryptocurrency systems, nothing like this exists. There are no resources that can provide a benefit to cryptocurrency owners. There are only records.For example, a few moments ago, one person gave another $61,182. In the Bitcoin system, this was recorded as an increment of 1 to the number associated with the first person's address and a decrement of 1 to the number associated with the second person's address. Initially, people gave each other $0.001 for the same numerical update (+1/-1).Obviously, these numerical updates do not represent a transfer of an asset in the amount of 1, as would be the case with stocks or fiat currencies. That's simply because a person whose number has increased does not, as a result, have the ability to realize greater benefit from a resource within the cryptocurrency system. With stocks or fiat currencies, such a person would be able to receive a larger dividend from a company or more goods, services, or labor from bank debtors.From the above, it follows that, contrary to popular belief, that famous decentralized database (blockchain) doesn't store the record of transactions. For a transaction to occur and be recorded, there must be an asset that changes owners. However, within cryptocurrency systems, no assets are involved—only records of changes in numbers associated with digital addresses.What the blockchain actually stores is an activity log. This log tracks the operation of a scheme resembling a pyramid scheme, where participants give each other assets in the hope of receiving more assets from new participants in the future. With each such giving, the log is updated via so-called \"wallet\" applications, and everything is stored on the blockchain. The log is also automatically updated through cryptocurrency protocols when so-called \"miners\", using a trial-and-error method, find a number that meets the conditions of that protocol.So when a person \"buys\" or \"mines\" 2 \"bitcoins\" for $120,000 or 300,000 kWh of electricity, they have actually paid 120 or 300 thousand units of an asset into the scheme and received the ability to change the numbers associated with digital addresses by +2 and -2. After that, they need new participants to return the same or another type of asset. Otherwise, they become a victim of the scheme.In conclusion, since cryptocurrencies are often presented to the public in economic terms, their owners believe they possess a monetary type of asset and use it to make transactions. However, since the asset with which transactions would be made does not exist, what they actually possess is the ability to update the logs of modern pyramid schemes. In every pyramid scheme, participants give someone their asset, and in return do not receive another type of asset, but a promise, a receipt, a confirmation, or some other form of record — which is the case with cryptocurrencies.",

There's no tangible use or financial benefit to it, besides the abstract belief that its value will rise in the future.Yet it still works, somehow. People still... put value into it. What people do is put entries into the log. And they give things with value (assets) to others. That's how the scheme operates, it \"works\" by definition. Why it works? It's like with every other pyramid scheme - participants hope that new participants will give them more assets in the future. But this always collapses. Then it doesn't \"work.\" Of course, Bitcoin and Shitcoins will not collapse as they are logs, and some copy of the log will always exist on someone's computer. The scheme where people give assets to others is what will collapse.",

In other words, it is the expected benefit that a resource can provide in the future to owners. In stocks that resource is capital and profits of a company. So if a company has a positive equity and produce profits its stock is valuable. We can argue how big that value is but that doesn't change the fact of its existence.With cryptocurrencies however, no resource exists that can provide benefit to cryptocurrency owners. So there's no value that you can determine or talk about. Only a log exists that crypo owners can update via wallet applications. And that log can be downloaded for free by anyone.",

This is simply not true. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have value because people are willing to buy and use them as a form of digital currency. They have all the characteristics of an asset: scarcity, utility, and transferability.Furthermore, the OP's explanation of what constitutes an asset is flawed. They claim that assets must provide a benefit to their owners, but this is not the case. Assets can have value for a variety of reasons, including their scarcity, their usefulness, or their potential to increase in value.The OP also claims that cryptocurrency transactions do not involve the transfer of an asset, but this is clearly not the case.

It's true that the transaction is recorded on a blockchain, but this does not make it any less of a transaction.Finally, the OP's characterization of cryptocurrency systems as pyramid schemes is not only false, but also dangerous.

Don't be fooled by the dangerous lies being spread by this individual.When you \"buy\" Bitcoin, what you have actually bought is the ability to update the log. There are no assets involved here. And it is assets that have value or possess features like scarcity, utility, and transferability.Further, an \"asset\" is defined as a resource that provides benefit. There’s nothing flawed about this definition.When one person sends Bitcoin to another, they are merely transferring the ability to change the numbers associated with digital addresses—nothing more. There are no assets involved here. No transactions with an asset are actually taking place; only the log is being updated.Finally, cryptocurrency systems are not pyramid schemes. They are decentralized logs that track the operations of pyramid schemes. A pyramid scheme occurs when you give an asset to someone without receiving another asset in return. You then hope that, in the future, someone else will join so you can get some asset back.P.S. Your accusation of me spreading dangerous lies was pretty hilarious given that you're the one who does that.",

However, I have some objections. Firstly, if we're to agree that your definition of assets holds, there a lot of cryptocurrencies today will pass the test because there are hundreds of tokens if not more that incentivizes their users to hold. For example, Binance token would easily pass for an asset because aside from just benefitting from price movements, there's opportunity to earn yield. Even better, they buy back tokens from open market and burn it.There are other examples but I'd just like to end it here before it gets lengthy. My point?
