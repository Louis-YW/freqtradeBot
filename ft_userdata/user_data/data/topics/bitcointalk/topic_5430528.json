  "content": "Its quite convenient to carry cards for contact less payments, and effortlessly ideal and kinda safe to have the chips inside our palms. Many swedes have adopted the idea of chip implants for easy access to their daily activities leaving them with no reason to take along with them any cards or documents like e-tickets, library cards etc when required to enter the train, gym, library or their homes. It's actually simpler to swipe one's hand against digital readers and get an action executed.However these kinds of RFID Chips may not work for LN payments, but they've got same Side effects on the human body when incorrectly implanted. It could cause infection; constantly removing and implanting chips from/to the body regarding a new update may be harmful to the human body. Bodily Migration; Chips can move from a specific location where it was implanted to another position in the body. Cancer according to WikiAside these side effects, NFC chip implant for LN payment is only compatible with static LNURLw which has no security mechanism attached to it, unlike the Boldcard, unfortunately such chips with security mechanisms are not available or compatible for implants. QuoteStatic LNURLw links are not secure and not suitable for large amounts. Firstly, the chip can be read. Secondly, the static URL is communicated to the POS device during a payment. So the link could then be used to make further withdrawals.Since we can set up the minimum and maximum amount per day, that won't be a problem for people who intend to try this with low budgets to avoid losing out huge amount of Sats. Moving on, this guide was initiated by a Swiss IT professional called F418 who was interviewed by cointelegraph at the Plan B Lugano Conference. Though he warned that nobody should try this as it's not a medical advice. ON github he shared the implant setup processes and ways to handle it successfully and recommended DIGIWELL for body implants. DIGIWELL is a platform that directs people to trusted shops for chip implants across the globeHe recommended LNbits for activating LNurlw extension which will then be used to write and read the NFC chip using Android and NFTtools. First, check if the implant is readable Follow the link for the implant read and write guide.Is this convenient enough? what do you think?https://cointelegraph.com/news/not-medical-advice-bitcoiner-implants-lightning-chip-to-make-btc-payments-by-handhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/human-microchipping-an-unbiased-look-at-the-pros-and-cons-ba8f979ebd96/https://www.npr.org/2018/10/22/658808705/thousands-of-swedes-are-inserting-microchips-under-their-skin",

      "body": "As a proof of concept it was fine to do.For long term use, there are ways that it can be done with a device designed to be used for human use.I would really not want to deal with having something like that inserted into my body, it's a cool idea and all, but still.Since am just about always wearing a smartwatch / carrying my phone I don't see needing it.And some of the worries are just not possible. i.e. bodily migration. It's just not going to happen.-Dave",

Though, its very risky if it's left Unnoticed for long, which will tighten the process of locating the chip in future.",
