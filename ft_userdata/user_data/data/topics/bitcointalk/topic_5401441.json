You will be removed without payment if I find you are enrolling this campaign with altApart from the fact that if it were true, they would get red trust.Edit: I've had a quick look at the two profiles and I'm pretty sure magneto is an alt of someone who had an account previously (BitcoinGirl.Club registered later).Magneto registers on March 22, 2014, doesn't write anything until August 20 of that year when he writes a single post and then doesn't write anything until November 22 when he writes 6 posts, one of which is this one:Quote from: magneto on November 22, 2016, 09:32:21 AMQuote from: sonnyacg on November 17, 2016, 01:01:13 AMHello guys, I want to ask here about how to remove red mark Negative trust? because I was exposed to negative trust  Can red marks removed?  You can't remove it yourself but if the guy that sent you neg trust is willing to remove it at a later stage then you have definitely a chance to remove it from your profile  As Lauda already said if you are willing to stop what you are doing then he'll happily take that neg trust away. However if you don't follow through with your promise then i'm pretty sure that red paint is here to stay But in all this there is nothing against the rules in what has been said so far.",

It could just be a coincidence.Although, according to ninjastic.space, I see that both of these accounts have taken long breaks from this forum before, so it is possible they have more active accounts. But of course, that is just my subjective opinion.",
