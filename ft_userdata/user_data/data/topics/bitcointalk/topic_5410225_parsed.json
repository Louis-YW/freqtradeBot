It seems you are desperate to sell this exchange for us to check it and probably attract on using it but most of the user will preferred to use those existing huge exchange like Binance rather than risk money on new exchange for whatever bonus or promo they are running. If you are not part of it and just want to know if it’s legit or not then the only thing you hear from people here in the forum was that exchange is new and not reputable so it only take 2 seconds to figure what is the risk involved by using it compared when you use proven exchange.",

Thanks anyway...You are on the right forum, its just so many newbies are promoting investment sites, casinos, and exchanges which are unheard of doing what you did asking if it's legal, and turns out they are part of the owner of those sites and just waiting for a new victim, you just have to check on Whois about its age and use the forum's search form or Google it, if you cannot find the site on the two, then its a new one, and are you willing to trade here?",

I'm not saying that it is going to scam you or what, but it's better safe that sorry.So my advise is, better stay away from that exchange for now, someone already posted some links that you can try beside the one that you are asking. Or maybe you can try it for yourself and give us your experience?",

Questions do not necessarily lead to ignorance, but rather tell someone about what is being asked.The site is too complicated to remember. Looks like it's still very new, and needs to see further developments.I've never used this exchange, but based on the active date of the domain it looks very young. Why don't you use a more trusted exchange?",

As long as it is related to cryptos then you are in a right place to ask such question but you should only extend your patience or temper as some of the replies that you will see on here may not really be appropriate like they will think that you are part of the project that you are asking, something like that. That is true to some but for some it isn't. Ok fine, you have no bad motives, I believe you on that. Now about my comment with the exchange, I haven't tried using it and it is only my first time hearing it.You said it's also your first time and you feel sceptical about it? Well that is a good sign to leave the site alone. Don't wait until something bad happens to you and besides we still have other exchanges which are already tested and proven so why not use them instead?",
