  "content": "Recently  European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen raised an alarm that because of Russia’s war in Ukraine most European nation are reverting to using coal for power generation. He retreated that instead of investments in gas infrastructure,  renewables or other alternatives, the extension of coal mining is considered the quickest and most viable solution for these European countries. We all understand that these EU nations need alternative source of power but the truth is that they are destroying the environment they claim to love dearly. If it was Bitcoin operations, the entire so-called environmentalist would raise alarm and propose the ban of mining. This year  Erik Thedéen , the vice chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority mentioned that bitcoin mining was doing harm to the environment and was setting back efforts to combat climate change. He further suggested outright ban of all forms of bitcoin mining that uses up an excessive amount of energy because it poses a threat to the continent’s climate goals. Crypto critics would quickly publicize  the claim that cryptocurrencies was now consuming more electricity than  Argentina , New York or Belgium. Now all of them are silent that instead of investing in other green energy source, Europe is destroying Mother Earth with coal. Where is Bill Gate, Fahad Kamal, Nouriel Roubin, Elon Musk and other environmental champions? They are all silent.But  cryptocurrency  mining industry has embarked on a rebranding effort to challenge the prevailing view that its electricity-guzzling computers are harmful to the climate. All five of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies say they are building or already operating plants powered by renewable energy, and industry executives have started arguing that demand from crypto miners will create opportunities for wind and solar companies to open facilities of their own. According to the  Bitcoin Mining Council , the worldwide Bitcoin mining sector is being powered by an estimated 58.5 per cent renewable energy by the fourth quarter of 2021.  Its now very clear that Bitcoiners are now more environmntal friendly than EU.",

I don't know what that bitch's problem is with bitcoin. She is probably afraid of bitcoin because it might take away her lunch when all the central banks collapse and lose their privileges over common people. That would make Ursula a commoner, that's why she is barking like a mad dog.",

These people will lose their position if energy prices rise significantly or are absent, but they will not lose their jobs if mining is banned. In other words, just as Europe is trying to find an easy solution by returning to coal, it chooses the easy solution by banning mining.If there is a heavy use of Bitcoin and a part of Parliament in Europe is interested in Bitcoin, you will notice that the votes against this ban will be higher.",

The damage done is measured in billions of euros because far more vaccines have been ordered than needed, and now they still have to pay for these vaccines to be safely disposed of because they have expired. To make matters worse, new vaccines are constantly being delivered even though there is no need for them at the moment.If such a woman has the main role in the EU, then we can rightly ask what others like her are doing for a salary of 10 000 EUR and much more. Nothing can surprise me from such people, because there is the saying \"they turn as the wind blows\", and they will do everything to stay in their comfortable armchairs.A few years ago, I watched a documentary that showed what kind of environmental crimes are being done in the name of green projects, and Germany was especially mentioned because of its insane bio fuel production policy. To produce it in large quantities, they turned huge areas into corn fields, and they went so far as to even take parts of national parks for arable land.When they tell you that Bitcoin is dangerous to the environment, show them the following article -> Quote from: https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/10-years-of-eus-failed-biofuels-policy-has-wiped-out-forests-the-size-of-the-netherlands-study/Europe’s thirst for biodiesel to fuel its cars and trucks has likely wiped out forests the size of the Netherlands since the introduction of the EU’s green fuels law in 2010[1], a new study shows. T&E, who carried out the study, calls on the EU to end support to palm and soy biodiesel immediately to avoid further deforestation, habitat loss and greater CO2 emissions than the fossil diesel it replaces.",

      "body": "A high percentage of coal powered bitcoin mining was state subsidized. Virtually all cases of bitcoin miners using dirty coal energy where instances of governments arranging it to boost local economies and create jobs. Geothermal, hydroelectric and wind power are the most sought after sources of power for crypto miners, due to them generally being cheaper in contrast to coal.More recent studies have concluded as much as 70% of bitcoin mining is done using renewable forms of energy. Crypto miners high mobility translates to them targeting surplus forms of renewable energy. Which in turn helps fund the expansion of renewable power across the globe. Not only is bitcoin mining and proof of work not destroying the environment. It is also one of the most environmentally friendly industries in the world.The EU isn't the biggest offender as far as climate change goes. Landfills and unsecured oil wells are definitely more destructive to the environment than the average consumer. Trillions of tons of waste decomposing in landfills produce massive quantities of greenhouse gases. That alone should eclipse any concern about crypto mining.",

But the transition to non-renewable energy sources spoils the environment. The process of burning coal or firewood releases a lot of greenhouse gases and they contribute to global warming. When burning, a lot of gases are also released and enter the human body with breathing, this can contribute to genetic diseases in the future. Mining on such a scale is not carried out and therefore produces less harm to the environment.",

Because the truth is that:Coal is the cheapest form of energy, then hydro, then nuclear, then gas and no nobody is mining by relying on a giant ball of fire in the sky!And miners, and I'm speaking as one will only care about that, miners are a business, they either make a profit or they go bankrupt, they are not here to save the world or anything else!",

I fear that it may be too late though.All valid points, but in regards to \"it's not the fault of politicians\", from what I hear a lot of voters are quite shocked because they would have expected quite the opposite from the people they put in charge in the past. They are going rogue in the EU right now. Not only do they crack down on Bitcoin through their TFR regulations for non-custodial wallets, but also are they going nuts with their approach to personal data. The law is almost for certain to soon come into effect that authorities can read any and all chats you have on your phone or any other device no matter whether there is end-to-end encryption or not. People are supposed to get installed a trojan on their phones either through ISPs/MSPs in order to make it possible for them to really see everything. They justify it with their fight against child pornography. Sure, the intent to fight child pornography is absolutely honorable and has all my support, but the technology is just not ready. They want to use AI and CEOs of data analytics companies already admitted the effective hit rate is still far far far from 100%. So if you send a picture of a little kid that's part of your family to your wife, the kid's grandma or whatever, your name might immediately be broadcasted to a list for potential criminals. In a worst case scenario the police shows up at your door and it turns out you haven't done anything wrong. Cool, but all the neighbors know the police showed up. Imagine these things happen in an environment where everyone knows everyone else, very small towns / villages. It's crazy... The non-custodial wallet regulation is also insane. If I understand that correctly, you need to go through KYC with a registered company for every single wallet you hold the keys to. Holy Christ. I guess you know how many wallets the old guys from this forum often have?  I wonder whether these regulations actually foster tax evasion rather than prevent it. It is like a cat and mouse game. If regulation raises the bar for people to strike a balance between being honest and being private, isn't the question (of course varies from individual to individual): What does someone value more? If it is honesty, the person gives up privacy. But, also understandably, if it is privacy, the person is willing to give up honesty (or feels even forced to do so). And I must say that this choice between honesty and privacy isn't a trivial one. There are people who have good reasons to stay private, and that doesn't imply they are dishonest just because there is a need for staying private. Political activists, journalists, many others.",
