  "content": "According to CNBC, the US' Treasury Department sanctioned on-chain mixing service Tornado.cash because of \"money laundering\" activities. Here's the link to the article: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/crypto-mixing-service-tornado-cash-blacklisted-by-treasury-department-.htmlI fail to see how successful the US government would be at sanctioning a decentralized mixing protocol, since there's no single entity behind it. You can't hold someone accountable for patronizing money laundering activities if everything's decentralized by design. Even if the website goes down, users can still access the smart contract directly without limitations.Am I missing something here? Does this mean all mixing protocols/services are doomed? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

The developer should've chosen to stay anonymous in the first place so none of this would've happened. It's a pity since most crypto projects have publicly-known developers and/or founders. As long as governments are able to identify the persons behind the project, decentralization/censorship-resistance will never be achieved. Now the \"decentralized\" mixing protocol's website has been shutdown, along with the project's GitHub repository. The source code is nowhere to be found, so unless someone has a backup, Tornado.Cash's original vision to bring privacy to the ETH chain would be doomed. The ability to take down the source code easily, makes me wonder if someday governments will do the same with Bitcoin if they find it too threatening to Fiat's existence. I believe the war is just beginning, so hold on tight as this is going to be a wild ride. Just my opinion",

Tornado Cash did not blacklist any particular address within its protocol. @poodle63, Do you have any news about it? As far as I know, the only thing that could get blacklisted is a particular address that is owned by some entity, like for example USDC.Quote from: Abiky on August 10, 2022, 12:33:30 AMThe ability to take down the source code easily, makes me wonder if someday governments will do the same with Bitcoin if they find it too threatening to Fiat's existence. I believe the war is just beginning, so hold on tight as this is going to be a wild ride. Just my opinion One of the many things that empower Bitcoin is its being run by a lot of nodes, which increases the decentralization. So, any centralized entity will get a hard time covering it up. It explains why running your own Bitcoin node is beneficial, the problem is likely if a centralized git repository like Github takes a part of it, like in this came. But I believe, that is a small thing that can be prevented within Bitcoin ecosystem.",

Tornado cash is now closed and dismissed by the US government and we'll still see a series of these closures when big funds will always go through these websites and they'll be tracked down for sure until they're closed. And another sanction is that, they'll never be able to operate again unless they come out with another name or if they're allowed to do that.",

Well who dont gonna get alarm right? Lets agree to disagree, some uses it for privacy but with its particular usage, scammers gonna love that.The protocol itself is open source and decentralized, so anyone can easily \"revive\" the mixer if there's enough interest into it. However, for some people, it may not be worth the risk as they could easily face prosecution from the US government (either through the US directly or through an allied country). While I don't support money laundering, the fact that the source code was removed from GitHub should be a reason of concern for both privacy and decentralization advocates. The government could easily shut down other mixers or \"De-Fi\" platforms if they're hosted on centralized servers. To achieve true decentralization and censorship-resistance, decentralized applications' web interface (mixers, lending protocols, etc) should be hosted on P2P networks (eg: IPFS) and use a decentralized domain name (preferably on-chain like ENS or Unstoppable.Domains). Even the source code should be hosted on a decentralized alternative to GitHub such as Radicle. But developers don't care about true decentralization these days, because they're only thinking about the money. Not only that, but making something completely decentralized would not be as easy to use for the average person.Recently, the US' Secretary of State hinted the possibility of taking down other crypto mixers as well (read his tweet here). If decentralized isn't prioritized, then I'm afraid I'll be the end of ChipMixer, CashShuffle (BCH), CashFusion (BCH), and even privacy coins like DASH and Monero. We're going to have to see how this will end as crypto/Blockchain tech becomes more popular by the day. Just my opinion",
