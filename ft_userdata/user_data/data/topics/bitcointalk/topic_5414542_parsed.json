  "content": "Hello everyoneI have a question for the people that run their own business and they accept Cryptocurrency.We have multiple services online and we only accept bitcoin/LTC/ETH/dogecoin and USDT (but only 1%-5% of our customers use it)The problem we are facing is our customers send us the payments and we keep the payments in the store wallet (plisio), we don't withdraw and exchange the money unless a certain amount has been reached, because if we exchange the amounts on every transaction then we will lose a lot of money.and in the past 3-4 days bitcoin was going down a lot and we lost a lot.So we are effected by : 1- Withdrawals fees2- Exchange fees3- Current market prices4- We can't HODL or keep the money longer than 7 days because we are a business and we have a lot of expenses/providers we have to pay.My question is how do you people manage to keep as much profit as you can? how do you not get effected by the market prices? Thank you in advance!",

I don't think eth, ltc or doge fees are high but eth is? I'd stop accepting thst if I were you.Also, try to send transactions with as low a fee as possible as much as you can (btc might confirm on Sundays at 1 sat/byte for example much better than it'll confirm during a Tuesday - that's something you can look at doing).Holding funds in addresses users pay into shouldn't be problematic either from a security and privacy standpoint imo.You could always add a bit onto the exchange rate too like a lot of payment providers do so you don't lose out on transaction fees (eg 1-5% might go unnoticed).",

You mustn't have expected it to always go up and up and up. The market will continue to be unpredictable and as such, should you not be so focused on the profits that might come from hodling, you should be ready to accept the loses when they do come as a part of the market.Fortunately for you, there are stable coins you could always swap BTC/ETH/Dogecoin and other altcoins for. Stavle coins keeps your profit and cost for purchase in tact. Swap and you dont have price falling to worry about.",

In my area there are no shops or the like that are willing to accept payments in the form of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin/LTC/ETH/Dogecoin. After all, here (where I live) the legality of cryptocurrencies is still as a commodity asset and cannot be used for payments so that no particular store is willing to accept payments in any form of cryptocurrency, including stablecoins.So it can be concluded that if you want to manage profits that are not much and far from losses, then try accepting cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins (USDT, BUSD, & USDC) where you can exchange them anytime you want without being hindered by bad market conditions. Because Stablecoin as I suggested it never has a big influence in terms of price so you can still keep your capital intact, as long as you don't expect huge profits from it because that's clearly not possible.",

If you use Binance there is no need to advertise USDT, focus on bitcoin because you can convert BTC to USDT very quickly after receiving it with almost no conversion fee.",

Accepting crypto as alternative payment channel is best for big business who can afford a market analyst to monitor prices that way they can decide when to hodl and when to sell. For small and medium entrepreneurs having a third-party exchange that coverts direct to fiat is best way to stay off excessive transaction fee from ETH and price fluctuations. Since it's strictly as payment channel then having your keys and coin might not be necessary",

Thank you in advance! I don't know your local currency, is it in USD or another currency?If your currency uses its own currency,  I will advise you to make use of P2P channels, so that any Bitcoin you receive can be instantly converted to your own currency since you run day to day business and may be in need of cash, I think you can make use of p2p if your local currency is also in USD, all you need to do is to immediately convert your bitcoin and litecoin to USD at soon as you get a confirmation from the sender since p2p price are determined at the conversion time, you don't have to compensate if the buyer didn't send the money on time when the price drop below the price you put it up for sale. This should cover all your 4 questions since p2p are mostly free.",

Thank you in advance! Well, you could always plan a budget in advance and just cash out the Bitcoin for fiat as soon as you make the sale. The rest of the profit that you do not need for your business expenses can be put in a hodl pile. As to the budget, you should have a rough idea of how much your expenses will be. If you really want to play it safe then sell and withdraw your Bitcoin on the same day as you receive them. That way you will not have to worry about volatility.As to the fees question, you can integrate the fees into the prices. Although honestly, if you use exchanges to transfer Bitcoin, they will charge your ridiculous fees. So use a wallet like Electrum.",

That is because many merchants are also trying to add cryptos as one of the payment methods. Using a crypto doesn't always mean that we will hodl it because crypto's original purpose is actually a currency/money. Those who hodl a crypto are different and they are called hodlers/investors.Merchants can add some fees on their services if needed only to use those 3rd party services and as a costumer I think they won't complain with that because in return of it is that they are now using their cryptos to avail their favorite services.",

Thank you in advance! Tbh, this is business and you do what will keep your business healthy and profitable. You don't follow the trend and suffer losses. If I say you used use an exchange that triggers to fiat immediately there is deposit, you will still not avoid the exchange fees, you could only avoid volatility. My advice is that if there is not favourable way for you, only accept stable coins like USDT you mentioned. Almost everyone that can use BTC, ETH, LTC etc can use stable coin. So, you can continue with stable coin for the mean time till you figure out how to go about it.",
