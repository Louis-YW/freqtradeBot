Firstly, Bitcoin halving does not occur every year. How does the Bitcoin halving cycle operate? Initially, miners received 50 BTC for each block they mined when Bitcoin was first created. This attracted early users to participate in mining, even before the success of Bitcoin became clear. The process involves reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is produced by half every 210,000 blocks, which happens approximately every four years.However instead of Bitcoin to gain a lower volatility, it will have a massive increase in the price which most person expect to be the next bull run. It has happened repeatedly and its likely to repeat again. In the past, roughly November 2012, when the price of BTC was about $12, the first halving happened. A year later, Bitcoin's price went up to almost $1,000. The second halving occurred in July 2016, and at that time, Bitcoin's price dropped to $670 but then went up to $2,550 by July 2017. Bitcoin also reached its highest price of about $19,700 in December 2017. During the most recent halving in May 2020, Bitcoin's price was $8,787, and it reached its highest ever, nearly $69,000, by November 2021. We are expecting to see what the next halving would be next year during April.",

I understood  its not every year, my bad I made a mistake in the content as I omitted \"4\" in the  post I will rectify that but coming to the part of the halving pump  I also understood that it comes in an unknown period after halving but there's always a high probability that there will be a pump .However, what I'm  insinuating on is after a long period  of halvings and we start getting a very low values what happens to bitcoin at that point.",

There has been a lot of discussions on whether high fees is the fate of Bitcoin... no conclusion have been drawn but it is looking likely. When all blocks have been mined completely and minere were left with nothing, this is when they will have to depend on transaction fees to earn their reward, but by then, we are not sure if the transaction fee will be higher than ever or not, just as you can see now, miners are earning much now while every blocks aren't completely mined, ordinals is serving such opportunities for them to receive higher reward for transaction confirmations, Quote from: Odohu on November 22, 2023, 09:40:36 PMQuote from: promise444c5 on November 22, 2023, 07:19:21 PM  Question:will the price value gain pump in accordanceto the halving valueFrom records,  every halving have always been followed by higher prices in accordance with simple law of demand and supply.

There has been a lot of discussions on whether high fees is the fate of Bitcoin... no conclusion have been drawn but it is looking likely. Please can you provide a source for this claim? It will not be feasible and profitable for miners unless bitcoin is been traded around millions of dollars. The cost of producing blocks will be far bigger than the reward and what about the cost of equipment and set up. It will be difficult for miners to produce block with such profits.What I think is going to happen by then is that when miners reward halving is no longer available, perhaps there is going to be a new consensus rules to compensate miners of their reward for block mining and security they give bitcoin.QuoteFrom records,  every halving have always been followed by higher prices in accordance with simple law of demand and supply. So it is likely that price will pump following subsequent halving activities.Every halving has price suppression and after the halving. Like the last halving that happened, the price will tank and it was after some months we say great growth in the price but again, some bad guys made it dump to $15k. Have you thought how miners are going to survive after 2140 any time bitcoin price should crash, we can't deny the volatility of bitcoin and we can't assume nothing will not happen but be prepared for it so that miners don't suffer losses.",

Yes the price of bitcoin can't be predicted but the annual events can be predicted and those events are the four cycle of bitcoin can be predicted and the halving can be predicted so when you say that bitcoin can't be Predicted then it becomes a general statement but you have to make it specific. Quote from: promise444c5 on November 22, 2023, 07:19:21 PM  Question:will the price value gain pump in accordanceto the halving valueThat is one of the uncertainty of bitcoin. The last bull after the halving was $69k and in this time there are different predictions and we don't know want price we are going to see this but there is one thing sure that, halving is coming next year and after the halving there will be a bull run and those the believe for all the bitcoiners.",

There has been a lot of discussions on whether high fees is the fate of Bitcoin... no conclusion have been drawn but it is looking likely. This discussion is going to be a broad one and much speculated one when the time for it approaches. It seems as if the miners will be the main people that will be controlling the market at that point because of them owning the transaction fees at that point since they won’t depend on the reward of BTC they get from mining to the blockchain. By that time, we might have more miners of bitcoin and this will make the transaction fees more higher because of the increased number of miners and struggle to earn the reward of the transaction fees.Quote from: Odohu on November 22, 2023, 09:40:36 PMQuote from: promise444c5 on November 22, 2023, 07:19:21 PM  Question:will the price value gain pump in accordanceto the halving valueFrom records,  every halving have always been followed by higher prices in accordance with simple law of demand and supply. So it is likely that price will pump following subsequent halving activities.This is already a culture in the bitcoin ecosystem. This upcoming halving won’t be an exception to price pump. The price will increase after the halving, but an exact date for the bull run to take place and the anticipated date for BTC to reach all-time high is what we can’t tell.",
