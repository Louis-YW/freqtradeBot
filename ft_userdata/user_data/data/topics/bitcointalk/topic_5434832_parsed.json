The US and NATO are currently giving Ukraine more sophisticated weapons that might help them to push Russia back or prolong the war. If their plan works and Russia start suffering defeats, I am predicting that out of frustration Russia might launch a nuclear attack on Ukraine which might infuriate the latter's sponsors and force them to join the war. This might indeed lead to a larger scale world War 3. Only the war in Ukraine is devastating the world, what would happen when these world powers start fighting? This world might suffer a mini-Armageddon if these speculations come to pass. But I am sure both Russia and her unfriendly nations know the consequences of another world War and I am sure none of them is prepared to bear the consequences. The number one need of the world this year is peace in Ukraine.",

For example:Quote from: http://voidjudgements.net/suedc/constitutionalcaselaw.pdfUS v Minker, 350 US 179 at 187(1956)� Supreme Court of the United States 1795 \"Inasmuch as every government is an artificial person, an abstraction, and a creature of the mind only, a government can interface only with other artificial persons. The imaginary, having neither actuality nor substance, is foreclosed from creating and attaining parity with the tangible. The legal manifestation of this is that no government, as well as any law, agency, aspect, court, etc. can concern itself with anything other than corporate, artificial persons and the contracts between them.There are several yellow highlighted areas in this PDF file. The above is one of them. Read it slowly. All that it says is that since government is an artificial 'thing', it can only work with artificial persons.We are people. Government can't work with us except that they can trick us into saying that we are a 'person'. We are people, not persons. There's a difference in law.This means that any authority government has over us, is something that they got by getting us to say that we were an artificial entity, a person. They don't have to explain the difference to us. All they have to do is go by what we tell them.There are some other interesting things in that PDF. Take a look at the yellow highlighted ones. They aren't that hard to understand.",
