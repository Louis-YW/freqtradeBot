You can be bold and DCA all you want but maybe stop worrying about what other people do with their money and focus on your own investment strategy. It would be nice if you could practice what you preach and get rich first then start educating people about the things you did to get there.",

Most likely he is just manipulating, He either have a short position or a better price entry since he probably sold already and want some more. A man that involved on crypto will always find a way to manipulate the market especially that he has a power to do it while those exchanges that he is now suing really commit some violation that he is turning a blind eye when he is still benefiting from it. I think it’s collecting time for him the overdue payment.Quote from: Z390 on June 13, 2023, 12:46:35 PMNow many people are getting out of crypto, online search about crypto have gone down so much compared to 2021, isn't this 2020 all over again?

What I’m confused on crypto people is why we are heavily affected by the inflation and recent lawsuit while it targets only the US economy. US might control the majority of crypto market but the rest of the world can still repurchase their holdings like what crypto community did when China exit on crypto.",

I don't think that searches about crypto can be considered as a data related to quitting but we can see the matter of SEC and Binance affected the price a bit which is again not really a new thing happens.So this is not going to be an end of cryptocurrency so one who thinks in that way are going to be the losers.",

The SEC's negative streak towards cryptocurrencies continues. But despite that, the cryptocurrency showed its highest peak in 2021. Although the market has recovered somewhat in 2023 from a full-year negative streak in 2022, the recent SEC outlook has once again hit investor confidence. But since this kind of situation is not new, investors should have confidence. Investors who stick with the market during these adverse conditions will succeed and It is better to grow your portfolio during this time. Those who use the time properly will be successful in the future.",

Real investors can't give up now; they'd rather buy more.People who focus on making quick money are the ones who are worried, because some people take loans to invest thinking the market will pump soon because halving is just a short while away, but the current market situation changed everything and caused panic for them to sell off, while others who invested money they couldn't afford to lose are also selling off. Only true investors will continue to hold and even buy more.",

The market is bleeding because of the SEC, but in a way this is a great opportunity to build your investment portfolio. It might be misleading to say the big investors have left due to market conditions, but I tend to believe they are just being careful and some are getting too busy to accumulate assets at low prices.",

If any of us chooses to buy more or is comfortable with the coins they already have, that's their business because not every one of us has the boldness to take the risk of investment even when the crypto market is down.

I also believe but in crypto anything can be happened so as a good investor we must face any of bad situations in the market smartly. It's a crucial time for the future traders. They should use low leverage and always must have stop loss activated. And for the spot traders and investors keep doing DCA. Because this strategy has a high success ratio. Always making profits is not a good strategy, reducing losses are also important and that will make a man successful in Crypto market.",

Some people think investing in cryptocurrencies is something that should only be done for a short period of time. Yes, it can happen occasionally if you are lucky enough to invest when the bull run is about to begin, but no one can predict that. People who believe in cryptocurrency investments are the ones who will not give up and who understand how the market works. Therefore, the fact that some people borrow money to invest in cryptocurrencies without realizing how volatile the market is or anticipating a quick return on their investment with profits are those one worry about the current price. To me, it is nothing new to see the market decline, so I don't worry about selling my holdings because I believe that these are not the same as earlier times and that the market can change overnight. As a result, I believe that those who understand how the market functions are now buying to hold onto their investments, while others are selling because they cannot afford to lose their money.",

Newcomers and people do not search for crypto online during bear market .It is during the bull run that the news of money making through crypto floods the internet.

I cannot make the mistake of following other people's financial decisions when I understand that we are on an individual financial race. If any investor in Bitcoins is quitting because of what is happening, it is what they have chosen, and I can only wish them well. It is as I have read on this forum, and I believe it so much that there will be many challenges to Bitcoins, exchanges will come and go, but bitcoin will remain. From research also, I have also discovered that whatever is happening to Bitcoins right now, a similar event has occurred with the same magnitude to Bitcoins before, and bitcoin has remained.",

I would say people many people do not rely on search engines again to relate about crypto like in its early stage. This days there numerous forums for the discussion and this forum is one of them and when people get information here they do not need to use search engines again. Also Almost every social media have hub where they discuss crypto related issues some even set up space meetings and this is where most people get their information from. We can also say not like before many investors are going totally private this days as governments restrictions stiffens against crypto. I am not much surprise seeing people leaving or selling of their crypto assets because just like there’s the fear of not missing out, people have also created the fear of losing out too. So any economic downturn or restrictions on crypto may news outlets spread stereotypes of it affecting the crypto market and as many people are just in it to make quick money they tend to bow out with this fear.",

The weak holders think crypto world will end soon because they don't understand what crypto world is. They also don't know that FUDs aren't something now here.",
