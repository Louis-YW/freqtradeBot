Once you import it, click on the unconfirmed transaction from the history tab, you should be able to see CPFP. But it requires higher fee.",

If I'm right then you won't be able to make a CPFP because only the receiver can do that.Do you mind telling us what website you sent the BTC to? You may need to contact the owner because they are the only ones who can do CPFP. So try to contact them and just tell them your current transaction issue and talk about for extra fee later if they ask.",
