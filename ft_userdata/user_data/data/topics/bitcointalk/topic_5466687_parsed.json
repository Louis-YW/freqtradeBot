  "content": "The URL is still https://www.huobi.com/ which may likely be changed with time. The new names is HTX. Some people are thinking that this may have something to do with FTX, but I do not think so because of what Huobi (now HTX) wrote about it. This is it:Quote from: https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/84948926582328Dear Users,As the world's leading virtual assets exchange, Huobi launches a refreshed branding strategy on September 13, 2023, where \"Huobi\" will be rebranded as \"HTX\", our new global brand.HTX: A New Global Brand\"H\" stands for Huobi, \"T\" represents TRON with a commitment to being all in TRON, and \"X\" stands for the exchange. Looking at HTX through the combination of HT and X, HT represents the native token of the platform while X symbolizes the exchange. Hence, HTX is an exchange with its native token of HT. On the other hand, X is the Roman numeral for 10, which pays tributes to HTX’s 10th anniversary. It is a new era for the platform with synergy between HTX, TRON, and Poloniex. There is also a brand new slogan - \"HTX, Just Trade It\".I brought this for people to know about it. Avoid fake URL also becuase I think some scammers like to use a means like this to scam people with google ads or fake link from search engine.https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/84948926582328",

Situations like this is what scammers use to take advantage of unsuspecting users who are not yet aware of the change of brand.Huobi will maintain their domain name as you added so as not to confuse users with such a sudden change, it will be a gradual shift from the current brand to the new one.- Jay -",

      "body": "Thanks for updating, I don't use them but this is a move that's unexpected from them. AFAIK, they've got several branding for their own Huobi brand in different parts of the world just as Binance. But anyway, I've just notice the claim that every exchange tells to their customers for being the 'leading'. As the details are crystal clear, this means the partnership between them and Tron is quite big that it has to rebrand itself and put tron on its business name. Interesting, is tron back to its former style of marketing through partnerships or they've been partner for quite a while now?",

      "body": "I'm really curious if they paid someone for the rebranding or if it's a product of their own management? In any case, when we look at what is actually hidden in the name, then it could be concluded that it is a lucrative deal between the company and Mr. Sun who bought a big storefront for his pointless cryptocurrency. In my opinion, the link between FTX and HTX exists in the fact that both companies have (or will have) a large exposure to altcoins, and on the example of FTX we saw how things unfold in that case. The company collapses, and it is left with a few billion shitcoins that it needs to sell, thus devaluing them even more.",

You are 100% correct! This is the type of made in China marketing that Justin Sun uses. America has FTX? We will create HTX hehehee. On Tron, it is another marketing tactic. Any chance Justin can mention Tron, he will always mention Tron. It has always been his source of income. I speculate much of the validators earning fees in Tron are owned by him.",

Because they see TRON as a better option than ETH right now, they've already planned on creating a ton of junk there, far more lucrative than a token which they can easily swap if they really care about it. With USDT gaining more and more volume on TRON and losing momentum on ETH they try to be in the winning team once.",

Being a Chinese exchange I won't be interested in going through their KYC policy. Renaming their brand won't help them in getting more customers. I checked and found that they have bought htx.com, but they haven't bought htxglobal.com and I suspect scammers might use this opportunity to clone the exchange and use the global domain.

Although CEXs need money, they have several months left until the price of Bitcoin begins to rise, and then all their problems will end until the end of 2025, when most of these platforms will begin to go bankrupt, just as happened with FTX. rename their brand. It is an indicator of something bad that will happen in the future despite the possibility of success in the short term.",
