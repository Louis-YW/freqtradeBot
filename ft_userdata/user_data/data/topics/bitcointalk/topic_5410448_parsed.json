  "content": "AbstractBoth in academic and public discourse, bitcoin(₿) is mainly presented as money. This is grossly misleading, and it creates misconception about what bitcoin actually is. Here, we will use the definition of bitcoin given by the bitcoin creator themselves, to show that bitcoin is not money, but a common record freely available to everyone. That record serves a single purpose: to grant people access to a chain distributor scheme where participants, after making investments, cannot get anything back without “distributors”. Distributors are new participants who supply the resources to existing participants and enable them to return the investments. Given that the Bitcoin system consumes an enormous amount of energy and technical resources, while in the same time produces nothing and transacts with nothing, this makes it the most nonsensical invention ever.The article is here: https://btcfarce.wordpress.com/",

However, all this is just one big joke or hoax. The system creates no bitcoins. It performs no transactions. Nakamoto invented no payment system.

You're responding to my post but write some random stuff.In my opening post I am describing how Nakamoto lied about their system creating and transacting with electronic coins. There are no coins in the system. Nakamoto could as well claimed: \"we define Ferrari as a chain of digital signatures\". Users would still get only numbers next to their addresses. This is all that user have, see and manage. Numbers. There are no coins in the system, no Ferraries, nothing. One can put on paper whatever they want. It's just words. I am also describing how people use Nakamoto's system for accessing an asset redistribution scheme. I have nothing against that. You can do whatever you want with your money. I am just refuting false narratives. Quote from: franky1 on August 20, 2022, 09:22:55 AMhere is a dumbed down version of how the bitcoin network actually worksinitially devices do hard calculations of a batch/pack/block of data (the data being a blocktemplate) in which this calculation produces an ID of the block that can only be correct if it has gone through many processes to find a sequence for the ID that meets a difficulty level required of the calculationand also meets other strict rules.these calculations have a real cost of time and electric and device costs, etc. inside this blocktemplate data. the person who produced a ID that met the rules also had to put an allotment of units(sats awarded) which when everyone else sees that blocktemplate and the block ID that meets the difficulty requirement and is a representation of the block AND meets the rules.. they deem it to meet the rules and a valid block. thus a valid reward.to award the block ID creatornow that winner did not register his name to get an address to associated the allotments of units to. .. what he done was create his own unique private key (varying methods) which then using cryptography creates a public key..he does not need to register this to his own name.instead by just having (in secret) the private key. he can produce a signature that proves he created the public key without needing a register to prove who owns which address. so by assigning the reward to the public address. he gains control over what happens to the rewarded units because now only the person with the private key of that public address can sign over control of the units to a different address. by making a movement order request(transaction) that is signed using a secret only he knows. but can be proved via math and cryptography without revealing the secret. when being rewarded units(sats) people can then sign some/all of their assigned units to other people. because it cost actual electric to create the units initially people put a price on the cost of creating them units. and people started to sell the units.those buying the units had a cost of buying the units and so when they decide to give the units to others they do so by selling the units to other people because there is a real cost of acquiring units. and eventually more and more people have sats assigned to their addresses. and then only they can move the units assigned to their address to other peoples addressa bitcoin(btc) is an allotment of 100,000,000units(of sats)much like a tonne is a allotment of 1,000,000units (of grams)once you understand the complex and costly things involved you start to understand the value creation aspect of the units. people cannot just create new units for free.people cant move random units not assigned to them.(they cant spend units they have not acquired)This is not how bitcoin works.

If someone is capable to write a paper they are capable of assessing something like that as well.But of course maybe the person or group behind Nakamoto identify was joking. And it's not Nakamoto's fault if people took the joke system seriously and started to give other people their electricity or other assets for numbers, or if they pushed the price of nothing up to the sky. That's just the nonsensical behavior of people that obviously like modern access to traditional asset redistribution schemes.But anyway, I changed the world \"lie\" to \"nonsense\". I don't know, maybe Bitcoin Whitepaper is indeed a joke or Nakamoto is completely ignorant of economics and they genuinely thought that money are numbers.Regarding the lawsuit. Hahahaha.

There's nothing revolutionary in people sending each other numbers via Nakamoto's system. There's only a giant waste of resources. It's not my fault if you believe in bitcoins but see only numbers and you're pissed off because of that. So there's no need to insult me. The problem is in you beliefs, not in me. I am helping you to see the truth and to wake up from collective delusion. You should say: \"thank you\" instead of insulting.",
