What is our thoughts ?It is for sure there is some positive effect of elons claim on Twitter not only for dodge but for the whole crypto atmosphere. Twitter is one of the most important platforms for crypto. People follow, express, and monitor projects through Twitter. I know Elon will take the charming initiative to make it more crypto-friendly. But my fear is he will use this platform to manipulate the crypto market as he did with dodge. I always consider doge as a joke for bitcoin and worthless in terms of value. He makes a valueless coin overpriced by using his popularity and hype. If McAfee is charged for promoting a scam crypto project then he is no better than him. He promotes doge for his own profits not because he loves its technology. Overall, I expect he will make twitter a better place for the crypto community.",

Just imagine must is hosting a talk show on dogecoin lately and trying to declare it an approved token for transaction with Tesla or twiter.. The expectation for dogecoin increase if Elon musk win his case has been high and we are seeing it already going to the moon. I don't know if he has made any statement on dogecoin yet but the coin is already flying because of his influence. Hodl is the language now for dogecoin.",

The acquisition of twitter by elon has been increasing the chance for the doge coin to be adopted as a micropayment system or tipping system in the twitter. There will be so many surprises to come very soon for him. Elon has been firing so many twitter's big name. The doge coin may be going again to the moon very soon. A big pump already happened and it seems like that the pump is quite stable at this moment without any signal for the doge coin did a reverse trend again. It's in a good condition for now.

However I have a feeling that this will be another failed pump and it will retrace.We hit $0.15 and closed on a crazy wick. I am thinking we will close bear this candle and then it will very slowly keep going down into the 8 cent area again. Maybe probably went long there and it’s good support.",

What is our thoughts ?Since the growth that dogecoin is experiencing is many times higher than what we can see with bitcoin and other major altcoins then we need to look for other factors that are not related to bitcoin, and in the case of dogecoin it is very obvious that people are happy because Elon finally bought Twitter and if he fulfills his vision then most likely dogecoin could be used as a currency for tips on the platform, in my opinion this is the only way we can explain what we are seeing with dogecoin.",

What is our thoughts ?nah. Its just pump and dump shame. I doubt its connected to twitter purchase. Doge shilling was never censored. Anyone could talk about doge whatever they want. Its not like people were banned due to talking about doge before. So for doge ... nothing will change. BNB should pump instead of doge because CZ confirmed participating as equity investor. Changpeng Zhao said Binance had wired some $500 million “two days ago” as part of the move.So its a big deal for bnb not doge.",

Everything can happen because of Elon's tweet or the increase in bitcoin prices.What is certain is that if you want to play with Dogecoin, you must be very careful and only use the money you can afford.",

What is our thoughts ?It has to be Elon musk's twitter takeover that brought about the pump in dogecoin and as a result other meme coin got an increased in value as well. There are rumors of Elon musk making dogecoin the currency of twitter and if this happens then dogecoin will experiencing more adoption as more people's get to know about dogecoin. Dogecoin survive on hype so when a big one as this came around, the holder use this advantage to pump their favorite token.Sadly, just as it rises so will it fall so investors are to be extremely careful with their investment, if you have no plans of holding for long then sell as you see it sudden begin to fall or you'll lose most gains that have been achieved with this pump in the market.",

It has nothing to do with bitcoin even though tesla is still holding around 10k bitcoin at this moment. The power of money has been proving itself. The take over of twitter has been pumping the price of doge coin to the moon. Im just waiting for elon to create another controversial tweet about that. Since era for shit token already ended last year and elon's tweet about any meme token doesn't have significant impact anymore.

In the world of trading, we all know that there are big players as price controllers, and this also applies to Elon's Doge.What’s the risk dealing with such hype? DOGE pump, but sooner or later it will dump again because the hype will fade though with DOGE I think it will continue to pump and dump which is an opportunity to take as a short term trader. Any good news for DOGE to retain it’s momentum and start the bull trend? Be careful with DOGE, it might become more volatile.",

Imagine, doge coin pumps even without Elon mentioning it?However, I see some videos circulating in the web about that twitter logo that is being replaced by a dog/dogecoin logo but it's only a fan made video though this might be the one who is making the hype. It will still depend on what is the tone of the message Elon drops in twitter. What if it sounds negative? I don't think this will motivate people to buy and hodl more doge coins.",
