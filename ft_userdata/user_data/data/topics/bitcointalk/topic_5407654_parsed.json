  "content": "Not your keys, Not your coins.A solemn saying we learn in crypto as we are always worried trading in the Centralized Exchanges (CEX) because unexpected things could happen all of a sudden. There are many incidences of these in the past where victims lost thier funds either thru hacking or the exchange itself shuts down and you'd be lucky if you could get them back.Legendary members of this forum always recommend keeping your coins in a wallet you fully control and where you keep the private key. A great piece of advice to take since they don't want you to wake up one day finding out the coins are gone. Having your coins in a private wallet, however, is limiting your potential returns in trading.One option if you want the custody of your assets and trade your assets at the same time is the Decentralized exchanges(DEX). Like what you could do in the CEX, you'll constantly monitor your chart when you execute your trading. Yup, rewarding but tedious job and you'll likely miss the life you have which is why some traders are already using bots for trading.Many crypto traders are recommending bots because it automates the specific task that takes up your time watching the chart. Major exchanges also allow traders to set up different trading bots, Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Kucoin, and BitMex to name a few. A fun fact, 38% of crypto users trade using bots and it could go up to 86% if the amount of money moved is considered. It helps you as a trader competes at the same level with institutions. The use of bots is growing steadily over the years and Binance is undoubtedly the exchange with the largest number of active bots according to Cryptonomist.So without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to Sidestepr.Sidestepr is a non-custodial crypto trading bot that automates buying and selling of highly liquid pairs (currently support WETH-USDT) at strategic price points.It implements a predictable \"buy low, sell high\" strategy, repeatedly taking profits at consistent positions -- all on autopilot for you. We call this a \"Sidestep strategy\", as you're essentially sidestepping between a volatile asset (e.g. WETH) and a relatively stable one (e.g. USDT), whenever it's profitable for you.Read more about the Sidestep strategy. It's a work in progress which have been tested since this month. The goal is to trade safe, it's not a get-rich-quick scheme bot and one could trade with such small capital. Let me show you a wallet that is actively using the Sidestepr Trading bot. You can look into it and find the details including its history and how much it had made since. It started at $100. Imagine if you start with a thousand. What Value does the SideSteper bot provide? Sidestepr was built to execute the Sidestep strategy with predictability, automatically. It comes with baseline settings which are sensible defaults that has been shown to be profitable via backtesting with historical data, but also ships with the capability for you to customize based on your trading preferences. By default, it has strategic, self-updating price points, with dynamic (self-optimizing) position sizing, so you never have to guess when (and how much) to trade.It lets you define an amount (in USD stables) as a target profit, so it knows how much of stables you want to secure as profit. Conversely, it lets keep a minimum amount (in ETH) as a target holding level, so it knows how much of ETH to keep for you to ride to the upside.Why does it work?In the simplest sense,  it works because you give the bot enough time so that the profit it earns for you by consistently and automatically buying and selling at profitable price points add up, and the overall worth of your portfolio will increase over time.The bot makes the swaps for you on autopilot, day-in and day-out, and even maintains enough native toke balance (e.g. $MATIC on Polygon, $AVAX on Avalanche, etc) to keep your bot running for as long as you have it correctly set-up. Runs on your own Metamask (or any non-custodial wallet  you are using)It's non-custodial, so you retain full control of your keys at all times, and there's never any lock-up, as the bot software runs on any commodity cloud infrastructure you control, and Ethereum based wallet, like MetaMask.It's compatible with any Ethereum (EVM) compatible blockchains, including:Polygon (recommended)Ethereum (not recommended because of high gas fees)ArbitrumAvalancheSidestepr will be launched initially on Polygon, with other EVM-compatible chains provided upon request.You can read the documentation of the bot here. https://smartcrypto.gitbook.io/sidestepr/Or you could join us in the telegram: https://t.me/sidestepr_groupFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/SidesteprTrades",
