But of the seven points that you stated, only one point made me have to ask you again, because in my opinion these points were a little less suitable for me, although they could suit other people very well and I used to think that points were in third place too it suits me very well.But after I met more and more new people, not one of them would give me the best advice even if I asked for it. And what's even worse is that they also have the potential to corner me from behind so now I'm starting to limit myself to making more friends with new people even though I always meet new people every day, but some of them are not for me to make friends in life.",
