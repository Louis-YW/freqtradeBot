It was launched in March 2021 and named after the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Satozhi (SATOZ) has a maximum total supply of 21 million, with a current circulating supply of 10 million, which means that almost 50% of Satozhi's circulation has been burned using the PoB protocol. The PoB protocol allows users to burn their tokens to get mining rights and rewards. Every 10 minutes, 50 Satozhi are generated as rewards and distributed automatically and fairly among the burners, without any human intervention. Satozhi (SATOZ) aims to solve the problems of resource consumption and inefficiency that plague traditional coin mining methods, such as CPU, GPU, and ASIC mining. Satozhi (SATOZ) also offers various decentralized products, such as Virtual Minting Tool (VMT), which is a unique protocol that enables VMT creators to sell their work not only as a digital item or a single value, but also as a lifetime mining reward. Satozhi (SATOZ) can be traded on several markets, such as PancakeSwap, BitMart, Hotbit, Dodo BSC, and more to come. THE MORE YOU BURN, THE MORE YOU'LL RECIEVE.CONTRACT ADDRESS TO BUY IT IN PANCAKESWAP----------------->    0xf4341fa52669cea0c1836095529a7e9b04b8b88dBuying and selling tax fee = 0.1%current price is around 0.023$ . The devs are about to make the Ethereum bridge and develop its own blockchain which will called \"satoszcan\" which will be used to create other tokens using satozhi chain, so all the fee tax will be used to burn more satozhi, therefore reducing supply and making the coin more scarce.Below you can check out the links OFFICIAL WEBSITE : satozhi.comBURNING POOL WHERE YOU CAN BURN AND RECIEVE REWARDS LATER: https://pool.satozhi.finance/TWITTER:  https://twitter.com/satozhiofficialOfficial telegram   - https://t.me/satozhitokenSatozhi Chart: https://poocoin.app/tokens/0xf4341fa52669cea0c1836095529a7e9b04b8b88dCoinMarketCap link:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/satozhi/Security checking of satozhi: (PS: LIQUIDITY IS LOCKED FOR 77 YEARS on UniCrypt) https://i.ibb.co/C6c13CW/SATOZ-LOCKED-LIQUIDITY.jpgToken Sniffer security scan: https://tokensniffer.com/token/bsc/8zs0sf6z9oodf1unokekhbua9xfb6cv0kxh11nhd9qahijxsjuvjudfvgvc2https://gopluslabs.io/token-security/56/0xf4341fa52669cea0c1836095529a7e9b04b8b88dWith the consistency of burnings and the bull-marketing coming. this token might reach 100$ up to 1000$ due to low supply(just imagine having a 500.000 supply or 250.000 in the future). it is definitely not a shitcoin.I have made my bets on this project. I've been studying thousands of projects in the binance smart chain world and this one was the most profissional and serious project that can suceeed. and still, we're kind of lucky to be early at this price.

THE MORE YOU BURN, THE MORE YOU'LL RECIEVE.Ohh so its like you burn 40 of your tokens to get 50 freshly generated from the air. isn't that the same as locking/staking 40 tokens and getting 10 tokens every block as reward? the net result for supply is the same - +10 tokens per block. So the whole project is based on building a POS token (with an additional marketing layer designed to confuse investors) placed on the POS blockchain. So the whole project makes no sense.",

A little bit about this market, everyone understands it's worse than a shitcoin  .This market has a lot of different options and opportunities as well as a lot of risks, look in the mirror to see how your best friend has limited vision in this field, while there are many With a bunch of products with the idea of ​​a professional team as well as abundant capital and investors are still looking for a position in the market, many people put their negative beliefs on things that are really meaningless.Sincerely recommend that you use the capital you have to experience the basic information of this market as well as be more realistic when making any decision, wish you many opportunities than from crypto.",

Either they are anti about these types of coins or they are an investor it. For those who are anti, they think coins like this are a problem to the crypto space because they are mostly just money grabs. This is clearly a meme coin judging by its name because they don't have an originality. It is better that most of the supply got burned because you said they are only useless, so what is the purpose of them existing?",

Thanks for reading this long post.And I thought this token is already listed and supported by the Binance exchange because you've used the word Binance until I found out it's not listed on Binance and just using a Binance chain to hype this token, you are good at shilling a token you really need to hype this token because it is down 99% percent from his all-time high two years ago and there's a possibility that this token will go down the drain.I don't see usage-only features and we have so many of them in the market and the market is saturated with similar features.",

They list projects that generates high volume, no matter how shitty this project is just like they listed PEPE few days ago. SATOZ daily volume is below 1000$.They also list projects of which they are business angels or those who pay dearly.
