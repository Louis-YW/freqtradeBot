  "content": "Bitcoin started life as a means of thwarting government oversight into transactions. That's why Satoshi created it: for people who could not use normal means to transact for fear of prosecution by a government.In other words, the very creation of Bitcoin was \"anti-government\", and that was clearly the theme given to it by the Bitcoin community.As we've discussed here in the forums:1. Bitcoin absolutely could be taken over by a major world government forcibly.2. Short of an outright takeover of the network, a few words from the US president could send the price of Bitcoin down by 90% or more, and an act of the US Congress or an executive order by the US president could send the price of Bitcoin down by 99%.In this context, it's amazing that one of the biggest topics during this US election season here at Bitcointalk.org is... the US election season. In short, it would appear as though much of the Bitcoin community is begging for the government to help pump the price of Bitcoin.While we can debate the merits of this, I would start by saying just how amazing it is to see Bitcoin's evolution from being the darling of internet libertarians to... donating money like they are the old industry in search of special favors.As for the debate, I would simply point out how short-sighted it is to invite the government--specifically the US federal government--to \"help\" pump the price of Bitcoin using the power of US laws. Never in the history of business has any product gotten away with this without being heavily regulated. Why? Because the taxpayers are going to want a return on their investment. For every new Bitcoin millionaire minted by the government intervention people here seem to want, there will be a million Americans who didn't make a dime from Bitcoin--and they are going to want their slice of the pie.\"Live by the sword, die by the sword\" seems to apply here. Be careful what you wish for.",

While I suspect that 99% of people here saying they want Trump would want him regardless of his stance on Bitcoin (and vice-versa), what people are asking for here is government help for Bitcoin, e.g. forcing people to use it (\"legal tender\"), giving it a special status that no other financial product has, and asking the US government to make massive purchases of Bitcoin (\"strategic Bitcoin reserve\") as to prop up the price.In other words, people here begging for Trump and the \"Bitcoin Trump Pump\" are begging for something way beyond what we had in the last four years with a relatively unregulated market and that 500% appreciation of Bitcoin. For the people for whom 500% is not enough, they need special privileges given to their favorite investment, not just a simple free market.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on July 19, 2024, 06:49:26 PMMate I think you have some misconceptions about bitcoin and it inter connectedness to the government, I didn't mean to imply that Bitcoin is now connected to the government, I am merely asserting that is what people are asking for when they are asking for Trump to give Bitcoin a special status, have the US government purchase Bitcoin, etc.QuoteThere is alot of room for development and regulations in the cryptocurrency ecosystem if we ever want bitcoin to attain the mainstream global attention.I completely agree, and what many people don't understand is that regulations often drive the price of an asset way higher because mainstream consumers can feel safe to invest in it.Imagine if Trump were elected, he pardons SBF in exchange for half a billion dollars, and coordinates with his billionaire pals like Elon Musk to manipulate the Bitcoin market. You know what the average mainstream investor does when they see they this? They run the hell away. No average consumer wants to play this game because they know they will lose.",

If there's anything that the government can do to bring Satoshi from wherever he is, I think they would have done it just to make sure that they can control Bitcoin. Based on the past events and the latest, I know that the government is just plotting for any way that they can have full control over Bitcoin and, if possible, be able to regulate the price, and I don't think they're going to stop until they archive that. Which I don't think is very possible. @OP, I don't think any experienced Bitcoiner would gladly hope on the government for intervention on the Bitcoin price or whatever. What the people (bitcoiners: miners and investors) only want is a government that is favorable for them to carry out their bitcoining freely without so many strict and unfavorable rules.",

What else do the government have to do to actually stop this technology growing that they haven’t done yet. The major thing will be to ban mining, miners will move elsewhere what else. The pump that comes with positive news from this election is nothing less than people seeing that the adoption rate will increase because one country will fully embrace it, this is the same way the market pumps and dumps when other countries too also talk about bitcoin, it is not a US thing only",

I'm not saying Bided himself did that, only that he didn't not do anything to stop Bitcoin's rise.Under Biden, the Bitcoin ETF was approved, SBF was sent to prison, and the price of Bitcoin soared. Trump, on the other hand, promises massive changes to every aspect of American life. The smart business move here is to go with stability and the status quo, not massive change.

That was a relatively small blip compared to what the US president declaring Bitcoin to be outlawed, or substituting his own currency for Bitcoin, or really anything else that could threaten the stability of the market. The US represents a huge portion of the consumer investor interest in Bitcoin. If those people get scared, the price will plummet.And there is no \"relaxing\" of regulations since anybody in the USA can buy Bitcoin in a few minutes already. What this has to mean is that people want Bitcoin to be purchased by the US federal government to make the price go higher, or force American citizens to buy Bitcoin whether they want to or not. You can't \"relax\" regulations that are already as relaxed as they can be.Quote from: Iranus on July 20, 2024, 08:30:25 AMI know you're a Biden supporter and you're disappointed to see the majority of people starting to turn to Trump. I guess that's why this thread was created but there's also no way you can stop people from supporting Trump.Sure, and you are a Trump supporter, and I respect your political opinion. As for the polling, 538 has the race as a toss up right now, and they take a broad averaging of the polls. Trump is in the spotlight right now because of his being shot and the Republican convention, but the Democrats will have their time in the media in a few weeks as well--this is how US elections always work.This election is about Americans deciding whether abortion will be illegal or not. If the majority wants abortion to be illegal, then Trump will win. If they don't, Biden will win.",

But that doesn't mean they can make everything disappear just because they don't like it, if they could do that then I believe bitcoin wouldn't exist until now.Quote from: kryptqnick on July 20, 2024, 08:08:30 AMAlso, nobody is begging the US government to pump up the price. That's not how it works. People are rather excited that more relaxed crypto policies in the US may lead to a higher BTC price (and better opportunities for Bitcoin enthusiasts in the US).Frankly speaking, bitcoin has never needed any support from the US president and its growth is just a matter of time as the demand for it is also increasing day by day. People are excited and want a pro-bitcoin US president simply because we want the development of bitcoin to happen faster. Because with or without Trump's catalyst, the increase in bitcoin price will be inevitable and no one can stop it.",

I said drastically effect the price. The FTX fiasco dropped the price of Bitcoin by 60%--and that was a mere blip compared to what an official action of the US government would do to the market.2. As much as people seem to need to feel this, there's simply no evidence that the US or other major governments \"hate Bitcoin\" or secretly wish to abolish it. The US could pass laws banning Bitcoin anytime they wanted, yet they never did. This isn't because they couldn't, it's because Bitcoin Persecution Syndrome is just a figment of people's imaginations, or some marketing hype people apply to make Bitcoin seem more \"cool\" or something*.(* And they don't seem to understand that, for average consumer investors, saying the government is against an investment is not \"exciting\", it's risky and saying this actually makes Bitcoin go down in price[/b]).QuoteFrankly speaking, bitcoin has never needed any support from the US president and its growth is just a matter of time as the demand for it is also increasing day by day.

Biden being reelected will mean the market keeps going the way it has been going, which is to say great for Bitcoin. Trump promises massive changes to the US economy and daily life, which will had risk to the market and could make Bitcoin plunge in value.",
