Space Jump is a race that only requires players to register and purchase a space ship to participate, and is a virtual sport that has been transformed from one that exists only in science fiction to one that is unrestricted.In the virtual world of X-Metaverse, we used blockchain and NFT technology to build an optimal platform for it, creating Space Jump, a new way to play where people can buy, trade and race NFT space battleships on.‚õΩCreating HangarBefore you participate in Space Jump, you will need a Hangar for space battleships to berth.

In the experience field, you don‚Äôt need to consume XMETA to sign up, and of course, you won‚Äôt get XMETA for winning the game.In the match, space battleships will be assigned to 5 ranks from N to SSR according to the ranks of the battleships, and battleships of different ranks cannot compete together.Note: When a player signs up for a field that cannot be started after 30 minutes due to not enough people joining the match, that registered field will be automatically dissolved and the registration fee will be refunded back to your game account.
