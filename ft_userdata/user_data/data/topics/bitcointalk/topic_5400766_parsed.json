Quote1. wallet file downloaded to my computerIf your computer is still alive you can recover it, the file must be there.",

Make sure to run it offline for safety purposes.Copy the public key and check if it still has a balance you can use blockchair.com to check the wallet balance. If you are lucky then you are ready to sweep the private key to other wallets like Electrum.",

I also converted the 64 characters to hex format as a 512 bit string.checked the string hashed it, 256 512 etc.... This transaction was in 2010 so the established protocols that we have now were not widely adopted or were still in the experimental phase.

If it's not a hexadecimal string it's even more difficult to guess what could it be.I've seen this YouTube movie about buying Bitcoin for PayPal from CoinPal and the long string was the transaction ID which doesn't help much in recovering your funds (you can only find from there your address and the content of it).Maybe you have more information in your e-mail?Since you said \"custody\", there may be that you've used some custodian web wallet. I've found on Reddit some names, maybe they'll help you remember something, but those are long gone, together with your money (since in a custodian system you have an account, they have your money)Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4j0xjx/list_of_early_webbased_bitcoin_wallets/d32q7t9/?context=3Most, if not all, vanished along the way. There was MyBitcoin, Instawallet, Bitcoinica, MtGox, BitFloor, Cryptoxchange and at least a few others. Some were just wallets and some were exchanges as well that people often mistakenly used as wallets.",

There was no email record of the transaction, the payment was transferred via paypal and then a wallet was created. If you already had a wallet you had an option of having the bitcoins transferred to that wallet by inputting the word list or a private key, if not then it created the wallet and gave a list of words, a file download of the wallet and a string of characters as I mentioned in my first post.The code that I have is for the first purchase that I made. The website created a wallet and then a few days later,  to test the whole thing, I made a smaller purchase and used the wordlist so that the coins would be in that wallet. At the time, I had no way of checking if it actually worked because i never downloaded the bitcoin program.I made other purchases after and created new wallets,  but the records for those are long destroyed.On the page that gave the wordlist and code string there was a thank you message and an explanation of what the to do with the wordlist and what the code was for but I did not take note of it.",

Given the very early period and the fact that Bitcoin has existed for just over 1 year, I don't think anyone who wanted a non-custodial wallet had a problem downloading the Bitcoin core considering that the size of the blockchain was far smaller than it is today.Quote from: monkiest on June 01, 2022, 06:06:06 AMThere were probably only a few hundred active members of this community back in 2010 that are still active now.There are not many members who were here in 2010 and are still active today, and of those who are recognizable, I found 2-3 such profiles. You can look at BPIP and try to find someone from that time who is still active. Someone probably traded BTC in the way you described, but unfortunately most of those who answered you in this thread came to the forum much later and have nothing to do with that time.A person who might know more about this is one of the founders of this forum, but has not been active for a long time - you can try to contact him via his Twitter - https://twitter.com/marttimalmi",
