If the price stays where it is, the mines that are just scraping by now are going to have to close.The ones that are doing OK, may have some issues staying profitable but with some players dropping out difficulty may decrease giving them a boost in profits.We also do not know what new hardware is on the horizon, we have a general idea but no specifics.

When you are just about breaking even, but you do it because you want to support BTC and spread the hashrate out. That's fine. If all of a sudden it's costing you $150 a month to keep your small farm running, along with the time and effort and noise and so on. You might just turn it off and sell the miners and get back into golf.-Dave",

      "body": "With things leaning towards a brighter future for bitcoin's price, at least following bitcoin's patterns during every halving where it pumps in price, one can safely assume that the mining industry will become even more profitable and you might see new faces by then, but as other people have pointed out, if the price stays the same as it is right now which is very much a possibility, a lot of small-time bitcoin miners will definitely have a herculean time staying afloat, some may even close up shop for good, which also means well for the second-hand gaming community since that only means more cheap GPUs to forage. In any case as of now there's no definitive answer as to what would happen to bitcoin and to mining if the halving comes, but one thing's for sure, halving or not the difficulty of mining depends greatly upon the valuation of bitcoin as well as how in-demand it is.",

In the future there is a possibility that mining machine company sellers might release more energy-saving miners with more hashing power that can trim down the maintenance cost and at the same time boost it mining capability.  Or the price of electricity might get expensive due to the depletion of natural resources, or the price of Bitcoin getting stuck to where it is due to not enough catalyst to trigger a price increase.  There are lots of variable factors that can happen i that can keep us unsure of what will happen in the future.Quote from: LDL on April 11, 2023, 01:14:12 PMHow Bitcoin Mining Relates to the Bitcoin Halving of 2024/28 and What Will Bitcoin Mining Be Profitable By Then?It relates to mining profitability.  Bitcoin halving means the reward is reduced to half.  And it means a lesser reward for miners.  If the price as I said, doesn't catch up with the halving, then miners may end up losing.  We might see many miners shutting down which may cause difficulty to reduce and mining Bitcoin may cost lower and the new lower difficulty may give miners a good chance to profit.  So at the end there will be a natural adjustment  like 1. Miners quitting due to losses mining in high difficulty, 2. Difficulty adjustment due to mining hash going down as a result of miners quitting.3. Lower difficulty makes mining less expensive4. Remaining Miners getting profit due to lower difficulties.At the end when all is adjusted,  miners will eventually get a profit assuming that the price either does not change or uptrend.",

I think you're mistaking Bitcoin mining and altcoin mining. Even if somebody mines BTC with GPU right now, they're probably trying to do lottery mining, if that is even possible. Even if you can do it, the price of GPU has been decreasing steadily since those price increases comes from the ETH mining boom a few years ago. At the very least, you can find cheap AMD secondhand cards nowadays, since their latest release has been discounted so often nowadays. Anyone who wants to buy cheap GPUs is probably buying right now regardless of what happened to BTC halving.",

Anyone who wants to buy cheap GPUs is probably buying right now regardless of what happened to BTC halving.I think so. There was a time when people could mine Bitcoin using CPUs. That was the genesis blocks time. Bitcoin Mining with a GPU is impossible right now. No GPU minable algorithm is profitable anymore (except for a few latest model GPUs) since the ETH Moved the POS update. I have a couple of Polaris cards, which are unprofitable. According to Whattomine.com, If I start Mining again with my 10 Rx 580, I will lose $2 a day. Who wants to do that? Even a 3090Ti makes $0.08 Profit a day. A 4070Ti makes $0.38 a day. Only Good Profitable GPU is the latest one. If you have 4090, You can make $0.92 a day max with the CryptoNightGPU algorithm. A 4090 price is around $2000 right now, which will take six years to ROI. In these six years, maybe the CryptoNightGPU algorithm will be unprofitable. So, Investing in GPU mining is a loss project. It seems I am going a bit off-topic. But, The moral is, You cannot use Mine Bitcoin with GPU anymore.",

My question may have been answered elsewhere on the forum but in case it hasn't.. What happens when all 21 million BTC are mined or when mining becomes unprofitable? I assume due to energy costs and computational power.I hear people say that BTC will crash in value when this happens. I wonder why that is. My logics tell me that 18 million coins are more rare than 21 million coins and thus they will keep their value.And secondly, what happens if/when governments forbid all conversion of currency to BTC in order to keep the financial system alive, and prevent a monetary collapse by not allowing a run to BTC? If they succeed in taking down the exchanges (currently there are lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase) I don't see how there could be mass adoption of BTC. I don't think that mining problems can kill the value of BTC. But taking down the exchanges can, as there can't be more influx of money into BTC.Correct me if this is flawed",

You are more likely to be correct than wrong, in fact, as it stands right now, I doubt home miners make have any significant share of the total hashrate, I'd give them 5% if I were to be very generous, the harder things become, the lower that percentage will be regardless of the overall hashrate drop, larger cooperate miners have many advantages over the small miner.The above changes only when a serious ban on large U.S cooperates miners happen, sometime that would wipe out nearly 50% of the total hashrate, home miners all over the world will find it easier to make a profit, however, I don't see such thing happening in the near future.",
