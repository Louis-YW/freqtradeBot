  "content": "The foundation of the Bitcoin network is bitcoin mining. Bitcoin transactions are confirmed and secured by miners. The network would be under attack and unusable without bitcoin miners.Since it is currently not possible to mine Bitcoin with a standard computer or laptop particularly profitably, you will definitely need a special piece of hardware called an ASIC.Bitcoin miners realized that graphic cards could provide extra hashing power. Graphic cards were surpassed by ASICs.Integrated Circuits with Specific Applications: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuitConsider a Bitcoin ASIC to be specialized Bitcoin mining hardware, such as Bitcoin mining computers or \"bitcoin generators.\" All significant Bitcoin mining these days is performed on specialized Bitcoin mining hardware ASICs, usually in thermally-controlled data-centers with low energy consumption.For this reason I have saved 5 best mining hardware according to my opinion. Hope you choose the best mining hardware.Antminer S19Antminer S19 ProWhatsMiner M30S+Whatsminer M30S++Canaan AvalonMiner 1246Comparison of Bitcoin Mining Hardware.

The other thing is that units from Bitmain are a bit expensive compared to Canaan units I don't know about Whatsminer or MicroBT it seems I can't access their website anymore and I think it is more expensive than Bitmain and Canaan units. Why not add the price from your Comparison so that it would be more useful to newbies who found this thread?",

If it is still possible please add estimated price tags to improve the quality of this topic.",

Do you use the list from another website as mentioned by bitmax, or is there another source for it? I think you can also add how easy it is to buy them for overseas miners (outside EU or US) for example, so your list can be more distinct compared to others.",

Antimners or Canaan?Canaan are WAY more reliable then Bitmain. BUT, dollar for hash and power for hash they are a little less efficient. It really becomes tough call with a lot of variables, if you have inexpensive power that you think will stay that way for a long time, then the Canaan are probably a better buy.If you can't be sure of your power costs down the road then a bit cheaper machine that is a bit faster might serve you better since you stand a better chance of RoI and profit.With that being said, anything can happen, the 17 series from Bitmain was a disaster for a lot of people. I have one in a rack that was out of the 1st or 2nd batch running with no issues since it was dropped off.-Dave",

And why the hell would the S19 (95Th) be ranked number one right now? Viabtc has a $ 0.075 per Th/s, the gear will earn you $7.12 while burning 78 kWh with no loss or fluctuation or cooling, at 9cents per kWh you're just running it at zero profit, at 3 cents you're looking at 5$. Why would this 34.5J/T be ranked first?",
