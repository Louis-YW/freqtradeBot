There is no best indicator or strategy anywhere, though you might have your personal best indicator, it will only be with you as the one that works best for you, not for everybody. Also, the last website you uploaded (the one of Patreon) is not working, maybe it's there because you want to sell something, I don't know.You could do better by explaining your strategy in a way people would understand and giving simple guides and links to the resources to download in using it.",

Indicators help the trader indefinitely in trading and the most commonly used by all traders are Moving Average and trading volume. These indicators give us a real picture of the market if the trading volume data is not falsified.",

I'm not sure if you wait for 2 bullish divergence before entering a trade for long. Since the title of this thread best trading indicator, what's the difference of that indicator you're using and the RSI. Because RSI can also tell a divergences like what you have said in the video. By the way, if you're only doing a trade in that way, I would refuse to believe that you're profitable because there's best way of using the divergences in trading.",

I think it's more realistic if you have provided more information or posted your PnL, winrate or something that proves that this indicator/s of yours really works, not just some links and words that it is the best.",

Because no matter how hard it is for you to measure using indicators, it will still be based on news and market conditions. So in my opinion there is no best indicator, they are all the same, depending on how we use it and don't rely too much on it.",

For traders, if you have a trading indicator that works for you, there is no need moving to another because it was called the best. You have to see features of why it has been called the best, compare it with what you use before deciding to make a switch.",

Anyone that follows you will end up losing his fund. I doubt you are making profit because if the indicator is working as you tried to hyped it, the high leverage you are using will blow up your account faster than saying Jack robison.",

You know that crypto is not just an overnight where after 24 hours everyone knows it at once, of course, its not like that. Then indicators in my opinion will only give confusion to the newbies in the crypto space as well. And besides that, in my years here, I have never tried to use an indicator even though I always base it on the chart or graph where the price of Bitcoin is headed for example.",
