Humans are not ants but we can learn a few things from the way they behave. Even the Holy Bible encouraged us to go to the ants and learn from themAnts are not selfish because they inform others if they see any food item. They come together and gather the food and store it. Humans will hide their source of income and will want only them to be rich. Some will even be pleased to see others suffer even when they have means of making them earn some money.Ants are team players because they work with a unity of purpose. It is rare to see ants fighting each other because they are together in peace and unity. Humans are always disagreeing and in conflict with each other. There are people you can never work with because they are not team players.Ants are always focused. If they want to achieve a goal they will pursue it till the end. They are not easily distracted by circumstances. Even if they are distracted after some time they will continue with the task. Even if you kill some, others will just carry the dead and the task will continue.Ants are determined and persistent: Ants will always put their problems aside and continue their task. If you destroy their habitation, after a little time they come together organize, and rebuild the home.Ants are good planners. They gather in the dry season so that they can use it in the rainy season when it will be difficult for them to move around to get food. Some humans are wasters and don't have plans for the future.",

      "body": "Proverbs 6 vs 6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard, Consider her ways, and be wise. 7.which having no guide, overseer or ruler, 8.provideth her meat in the summer,and gathered her food in the harvest. these are the verses God in the holy Bible advised we see if we want to fight poverty. Ant is the only thing God described as wise. Not even Human being, God has given everything for Human to enjoy, he uses the Ant to encourages hard work, and planning. the Ant has no ruler, but they work as team to achieve everything, with love and trust. This implies that God never wanted us to give excuses over the ruler of the world, regardless of their evil plans, if we work in love and honesty would all survived and never feel the evil plan of the leaders.The Ant are good planner, the practice food security in their kingdom. they save food doing the summer to prepare for the raining season. as human we must learn how to save money no matter how little it might be.the ant is my master, that's why i don't kill them.",

Op if  understand you, what you implies is that, as human being we ought to be more organized as the animal with the higher brain. bur we are not as organized as the Ant, which i agree with you, no doubt we think more than the Ant and any other animals, but when it comes to the Ant, there are special wisdom we human being have to learn from their ways of living and planning, just as God said, we should go to the Ant to learn if we want to be wise,(proverbs6v6) God knows why he said we should go to the ant to learn how to be wise, because he created everything with special gift and importance.the Ant brain are always thinking about togetherness and cooperation, while the human brain are full of greed and division, now one cares about the good of the society, its just individuals want and needs. At the end those needs are unsatisfiable, this is where the Ant brain is higher than human, they share everything little things they got without any ruler, but human with rulers are still struggling to work in oneness.",
