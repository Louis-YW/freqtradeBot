  "content": "A friend contacted me yesterday for some loans, which I declined (with some excuses) because I knew he really had no means of fast repayment. After some time, he called again and requested that I buy his refrigerator or his washing machine instead. Although I don't have a washing machine, but I had no interest in buying anything at that moment, so I contacted another of my friend who bought the refrigerator and the washing machine from that guy.It's not a surprise that sometimes we find ourselves in emergencies that really require some funds to solve the problem at hand. We all know that life treats everyone differently depending on the country, city, or village in which they find themselves. You can't blame anyone or say it's a result of bad budgeting plans or inability to save for emergencies.I just decided to put this up here to see what you guys think about it. If you are in a situation that requires some funds immediately, would you go for a loan or would you sell one of your properties to solve the problem? And which of them is a better option, to sell property or to take a loan?",

      "body": "None of them really seams like a good idea to me. Although I think I would choose the idea of selling a property over taking a loan, because I seriously, I don't like worrying about having to pay back a loan I've borrowed. I tend to avoid anything that has to do with loan seriously. But when it comes to selling properties , there are properties I wouldn't like to sell, I will be very picky about it. Maybe things I don't need anymore , I can choose to sell those. But it's best to work hard and have your own money, although we never can tell the challenges that life throws our way next, let's keep hoping for the better.",

      "body": "With you knowing that the person doesn't have any means of repayment for the main time, which is a bad sign for anyone to lend out to such a person looking at it from an economic perspective, But I don't see the idea of allowing your friend to sell a few of his properties in order to solve his or her problem as a wise decision. Since you are not in need of any of those properties, and even if you are providing that he is someone close to you, you will not want to buy his property; it might make you appear to look bad in the eyes of others. It could have been a good idea if you could have held those sold-out properties as collateral in exchange for the amount needed. If you don't like it, such an idea could also have been given to the person you called to purchase those properties. In situations like this, there are higher chances of the needy selling the property for a very lesser amount compared to what the market price will be because of how desperate and urgent he needed the funds. Holding the property will enable him to hustle for the money and come get them back in the near future when they have solved their pressing issues. If I'm to be in any situation like this, I prefer borrowing and using my property as collateral rather than selling it. It's better to use it as collateral and try hard to get the money for repayment, and if things don't work out, then I know I have tried rather than just selling them off. Well, this is just my own way of doing things, as I am not a fan of selling personal belongings, no matter how hard the situation is.",

Borrowing is better with the intention that you'll also sell your goods asap to pay off the loan. However, avoiding loans and debt is the average person's top choice.",

If the need for money is not too great and can be obtained by selling one of the properties that we have at home, maybe that is the best way to borrow money. But if the need for money is very large and it's not enough if you just sell the property in the house, maybe borrowing is the solution.But some people don't want to sell the property in their house but instead borrow money from their friends but after that, they forget to borrow the money. In this case, I've had this experience enough times where my friend needs $30, for example, and he will repay the loan next month when he gets his salary. But the truth is he forgot about it. And even though I asked him, he just said he didn't have the money yet.I might sell my property to get the money instead of borrowing because I'm afraid I won't have the money when it comes to paying. It will be safer for me because I am not bearing any debt.",

And which of them is a better option, to sell property or to take a loan?To answer this question, I think that it's better to try looking for a loan first because selling your property seems kind of like a desperate measure or you need the money so badly, some aren't even selling their stuff directly, most if not all are pawning them off hoping that they can get back to it again. I think loan's much better than selling because you're removing a function in your house if you were selling appliances compare that to a loan where you don't give away something valuable besides your reputation and integrity as a borrower.",

And which of them is a better option, to sell property or to take a loan?It completely depends on the situation and the individual financial circumstances of the person really. If somebody has fallen on tough times, like losing their job, then they may need some short term cash until the next paycheck comes in if they've been unable to save any money for this sort of emergency. If they are honest on their loan application then they may be rejected immediately because the loan provided needs to know that repayments can take place. That leaves you without the option to take a loan and may force people to sell their other assets, out of desperation. If a person is struggling in such a scenario and you want to help, you need to figure out if it's temporary misfortune or the sign of a bigger problem you may not be able to help like drug addiction.",

The person in the story above is even better having acquired a refrigerator and washing machine, not that they're expensive items but a struggling person will never have such gadgets. There are challenges and circumstances that are actually above your earning and savings combined sometime and you have no option than to to deal with it.As for me, I don't like anything debt and I prefer to have nothing than to be owing someone.

But, planning also helps us to outpace such a fast approaching hard experience; running out of funds. Selling items doesn't count neither does borrowing work, as it'll fade off. They're many other ways to get through tough situations. Although not everyone has the facilities or skills that can take them through hard times. Improving situation like you said can mean improving social skills, those we see everyday are our best tools in life. Calling people who are far away for help most times dont provide immediate help compared to close friends who live in the same neighborhood, and understands, first hand, our situation. I'd also add that Op didn't help his friend because he doesn't see him. Seeing can mean love, in similar format those that we see on daily basis we tend to love, naturally. Hence, OP's friend if he has the social skills he would have taken the advantage of the people around him and ask for their help instead of calling his friend in a far place.",
