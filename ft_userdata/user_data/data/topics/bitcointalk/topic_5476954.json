Are you referring to your own bitcoin? Or is it the same Bitcoin we all know created by Satoshi Nakamoto that your are referring as not having a loss in regards to day to day trading? Because inasmuch that Bitcoin isn't he best asset to invest your funds for long term, it does mean on a day to day basis it's value do not rises and fall, depending on the nature of the market for the day.QuoteAs days goes on, it is the only coin which has 100% of gain. It seems you are referring to a different bitcoin, and not the Bitcoin we all know which is forum is created for, because when we say a coin goes 100% in gain, it simply means the coin double in price, that is for example, maybe a coin was worth $5 and it skyrocketed to $10, who h means it's gone 100% in gain, which BitcoinÂ  gotten such gain for quite a long while.",

So if the OP or others bought around that price, then they could be sitting like 130%++ profits already. But for those who bought and fomo during the last bull run and bought at $60k, they are still in the negative.And if we look at the last all time high, we are still -37.04% as per coinmarketcap.So in order for everyone to enjoy financial growth, then we will have to see and wait what will be the bull run price next year till 2025. Long way to go for us to make that huge profit that we all are dreaming, ATH of $100k or more.",

They might have just heard the word Bitcoin, but in reality, they don't have any significant knowledge of what Bitcoin is. Some people don't have proper knowledge about Bitcoin; they invest because of FOMO, and if things don't go as they intend to, they impatiently sell off because of price volatility. The fact that the price is still surging doesn't mean it's usually like that all the time, so it's better that investors have concrete knowledge of Bitcoin for them to make a successful investment.",

If you don't have much money I will advice to invest on other alternative coins, the type of gains someone who have only $1000 to invest in Bitcoin last year won't be the same as someone who invested the $1000 into Solana, do the math.Even Ordinals which was trading for $3.4 in 2022 is now up $60, this would have given you a superior gains over investing in Bitcoin, the thing is Bitcoin is more reliable and safer than other investments, but profit wise it's not as great as other crypto currencies.",

Although with bitcoin there's a huge chance for us to earn since there are lots of positive things happening and this is the most reliable crypto in the market.Â  Its just we need to know on how we can handle the risk so that we can smoothly invest on bitcoin without worrying on the fuds scattered by any institution who want to manipulate the market.Bitcoin is really promising currency we could have and it has limited supply so its really good if we have holdings for long term purposes so that we will not missed any golden chances especially if price of bitcoin goes up in future.",

I remember during the end of 2017 there were many newbie who praised crypto and Bitcoin in general and invested during peak when it was over $20k and then as soon as bear run started they sold at very lesser price and started talking bad about Bitcoin when it dropped below $5k though Bitcoin recovered and reached $69k but people still said bad thing and lost their money because they were not prepared for bear market. Just be prepared to face both the sides of crypto and apart from Bitcoin no other Altcoin can pump back everytime after bear market.
