Being there is not a sign of legitimacy of course, but exchange not being there at all is a major red flag. At least for me.By the way, how did you even hear about this exchange, what made you use it when there are so many solid choices if you don't mind going through KYC? And if they suddenly ask you for more money in order to get your deposit out, you can be 100% sure that its a scam.",

I visited the site and the design does not seem so professional that you need to manually refresh the page to update the prices.

They have so many scam exchanges listed there. Some even fake trading volumes through wash trading to look legitimate.Newbie sees HitBTC on Reddit, Newbie rushes to CMC to check if HitBTC is listed there and on finding out it's listed then he thinks it's legit because someone told him if an exchange appears on CMC. Then it must be legit.I have been engaging with newbies so many times, even recently when teaching them about Bitcoin, trading and exchanges. Different people have different levels of perceiving and understanding things. If you were a little sharp as a newbie doesn't mean someone else will be, the same  Secondly, I know some exchanges that are legitimate and don't even appear on CMC. Does that make them scam? Did they forget to scam me when I used some of them?",

Did they forget to scam me when I used some of them? Obviously not, but we need some way to at least see what options are available. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko serve that purpose just fine. After that, it's up to you to carry out more research and pick what you think is good. There are dangers in all popular ways people look for new crypto exchanges. Looking on CMC or CG is one of them. Listening to so-called YouTube influencers and self-proclaimed \"trading experts\" is another. Asking google and trusting its suggestions also. And some people trust social media recommendations or reviews found over the internet. DYOR will always be necessary.",

Suppose the platform team did not pay you. In that case, I am sure that you opened an account and deposited your money on this unknown exchange platform because of the free crypto withdrawal fees that this platform provides as an advantage to attract potential customers, it is undoubtedly a trap, but have you asked yourself why other popular and reputable exchanges in the market did not make the fees-free for customers and why did this exchange platform do so without others? This indicates they are scammers because no other platform can provide such huge financial liquidity for zero networking fees.",
