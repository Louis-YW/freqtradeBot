Well, you need to pay attention that not everyone has the same type of cellphone as you.In addition, if it is not updated again, it will look like in the case of switching from Blockfolio to FTX and it will be very vulnerable to hacking or unauthorized access.",

      "body": "It look like you really liked using Blockfolio before. but now it do not work for you anymore. I can understand that you just want to find another app that will do similar things like blockfolio which were giving services like checking different types of cryptocurrencies giving alerts when prices changing and keep track of your transactions. One app you may try CoinStats. It work on Apple phones and have much features like showing the current prices of different cryptocurrencies. You can set alerts for price changes and can help you to track of your transactions. It also work with altcoins so you can keep an eye on your favorite coins. I will say you should check this application this will give a good experience or even better experience as compare to Blockfolio.",

Because, as far as I know, this app is not also browser-friendly. Now, when it comes to the portfolio you are talking about, I am not familiar with that either. But I seem to have seen that in Facebook ads.  Then there are many other options for price alerts about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency; there are crypto.com, Coingecko, coinmarketcap, and Gecko Terminal on the Dex platforms.",

You don't necessarily need an iPhone, to get updates on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, these two are the best apps, when it comes to anything that relates to crypto affairs.",

If there are no such applications, there should be analogues in the appstore, we are waiting for the opinion of Apple supporters, sometimes I really want to switch to their products, and this question will also arise in my mind.",

So I find coinmarketcap more comfortable and always use it. no matter the operating system of the mobile, cmc supports all operating systems.  And the app that op is talking about to be honest i am not aware of that app.",
