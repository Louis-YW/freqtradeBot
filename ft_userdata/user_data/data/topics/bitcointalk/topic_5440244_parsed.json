Well, your website is quite simple but too much simplicity to the point that it's not attractive anymore.Try to pick those tips that have been mentioned to you if you're still interested in making your site better. You're still starting out and it will be your hardest battle because beginning's are always the hardest part.",

Anyway, OP, I am quite confused at first which it made me think that your website is a gambling sites like a casino after reading a part of the title before I was able to read all of it. TLDR; I checked the website and base on the title of each one of it is good like the Top 7 Sports Betting Mistakes and I definitely agree with this one \"Chasing loses\". I think that most of the gamblers didn't even manage to complete that which is to recover all the loses. Well, I think some people may have done it or did it after winning very very huge amount. I am sure if you research then you will surely find that there are people who won huge amount and maybe that amount may have recovered all of the loses. Who knows if that person is tracking his/her funds and how much money is gambled and how much money won.",

Please keep the suggestions coming!Think more about innovations instead of putting too much ads and promotional links on this site, you need first to build your reputation so better to think for your edge compare to the other site. Its also good to see a constructive reviews about the site you are going to share, gambler want’s to know more about fairness, security and the games being offered on every site.",

These are crucial pages a website should have regardless of the stage, so far it's been launched. The background color is excellent for the kind of articles you publish. Don't think your site is too young not to be reached out to by people or clienteles. That's why you should always tell people your aim, why the website is launched then drop a contact detail that'll lead people easily to you.

There are a lot of platforms that you can review. You can start reviewing from the most popular one, that might also provide you with more traffic.You can buy a domain and switch your blog later one once you start getting enough visits and when you realize that your website/blog is getting some organic views and visits.",

Best of luck!I just checked it and I see that the site is already secure. That's a good start. This was one of the important things when building a site because when someone sees that \"your connection is not secure\" phrase, they will immediately doubt it and will refrain from accessing it further. My impression about the site is I like how it's designed.It's kinda simple and that dark theme mode is so calming in my eyes but I don't think so if they will follow your suggestion of reviewing a casino because their site clearly states that they are only focused on sports betting but for that, we already have tons of websites sites who reviews a crypto casino.",

Additionally, he needs to know his keyword research to enable his articles rank for the keywords he is targeting thereby boosting his traffic from google search. Given a few months, practicing all the valuable advice shared on this thread, newly launched casinos would be contacting Op for promotions.
