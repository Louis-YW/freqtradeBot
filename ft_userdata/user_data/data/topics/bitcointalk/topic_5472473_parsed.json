  "content": "Be careful if you use the Strike app. Seems like some users have been getting phishing emails that looked like they were from the company.  At first Strike was refusing to admit and claimed no leak from their side. But I guess they did some more digging, cause now they sent out a message admitting it might've come from one of their third-party vendors.

I have never users this service before; but its good that the news have gotten out, it should help those that are using the service become more cautious of how the interacts with mails coming in; because if those that have access to the leaked mail have any ill intentions they might be able to use them. And for those that are using unique email for the service that is they created an email address specifically for that service then they might be able to change it and then discard the previous one to avoid any mistakes but those that do share their emails with other services should be cautious.",

      "body": "It's honestly sad to see so many major services close to bitcoin end up leaking user information. If someone's not careful they could end up losing money in the phishing attempt thinking they're sending money to a brand they trust, or even worse get hacked by unauthorized access due to their leaked credentials. That's why when I interact with crypto services I try to use email aliases. I've found that email.com allows for up to 10 aliases that don't give out your real email but I think I'll end up needing something more advanced real soon too. It's worth exploring email alias solutions if you're interacting with  accounts that hold funds. Never give out your \"safe\" communication emails to random services because things like this could happen or perhaps even worse...",

Over the past months, I think we have seen more of an attack on some of the major service providers, which seem to have a large number of customers, but only a few have recorded financial losses. It's always about data being stolen. What is the essence of these people's stealing of this data? Or they are just, to some point, trying to check out how effective their hacking tools are. This is one of the reasons why we always advise using one email for one particular site, so that when you receive an authorised email from an unknown sender, you will know where you are getting a data breach from, even without any warning from the service provider. I currently no longer open emails, and I don't know why the senders talk more about clicking on links that the email might come with. This is for security reasons.",

But I would agree that there are a lot of phishing lately on some major service providers related to crypto. And it was mostly to this kind of leaked from 3rd party.And it's hard to trust this 3rd party with the kind of hacks that is happening right now. I mean they are being hired to take care of one job and that is to protect the identity of their clients. If they can't do that then who will?This could be just one example though so in the next couple of months we will hear another phishing emails so everyone be careful on what we click and not trust anything without any verification.",

Are they still investigating this matter? I hope they are truthful when they claim that there hasn't been any security breach. However, it might be the best solution for users to transfer their assets from the Strike app so things can be clarified in the coming days.Thank you, OP, and I hope that there are no victims who lost their money in this scam operation. Everyone should be cautious and verify any message they receive, as they could be traps made by scammers.",

Members here who have any thing doing with them should apply caution while dealing  otherwise they just might feel reluctant giving you your money citing that period.Third parties are never safe for anything  to guarantee their clients 100% safety and security which I think is the least they can vouch for your assets. They  don't give a damn thought of your assets and are rarely responsive to customers plight but they make high profit from their actions.",
