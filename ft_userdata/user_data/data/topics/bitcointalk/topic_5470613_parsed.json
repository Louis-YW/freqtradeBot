If more people can buy, maybe the adoption would have been greater than this if inflation continues the way it is. The main reason for the increase in crypto adoption is the continuous declination in naira value and because some Nigerians see bitcoin as an investment.Quote from: She shining on October 17, 2023, 01:16:29 AMI know that one's opportunity can be another's threat. Is the continuous fall beneficial to crypto traders or its just a trap?It dopends on the coins that you have. If you have a shitcoin and it become a dead coin or its value do not rise, that means there is no difference, or having your money on the coin may make the value of your money to decrease. If it is coin a like bitcoin which is a hedge against inflation, you have nothing to be worried about when its price is still undervalued as of now.Quote from: She shining on October 17, 2023, 01:16:29 AMDoes the benefit from the market compensate for the cost of living?The advise is that you should get a business, or have a means of earning. Investment should not be what to be used to determine cost of living.",

I believe currently holders of coins before Tinubu's rule has experienced a great deal of profit with Naira falling in relation to Dollar.Both the unemployment rate and the inflation rate are both contributing to the adoption of Bitcoin in the country, the unemployment rate dey make the youths pick interest in the industry as they find ways to make a living for demselfs. The unemployment rate they make the youths go into trading and investing to use survive but also the inflation rate they contributions as people wey get money dey find means to protect their wealth against the deflation of the Naira. Inflation rate na number one reason why unemployment fit be two with other reasons like the increase in international business, Remittance payments and so on.QuoteI know that one's opportunity can be another's threat. Is the continuous fall beneficial to crypto traders or its just a trap? Personally what are your thoughts on this? Does the benefit from the market compensate for the cost of living?It can't be a trap unless you dey trade directly with Naira but we know say immediately the Naira stars to dey fall, e no dey stop and looking at the country there's no movement of a policy been introduced to strength the Naira. Even if the naira stop to dey fall, you can still make your profits from crypto trading so it can't be a trap, you shouldn't be trading Bitcoin against the naira but other currency and also cryptocurrency. When you wan trade your profits to naira you get double profits due to the Naira depreciating and your profits now been worth more then when naira stabilize you still get your normal profit from trading Bitcoin or other cryptocurency but only do this if you have the knowledge on trading. Trading should be your side hustle, as a trader nobi everytime wey you go dey benefit from the market. You supposed get other hustle wey go dey pay you steady income like salary job and na dat one you supposed to dey use for your cost of living.",

Does the benefit from the market compensate for the cost of living?Of a truth the rise in cryptocurrency adoption is someworth associated with the fact that people are looking for other alternative means of survival. Bitcoin as seen as an investment could be taken as a such alternative means because one can trade on it on daily basis to generate  revenue or profit for themselves and in other words, they can buy and hold for a very long term so as to rake in profit when the price goes up as it meets their profit target.I do not think the continuous fall in naira can be or stand to be a trap to crypto traders. Naira fall has nothing to do with crypto trading but rather the policies enacted by the government to strengthen the economy of the nation to help give  strong base for the naira to regain its value. Just as  CryptopreneurBrainboss has opined, it can only be a trap when one decides to trade crypto directly with the naira against the CBN policies but as a sharp trader you are, you need not worry as it is in your own advantage because you trade in bitcoin not nair and convert to usdt for those who cares and off to the p2p market you go to finalize your sales.",

Unemployment doesn't necessarily mean No job, it can be a situation where one performs a job he or she is overqualified for. The need to earn more as a side hustle brings about investment, which in turn Bitcoin.If a country has high population like Nigeria and the government give a favorable environment for bitcoin and other crypto adoption, many Nigerians will be involved in crypto adoption generally. You can see how many people can invest in ponzi schemes, even in developed countries which has nothing to do with employment. Ponzi scheme is not good but I just used it as an example. Anywhere there is money and people see that if they invest, they will make money, people will invest in such a thing. That is bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies for you. As long as Nigerians heard about something like that, many people among them are involved is something like that already which has nothing to do with employment or unemployment.As for trading, I wish there are many traders among us up to 5000 people and let us do a survey about people that are making it from crypto trading, you will be disappointed with the result.In countries like United States, you can not compare them with Nigeria if the nominal value of the money they have in cryptocurrencies is compared with Nigeria, they have many ways they earn from cryptocurrencies, some people among them launch new coins and tokens, they have employments pertaining to cryptocurrencies et cetera. Is that related to unemployment? As long as people see job and opportunity in something, employment or not, they are going there. Nigerians are numerous. In a numerous nation, you know how this can be.Quote from: She shining on October 17, 2023, 04:19:12 PMWait Bitcoin and naira pair dey exist?

The reasons I see more for the adoption are devaluation of naira and crypto means of investment. There are developed countries with high employment rate that well adopted cryptocurrencies.",

The developed countries with booming economic situation are far fetched from unemployment and are open to innovations hence their adoption of Bitcoin and alternative means of investment so they could get profit from their holdings. They otherwise see Bitcoin as a means of measurement and store of assets value.",

As of today the major reason to why people dey actually hold and use Bitcoin sef na base on the principle say e go fit generate profit for them if them hold for long and Nigerians too no exception for this idea as I believe say this too na one of the reasons for the massive adoption in the country plus the fact about wonderful experience people actually got from airdrop and big and temporary pumps from some of the rapidly grow altcoins in the crypto space.",

But the amount of goods and services that $100 can buy or pay for in the past 10 years, the same $100 can not pay for it as of today.Bitcoin is undervalued right now and it is an appreciative asset, store of value and a hedge against inflation in long term and it would be the best for now when its price is still low.Quote from: Agbamoni on October 18, 2023, 07:07:06 AMSeriously if dollar increase pass like this e no go too make sense o because ill naira go they loose more value compared to other countries.Since naira was created in 1973, has the value gone up before against dollar?

This is not the only reason and I don't think it's the main reason why Cryptocurrency adoption is increasing in Nigeria, I see it that, the increase in the adoption rate of cryptocurrency in Nigeria has come from the fact cryptocurrency as been a way for alot of people all over the world to liberate from financial struggles aside from the other benefits with it not withstanding that alot have suffered from scammed or failed projects all over the world including Nigeria. I will stick to this my claim reason is that before the economy collapse to this stage the adoption rate of crypto has been increasing and in fact if the economy becomes more better people will have more money to invest in cryptocurrency and this will increase our adoption rate more. Though the best cryptocurrency to invest in is Bitcoin since there is surety for profit in the long run but Nigerians as also invested on altcoins and shitcoins especially in 2021 and we know what happen to most of them, so I guess this is among the reason most Nigerians has stick to bitcoin for investment. QuoteI know that one's opportunity can be another's threat. Is the continuous fall beneficial to crypto traders or its just a trap? There is no trap here, we all know that the economy is not getting much better for the time being and no sudden change in our economy that will give it a positive growth at the time being because when it's time for a positive growth it won't be sudden. QuotePersonally what are your thoughts on this? Does the benefit from the market compensate for the cost of living?Yes it compensate alot from this because those earning from a currency being favored by the depreciation of our local currency are actually being able to make up in some ways (if not alot ) from all these economic crisis that has caused hike in price in everything because someone earning in Naira is at the lost in regards to the Economy while those earning in dollars, Euro and any other favorable currency are able to compensate better now (especially when the two are still being paid same amount they earned before the economy became worst).",

Does the benefit from the market compensate for the cost of living?From what I observed in bitcoin and the people that I know are into bitcoin, are investing in bitcoin to make profit, because most of them believe that bitcoin investment is something that will change their lives after they sell in the bull run. Profit is the first thing in their mind, this is why you see that even the ones that don't know about trading will want to trade. They go extra miles to learn trading by all means so that they can make profit from the fluctuation of the price.Secondly, is depreciation of Naira, though I have seen people who prefer to keep dollar than bitcoin because they don't have trust for bitcoin yet and all the time, they exchange their dollar to Naira when they want to spend. Unemployment has made Nigerian youths to be ready to do something that will make them be dependent on themselves to safeguard their future, and most of these youths who has the knowledge of bitcoin are buying and hodling with the little money that have to invest for the future.",

      "body": "Quote Cryptocurrency adoption in our country has been increasing over the years due to our unemployment rate and inflation rate. The depreciation of the Naira triggered the massive adoption of cryptocurrency in Nigeria. Mostly everyone in Nigeria is looking for a safer way of earning dollars so that they can be able to overcome the high standard of living in Nigeria. Imagine seeing the exchange rate of one dollar to Naira at 1175 Naira, you will want to adopt Bitcoin as a hedge or as an investment that will help you overcome the inflation in Nigeria. QuoteI know that one's opportunity can be another's threat. Is the continuous fall beneficial to crypto traders or is it just a trap?It is no threat because the continuous fall of the Naira is a result of Nigeria's bad economy until a good policy is deployed by our government or CBN that will help the Naira to gain against the dollar if not Naira will keep on falling.

Does the benefit from the market compensate for the cost of living?Yes, the benefit from the crypto market will help you overcome the inflation in Nigeria because your 10,000 Naira will be 10,000 Naira or above any time you want to convert some of your Bitcoin to fiat.",

We need prayer at the moment and God's intervention if not the dwindling economy will continue.",

I believe currently holders of coins before Tinubu's rule has experienced a great deal of profit with Naira falling in relation to Dollar.I know that one's opportunity can be another's threat. Is the continuous fall beneficial to crypto traders or its just a trap?Personally what are your thoughts on this? Does the benefit from the market compensate for the cost of living?For me, I go say make dollar increase make naira fall because even if naira increase and dollar fall, wetin go still happen for this country go still happen, beside the introduction of crypto don make people gain employment and don make dem no dey reason to do bad thing just to earn a living and e dey very beneficial if dollar increase because of the gain wey dey dey am and we fit dey use that gain dey save self, and our leaders dem know say to be a partaker of crypto make sense, na e mk some of dem dey hide dey do am even as dem dey talk say dem go banned us from using crypto and na them know wetin we dem dey play. And my prayer be say mk dollar just increase because see this country anything wey don high don high.",
