  "content": "Betcoin is a cryptocurrency with a novel inflation model which is a hybrid between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.In Betcoin, approximately 1/3 of the currency is paid out to miners and 2/3 is paid out to coin holders via gamified proof of stake.All betcoins accrue interest at a rate of 0.01% per 125 minutes and coin holders can realize their gains by staking their betcoins in virtual basketball games between 32 countries.The Betcoin currency runs on an application called PolyCash and uses a blockchain called Datachain. For more information about the project please visithttps://poly.cash/We've recently completed some important upgrades to Betcoin like making it easy to install with Docker, and building a peer verification API that confirms if you're in sync with the network every 10 minutes.Betcoin uses the Scrypt mining algorithm and currently has a very low level of difficulty. Right now you can mine coins quickly even using a normal CPU.  We need to get the difficulty level up in order to secure the chain, as we prepare to begin marketing this cryptocurrency to a wider market.  Therefore I would like to connect with anyone who has Scrypt miners available for use.Please feel free to PM me or reply in this thread if you have any questions.  If you're ready to set up a node and start mining please see our installation instructions on Github.https://github.com/PolyCash/polycash",

      "body": "One thing that makes this project special is the opportunity to set up automated betting strategies.There are no betting fees so the system is nearly frictionless.  And of course bettors are rewarded through the inflation of the currency, so betting technically has a positive expected value.Then if you can improve on the odds being used in the betting events, you can write code to automatically bet and profit from your insights.I have written a couple of sample strategies that you can select from when logging in to my public node.Hopefully this helps clarify the idea behind this project.",
