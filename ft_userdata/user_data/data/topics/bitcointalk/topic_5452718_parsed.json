It's the same as cigarette advertisements for example, that even though there's a campaign about the negative effects on it, still people continue to smoke. To minimize gambling addiction really has to start with the person itself or if that person already falls into the trap of gambling, should be associated with the help of family and friends. Also, establishing several gambling rehabilitation centers should help if the family and friends can't control anymore the user involved.",

Many people that will watch this scene find it new and might be interested to search for the games and curious to the game. Instead of reduction probably there might be a conversion to gambler result with this kind of advertisement since it’s on a public without moderation of viewers.People curiosity will always kicks in on this kind of scenario that will trigger them to gamble since this is new despite the negative propaganda. An example for this are cigarettes, Government in my country attached grossed picture on cigarette packs that related to diseases that you can get on cigarettes yet people keeps ignoring it because they like the product. This might be the same outcome on this kind of advertisement.",

Regardless of what our opinion on the view point is,  it is clear that the parade shows some form of promotions and aftermath results of the activities of stung slot players. This parade also shows the level probability disadvantage of addicted slot players,  and how their lives turn out to be in the long run,  and also this may further promote gambling controls since there is already a show of what the aftermath effect of this will be on potential slot players and how it can ruin your life., it's important to note that this parade seems like a stage play with slot mentioned in it but gives a double-edged message as to what the parade promotes.",

A parade may be a creative way to raise awareness about the risks of gambling, but it is not a reliable or effective method to reduce gambling addiction. In fact, such a parade could potentially trigger some people and increase their desire to gamble, especially if they are motivated by the prospect of winning big prizes. I watched the video closely, but I must have missed the part where they discourage gambling. From what I saw, it seemed more like a glorified ad for slot machines than anything else. However, without knowing the specific intention or purpose of the parade, it is hard to make an accurate assessment.",

They don't need to go this far, parading on the country side and telling the ill effects on slot game.So I don't like the way they supposedly \"educate\" the masses here, it's the wrong impression that they are sending to the people. If they really want to stop it then go to their governments. And for sure, it could back fire and there could be an increase of gamblers because of this slot education parade.And I think this is one of the worst strategy.",

According to TV programme that I watched some days ago. The presenter was advising parents to teach their female children to play video games as their male siblings do. So what I am trying to say here is that, education is very much important for gaming space. Yes as the op said such parade should be taught in all areas of the government so young pupils will be able to play the video. Serious awareness is needed in the area.",

One thing with citizens is that a government that lacks legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens will always make a mockery of itself when it atteattemptsfridge the right of the citizens most especially when the government want to stop what is beneficial to the financial well being of the citizens were the government have failed to grant any opportunities that could possibly help the citizens to come out of the total dependant on the government and for this regulations can only work when the individual involved is made to see the need to regulate a certain thing and help support and protect the citizen's interest. Just like the Nigeria CBN vs Cryptocurrency,  why the policy failed os the CBN lack the legitimacy to place a ban on cryptocurrency without making any alternative available to the people,  so the citizens have no choice but to continue with their activities using other means but will keep them out of the radar of the government.",

I’m about to laugh on this parade, didn’t expect someone will actually do this. Again, this can’t help with regards to addiction in gambling, the authorities should start making their presence felt and warn those sites about encouraging younger people getting into gambling, maybe they can increase the age who are allowed to gamble, this can help.",
