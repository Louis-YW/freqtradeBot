Sometimes I think you are not a real trader, or you are looking at the wrong places, or you are just completely over ambitious.Check out the top gains and losers on different exchanges, there is always a coin or token pumping and dumping regardless of the market situation",

Within each 4 years, you can see very dramatic price movements but after a full cycle, price will rise a lot and good enough to have profit.Looking at daily chart and price movement every day is not smart. It will affect your feeling and your activity so that you can not stick with your plan.Investment long term with 4 years and longer as you can see with https://hodl.camp/, if you can hold more than 4 1/2 years, you will not get loss.",

I was bearish early morning yesterday, but I saw some strong bullish signals.. I said to my self that this is bear trap. It was at night when everybody was expecting bear, those signals were correct lots of shorters had been liquidated in past two days, the manipulation of the market is so damn much",

If there's no opening or good trade, then don't make a trade, simple as that. Most of the newbie traders are envious of other traders, thinking that they should make profits as well but I believe that's a misunderstanding.Every traders should move according to their own phase, based on their intelligence about trading, that's how they are going to make profits.",

Some 5 years back it was possible to manipulate the market if you had a big bankroll and smart strategy but now there are too many whales and institutions who hold and trade Bitcoin so it's impossible to manipulate or even move the market by much.If you want to trade those sharp movements, it's based to do that in the altcoins market and there are 0x to 100x all the time. It's almost a more advanced version of gambling where you gamble on a token to either 2x 10x or just die the next morning you wake up. You can play the crash or dice game instead if you are just desperate to lose or gain some extra bucks and don't have the patience to hold for long.",

I believe that for someone to hold cryptocurrency is of two different ways. I believe that holding cryptocurrency directly can only help to make a lot of profit to men cryptocurrency enter bullish market. But the best method hold cryptocurrency is being converted to usdt and immediately we experience bullish market then the conversion have to return cryptocurrency. And with that a lot of profit will be made",
