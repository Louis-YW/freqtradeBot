Well, if we look at the contents of the article you submitted, both discuss views on cryptocurrencies and Of course both focus on Bitcoin, where as Bitcoin maximalists believe that BTC is the only cryptocurrency with true value, while the SEC still has concerns about the proliferation of fraudulent cryptocurrencies and exploitative in the market whether BTC will maintain its dominant position in the long term or not as well as in an effort to protect consumers from fraudulent projects, their version (SEC). To me, this still seems reasonable because the crypto market continues to grow and develop over time.",

I don't think there has been any form of direct attack from the SEC on Bitcoin recently, at least none that I am aware of. Since they don't have a CEO, they can sue and invite someone over to list out the charges that have been made against them. It's just individuals who are holders of Bitcoin that are being attacked, not Bitcoin; the price of Bitcoin just gets affected based on the fuzz they might end up causing with their attack on big names.QuoteWhich criteria again Bitcoin needs to fit in?  Digital money. Based on their rating, Bitcoin lacks all the features that make it appear to be a security token since it's being calculated based on the involvement of the team behind the project in terms of decision-making. Leaving them with doubt that the team is benefiting largely from their investors in many ways, including exploitation using different methods, which include market manipulation and rug pulling. Those kinds of things can't be done with Bitcoin. It could be seen as digital money by the SEC based on the value and use case people have placed on it, which is major as a means of exchange, and it can cover up all kinds of financial transactions.",

You just heard the news and decided to post it here without knowing that this news has already been shared here. So, i think someone else's rocket is already launched and BTC hit 29,900$ just today morning. And now coming back to earth. hehe.And your title seems a little bit off because Bitcoin is not the only coin which they had declared as not a security there are other 4 tokens too exists which are crypto but not security. But, i like your optimism toward this news. All i am seeing is BTC is just cooking right now and once the time will come it will blow.",

Bitcoin is actually decentralized digital cash but due to many factors it can be used as the best asset to gain profits for the long term. Look the fiat based cash system won't give us a lot of profits because the fiat based currencies can go down in value anytime while the Bitcoin is a sure way to be profitable for those who want to hold it for long periods.I also agree that other crypto-currencies are only there because of Bitcoin and they don't really have anything special other than the features they have. A currency doesn't get worthy because of its features, but it gets worthy when people find it as a valuable form to trade good with it. Although, I agree that most of the crypto-currencies can be used for the purpose of trading goods but none of them can come close to Bitcoin when the matter is about decentralization. I hope that SEC and other governmental bodies will soon accept that Bitcoin is the cash of future, and the future economies will be run by Bitcoin or at least they will implement Bitcoin along with the fiat based system. The future of Bitcoin is very bright and those who are aware about Bitcoin will be among the knowledgeable generation of the coming decades. I love Bitcoin and seeing a news like this always makes me happy. I wish that Bitcoin may grow to very high values in future, and more and more businesses should implement it as an acceptable form of payment.",
