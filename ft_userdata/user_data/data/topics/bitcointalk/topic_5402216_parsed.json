  "content": "Hi there,i released my own URL shortener.Some parameters:URL: https://s.griddy.clickRelease date: 2022-JUN-09min. CPM: 0.25$ (it may be higher based on houly dynamic CPM analysis)Unique IP Count: 1 / hour!Withdrawals: Instant, FaucetPayLogin/register: just simply enter your FaucetPay e-mail addressSupported currency: USDTMinimum payout: 0.00000001 USDTCaptcha: hCaptchaNumber of pages to complete: 1Ads: yesPopups: yesLink lifetime period: 24 hours, then will be auto-removedI know this URL shortener has the lowest CPM at the moment, but it can hopefuly grow.This URL shortener could be suitable for faucets / PTC sites or other Micropayment websites.It has integrated adblock and popup-blocker checks, so it's also good to verify if your users are not using some adblockers/popup-blockers.User interface for publishers is as simple as it goes, but it has every data you need.A bit of comparation and explanation, why this URL shortener could be better than other ones with 2-3$ CPM?The answer: This URL shortener allows you to earn 24 times / day from one single IP address, the other URL shorteners mostly crediting only one claim / IP / 24 hours. So you can get 24 x $0.25 = 6.00$ from a single IP address. It's very unlikely to get this high CPM from other pages, however, they usually promoting Greenland traffic for 20$/CPM, but what is the chance to get a visitor from Greenland? That's all i wanted to tellhave a nice day,Enjoy!",
