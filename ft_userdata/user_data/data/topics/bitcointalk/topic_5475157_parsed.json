  "content": "Recently I was scrolling on Twitter(X) and I came across something rather interesting..A bitcoin developer that I follow on there (@0xB10C) posted this on his page. [1]Given the community's commitment to upholding the censorship resistance of our network, I deemed it appropriate to conduct a thorough reading.Here's what I found:Firstly, the developers project aims to detect instances where Bitcoin mining pools fail to mine transactions they could have included. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a bureau in the U.S. Treasury Department, is responsible for enforcing economic and trade sanctions aligning with U.S. foreign policy, targeting countries, terrorists, and threats to national security. Over the past weeks, the project identified six missing transactions from OFAC-sanctioned addresses, prompting an investigation into whether these omissions were intentional or had alternative explanations.The RSS feed reported missing transactions from ViaBTC, Foundry USA, and F2Pool, involving OFAC-sanctioned addresses.The analysis explores various reasons for transactions being absent from blocks, such as network propagation, individual node differences, and pool transaction prioritization. The primary goal is to determine whether mining pools intentionally filter OFAC-sanctioned transactions and assess the impact on Bitcoin's censorship-resistant properties.One missing transaction from ViaBTC's block 808660 was due to the prioritization of other transactions by ViaBTC's Bitcoin Transaction Accelerator, indicating it was not intentionally filtered. Foundry USA's block 813231 did not include a sanctioned transaction due to potential delays in transaction propagation. Again, unintentional.According to the report, the analysis suggests that F2Pool omitted transactions from OFAC-sanctioned addresses in blocks 810727, 811791, 811920, and 813357. The reasons for the omission vary for each block, but the common thread is the likelihood of intentional filtering by F2Pool. Here's a breakdown of the reasons for the omission in each block:Block 810727:F2Pool did not include this transaction, and instead, another transaction was included. The report suggests that the missing transaction had a slightly higher fee rate but was 3 vBytes smaller than the included transaction. Despite the fee rate advantage, the larger transaction was chosen.Block 811791:The report indicates that F2Pool omitted this transaction, and despite having enough space in the block, it was likely intentionally filtered. The presence of extra transactions in the block did not affect the inclusion of the sanctioned transaction, making intentional filtering more plausible.Block 811920:F2Pool did not include this large consolidation transaction in the block, and the report suggests that the transaction might not have propagated to F2Pool in time, but it's also likely that it was intentionally filtered. The transaction was marked as \"recently broadcast\" on mempool.space.Block 813357:F2Pool excluded this consolidation transaction from the block, and the report indicates that, similar to the case in block 811791, it's likely intentionally filtered. The transaction had been in the node’s mempool for more than 25 minutes, making it less likely that it wasn't known to F2Pool when building the block.In summary, the report concludes that these transactions were likely intentionally filtered by F2Pool, This raises the question of why F2Pool, a pool with origins in Asia, is the first pool to filter transactions based on US OFAC sanctions, especially considering that other transactions with similar or lower fee rates were included in the blocks. The original report can be found here. I highly encourage giving it a read. [2]----------I find myself uncertain about how to interpret all of this information. Despite the seemingly small number of just six transactions, the fact that such situations are possible raises concerns. I'm grappling with whether this should be a cause for worry in the future or if it's perhaps an overblown issue. The writer of the report leaves us with this:QuoteThe Bitcoin network, however, continues to work as normal. A single pool filtering transactions does not affect the censorship resistance of the Bitcoin network as a whole. Further monitoring of the transaction selection of mining pools allows identifying when more pools start to filter transactions based on, for example, OFAC sanctions. It also allows miners pointing their hashrate to these pools to make an informed decision on switching to a different pool if they don’t agree with a pool’s (unannounced) filtering policies.[1] https://x.com/0xB10C/status/1726964430460588201?s=20[2] https://b10c.me/observations/08-missing-sanctioned-transactions/",

I believe that the reason for this is that the US obviously has a much greater influence in that part of the world, whether it is pressure coming from politics, or they have something with which they hold that pool in their hands. In addition, it is much smarter to start experimenting in someone else's backyard and see how things will develop, and only then implement such measures in US mining based pools.However, I remembered that we already had a similar discussion, only that time it was MARATHON pool, which was actually the first to mine something they called \"clean block\". Although this is bad news, MARA AND F2Pool currently have about a 15% share of all mined blocks.MARA Pool mined its first 'clean' block today",

And it's going to happen, I'm 99% sure they are already thinking of it but are just testing the waters for a while with smaller measure for a while, then, some will have a shock realizing how little decentralization we have in this aspect.",

One of the main tenets of bitcoin is that it is supposed to be uncensorable. If 51% of the hashrate goes the same way as F2Pool and refuses to mine any transactions the US government tells them not to, then that is very much not \"uncensorable\". That is the death of bitcoin as at that point only government approved transactions are allowed to be mined.This is the ultimate result of people not caring about their privacy, of most addresses on the network being linked to someone's KYC, of everyone using centralized exchanges and giving them all the control, and of people believing that blockchain analysis is anything other than complete bullshit. People like me have gone on and on about privacy, about censorship resistance, about self custody, about not using centralized exchanges for years, but the fact is that most people in this space care more about fiat profits than they care about what bitcoin was designed to be. This is the result. A government permissioned network.",

OFAC compliant pools seem to control the vast majority of the hashrate right now*. If they want, they could fork the network and maintain the longest chain even now. But will they? They're already losing out on fee revenue by excluding otherwise perfectly valid transactions from their blocks just because of OFAC. Hard forking by completely ignoring perfectly valid blocks just because they include transactions by BTC addresses in the OFAC list would likely create a very big debate. Core developers would have to decide which chain to support, big services would have to announce their recognition to what they see as the main BTC etc. It would be wild to see. Miners stand to lose a lot of revenue. I think big pools will just chose to filter transactions without forking. This status quo maintains their revenue and they can also claim non-participation in BTC \"money laundering\". * Please read the source article more carefully and get confused like I was. The only pool we can say with some certainty that is currently filtering BTC transactions is F2POOL. The others mentioned are false positives. F2POOL control maybe 12% of the network hashrate at the moment. Together with MARA pool which in 2021 had openly stated to be mining OFAC compliant blocks, although we're not sure if they still do, would make up around 16% in bitcoin's hashrate.",

The two mining pools which are been linked to be censoring transactions is the F2Pool (11.6%) and Mara (3.8%) with both having a combined hash rate of 15%, so just as you said if the individual miners actually leave either of the pools and join the other pools that do not censor transactions then it will weaken thr hashrate of the pools and could take them out of the market. But the question remains will they leave and join others? Then the concern again is what if the government is able to get other big pools like Foundry ( which is US based mining pool ) and Antpool into their side, then the whole decentralization advantage that bitcoin possess will be gone. Something we have all thought will never happen, but due to maybe greed of some pools it almost right before us",
