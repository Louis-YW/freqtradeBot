  "content": "There's quite some drama in Reputation board about things happening in the German forum, I don't want to get the same drama here.While the question comes from there, it's actually generic.If an user threatens another user (especially a rather new account) with getting him banned... is that OK? Or, better asked, should we do anything about it? (report or anything). Is a new (unofficial) rule needed?Of course, it's a fake threatening since he has no power to do anything, but it can silence or disappoint new users coming to this forum.Or I'm worried for nothing, since it's a situation that doesn't happen often and it's usually related to political (to say so) views, not technical, so not a big deal?",

It was already like that when I joined, and in the first years I was afraid to get a red tag for some unimportant tiny mistake.How you can think Bitcointalk isn't friendly to newbies since they only need to avoid plagiarism alone, the other rules isn't strict enough and would make you get banned. In school or university, we have been taught to not do plagiarism in anything of our home work and exam, so we have a mindset to not plagiarism on everywhere. For the red tag, I don't know how strict the DT members is, but I tend to agree it's stricter than now since they got red tagged due to spam and merit abuse.",

Or, better asked, should we do anything about it? (report or anything). Is a new (unofficial) rule needed?This threat is verbal but in certain cases it must be prohibited especially when it involves physical threats or death threats as stated in rule no.8 [No threats to injure the body, death threats]. If the threats fall into the 2 categories above, I think the ban is a consequence that can be taken.Whereas we must grow thick skin in order to appear more immune to verbal threats from those who may not like or hate us. Those threats are bullshit and I think the best option is to ignore them, but if neutral tags are allowed then I also think it's a good choice.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on June 27, 2022, 09:20:31 AMWhy should we believe and listen to the threats of every jerk who threatens to do something against another user?Here on the forum, no one knows anyone.

The forum or specifically the community is against it. It is a serious offense too.

So we really had to ignore it.Most likely, the question was not related to cheating, because no one would pay attention to threats from cheaters. This is an empty phrase that ends with the registration of a new account.One tip for those who are afraid of all sorts of threats on the forum is just to be careful on the Internet. The less you say about yourself, the harder it is to get to you. There should be no friends or buddies here, especially when you have no idea who is sitting at the other monitor.",

      "body": "I'm from the German section and can confirm that the recent clown show has happened where a Newbie was indeed threatened in our local board (the topic can be seen in Reputation but it's somehow a shitshow  )Thanks for NeuroticFish for bringing it up here. In my opinion, there are 2 solutions: 1. Add it to the rules and enforce it, that such posts will be deleted. 2. Basically, what Lucius suggested: Quote from: Lucius on June 27, 2022, 09:59:16 AMQuote from: NeuroticFish on June 27, 2022, 08:50:39 AMIf an user threatens another user (especially a rather new account) with getting him banned... is that OK?

Anything more than that is not worth any drama and time.I agree here. Leave a neutral feedback to the offender and discourage his behaviour by addressing his misbehaviour. That should be sufficient to protect Newbies, make them feel safe and send a cleaer message to the offener. In addition we can distrust (~) the offender. Could be added as a DT Standard because without Newbies, its getting difficult and there's just no benefit, when (contributing) Newbies are scared away. That solution would be easy and without creating much trouble while still sending a clear message.",

Whether, that's a threat, who cares, @TMAN, maybe if @Kamix saw what @TMAN said, he'd know that's the reality of the people on this forum, the distinguishing character.I think the word 'ban' is not a threat, but it's a bit harsh for beginners, maybe @Kamix is ​​not familiar with this forum, later he will understand which is serious and which is threatening.",
