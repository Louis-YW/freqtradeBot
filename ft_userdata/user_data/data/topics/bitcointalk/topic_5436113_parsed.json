  "content": "German Bundesliga Season 22/23(A self-moderated discussion and prediction thread)Since the old Bundesliga thread has unfortunately turned into a mega spam-fest where reasonable discussions or chats are almost impossible, I took the chance to open another self-moderated thread.This thread is supposed to be about the following topics:1. Casual discussions about the Bundesliga and its clubs2. Betting & tips on individual Bundesliga matches and/or parlays3. Transfer rumours about Bundesliga players and coachesTo prevent this thread from ending up in a spam-fest as well, there will be some clear rules. This means that posts that do not comply with the rules (especially generic shitposts for signature campaigns) will be consequently deleted. In this thread the discussion should be in the spotlight, so please only post if you are really interested in the Bundesliga - otherwise please check out the spamthreads.Thread rules & guidelines:1. No off-topic2. No pyramid quotes (if you're quoting more than three people your post will be deleted. Use ~ or -snip- for longer quotes.)3. No posts of generic quality (shitposts)4. No defamation5. No trolling6. Good posts will be rewarded by me. So give your post some thought and get some merit.",

Example: ugo to a post via quote to have a serious conversation about it and there is never a reply. This can depend on several factors. 1. the post got lost in all the spam posts or 2. the quoted post was itself a \"spam post\" to get on its post count for signature bounties.A self-moderated thread should solve the problem - though that means some work for u.

I am confident that together we can build a cool and fun place for everything related to the Bundesliga.  Quote from: Trofo on January 20, 2023, 05:41:26 PMI am personally in dilemma what to do with my Premier League and La Liga themes since they have been quite full of spam and I am doing all my discussing on pool threads that are closed to non participants. Something needs to be done but I haven't found perfect solution yet.Let's try to set a good example with this thread. Maybe it works out and we can manage to reduce the spam at least a little bit. And if it doesn't work, we will have to look for other solutions, I guess. But let's give this one a shot first.Anyway, enough introductory talk, let's get on with the Bundesliga: Today's top match between RB Leipzig and FC Bayern just ended in a 1-1 draw a few minutes ago and I think that's probably a fair result overall. In the first half, I really felt FC Bayern were clearly the better team - but after the half-time, RB improved significantly, so the draw is okay in the end, tbh. For the excitement in the Bundesliga, the draw is certainly not a bad result either, because if Freiburg scores a win tomorrow, they can get as close as two points to FC Bayern.That's the schedule for tomorrow, plenty of exciting matches. Source: Bundesliga, Google ResultsPersonally, I am very interested to see how Schalke 04 will start the second half of the season. After the disastrous first half, it's time to turn things around rather quickly if they don't want to be relegated to the second Bundesliga once again. It is quite remarkable what has happened to this great club with such a long tradition.",

There was a Leipzig and Bayern Munich match yesterday, I watched a little bit, after all, it's a good match. RB Leipzig drew at home. Leipzig is still promising. The points for the top positions in the league are very close to each other. Bayern Munich opened the goal at 37 minutes. Shortly after the second half started, Leipzig caught the draw and they evened the situation. Even though a foul was expected, I think the position was clean.",

Somehow I feel like Bayern are currently missing the good old players.The weekend's games were completely bonkers, if you ask me. As a FC Bayern fan, I was not only disappointed about the 1:1 against RB Leipzig, but also that FC Köln literally blew Bremen out of the stadium with a score of 7:1, LOL. My bet that both teams would score came off. But a result like that? WTF.Nevertheless, there was also quite a surprise for me personally. Despite the crazy results, I was able to win the matchday in our German Bundesliga betting game and win a 2 mBTC free bet on Betnomi. That makes the weak performance of FC Bayern very easy to forget, haha. The Bundesliga table currently looks like this. FC Bayern leads the table with 35 points, followed by Eintracht Frankfurt, Union Berlin and SC Freiburg with 30 points each. IMHO, none of these three rivals will finish on a Champions League spot at the end of the season, but we'll see. Will be more likely something like RB Leipzig, Dortmund and Gladbach?Source: Bundesliga, Google SearchDon't miss: The next matchday already starts tomorrow, as there are also matches on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.",

But at Bayern in particular, it's hardly been about football in recent days, but rather about the tiresome goalkeeper discussion, which peaked yesterday with the sacking of goalkeeper coach Toni Tapalović. As a reason, irreconcilable differences with the rest of the coaching team were cited by the media. If you ask me, a very unfortunate end for a co-trainer who had been working with Bayern (and Manuel Neuer ofc) since 2011.But perhaps now is exactly the right time for the team to finally get back to normal and focus fully on the games in the second half of the season (Neuer is injured anyway until the end of the season, why are we having this goalkeeper discussion at all?). I mean there are tough opponents waiting in the Champions League - you simply can't afford discussions off the pitch tbh.And concerning the Leipzig game: Probably a 5:0 or something? Pretty, pretty sure Schalke getting smashed today.",

Pretty interesting that the transfer went so quickly in the end. But honestly it's starting to get pretty tough when it comes to the Bayern midfield. Top-class players everywhere.
