That is always the mindset of people. Topics in off topic board does not mean that they are trash. It could mean that thru don't fit the board that they were made and there is no provision for a board that can accommodate such a topic. The moderators will have no option than to move it to off topic. I have created a  post  in the off topic section which people contributed to and I even got merited for it.I think another reason your post is moved to off topic is that it didn't mention bitcoin, although it mentioned coins and also you seriously advertised a particular service there.",

Just like the reply above, you can move it again to other board you think it suits and feel free to edit the content or subject for it to not getting moved again to off-topic board.",

Even if I am wrong, I do not think moderators did the right thing either.Who said you off topic board is where trash posts belongs? The board is specific for discussion which don't have anything related to bitcoin but we can discuss other topics which are of our interest as already shared by @LoyceV above which you can clearly see.The thing is trash posts don't have any place on forum and moderators simply delete them not move to any other board so your post was not having any discussion about bitcoin related but a general discussion so I don't think they have done anything wrong.",

I used to think the above is true because Off-topic has a lot of useless topics. I now report them as \"insubstantial topic\" when I stumble upon them, and usually they get locked. Based on the board's description, the board should be interesting to me. But it's not. I just checked 5 topics, and reported them all. The main problem is that experienced users gave up on the board, and Newbies use to to increase their post count.",

Click on the link and check the topic, the only reply that was posted was when the topic was in beginners and help. No reply in off-topic. But you are right and I have nothing to say again.
