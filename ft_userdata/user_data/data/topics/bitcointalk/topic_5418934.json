I've seen quite a few newer members with lots of merit and more merits than activity so I doubt it's a full \"everyone's selfish\" and more an \"I'm a bad quality poster\" or \"I don't post in the boards where most merits are given\" with the additional option of being someone who posts a lot of questions and doesn't contribute as much to topics or themselves by offering something interesting to the discussion.A lot of merit sources would also rather use up their source merits than just have them burnt so there's probably a role that plays too in all this.

Post quality aside, this quote from Pmalek seems to be the main reason why member's may not get merits from merit sources and member's that aren't merit sources, you may not be showing up in topics that interest them:Quote from: Pmalek on September 26, 2022, 07:15:05 AMI can't speak for others, so I can only talk about my own distribution. It's very simple. I send merits to people who write quality posts in the topics I am interested in. Wherever I read and post at that moment is where my source merits go. The thing is, if the same people keep showing up in the same threads, it's only logical they have a bigger chance to be on the receiving end than those that don't.  If you want to get merited, show up. That's the first thing. Do we have to drag you out and force you to post so we can merit you? These threads help to make it easier if you are not showing up in topics that interest merit sources as it takes your post directly to them:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410264.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5093271.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5412657.0",

People likely, overtime, grow more keen to visiting certain sections, and may take a shine to some profiles the frequently encounter there for a variety of reasons. In my close to 5 years on the forum, I’ve merited 2.079 different users so far, having sent more than 24K sMerits to date (see data here). Now of course there will be some profiles amongst those I encounter frequently (i.e. on my local board) and others sparecely, despite being quite a few hours on the forum insofar. There is content I may be inclined to read, and other that I find unsubstantial and tend to skip, as well as areas that are not in the scope of my reading habits on the forum. Of the posts that I do read, more often than not, the best answers are provided by profiles that have been on the forum for quite a while, which is seemingly logical since they know more both of the topics being discussed and the ropes to the forum itself. There are counter examples of course of all sorts, but that is their competitive advantage, built over time. Lower ranks may find it hard to post something different, that does not reiterate what’s already been said, and therefore find it harder to earn merits. Many of the profiles here have been there, and it’s generally overcome with time and effort, although admittedly at different paces.There are obviously going to be plenty of meriting examples people would not agree with, thus the intention of the forum to be diverse in criteria though multiple Merit Sources and individual Meriters. Could it be better? Sure, though no solid proposal has been seriously placed on the table that I can recall.",

What lead me into Bitcoin talk forum, was simply my zeal to know more about BTC, as well as the trading aspect, Succeeding in the crypto world. I've asked a lot of questions which eventually led to LordB, telling me you know what, there's a place to get all Answers to your questions. That's how I arrived hereIf you could read through my explore history, you will realized I've spent so much time in various places and section of the forum, And whenever I found something new or strange I ask questions.As you know, Questions don't attract merits, Contribution did, do you think I will continue to enclose my self in something I know that yields nothing and still continue. You've got to give it a thought before concluding.In as much as I also want to be ranked, and share my ranked journey just as every other person,  Knowledge is important and I will definitely go for it, If I wanted a merit or rank, I will simply purchase rank, But what gain does it yield buying a copper member rank, Without proper knowledge of what BTC is.Going forward, I've encountered lot of random response, which even goes on to get 50, 30, 25, and more merit, at the same time, you will found a newbie account with a superb, Constructive, and informative response, yet no single merit, my only wrong doing is not puting the links together and thanks to the member who brought this one herehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2992259.msg30856756#msg30856756I've seen a lot of low quality response like this from ranked members getting so much merit, but a newbie with far more, recieves nothing, My target is to learn as much as I can, so I can also impact someone else, so with all due respect, your Observations and conclusion is totally wrong 100% Respect to you.",

This system isn't really favorable to Newbies. I might like a pair of jeans, while you find them ugly. You might consider the shoes you wear fashionable, but maybe I wouldn't wear them if you gave them to me for free. Posts can be similar to that. I merit whatever I think is good and if I have the needed amount of merits. I don't merit what I don't like or if I don't have the needed merits at the time. So just because I didn't merit a post, doesn't necessarily mean it's bad and I don't like it. It's subjective. Legendary accounts with 3k, 5k, or 10k merits didn't get there by accident or by share luck. Their contributions, quality, and quantity of posting got them there. Each well-thought post is a new chance to get merited. Each new shit post isn't. It just adds to the numbers and nothing else. It's hard to comment on what you consider a low or a high quality post unless you show proper examples of that. I can then tell you if I agree with those merits or not.

At the time, people were still getting the hang of it trying to understand how it all worked. And with the airdropped merits, there was a lot to pass along. I am not familiar with the topic of discussion, but the post is not what I consider a shit post. It's something I might merit with 1-2 merits, for example. Not 50 by any means. I can't comment on the intentions of the merit sender, but I certainly don't agree with the number sent. But that's just me. This example you and someone else mentioned doesn't work in your favor. The whole OP is about how legendary members merit other legendary members and abuse the system. But the receiver in that example is just a Full Member. His rank was even lower at the time the merits were awarded. And the person who sent the merits is a Hero.",

A quality post is not judge by the magnitude of the content but the insight it gives, it is more convenient to read through short, direct and straight forward response that is on point than going through pages of articles you can't figure out a particular idea or taught from it.2.

High rank members get merits for shitposts because they have recognition on this forum, but since they are already high rank, merit becomes purely a vanity stat for them. And despite merit points being a limited resource, it's not like newbies lose something when high ranked members get merited. There's plenty of spare merit in this ecosystem, I personally sit on over 120 sMerit and there's not enough good posts from newbies to give it away.",

It has already been discussed here showing that it was probably an alt account of the same member. You still haven't shown any examples to prove your point. Please show me an example of a quality post from a newbie member that you think was under-merited.Quote from: Lordsilvabtc on October 31, 2022, 10:40:27 PMLike I earlier said, My post isn't to attack Legendary members, If you feel this way, I'm sorry, I don't mean to upset you legends.

You accused senior members of abusing the merit system and being selfish, but now you say that wasn't your intention?",
