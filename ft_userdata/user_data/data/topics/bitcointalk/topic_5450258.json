Is this volatility a good sign of the market or a bad sign of the market?Volatility is a bit of both, it's good that the market is volatile because when prices go down suddenly, you can get in at a lower price and because of the volatility, there's a chance it will go up and you making a profit and it's a bad one especially if you're a panic seller because volatility causes unhinged emotions to go off rails and make you decide unreasonable things when you're in the market like panic buying or selling.",

It is not possible for Bitcoin to go from $31k to $100k. Bitcoin won't reach $100k as easily as we think. Here we have to see a lot of volatility in the market for Bitcoin to reach $100k. Maybe by 2023 Bitcoin can take position between $40k to $50k dollars. But such market volatility can be good or bad. But we do not accept that this instability will lead to good. But we have to remember that we have to move forward with this instability of the market.",

Everyone are accepting instability of Bitcoin price, if someone can't accept it, he shouldn't invest in the first place. This is not only invest in Bitcoin, but the other assets too e.g. precious metal, real estate, stock because those assets price are having their own volatility too.",

Is this volatility a good sign of the market or a bad sign of the market?Just like what the old bitcoiniers called this period a “bull trap” I think the recent volatility of bitcoin causing it to jump and down in thousand within period of hours is partially due to the much anticipated halving of the new halving coming up. The dump of price actually happens with the crises exchanges are facing recently, the top one is that with the SEC failing to agreement with some of these exchanges. This has somehow created panic in the markets. Also the relaxation of crypto regulations or ban in countries like China also plays its part.But the major thing causing this excess volatility is the panic around the halving, some people are withdrawing there funds after meeting first year quarter target and others are accumulating fast when a little drop happens for the next halving. This two to me are what drive the market right now. Should this panic reduces after halving we will have moe less a little stable market before the next. So it is a good sign",

As you guessed that Bitcoin market will reach between $40Kto $50K this year it is all but your imagination.  Maybe it's the opposite of what you think. the price of Bitcoin may fall further this year.  The price of Bitcoin is completely dependent on the market.  But I think more volatility in the market is not good. I have seen several times with Bitcoin that when the value of a coin increases very quickly, the value of the coin decreases very quickly after a few days. No matter what we say about the market, we have no choice but to wait until the end",

Investors withdrew $100b from the bank due to the fear that FRB will collapse. US government is planning to inject more money  into the economy to cover up this from becoming a problem to the economy. This action of printing more money will only ignite more inflation. This has made investors to see bitcoin as a digital gold and store of value to invest their funds into bitcoin, since fiat currency is depreciating. This is the reason of the sudden pump in price today. Bitcoin investors are happy for making a wise choice of investing into bitcoin which cannot be influenced by the government of individuals, as it has serve as a store of value and an assets. I believe that the price of bitcoin will keep on pumping since the secrete has been revealed to investors that fiat and the banks are scams,but bitcoin remains the only option. I see bitcoin price hit above $100k between late 2024 to early 2025.https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/26/bitcoin-inches-toward-29k-cardano-leads-gains-among-crypto-majors/",

Is this volatility a good sign of the market or a bad sign of the market?It's a good sign in my opinion of constant movement in the market meaning there are a lot of investors buying and selling Bitcoin. At this early, we can already see the market price increasing up to 30k$ even without the Bitcoin halving event. Surely there will be a huge spike months before halving and that huge spike could easily trigger a lot of investors in the market, which can cause a huge movement. Still, if there is a lot of movement in the market, it could easily create panic in the market that could easily cost up and down in the market.No one really knows what could happen in the market price for sure so the investment was obviously for long-term investment, but it's a positive investment even though is a risky investment.Quote from: wahyuagung26 on April 26, 2023, 04:21:57 PMQuote from: Patrol69 on April 26, 2023, 01:52:14 PM Basically I do not understand the reason for so much volatility in the market.

Previously, when bitcoin was less than $25K, when the price increased to a certain point, it would then pause and wait for another correction before increasing again, finally beating the previous price it reached before the correction. This has been going on for a while, so it's not a new trend, and it's also a good indicator. In the coming days, if the uptrend would continue we might witness a break through to $33K or higher.",
