Meanwhile, the referral is different from the affiliate, though they are the same aiming of profit it has differences. Referral marketing is in relation to the one who was referred, it could be friends or family and it should be direct contact to the referral not just clicking a random affiliate link.",

In gambling the product that a blogger promotes is the casino itself and its games so inorder for the affiliate marketer to track records use his referral link in making users sign up.

In this case partner to the casino itself that helps them advertise or something (Referrals fall under these \"somethings\"). A Referral is also a partner, but in this case, it's not to the casino itself but rather to another user. There was one scenario I remembered back then where an article said that streamers/YouTubers that you see gambling in their channels are affiliated partners to the casinos, hence they use not their money but rather money given by the casino to be spent on, well, their casino, which would what be the content for that specific episode/day. I guess you can say Referrals is one (or maybe a few, if there's even any) levels below Affiliates.",

Thanks!See mate, I would try to be straight enough as much as I can.Normally referral is defined as when you refer someone about a particular site, here it works like individual to individuals, for ex:- you just send your referral link to your friend while talking verbally.In the other end, Affiliate is something similar to referral, but here you promise the site/company that you will bring more users through your link . Sometimes in Affiliate deal, you also get a specific percentage as discussed with the company.Normally a big YouTuber or influencer does the affiliate promotion.This is from my knowledge and experience that i am sharing on this matter.Hope this helps you OP to understand the matter better.",

On referrals, the one who referred you earns while you spend, and you can't do anything to change this way, or to even make profits. It's way more beneficial to be an affiliate than to be a referral for most scenarios, so if someone sends you an affiliate link, better register on those instead of referral links.",

I just forget that there are like celebrities that are affiliated with that casino or just connected to it but they haven't invested in it. It is just like they advertise it because they are affiliated with it. It is not all about having money to invest, but it is about giving something to each other and recognizing each other.
