If i expect payment from somebody, i'll open my wallet to see if i received said payment. If i were to get an alert of an incoming transaction to my wallet, i'll see said transaction the next time i open my wallet anyways. If i were to see an unauthorized outgoing transaction, it's to late anyways.And as for whales: i don't care about those movements...",

I can just invest in bitcoin when the price is significantly low if compared to all-time-high, just like a time like this.",

However, if you are concerned about keeping track on every transaction in your wallet, it is best to use a watch-only[1] wallet with Bluewallet installed on your smartphone.Quote from: RCYH13 on September 13, 2022, 06:45:34 AMAlso, how many of you set up smart alerts to track projects or whales?Not me as I don't really care about these people/miner/whale moving their bitcoin, because it's their right and it's none of our business. Also, you don't really need to setup an alert as there are twitter pages doing it.[1] https://bluewallet.io/watch-only/",

Some use them, some not.However, using special apps for notifications is overkill imho when a wallet on your smartphone can do that (and you can also import there only the address or master public key to keep it watch only).And as said, whale tracking is counter productive: it doesn't give any relevant info, it can only scare some newbies.",

I did it by adding my address to the adresses watch list on my etherscan.io account and am still receiving email notification till now. The only problem is that you will receive notification only for eth transfers.
