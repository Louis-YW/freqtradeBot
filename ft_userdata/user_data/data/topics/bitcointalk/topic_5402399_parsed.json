      "body": "On a different note, Ledger supports around 2000 different coins and tokens. In reality, most of them are useless. I don't think there is another hardware wallet manufacturer that supports that many altcoins and shitcoins like Ledger does. Trezor has a fair share of them as well, but the support depends on the type of Trezor HW you have. If Ledger doesn't support it natively or through a 3rd-party app, is that really an asset worth buying and keeping? Just something worth thinking about.",
