In spite of this, don't think it's too late to start investing in Bitcoin - I can tell you that it's still very early in the game to invest in Bitcoin at the moment. We are still in the early stages of the bitcoin revolution because don't let the opportunity pass again. As long as you work hard and seriously with bitcoin from now on, I believe that in 5 years you will also achieve success as early investors.",

It's totally fine to be wrong about some things and realize it later. It's worse to never recognize one's mistakes and have to progress. Moreover, I don't think people should invest in something they don't believe in, so I'd say not buying Bitcoin when you think it can be a scam is reasonable.Bitcoin is still in pretty early days of adoption, still probably has a lot of potential to go up and to become more widely used.",

The Bitcointalk forum is a center of crypto knowledge that you probably won't find anywhere else. it's normal when at first you don't believe in bitcoin and think it's just a scam and Ponzi. You need to look deeper and get involved in the investment. You might be interested in getting into bitcoin because its price continues to rise and it has become a crypto digital asset that has caught the world's attention. When you have started to enter at this time, you must be prepared for all the risks, if you are consistent and make some investments for the long term, in the next 5 years, you will have many benefits.",

Actually, it's good that a person is always skeptic with something that he doesn't know and don't want to go in depth further. It's a normal mechanism that we tend to say and react because we're lack of knowledge with that. But for someone who's reactive negatively with things that he don't know yet curious to know more about it, that's nice of you that you did your own research and proved to yourself that bitcoin isn't the typical online or internet scam that we've used to see before. I know where the people are coming from when the first impression they give to bitcoin is like a scam. Many of us came there and understood the reason why they're skeptic about it. Nevertheless, if you've got an open mind and you allow yourself to understand what really it is, you'll be grateful that you've known what bitcoin is.",

No one to be blamed, as during that time, it was human tendency to check each and every aspect when it comes for investment in money. Similar thing also happened during this bear market. People with less knowledge panicked and sold their high valued Bitcoins for which they later regret on it. So yes it‚Äôs always better to learn from mistakes and use it for your future reference.",

Earl Nightingale said, ‚ÄúOne hour per day of study in your chosen field is all it takes. One hour per day of study will put you at the top of your field within three years. Within five years, you‚Äôll be a national authority. In seven years, you can be one of the best people in the world at what you do.‚Äù That is to say, if you had learned about Bitcoin some years ago, as mentioned, probably you would have held more Bitcoin or not. Some people claim they already know a lot about cryptocurrency, while they are lagging in some vitals.A special welcome from me; keep learning, mate. In the forum, you will get a lot of opinions, but you have to filter out the ones that you think are best and most useful to you. I normally say Bitcoin still has a lot of potential in the future, so even if you invest now, there is still a new all-time high coming for Bitcoin.",

You know learning is very important and vital in human existence. If you do not learn you will never know and if you do not know, you will find it difficult to adapt. So it is every where. Learning exposes you to new ideas and keeps you informed about your environment and development on going around you. As we all know, learning is also a continuous process that is why you see great scholars are made as a result of continuous learning which is a step in making Discovery in science and technology globally. Bitcoin is a a result of Discovery which I believe Satoshi must have learnt a lot in studying and building the first blockchain which is termed blockchain genesis.Another thing I noticed is that people are not really ready to learn, they prefer already doing things the regular way which is not way too much ¬†demanding and tasking. It is very difficult for some to learn and I also realized as well that not all are fast Learner. So therefore, learning is a gradual process in life.",

Though, people who really understand how Bitcoin works could never be a victim of a ponzi scheme. Misconception about Bitcoin until now here in our place is still a company that will give them profits if they are going to invest their money on it. I always try to correct them but they never listen.So I let them believe what they want to believe and focus on myself how to earn more Bitcoin.",

It's ok to have some losses because that is part of the journey, all you have to do is to use that experience to correct your mistakes. Ignorance is quiet normal though since Bitcoin is still new and not everyone knows about it, what is not ok is that you failed to analyze Bitcoin or you didn't make any effort to know its details and you just invest right away because someone told you to do so, this is the moment where many got burned and liquidated if you don't want to experience the worst, then start learning now.",
