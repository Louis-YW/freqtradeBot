I can quite grasp the conclusions you convey, and it can be said that luck plays a big role in our lives. just do consistently what you are doing every day (in this case I say a business) and hopefully luck will stay with you one day and the business you run will get bigger.",

The majority who grew their profile from scratch where they had nothing to a good success just like OP relations were gradually getting prepared for their big success while they endured those days of their little beginning. I am not disputing the fact people get lucky at times to get success they didn't labor so hard for,  But with the high inflation rate this days does cases are rare it is no longer has common as it used to be. To me been successful mean been so intentional about getting what ever success one desires and if luck makes it easier in the cause of the building process then fine.",

Without hard work, I hardly doubt successful people would exist. I won't deny that lucky people exist, I mean look at Fred Smith (FedEx), he gambled away the money left of his company when it was on the brink of bankruptcy and won, but that wasn't all there is, he used that money that he got from luck to create more opportunities for his business, which grew to what it is today. Successful people don't let luck guide them, most of the time it can be said to be a culmination of all the efforts that they did in the past, which presented itself in a combined form and should be called opportunities instead of luck. Luck is a separate factor that exists, but isn't exactly a major cause of a breakthrough to a successful career, at least, most of the time.",

Some succeeded by sheer hard work. Some succeeded by perseverance more than any other. Some succeeded by luck.

A janitor who finally became the manager of the company he has been working with after many years of hard work and dedication. A brilliant young man studied hard, topped the board exam, and hired by a huge company. A drop out decided to just focus on his hobby and ended up managing his own business.

When you start continuing the work consistently with greater focus, of course you also have to be smart enough right?Because when someone who wants to continue a job while still stupid himself, how can he consistently focus on the work he wants to continue? I think one cannot ignore intelligence even though he can hope for luck in his business, because people who are smart in a field of work can definitely make a better focus and run their business more consistently.",

I think you might have misinterpreted what they meant or they did not realize themselves how luck contributed to success. Successful business people can often overlook the one trait that matters here: perseverance. Many businesses came about after the owner adapted and tried many different combinations, failing many times along the way but finally figuring out a \"magic\" formula that worked for them. People assume it is luck, but in actual fact they had the ability to change when they saw something was not working and let go of it. Luck can sometimes play a pivotal role, like being in the right place to land a very favorable contract, but often repeat business is what makes them true winners over the long term.",

I respect your opinion or view on your uncles but I am sure that it is not pure luck that brought them to success, its the opposite it's their effort and decision making and that luck is just bonuses on it like example they've got a big client that they can gain profit but you will say that it was pure luck but the truth is that you've worked hard so much before and those clients before recommended you, still it has luck on it but it was a pure effort. Though I don't see anything wrong with you as you still mentioned that you'll make effort and try to make luck work for you, just continue your effort and hard work no matter what you think about luck but just continue it.",

Some were given some luck but losses it since they don’t know how to manage it like those 1day millionaire which wins in lotto and just happen to spend it into somethings else and didn’t save or bought some investment.

This is so true i recently even read a research paper on this, luck plays a really major factor in determining many major careers, i read that how major ice hockey players are born in months of Jan to Match because that is the cut off for the age bracket and those guys are more aged at that time therefore get better training because are physically more grown so just your birth month would decide how better player you will be so obviously chance or fate does play a role in almost everything around us.",

You can be a bright student or even a genius, handsome, hardworking, determined and what not but if you're out of luck you are never going to become rich and successful. This is partly true for myself - I've always been fighting against the odds, swimming against the tide. I did have some success but with some luck I'd probably become a billionaire. The same is true regarding my entire family, also in sports and all other endeavors. Peeps who are lucky are just blessed.",

Looking for luck alone must be with effort lol.You stuck with what your uncle and family said, it's clear what your uncle said that he worked hard before, of course in that hard work he reaped experience and knowledge to be better, when the opportunity came to him, he was ready because with the experience and knowledge him have when work hard.I think your opinion can't be blamed either because it's a group of people whose thinking is Fix Mindset, and it really can be learned but people who use this mindset they are usually stagnant in their lives and don't like the challenge of finding out and practicing a lot of skills .I think you should listen to your uncle's story again.",

There cannot be any generalized structure for success. But, if you notice that people do achieve at different age with respect to their effort levels. Knowledge also playing a vital role here. Keep trying with proper plan and knowledge will help anyone to be successful in my opinion.With bitcoin trading I was not successful then I adapted holding strategy and now I find myself recovering all my losses in trading. You can find similar example everywhere; yes, all the people who achieved are those who refused to give up. If you keep attempting with proper plans and knowledge then you can get what you dream about. Here, most people do miss about \"plans\" as empty attempts will not help.",
