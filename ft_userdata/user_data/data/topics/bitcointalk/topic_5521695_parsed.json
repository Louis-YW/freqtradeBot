YourTexasBenefitsi comHello,To obtain high-resolution chart data (minute-by-minute or even second-by-second), you can use financial data providers like FirstRate Data or Kaggle. These platforms offer historical intraday data for various financial instruments, which can help you prove the price stability during the specified timeframe. Best regards,Jack Henry",

When you send bitcoins from one address to another, you still have the same amount of bitcoins, less the transaction fee.Did you sell the bitcoins after transferring them? Is that the 7% drop?As for the data you are looking for, the exchange should have price data including the low and high prices for the period. That should be sufficient. You don't necessarily need the price of every trade.",

      "body": "Why would you need to explain about your case if you are going to withdraw it? Weird, and why do they offer $50 for the withdrawal fee? It looks suspicious to me.Why not tell us first this \"big unnamed provider\"? Let's see if that provider you talking about is legit or not. About the funds that you sent from your hardware wallet to online, if you receive them there with a 7% loss, then maybe that platform has a deposit fee?Still, its suspicious. I never heard of any exchanges that deducted crypto by just depositing it should be 0 fee.",
