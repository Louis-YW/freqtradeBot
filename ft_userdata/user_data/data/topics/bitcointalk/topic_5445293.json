I don't like \"smart\" contracts, because usually the user has no idea how it works.I agree. Same with bitcoin in 2009. But thank you for considering.I disagree. Satoshi released a very simple to understand whitepaper, even before releasing the software itself, and discussed it directly with others publicly, so I believe the understanding amongst early users was pretty high. Compared to today, you had to run a node,Â  you had to mine to get BTC, all things that most Bitcoin owners have no idea about today.Back on-topic: I may need to do something similar, Loyce..  For now, Bisq it is! I really relate to your 'rules', especially for the (big!) signature space we have here.. Quote I only advertise services that I like. I reserve the right to reject offers I don't like. If the service I'm advertising turns into a scam, I reserve the right to stop advertising it without returning payment.The profile picture, eh, it has no clickable links and is fairly small, so it's alright for me as I have it now. What I really don't like is when you have to do the 'trifecta' of signature, profile picture and personal text; basically making your whole profile indistinguishable from others (besides the name) and your post containing more ad space for a single sponsor than actual content.For campaign managers: I did enjoy how icopress provided different, individual avatars (relates to the subject of 'individuality' of profiles and posts).",

I understand that whoever pays for the campaign wants maximum exposure, but it seems to me that most of those who are interested in something will still click on the signature because it is a direct clickable link. By the way, I'm not part of the sig campaign that I currently have a signature on, but it's one of the oldest projects on the forum I'm a member of, so why not promote something that's been around for a long time and maybe get some more referrals.",

Your offer had the best terms I've seen in any signature campaign (similar to the deal for renting out my Avatar): no post requirements, no requirements to post on certain boards, just \"be myself\". It gave me absolute freedom, and I can now say from experience I don't post less even when nobody is counting posts.I've accepted an offer from AgoraDesk, on a weekly basis. I still keep the option open to switch to a better paying campaign once one presents itself, so I'll keep bumping this thread once in a while.Until now, I've never left a campaign before it ended, but if a better offer presents itself, I may switch in the future. I've been open about this to the campaign manager from the start.Since CM was taken down, I stopped advertising mixers. And since 2 days ago, the Netherlands no longer allows advertising for gambling sites (including affilates), unless they can prove less than 5% of the players are under 24 years old. I don't like this level of government involvement, but it applies nonetheless. But I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not even sure if this gambling advertising law even applies to casinos that don't target the Dutch market, so if someone can convince me it doesn't apply, that would be great",

Netherlands is one of the most challenging markets to work on, and most big players rather opt out of it than pay all the hefty fines that the gov is giving out in case they catch you. The few big local operators that are there basically have a monopoly under the current Kansspelautoriteit laws, and remote gambling operators are still excluded from most frameworks = but the gov promised that they will introduce it soon. If you open up a few of the MGA and Curacao licensed casinos you'll see that no one has your language available and the country is blocked on IP level. When it comes to gambling, I applaud government involvement, in UK they cracked it down to the max and kids are much safer.",
