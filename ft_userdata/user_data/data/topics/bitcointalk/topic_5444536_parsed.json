We're looking for good leaders and keep voting for wrong leaders, country where they leaders citizens conscience with peanut's.We're getting worst by the day because even me that is complaining, nobody know my mindset, we said one thing and do another thing. How can change come when inside you is not yet change? We love election money more than the future we dream for. Half bread is better than kpuff kpuff, that's the code for collecting bribe. This country will be better if the citizens are ready and willing to be better. This country is our future but the future is not a football field. Let's start the change within our hearts. Election is coming again don't help anyone to win by bribes, let them win by merits.",

During election, the politicians will come and lie to us and promise us heaven on earth, after voting for them they will totally forget about the citizens and the promise they made to them. I fell so sorry for those who sold their right during election because they will never be remembered. The country and the leaders will not change if we the citizen don't change. The change must begin with us.",

I think the youths were protesting even after INEC pronounced the winner; the protest still continued for some days. If I can speak plainly, this past election was so massive more than other elections because a significant number of youths were out to vote for an esteem politician whom they believe will make the country get better, but the result of the election seemed manipulated so people are even angry.",
