The address is not the one that should have been copied!Sounds like there might be something fishy going on with your device instead of the blockchair being hacked.  Could be some kinda clipboard malware messing things up.  I'd say run one of those antivirus and anti-malware scans or something, just to make sure there's no malicious software on your device and  might help figure out what's causing this. Have you tried copy-pasting your btc address somewhere other than the blockchair website?",

The easiest ways to prevent this from happening again is to install an antivirus on your device. Aside the antivirus software, the best thing you can do for yourself is to after you have copied the address write the last letters or alphabets manually. Also try to uninstall each piece of software piece by piece and then test whether it is better or worse that is if you noticed that it came after you installed a piece of software. This is not the only way as there are many. Hopefully one works best for you.",

The address is not the one that should have been copied!Before you claim something to be hacked, you need to first confirm how the thing works. Since you copied your address and pasted it in there and noticed the changes, have you tried using another method like copying and pasting the address on another website or even on a notepad to see if the address will still be the same or if it will change? If it doesn't, that's when you should know where your problem is from. But for the time being, the chance of your PC or whatever gadget you are using being hacked is much higher than the chance of your blockchair being hacked. You should be thankful that it's not in sending out transactions that you notice this, like most people usually notice this. Try wiping out your gadget even if it will take you to get a new operating system in order for you to be sure that the virus is being wiped out of the system, or better yet, you should still be typing the address on your keyboard instead of copying and pasting it.",

Good on you OP, your attention to your address and your attention to detail has provably saved you from scammers.I would recommend you to do some backup or your important information (ideally you should do it in a cloud service which also have scanning for viruses and unwanted software), after you have got all your important stuff backed, then wipe completely your devices and your USD drives, to be sure something like this will ever happen to you in the whort term.You probably got this virus by participating in fishy and shady places related to cryptocurrencies or airdrops.

It's commendable that you're able to do double checking, definitely saved yourself from a hacker that wanted to steal from you.
