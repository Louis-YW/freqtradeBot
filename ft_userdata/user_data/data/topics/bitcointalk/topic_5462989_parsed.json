AFAIK there isn't any wallet that meets these 3 criteria for android wallets.There are Bitcoin wallets like Unstoppable wallet  which supports taproot, not the ledger connectivity.But I think it is not really good idea to connect your Hardware wallet to Android since we know Android is more vulnerable to malicious attacks so you may let someone access and control your cold storage just because you linked an unknown link.",

Android will warn you before you allow such permissions.  Stay away from dodgy sites, stick to Google play to download apps, read reviews, be mindful what permissions you give and if they are really necessary, encrypt your data (new phones come with 'on' by default), use lock, don't connect to unsecure networks and you will be good.

Android, Windows both have large user base, so they get attacked the most but weakest link is always the user.Let me tell you how it is possible that how one click of a malicious link will lead to a series of processes that will give complete control of our device.First, it will compromise the browser which will lead to installing the malware in the background and you will have to know idea what is going on and there is no way to find out. And also you can't find the malware install root directory in your app management likely the malware will be completely invincible and keep running always on the background.If you want you can see the presentation on youtube about how such attacks are done. Google Protect is not going to find those malware if the attacker is smart enough.",

This is off by default.

We all know that windows and Android have the biggest users over the globe, so it's natural for hackers to target those operating systems more often than iOS, macOS or Linux.Quote from: libert19 on August 16, 2023, 11:51:22 AMUnless browser has \"install unknown apps\" setting enabled, browser can't install anything on it's own.

This get installed normally like nay other app.OP I have tried to check wallet scrutiny, but it looks like getting a wallet that meets all the criteria you want is close to impossible. Why taproot through?",

Thanks to anyone who can help me!If you want a Bitcoin Wallet on Android that can also connect to the Bitcoin Core full Node, you won't find it (at least for now -cmiiw) because Bitcoin Core is only available for the desktop version.Although some users don't like Ledger, you can use the desktop version of Ledger Live if you want a wallet that supports Ledger hardware wallet, Taproot address, and connects to the Bitcoin Core full node. However, if you only want to use a Taproot address connected to a Ledger hardware wallet, you can still use Ledger Live mobile (Android, iOS).",

Take note that a hardware wallet is also a cold wallet and it is also more newbie-friendly than setting up your own airgapped wallet, so maybe you should consider a hardware wallet for now.",
