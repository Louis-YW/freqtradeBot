Which is another absurd joke, you put in the work to get them players. You make money for them, you get a tiny piece of the pie and then they tell you that you are a cheater and bonus hunter. Just blows my mind.To add: I've been playing there for a year and I am fully verified. Seems that doesn't matter when a casino can't pay 72$ they will just come up with some rule not to.",

      "body": "I have also lodged with Askgamblers as they have a rep there.I wrote pretty much step-by-step exactly what I did.Won 5$ giveaway from Stream - bustedWatched the stream till end - cashed my 4.5$ affiliate earnings, 2 hands house BJ to 18$Played Jokrz Wild Ultranudge Gigablox 2 flopped 3rd hit 70$.https://www.upload.ee/image/15693738/jokrz.jpgPlayed 1 crash hand after that coz wd fee is 1$.https://www.upload.ee/image/15693749/last_crash_hand.pngU can clearly see the currency I played with is USDT - which isn't bonus currency. So what bonus hunting are we talking about? LOL!and then requested a wd.Thing with Coins Game is that they do not provide your full betting history and they can make up things as they go.I deposit sometimes, sometimes I play with the affiliate earnings. I don't sit in chat all day hoping for a drop and I also deleted their telegram channel over 6 months ago and haven't even used any single code for 6 months. My last deposit is on 28th Aug 23.On the vid there are all my depos and wd's.What I personally think - There are algorithms that flag accounts they do not check things manually.And the algo flagged me because my wager for that day was smaller than my withdraw request probably.What comes to a live support agent, they are clueless in my world - they have no backend access and even chat gpt can do their job. No where ever in the past 15 years I have seen a live support agent resolve anything for me.After I calculate my wager vs withdraw = 4.5$ + 9$ + 8$ + 8$ + 8$ + 5.5$ = 43$So the system indeed could flag me 43$ wager trying to wd 72$. But still this shouldn't be an issue any casino has to honor their bets and their affiliates.Even if I deposit 5$ and do 5x1$ plinko balls and hit a 1000x and request a cashout it shouldn't be an issue. Therefore such algo shouldn't even exist.",

Just blows my mind.So you can withdraw the affiliate funds but cannot play with?Â  This is really strange as Cainso will usually like that people wager with the funds so that they may lose the funds in this process and are left with no funds to withdraw.Secondly, how can they distinguish that you are playing with Affiliate funds or your own funds? Unless and until you are either playing with all of your money at the site or you do not have any money deposited at the site.Quote from: just4kicks on September 17, 2023, 07:38:15 AMAfter I calculate my wager vs withdraw = 4.5$ + 9$ + 8$ + 8$ + 8$ + 5.5$ = 43$So the system indeed could flag me 43$ wager trying to wd 72$.

Not just 1 costumer, by the impact of this post and ask gamblers this 72$ ridiculous dance will cost them 30 of my affiliates who I will make sure won't play there again + everyone who sees this topic here and ofc over at Ask Gamblers.I'd say ~1000 potential costumers lost.Like at this point it ain't even about the 72$, I should be allowed to play with my affiliate earnings how I want to.What pisses me off the most is that they labeled me as a bonus hunter / abuser when I have claimed 1 free code in the past 6 months and there's been plenty of deposits.All this makes no sense.",
