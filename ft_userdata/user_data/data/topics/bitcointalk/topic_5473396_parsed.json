  "content": "I would like to say first of all that I have no financial claims against Rollbit.They paid me all the money from my balance, including my positive balance (I withdrew $1,100 on top of my deposits), but I think you guys should know what their illegal and humiliating verification procedure is.So, I bet mostly on top tennis tournaments. First, I was limited to the maximum bet amount. Ok, there's nothing wrong with that. I decided to withdraw the remaining balance. I passed KYC without any problems. And then the circus began. They write to me that I need to go through video verification in Google Meet. I received an email, I chose a date and time, and literally the next day I went through video verification, but you will be shocked when you find out what they make you do during the call.First I have to turn on the camera, which is fine, but after that they force me to share the screen and show:1. When I go to the Rollbit website, it’s ok.2. How I go to the website of the Binance exchange, from where I made deposits, and live showed my Binance profile, all my transactions, my balance, and the verification section. This is illegal, Binance has nothing to do with them.3. Your Google profile in Chrome. Yes, yes, they even wanted to see this, they checked that the name matched the one indicated on Binance and in the Rollbit profile. This is also far from legal.This terrible procedure defies not only common sense, but also any EU laws on personal data. Logging into Binance live is like logging into your bank account live, it's very confidential information, but if I refused, I'm sure they would steal all the money from me.Stay away from Rollbit, this is not where you should play and expose yourself to the risk of such a procedure.I hope I chose the right section of the forum. While I am not accusing the site of stealing money, I am accusing the site of having an illegal and humiliating video verification process.",

I’ve went through this process before. Rollbit does make me very sad though.I wouldn't accuse a site of doing something illegal if they were asking questions and operating within the confines of their site. I could answer any questions about my account, they could ask me a lot of things, ok, I will answer.But to force people to log into their accounts on third-party resources, bank accounts, crypto exchanges, and their Google account when sharing the screen, this has nothing to do with them and is absolutely illegal.Rollbit just needs to know that they have a disgusting (for themselves) sports provider that confuses the probabilities, gives 2.5 instead of 1.5 every day for many events.Even a monkey can win at the sport on Rollbit.Change your provider to a normal one, and stop tormenting users, here's some advice.",

      "body": "This is far above it all, as I have not seen any such KYC procedures. It's a matter of privacy. I know your data is no longer private the moment you send your documents over to them, but this is really not it, as they have indirectly accessed every aspect of your remaining private data. I understand the reason for this form of verification. This could be as a result of the high rate of fraud online and document theft, which many people can now buy and document from anyone and use to pass KYC, and again, document edition and number manipulation are increasing these days too, so this live video could clear their doubt that there is nothing fishy from your own end, as they can check and confirm the transaction history through the call, but this has now given them access to your current balance on Binance, and your email linked to the account has also been shown to them. Since you have withdrawn your money, if there is anything else that you think might have been leaked that will affect your account, please increase your account security just for the time being. Side note: It's important to note that it's not really safe for you to leave money on a centralised exchange. If you have any and are not trading with it, you should consider moving them into your private wallet.",

In a video chat they have no right to ask for sharing screen. A video chat is to confirm the facial to check if it matches with the identification document given to them. They may ask some basic questions like name, DOB, when the account was created, and some basic information like the bets you placed, what market you bet usually etc.I am sure you have not recorded your screen, if you would then you can seek legal aid and sue them for harassing you and taking unethical advantages of your situation.",

Not sure how i’m supposed to prove it but the Community Manager set up an interview with me on Google Meeting. I’ve actually said this on my thread about rollbit as well but unfortunately I didn’t record the interview. They were indeed asking where I deposited the money from and browser thing for google chrome since I was using chrome. They didn’t do any in depth investigation regarding my chrome person tabs they just wanted to see it and for me to click on it etc. I assume they do this for verification purposes.",

My suggestion is when next you are passing through this stage of verifications don't always show them when you start to login your account rather, you should try login first before anything else, I can't trust anyone or any of the staff working on those site.",
