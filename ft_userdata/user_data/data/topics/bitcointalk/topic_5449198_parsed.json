Somebody hacked into your stuff, stole something and now you have been robbed, or even worse someone convinced you to willingly send a small or large sum of money to them without getting anything in return. I feel like this should be a topic of discussion simply because this is so prevalent in the crypto category and everyone has their two cents on this. So my simple question is this, in your experience, what are the red flags and tell tale signs that the person you are dealing with is a scammer/fraudster. That is the million dollar question isn't it. How can you tell who to trust, forensic analysis edition is what i'm looking for. Would like to know the answer to this question in every applicable way or fashion that is related to our industry to use as sort of a guide book or study guide, if this exists please produce the source link for all to see.

Scams are unsolicited, and the scammers reach out through you through email or social media,They tell you what you want to here. This could be by offering a too good to be true deal or rattling you with a notice that you are in danger or your funds are at risk.They tell you things that align with your interests which are public knowledge. For example, a known collector on the forum gets a pm about rare items for collection with a small shipping fee.Your conversation with the person appears rushed.All these are not definite signs and scammers adjust their strategy regularly to appear more convincing. Always be on the lookout for scams and think it twice or three times before opening your wallet.Quote from: tread93 on April 17, 2023, 06:12:22 PMHow can you tell who to trust,No one.- Jay -",

And if you not smart they would just use you to shine. First if they are coming from banking system to defraud you from your Cryptocurrencies. They will ask you for OTP and remember bank staff would never ask you for OTP, please don't send them your OTP. Then in the social media, all the individual pages. And not group pages are for scammers so avoid those individuals pages. But if is a market place you can buy what you want but receive your good before pay.",

      "body": "Scammers use a variety of tactics to entice their victims into committing to them and falling into their trap. The one I am more familiar with and that frequently occurs to me is the scammer being the first person to message you about a specific service they provide. They make every effort to persuade you to use their service. They will even provide you documents or testimonies of people who have joined and benefited from their services. Any service or company that has no reputation should be avoided, because everything they show you is simply too good to be true, and you should avoid people like that. They mostly goof around on Telegram.",

That's how the internet works nowadays. Don't trust anyone, even in people that you trust in the real life because it can be an identity fraud. Anyone can be other people online. So, we need to forget about the trust factor online, and that's the only way to avoid getting scammed.If someone asks you for money online you can be sure that's a 95% scam. And the smart way to avoid it is to block that contact, that's our only option.",

Additionally, I believe that similar topics have been extensively discussed on the forum before. Nonetheless, the key to avoiding scams is to let go of the desire to get rich quickly and to avoid being greedy. This approach can save you from many scammers. Scammers are constantly coming up with new ideas to steal your funds, so you can't rely solely on following rules. You must use your intelligence to protect yourself from scams.",

You would need to ask yourself what's in it for them that they need to initiate talking and by then you can already sense what thier goals are.  I can trust more if I am the one initiating a conversation.If you see they are very aggressive and forceful even when you both know there is no contract agreed upon.

To make things simples, everyone on the internet is a scammer or fraudster in potential to deal with, unless they have how to prove their reputation on previous successful trades and deals. You never trade with someone you don't know the backgrounds with certain, that is why there is the middleman service on this forum, which is the person who will ensure the deal is legit for both sides of the negotiation, the seller and the buyer.This way you can trade with everyone on the internet without worries of being scammed. The middleman must be someone highly experienced and reputable along the years on internet niches, like bitcointalk forum.",

Because cryptocurrency is so risky, trust is a major issue. Everyone wants to win and make a lot of money when they invest in it, which is why scammers are constantly looking for new ways to scam and defraud people who are new to cryptocurrency or fall for their traps.Scammers have different ways to be identified which include the following:They always appear desperate to end or conclude any transaction they started before the victim realizes what is going on; therefore, if anyone is desperate for you to invest in a platform or send any cryptocurrency that you are not sure is a scammer, because real investors cannot be desperate to finish their transactions because they have nothing to fear.Scammers typically use Telegram channels and groups to find victims and then delete the evidence after they have duped you. They usually have a team that will encourage you to invest or transact with them, claiming that they did theirs and were successful, so you will believe it is true because others have confirmed it for you.Many users here have mentioned red flags that are used to identify scammers, but keep in mind that scammers are constantly developing new techniques to improve their scams. We simply need to be cautious and continue to learn every day so that we always know what to do.",

It’s risky to put yourself in a financial situation with a person online, but if you somehow find yourself in such scenario, you should definitely do a web search on their profile pictures, chances are you will find multiple accounts with the same pictures but different names. Ask for a zoom call and see the lame excuses they come up. Lastly, if it’s a crypto investment scam, do a thorough research on the website.

Always check it. The contact details too,The way the arrange their lines too if it is convincing enough should prompt you to ask for evidence or picture proof.

That information is almost priceless. One of the signs I can point to is unimaginable returns from investment. Most fraudsters introduce businesses that promise to give high profits from little investment. This will make one interested in the business. Another red flag is that such a business always introduces a get-rich-quick ideology. These scammers know that long-term investment hardly attracts victims, so they make the business look like an instant money-doubling scheme. A business that asks for processing fees before one can claim his/her profit is usually fake. A genuine business will withdraw the service charge from profits and send the balance to the beneficiary.",

If the scammer start acting like teach you what to do then it's probably their strategy to make you do what they want you to do with them.
