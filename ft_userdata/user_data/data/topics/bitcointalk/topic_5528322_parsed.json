With Bitcoin Lightning Network, transaction fee will be very tiny and cheap, so USDT on Bitcoin LN will be competitive enough with USDT on altcoin blockchains. If picking between Bitcoin Lightning Network and altcoin blockchains, I think Bitcoin Lightning Network is safer and more secured.USDT itself has big risks, just be careful when using USDT generally.PSA: Most Stablecoins Can Be Frozen, Even in Your Own Wallets",

(when you are the receiver of incoming balance). you will learn the hard way one day of the troubles cypherpunks had trying to create digital money",

People are surprised by this news because the information and expectations of Bitcoin Lighting is messed up. They made people believe that Bitcoin lighting is easy to use, it's simple and fast while in reality it's very complicated for an average user to use. It's also very impractical to use too. You are right, LN has failed!Quote from: Wind_FURY on February 01, 2025, 09:29:26 AMBecause if bigger blocks actually was the answer to user adoption, then explain your Lord Roger Ver's BCash.Bitcoin is successful, right? Do we need to use it as a payment method or do we need to use it as wealth storage? I think that we need most but most importantly, we should value Bitcoin because it's a good P2P payment method, one of the most decentralized coin, compared to other coins. Bitcoin's popularity and increased adoption mean that many people want to use Bitcoin as a payment method. If we don't increase the block size, it will become impossible for people to use Bitcoin and then they'll move on altcoins that offer fast and cheap transactions. 1 MB block size was normal during satoshi's era but after that, everything has advanced and some old things have to change for a better future.As I said above, bigger blocks are necessary but it's not the reason why Bitcoin Cash is not successful, this coin has many other problems and one of the most important problem is that they don't listen to others and promote a false propaganda.",
