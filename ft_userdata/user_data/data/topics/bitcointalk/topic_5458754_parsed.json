Additionally, you can use email encryption, hard drive encryption (LUKS) etc... Is this what you're trying to achieve?No!Self-hosted email servers serve a different purpose as hard disk encryption serves another purpose (encrypt your data) however what I propose serves exclusively those who cannot maintain or have their own email server , or even use encryption on your hard drive, and even if they do, accessing your email from any device connected to the internet is a whole different thing from having to access your hard drive.You could use a similar system, something like (My email server with disk encryption) but when sending the email to another user, what guarantees that it will remain secure?But shall we think further? What can keep organizations away from their mailbox, and keep spam at bay? The decentralization of this service is important for those who depend on them, both for arguments, criticism and the use of freedom of expression. It's not about a personal email server, nor just the encryption of your hard drive, it's about a little more than that.I'm working on the project's challenge and on its paper, I believe that the explanation will be better in the paper, as I will have help.

Especially because it is similar to the concept of sending Hash to Hash, in which each \"E-mail\" is treated at the client layer.",

Regardless of my criticism I'm curious to read the details of the project you have in mind.The realization of smart contracts is still being studied. Fact is, people tend to just use the email service in the conventional way. As for doing it locally, it can be done but it is not so safe, imagine that you can lose access to your computer, and it goes offline from the entire network, it is better that the entire network knows about the consensus of sending x bytes of encrypted data for a given hash, once certain conditions are met. Even if your computer is totally unusable, the email will be sent by some network node.PS The criticisms made are valid and accepted, this system must be robust and the community understands the need for this, as well as the need for privacy and anonymity. I'm interested in discussing the system further with you.",

However, the decentralized protocol will not be released. Utopia is very knowledge-intensive software. A lot of time, effort and resources went into this product, and we do not want to share all of our know-how as it will result in forks which in turn may result in instability of our main network. Fork will lead to the division of the community, while our intention is the unification of the community of like-minded individuals. The bottom line here is that a lot of software is closed source, and this does not hurt them a bit. In addition, we will audit our code.Basically, it's a product, not a free software. So I'd avoid it as much as possible, especially when alternative software like Briar exist.",
