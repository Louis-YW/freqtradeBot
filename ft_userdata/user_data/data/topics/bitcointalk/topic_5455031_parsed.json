This is just a paid channel created by a user who is running his own online business; what else do you expect? They are out for business, and they see themselves as influencers, which means they want to be paid for whatever they do. When you, as a business owner, see that my channel is doing well, they will offer me a promotional offer, which I will gladly accept. After all, that's among the reasons why I created the channel in the first place, so this is nothing new to me. 1xbit can even go as far as advertising in Telegram's official channel with the right price being paid.Quote from: Cantsay on June 04, 2023, 10:11:33 AMdespite that, we wonder how and where 1xbit.com/1xbet.com gets new customers who fall for their scams. No need to wonder, most of their money scammed from victims are usually used for advertisement, they are among the most advertised betting platform online currently since they are already largely known for their scamming behavior, they don't just stop by advertising on wallets, huge sites with traffic and other, they also uses celebrities in advertising their business, if you are the type that watch clips online you will see most of our Africa celebrities promote them with their promo code in their videos, and their are people who are called die hard fan's, those set of people always take anything their favorite celebrity posted and promoted so they will always have new customers, and it's not like they are not that smart, they always pay few of their other customers and victimize many which some people don't see it fully as scam.",

      "body": "It's usually very important as a person to exercise patience when engaging with online platforms. Some people becomes to greedy when the here about money doubling just like the one in your post which say invest 50$ and get 100$. All these are just schemes to lure you into investing at a very high risk. Before engaging with any platform whether you are a beginner or an expert it's very necessary to check out some few details about the platform. Do not fall for their tricks, as most of them now display payment proofs on their platform. Just do a quick review to be sure of what you are getting involved with.Quote from: Cantsay on June 04, 2023, 10:11:33 AMAlthough I have made an edit on my profile after LDL's case, so I no longer use telegram and as such I don't think I'll be ever experience this telegram channel in Op.  Just because one person fell for some stupid scam shouldn't be a reason for everyone to stop using telegram. As we all know even as telegram is used as a means for scamming, it also has been very helpful to a lot of people including us, users of this forum through Many good bot (the superbot notifier) and many other bots that has been useful. So I will just give one advise to all out there just be mindful of the thing you do on telegram.",
