(no disrespect just kidding with you). other than this, i really like your enthusiasm in teaching others each and everything that you had learned. I found this method very great as i am also a part-time teacher who teaches lower grade students and I have developed a skill in me (idk i should call it a skill or not) of learning better while telling to others. For example, if i am learning about Dead Lock (a computer OS term), in addition to just reading it i prefer to teach or tell others about it (like my class fellows) so that they could also understand it and i will never forget it again too. Well, if you had searched these 5 topics and learned something from them then you must share your experience too along with the list, like what're the main differences you have found in these five explorers and which one is better, why mempool is showing $2 fee even in the high priority offer and still you are making the transaction from trust wallet to another wallet by paying $3 dollars in fee. My suggestion is, do not make small posts of your each small learnings instead grab a great topic learn about its all aspects and then make a big post with your suggestions and ideas. In that way, your information will look attractive and interesting to read because here we all can find top explorers but what makes them unique (you could cover that and could provide your suggestions).",

The OP effort should be appreciated for being willing to learn about Bitcoin even though there are some other, more basic things that are important to learn.IMO, the use of the topic made by the OP is not for beginners who are just learning about Bitcoin, but for people who already have Bitcoin assets.Maybe what a beginner who is just getting involved in Bitcoin needs is something about a Bitcoin wallet and how to get coins.",
