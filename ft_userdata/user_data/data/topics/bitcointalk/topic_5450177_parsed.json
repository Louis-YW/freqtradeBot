I don't know if the quality of my posts is really bad or most people don't like my post style. In fact, I just realized that I only have earn 28 merit in the last 120 days or 36 merit in 150 days. Of course it's wonder when I actually post something that seems a bit less garbage/ spamming [in my opinion] than many of today's gambling posters.Of course I recognize that there are several thread that might be useful when I feel my submission is worth reporting to the merit sources for review, but I'm really having a hard time deciding which one is worthy of your acceptance. This made me decide to create this one thread, but not for the purpose of begging you. But to be honest sometimes I have to skip a lot of posts when I don't have any sMerit to give to others.So let me ask, was it really too much when I asked some of you to review my post and drop some merit there if you find something worthy? I hope this isn't a excessively attempt to do instead of sending you an unsolicited PM.Theymos said:QuoteDo not beg for merit excessively.",

The only thing I noticed was just that you feels more relaxed after achieving 1000 merits which makes you Legendary rank and having this mind you have not to stress yourself putting efforts to earn merits like other.Â But truth be told, I have seen few users that have backslided after getting the required merits for the higher rank they wishes.Besides, your pressure can't be quantified with those with lower ranks who are fighting every day to day making sure to achieved their desires of either becoming Full member, or Sr members and I noticed this are the people putting more fire ðŸ”¥ to get Hero and Legendary rank.In conclusion, there's nothing wrong with your post, rather you got relaxed after getting the required merits for Legendary. So to keep earning merits you need to put more fire and action on your posts. Although lower ranks post with desperacy for them to earn merits.",

Because their main reasons to do that is to rank up and join campaigns. Unfortunately, by inorganic rank-ups they will not be able to make good quality posts that are harmful and negatively constructive for their campaigns.What a pity to see they exploited generosity and sympathy of higher ranked members to rank up with not too good quality posts, then use smerit they got for their own merit cycles.I believe they are able to rank up organically but it takes more time.

It started to be worse since the day theymos increased monthly smerit allocation.You may be right, but supporting each other in the community on quality posts is not going to be wrong behavior and against the rules. There are many users helping other users to get rank, this also happened in my local board section. They help not out of pity, but they help because they know that those who are being helped are users whose posts are of good quality. But something can also happen as you say. But one thing, you will get a much higher amount of merit if you have two things. Firstly you are HQ poster and secondly you are well known among the community.But the merit system doesn't only apply to those who need a rank, I mean the merit system is always expected to be useful for whoever they are even though their rank is stuck (Legendary). I also sometimes feel that my contributions just ignored, and actually I can say a lot of users also miss my posts which are basically of a quality (sometimes better than some of the other most merit users on my local board). But it's just my feeling, maybe because they think that I'm Legendary.But I once hoped that this mindset would change soon because the merit had to flow between all ranks even if they were Legendary. They should care enough about contributors instead of just helping other people or some users who are climbing up the rankings. You know, in the past I wish someone/a few people also reviewed my post because I thought a lot of local users of my board just ignored me. Check there.",

Yep, and I probably didn't convey that sentiment in my previous post, but it's quite true. Â Your posts might still be of the same quality, but many members with merits to give away (including me, which I did say) do look at someone's merit count when they're deciding whether they're going to give someone merits.That's just the way it is, and I think it's a good way to use the merit system. Â Merits are more than just a thumbs-up or a like; they're the mechanism by which people rank up here, so giving them to someone who already has enough to make Legendary might be considered to be squandering those sMerits.Note: I'm totally guilty of violating what I just wrote, many times over. Â But as a merit source I've usually got plenty of sMerits to hand out. Â *And speaking of that, I think I'll now get back to my extensive waiting list of members wanting post reviews*Edit: Shitsky!!Â  I didn't realize how low I was running on sMerits, and I just handed out my last one while doing reviews.Â  If anyone who's still waiting for a review sees this, please be patient as I have to wait until my source allocation gets re-upped.Â  Â *eeek!*",

Your contribution to fighting scams and spammers do not go unnoticed and you have built a reputation for yourself, do not let the merits become a distraction that you forget the work you have done.

You can make use of LoyceVâ€™s  Report unmerited good posts to Merit Source  thread. I just learnt that Bitcoin Discussion is visited much by merit sources so posts in that board may not get as much merits even if they are quality posts. I have never looked at it this way but now it seems Bitcoin Discussion comes right after Gambling and Altcoin Discussion in post quality.

So she asked her friend to review her physical appearance and score how she looks. I think the major problem was that for these months she has not been fortunate to be in an area where men that really like her physique or style are located.I have also felt the same way in this forum. Sometimes you spend some quality time doing some posts and you expect to get at least one merit from it, but you end up getting nothing. While on some occasions you just get more than you expect. The reason is that members that will like your post have not located them. If members that really need that information you gave Â locate them, you will definitely get some merit.These are my own views, I might be wrong.",
