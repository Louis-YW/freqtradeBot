So far number of successful repetitions equals 1 because in 2014-15 you have event N=0 based on which you could create indicator and in 2018-19, during N=1, it successfuly predicted bottom. Now we have N=2 and its not yet confirmed. So its not like we are talking about possible \"fail for the first time\" event, we are taking about succeeded for the second time.Its like you play coin toss. During first game heads won. Based on that you predict that heads will always win. You throw again and heads won again. Based on that you create a thread, here on bitcointalk, asking as if heads will fail for the first time during your next throw. Of course its possible and going back to TA and EMA20 and EMA100, based only on outcome we cant even estimate probability (because unlike coin toss its not 50:50) and N=1 or N=2 is way too small sample to say anything.People say -\"ok, small sample error, but we had only 3/4 bull runs in crypto, there is no more data\". Ok but we had hundreds of those in stocks/comedies/gold etc. and based on this dozens of TA books were created. There is no need to create new indicator only for bitcoin only because it succeeded once or twice.\"bad data is worse than no data at all\"",

As they say, twice can be coincidence, three times is a pattern. So it's still to early too say whether this is a pattern based on 2 confirmed scenarios and 1 potential, even if looks convincing. It's a bit like the 2020 halving. Just because price increased twice before, doesn't mean it will happen a third time. Even though that's exactly what happened.PS - You forgot to put time-frame: Weekly.Quote from: Wilhelm on July 25, 2022, 11:03:03 AMI think a 20 and 100 EMA is a way too short period to make any guesstimate. You need to cover the normal human cycle called \"a year\". And it is common knowledge that Bitcoin has a multiple year cycle.It's based on the Weekly chart, so the 100 EMA is close to 2 years. Otherwise you'd be right, as it'd have called a low at $47K",

And it is common knowledge that Bitcoin has a multiple year cycle.I am aware of that. Using EMA/MA's only, I was able to call for $21k when Price was at $48k and no one was willing to bet short with me.And as dragonvslinux mentioned, 100 EMA is 2 years average which is more than enough.Not saying this is the exact bottom, I myself think we are yet to see a bottom but this indicator has worked perfectly in past.And as 200 Weekly Moving Average failed to hold the price this cycle, this might also fail.Only time knows.",

I had thought you were a bit more bullish than that. I'm currently at 60% believing the bottom is in, based on my own arbitrary data.

Therefore more likely to go lower if it doesn't. I'm however pretty confident it can be reclaimed this week, now that the RSI has left weekly oversold conditions. Miners still need to get their shit together though (no offence to anyone here).Also.Quote from: Wilhelm on July 25, 2022, 11:03:03 AMTA is useless if you don't take the macro picture into account.If more \"bearish\" CPI news arrives that causes a 10% pump in price, then I welcome it",

Personally I think we ignore a single exchange's BTC price when it deviates from the norm. At least based on Index's average price weighted by volume, Bitcoin didn't make a new low. Otherwise we start considering Bitmex going to $0 and other nonsense.",
