      "body": "Update!https://gov.gmx.io/t/grant-request-gmx-tsp-exchange-proposal/2341GMX <> Tsp.exchange ProposalProposal DescriptionTsp.exchange which a novel decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator APP. Our core goal is to offer users a trading experience akin to that of centralized exchanges (CEX), while ensuring the transparency and security inherent to decentralized exchanges (DEX).To achieve this goal, weâ€™ve addressed two pivotal challenges of DEX:By adopting the 4337 protocol, weâ€™ve significantly simplified user private key management, thereby reducing the complexity of using a DEX.Our user interface is designed to closely resemble CEXs, ensuring users donâ€™t have to alter their trading habits.Despite GMXâ€™s advanced technology and philosophy, its end-user base remains limited. We believe this is primarily due to its user experience differing significantly from mainstream centralized exchanges like Binance and OKX. This is where Tsp.exchange comes into play, addressing this core issue for GMX. This collaboration is not only mutually beneficial but also synergistic, and we believe it will resonate with the community members.Weâ€™ve successfully integrated with GMX V1 and are currently in the beta testing phase. In the future, we plan to invite members of the GMX community to participate in this beta test. Simultaneously, weâ€™re also planning to integrate with GMX V2. However, due to financial constraints, this plan faces challenges. If GMX can provide financial support or consider investing in us, it would greatly expedite our development process.A successful grant application will not only bolster our product promotion and brand endorsement but will also drive more users and traffic to GMX.",
