  "content": "Bitcoin halvingDetails: Bitcoin halving is the major event that has been happening every four years since its first halving in 2012 and will continue until the last halving in 2140. Bitcoin halving reduces the block rewards for miners and increases bitcoin's scarcity, which eventually leads to an increase in the price of bitcoin over time.Impact: Bitcoin halving increases bitcoin's scarcity and reduces the injection rate of new bitcoin into circulation, which causes a major price appreciation for bitcoin. Evidence: It is historically proven that after every bitcoin halving, the market rallies up and initiates a bull run. For example, after Bitcoin halving in may 2020, the price of Bitcoin went up almost 700%.Pros:Reduction of inflationIncreases demandIncrease network Security   Cons:Lower mining rewardsIncrease volatility due to reduction of new bitcoin supplyBitcoin ETFDetails: An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that is traded on a traditional stock exchange. The Bitcoin ETF tracks the real-time price of bitcoin, which is issued by asset managers who purchase bitcoin from the spot market, bundle them together, and offer their customers shares of that bundled bitcoin. These shares are exchangeable on the traditional stock market. Impact: Bitcoin ETFs are regulated by the SEC, so investors feel secure investing by thinking their investments are protected by law. Bitcoin ETF’s share is tradable to the stock exchange market, so some investors feel comfortable buying this share instead of real bitcoin, which needs to be stored and secured by the users. Evidence: World-largest asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco, Valkyrie like asset manager applied for the bitcoin ETF, and many analysts predict that it will be approved just before the halving. Pros:Can be brought as a share.RegulatedTax efficiencyCons:Investors can't hold real bitcoin.Higher feesThey have no control over their fund.Regulation:Details: The regulation of bitcoin is still lacking in clarity, and Sec. is working on regulating this financial sector. Without clear regulation institutional investors will hesitate to invest in bitcoin for any possible downgrade. Impact: Institutional investors will be more confident about investing in bitcoin. Merchants can accept bitcoin as payment from their customers. Bitcoin-centric fraudulent and scam activity will be nominal. Evidence: The USA has already classified bitcoin as a commodity. El Salvador declared bitcoin a legal tender. Canada treats bitcoin like other commodities for taxation.Pros:Increased investor confidenceReduced scams and fraudulent activityInstitutional involvementCons:CentralizationReduced privacyAdoptionDetails: As more merchants start to accept bitcoin as a form of payment, their customers start investing in bitcoin likewise. This adoption has increased significantly over the past 3 years. Impact: The ever-growing acceptance of bitcoin in the local market has spread awareness and adoption of it. Customers will hastily try to acquire more bitcoin, which will lead to a bitcoin price appreciation. Evidence: According to VanEck, the price of bitcoin has outperformed the Nasdaq, the S&P 500, and gold for the past 3 years. Pros: Increased cash inflow.Reduced volatilityLegitimacy in the open marketIncreased financial freedomCons: Slow transactionSecurity risk due to a lack of basic knowledgeTechnological advancementsDetails: Technological advancements in the bitcoin network will offer a more convenient environment for local businesses to integrate the bitcoin payment network into their businesses. Impact: Upgrades in security, scalability, and interoperability will increase the number of bitcoin-centric startups and small businesses. Advanced smart contracts will allow bitcoin developers to create featureful dapps. Evidence: To increase the scalability and security of the bitcoin network,  Covenants upgrade has been proposed, which will introduce more advanced features like Pre signed transactions, Mitigation of Double-Spending and programmable smart contracts in the bitcoin network. The SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT upgrade will increase transaction speed and make it more cost-efficient. Pros:Increased scalability and security.Introduce new use cases. Cons:Increase network complexity There are other possible scenarios or events that can occur and shift the market in a whole new direction. These are just some of the catalyst events that could happen in the future.",

      "body": "This is a good compilation of objectives for bull periods in bitcoin. Although the first one which is halving is the only concrete case that can rally a real bull period but the rest could just be a little bit more of sideways movement. Quote from: Sophokles on September 24, 2023, 07:27:39 PM Bitcoin ETF’s share is tradable to the stock exchange market, so some investors feel comfortable buying this share instead of real bitcoin, which needs to be stored and secured by the users.Although they are many people that do not want to hold there funds by themselves but if you look at the cases surrounding custodianship to other people the risk is more compared to when you hold the funds your self. This ETF companies seems more like leaving ones coin on exchanges not that they will lose it but what if the company faces challenges, that in turn will also affect the share holders, although it could be rare but nothing is impossible.  Quote from: Sophokles on September 24, 2023, 07:27:39 PMRegulation:Pros:Increased investor confidenceReduced scams and fraudulent activityInstitutional involvementIt will certainly seems like government regulated entities reduce scams but I don’t think it actually does reduce any crime because up till now the government banks are things scammers still use, although bitcoin is a new technology so it is where the scammers will be currently focused on but that doesn’t mean it is different from the other entities regulated. The government just spread this stereotype just to get bitcoin regulated and to tame or watch some people",

I think regulation holds the key to how bitcoin will evolve in the future. It can be in the top of technological advancement or an outlaw in the global finance. Without a distinct and amicable regulation real adoption won't arrive. Quote from: Zaguru12 on September 24, 2023, 07:55:52 PMQuote from: Sophokles on September 24, 2023, 07:27:39 PMRegulation:Pros:Increased investor confidenceReduced scams and fraudulent activityInstitutional involvementIt will certainly seems like government regulated entities reduce scams but I don’t think it actually does reduce any crime because up till now the government banks are things scammers still use, although bitcoin is a new technology so it is where the scammers will be currently focused on but that doesn’t mean it is different from the other entities regulated.

Sure the stock market indices look healthy but if you remove the top 10 companies on the Sp500 the actual gain is maybe 3-4% or so. Many companies are hitting 52 week lows.We got bad inflation, rates might go up again one more time before year end, and we still got geopolitical issues to deal with. So with all this, I don’t see FOMO starting sometime next month or so.",

They are processes.I'm sure that the BTC halving and the Bitcoin ETF approval(if approved) can cause some hype and even a FOMO phase, but I'm not so optimistic about mass global BTC adoption and the governments making better crypto regulations, which are in favor of Bitcoin(and the altcoins).I expect the crypto regulatory frame to become even more restrictive and bureaucratic. This will make crypto adoption even harder than it used to be.What do you mean by \"technological advancement\" in regards to Bitcoin? Do you really think that the scalability issue will the solved and Bitcoin will become even more user-friendly? I'm not an optimist about this.",

P2p transactions will increase if more people begin to use Bitcoin, having more nations like El Salvador will be good for the market. Bitcoin halving and Bitcoin ETF will just bring the needed hype to temporarily push the price. If more advanced technologies can increase the speed of transactions, reduce the cost of transactions and make the system more secure, it will increase investment in Bitcoin.

The same thing will happen to btc.Government regulations increase investors' confidence since some people will never invest in the sectors unless they have government guarantees. Some people want the bitcoin business to be regulated like fiat banks. Regulation is not bad but people should be given the option to choose between centralization and decentralization. People should not be forced to close their privacy.",

Regulation means we are eliminating the very purpose of why Satoshi created bitcoin. Some people might say, bitcoin cannot be the future unless it's regulated. Well, let's see about that. Regulation may add more security to it's holders, but it will never going to prevent the spread of scams.
