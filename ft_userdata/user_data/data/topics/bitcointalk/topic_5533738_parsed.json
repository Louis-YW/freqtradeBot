I am just curious because it is not every bitcoin enthusiasts that can devote it treasury times and funds just to spread the awareness of bitcoin.Also, you have asked for partnership on this project, so what would as well be their profit returns as delegates on the project?What I know verily about bitcoin speculation is that it is every enthusiasts task to do as individual delegation with no profits of returns unless your aim is to lure audience or free donations to appreciate your impacts otherwise, I will say this your speculation project should be one you can carry on alone and if genuinely, some other interested persons my want to be partnered with you. I am just of the input that bitcoin speculation is an individual task and must not be turned alike to selfishness.",

      "body": "My interest in this project isn’t driven by speculation—it’s about making Bitcoin a natural part of everyday life. Over the past three years, I’ve witnessed how BTC empowers financial sovereignty and transforms lives. I’m committed to spreading Bitcoin adoption because I believe in its ability to liberate people from the traditional financial system.This project is funded by a longtime Bitcoiner who’s held BTC for 12 years and supports our research. My partner Richard and I have developed a compact digital tipping device powered by the Lightning Network so that when a BTC holder tips, its in-built configurable split payment function instantly and transparently divides the tip among all staff. In this way, every micro-tip—measured in sats—accumulates over time, empowering your team to build their BTC balance without having to purchase Bitcoin. This also addresses one of the largest problems with tips, transparent and fair tip splitting. We also encourage the tip accepting business to move the BTC off the lightning platform as often as possible to constantly keep up the not your keys not your BTC policy we practice ourselves.  For partners, particularly distributors, the model is designed to be mutually beneficial. Distributors can acquire these devices at a highly subsidized rate of $15 per unit (from a $30 production cost) and install them at no cost to the business. Once deployed, you remain permanently linked to the device and earn 50% of the 15% platform fee on every tip. Even if each device nets around $1 a day, that revenue covers costs and creates a passive income stream, with the potential for significant growth as Lightning adoption increases. There are about 200 devices in inventory and I am comfortable sending about 4 free devices (anymore than that would need to paid for, this would be to show you how it goes) to anyone who would be interested in being a part of the distribution network.This initiative is about capturing the Bitcoin already circulating in vibrant communities—through local meetups, conventions, and everyday transactions—and redirecting it to empower employees. It’s not about chasing speculative profits; it’s about a sustainable, grassroots movement that benefits everyone involved.I truly appreciate your perspective on Bitcoin speculation being an individual task. In contrast, this project aims to harness collective action to build a robust Bitcoin ecosystem. If you’re interested in exploring this further, I’d be happy to discuss it more.",

Our project isn’t about forcing anyone into a separate network or renting channels—it’s about harnessing the power of Lightning to capture the Bitcoin already flowing in our communities. The core strength is in its configurable split payment function. This isn’t just tech for tech’s sake; it’s designed for complete transparency. Every tip is split instantly among all staff, putting Bitcoin directly into their pockets without any hassle or room for misappropriation (no more stealing from the tip jar). That’s exactly what transparency is meant for.Yes, we use units like millisats and LN invoice data—that’s simply how the Lightning Network operates, enabling instant, low-cost transactions that the base layer can’t match. Our device is designed to capture micro-tips from genuine BTC holders at meetups, conventions, and everyday venues, splitting the tip transparently among all staff and putting Bitcoin directly into their pockets.This isn’t some gimmick or speculative side hustle. It’s a practical tool to make Bitcoin accessible, allowing people to accumulate BTC without having to buy it upfront. We’re relying on the natural trickle-down effect of Bitcoiners who, with their goodwill, willingly tip small amounts—each tip contributing to grassroots adoption and real financial empowerment.Our focus is on using the strengths of Lightning to turn every tip into a stepping stone towards a broader Bitcoin standard. Rather than dealing in “costume jewelry,” we’re capturing real BTC from active users and channeling it into everyday transactions. If you’re stuck on traditional models, you might be missing the innovative potential of microtransactions in driving widespread BTC adoption.",

It is even more fun if someone is involved independently in the investment process that is being done so that they don't have to think about other people's steps in it. Is there something you are looking for in the telegram channel or are you looking to sell trading signals like many do. Don't be offended, I just asked and forget it if the question is not useful to you.",

      "body": "Look, you say they “can’t even buy their kids candy” with these microtips, but you’re missing the point. Our device splits every tip instantly, so even tiny sats add up over time into real Bitcoin. We urge you to move the BTC off the dashboard by generating an on-chain address with your cold storage wallet, transfer your sats from the system which has a withdraw function, and verify the transaction—securing true BTC that accumulates gradually. This isn’t about flashy payouts; it’s about building BTC without having to buy it upfront. Every sat counts, and as Lightning adoption grows, these microtips will turn into significant value. Instead of dismissing our approach as worthless, recognize that we’re empowering everyday users with genuine, transparent Bitcoin ownership.Furthermore I do agree that this post is relevant to the service section as well, my goal isn’t to set up an investment scheme but to drive Bitcoin adoption by making BTC accessible through a practical service. I work for a wealthy Bitcoiner who’s dedicated to educating people about BTC’s true value—its ability to grant financial sovereignty and help you break free from a system designed to keep us from achieving abundance.The tipping device, powered by Lightning, is a service tool—not a speculative investment. It captures circulating BTC in everyday venues and automatically splits every tip among staff, enabling them to build sats over time without having to purchase Bitcoin. Any earnings are simply used to sustain and grow the project, ensuring that the device remains free for tip-accepting businesses and that distributors are rewarded for their efforts as well.This is a grassroots, service-driven initiative focused solely on empowering communities and demonstrating Bitcoin’s practical utility. If you’re interested in discussing this as a service and helping spread Bitcoin adoption, I’m open to a genuine conversation.",
