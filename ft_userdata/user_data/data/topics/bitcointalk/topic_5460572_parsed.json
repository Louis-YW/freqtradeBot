They are less in number than average and poor people, but they spend more. In a population of 100%, likely the highly rich people may not be more than 20%, while 30% can be the average and 50% the people that are not rich at all. If what I said is not accurate because it can differ from places to places, more people will still fall under average and poor. So who do you expect to gamble more? They are the average and poor people because they are more in population. Also that, highly rich people are not likely to gamble if comparing it with average and poor people. Poor people do gamble to risk little, expecting that one day they will hit the jackpot. But some can be addicted.",

If you research why people gamble you will have different responses from respondents. Many people gamble because they see gambling as a source of income to meet their basic needs. Their main motivation for gambling is to get quick money. I high number of these set of people are found in poor countries where there is a high rate of unemployment and poverty. These set of people resort to gambling because they have nowhere to get income. While another set of people gamble because of fun and entertainment. And you can find the majority of them are in prosperous nations where unemployment is minimal. I think the poor gamble more than the poor because most poor people depend on luck to get riches. Some people don't care about hard work but believe in luck. But most of the rich have an understanding of how to get wealth so the don't depend on fate but work hard to get wealth. Many rich people don't also have spare time to gamble but the poor have all the time to engage in betting.",

There would be some rich people that would have gambling addiction too, but they may be able to calculate their risks and not spend more than what can affect them. There are also rich people that have become poor because of gambling. I believe that anyone can become a gambling addict, be it rich or poor. But one thing about the people that are rich is that they believe more in what is letting them to make money and gambling is not one of them, unlike the poor people that can think of gambling as a way to make money, causing the addiction.",

The host has a higher chance of winning and gamblers always has this chance on winning but the chance of losing is much greater. That kind of mindset is straight wrong and I think it's the opposite of what he should really consider. if your money is not suffucient, finding a way to consistently earn money to address your need is a must thing to do and choosing to gamble is just the plain opposite of the thing that person should do.",

After all, there are less rich people in the world, so they must be the minor portion in many other activities and statistics as well. The point is that rich people are the ones who move the gambling industry, because they spend much more than the other classes combined. While a middle class gambler plays few bucks a week, a rich gambler is placing huge bets, sometimes above the 1$ million mark, while the poor gambler is only buying lottery tickets with the few pennies he has to spend.Maybe with the phenomenon of online gambling, and sportsbook more specifically, we tend to see the impact of rich gamblers decreasing compared to to the total sum wagered by middle class gamblers, as betting has become easier and more accessible to everyone.",

Probably not, because the majority of the participants in such games are hoping to turn their lives around; someone who is already wealthy doesn't need that. Thus, I've noticed that poorer people tend to gamble in an attempt to earn money, anticipating that eventually they'll get lucky and at least win a decent amount of money. It's almost certain that you'll win a few times, but the issue with this mindset and gambling is that the odds are often against you, and eventually, you'll lose what you've previously gained.Wealthier people, on the other hand, may gamble as a hobby, for the adrenaline boost, or to portray their wealth.",

However, amount-wise rich are spending way more than the lower class probably. Rich people are rich for a reason, they usually don't play the games that are going to make them poor in the long run. (in other words they only play the games which they are going to win) That's called mathematics. The poor are usually dumb and they think they can game the system. Each of them think he/she is the one special snowflake. 99 times out of 100 that's not true as you know. Since the poor usually own anything (hence the name poor) they wager everything they get every month and that makes them even poorer.",

The really wealthy may be more likely to gamble than the rest of us since they can afford to lose more money. While the odds of winning are low in comparison to their wealth, many people gamble for reasons other than financial gain.Gambling adds yet another layer of complexity to the situation. High-frequency trading in the stock market, which some people consider to be gambling, is very different from a low-stakes poker game between friends. When do we say enough is enough?As for exact percentages, they are hard to come by. The taboo nature of gambling results in underreporting of the habit.
