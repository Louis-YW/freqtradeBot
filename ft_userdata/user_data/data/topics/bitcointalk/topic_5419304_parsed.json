So you should have the backup seed somewhere, isn't it? That should be the first to check.Then, unless you had a Linux with no persistence, the files should be there, maybe not even deleted.So, if neither the seed, nor the path shown by BitMaxz don't give anything useful, you should tell a bit more about what you've done there.",

Most live OS'es use a \"ramdisk\" where the harddisk is actually just your RAM in disguise (which is cleared every reboot).You wrote down your seed, right? Given that you had access to your wallet for so long, I don't see how you could've failed to write it down.",

Did you have RBF enabled in the settings? If so, you should be able to increase the fees of the transaction. Go to the history tab -> select your transaction (right click) -> bump fee.",

BTC went out from my wallet but transaction not confirmed (no-one confirmation) and on recipients wallet it shows but can't spend. More than 8 hours. What to do?It will take a quite while to confirm because of the fee but it's not missing or anything. Just wait it out if it's not rush.This thread's topic isn't related to your issue, by the way. It's not lost or will be lost.We're in Electrum board so I take that it's sent using Electrum...If so, you can try to use replace-by-fee to increase its transaction fee, right-click on the transaction and click \"Increase fee\".Set the new transaction fee, click \"Sign\" and then \"Broadcast\".If Electrum is the recipient that can't spend unconfirmed coins, untick your setting \"Tools->Preference->Transactions->Spend only confirmed coins\".You'll be able to spend it after disabling that.Better off, set a quite larger fee when spending it to bump the parent transaction's fee rate.",

The mempool is congested. Maybe keep an eye on https://mempool.space/ now and then. With some luck it may be confirmed before Monday.Option 2. Increase fee, as nc50lc explained.Option 3. You or the recipient do CPFP. That means to spend one of the unconfirmed coins (the recipient can spend with the right wallet software and the right settings), using a very high fee (to cover for the new tx and also for your 1sat/vByte tx too)PS. Next time make your own topic, don't hijack others', especially since it's a different issue.",
