Whenever an argument starts looking like it was written by a lawyer, or relying overmuch on precedent, you've stopped thinking about the real case and have started using rules to retreat into moral and intellectual laziness, divorcing yourself from the decision you're about to make. If you're making a decision about a case, then you're responsible for that case, and you can't say, \"I don't agree with it, but I was just enforcing the rules.\" Every case needs to be handled individually.",

Also, when copying and pasting text, a user comment must be present.
