  "content": "Hi Been wondering how to tell we have reached the crypto bottom? have we already bottomed out(I personally don't think so im not sure). If we look at the current world financial system - it looks dire. surely this will all have a impact on people investing in crypto and when funds are short, may even withdraw their investment. Personally, because of the state of the financial system, I cannot see how crypto can become bullish as long as the world economy doesn't show signs of a recovery . I could be wrong though ?what are your thoughts on this? Is a further crash on the horizon?",

We can always look at previous trends, what has been anounced in regards of crypto developement, what are general economic trends in the whole world and then maybe get in the ballpark.",

Nobody will tell you that because many things depend on people's decisions. If the US government continues to destroy the stock market, we will have a crash and a recession. Does it mean bitcoin will crash? Again, we don't  know because bitcoin is already below 200 WMA and it already was below the level of miner capitulation. It doesn't have much crashing space left at over -70% from the top. My opinion is that if stocks keep crashing bitcoin will be crashing less because it already did a hard correction. It became more oversold than it ever was. People were anticipating the worst and whoever was considering selling with a loss did it 2 weeks ago. Eventually people will start to move their money from other assets into cheap bitcoin that at 20k USD has a much greater potential to go up than most stocks.",

It is your own strategies on how to optimize your possible profits in this market. Just like when btc went down to 17k range, if you bought it at that level, you are in profit today.But for someone to know when we will exactly hit the rock bottom, no one can do that up until today.",

Unless, somehow everyone pulls their money from the stock market, to invest in crypto. Which is very unlikely.As long as everyone stays positive, the market will too. In trading terms, most of the world has to go \"long\" on the future   Hopefully most people will see the current market as an \"opportunity\" instead of shorting it.It's impossible to be certain tho.",

It's a little hard to judge and see the crypto market at its lowest point, basic.I'm talking about the experience, from the experience of the past few years, the market plummeted at its lows, usually those lows lasted 6-8 months, all types of coins are not moving, but at the moment I don't see that, there is still some movement of a few percent up, I believe it hasn't bottomed out yet, maybe it will continue.",

It basically traded sideways for months and people basically gave up due to boredom and sold… and that was the bottom.Most likely it will be a similar situation here. Especially given that we are in the summer months and stock markets are also starting to get little volatility. Most likely nothing exciting will happen until the Q3 and maybe crypto will bottom then.",

Either it was the recent $17k, or if we will have a subsequent dip, it can't go much lower than $17k as there are too many people who find the price cheap at those levels and buy.Over time if you follow the markets you learn to identify when the top and the bottom are near: when people talk about the world ending and going to 0, the bottom is near. On the other hand, when people keep opening threads asking you what will be the record of the ath. $150k, $250k, $400k etc. and how fast we will get there, it is close to the top.",

Even though we can't predict accurately, we can find a point where we can enter the market by buying at that price and if the price still drops from our predicted price, it won't be a problem. But if you trade and analyze often, your feeling will be able to guess the basic price that can be achieved by bitcoin and it will be close to the market price.

For bitcoin price, maybe $17k is the bottom price for a while because we do not know if the price can get down again or bounce to the high price. But if you want to invest in bitcoin, the price now is still worth it to buy bitcoin. Even if the price goes down again like before, that will be your chance to buy bitcoin at a lower price.

      "body": "I've always found it pretty easy to spot the bottom in the past.  There's usually an unmistakable moment where capitulation is obvious and clear.  This cycle was a little different because the nature of the crash wasn't retail panic, and instead was orchestrated by big players squeezing out overleveraged entities.  So we had a capitulation moment, but it was sloppier than what we've typically seen in the past.  While I would have preferred a massive volume spike and huge drop instead of the slow bouncing around for a couple days, it does seem like FTX has stepped in to be the lender of last resort and put a bottom on the market to limit further selling.  While the ultimate bottom may be lower than what we saw recently, the downside vs upside has me thinking that now isn't a bad time to be buying and even if we fall from here, you're looking at a possible 50% loss in a near worst case scenario, while the best case scenario which has been playing out for years has upside closer to x10.  Worth it in my opinion.",

As per my understanding it is possible to understand whether the market has turned bearish or bullish with continued price movement happening for certain time period. When the market is on the bearish trend we need to just focus on the price move and set a bottom target according to our mind and go for a buying. This is how I fix the bottom, sometimes it coincides with the perfect bottom with little variation over/under.",
