Then, you'll need to use a bridge to transfer your BTC from the Ethereum (erc20) network to the Bitcoin network. Previously, Multichain was a good option, but currently, it's not available due to their CEO's arrest. Now, you can consider checking out the wanchain bridge or other suitable alternatives. Keep in mind that using these bridges carries some risks. If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you.",

You can use a CEX that doesn't require KYC verification, for example, Bitget. First, deposit ETH, then you can convert it to BTC and withdraw it using the Bitcoin network. Just keep in mind that there's a daily limitation on withdrawals for all CEXs without KYC verification. It's $50K per day for Bitget.",

But due the privacy, @OP don't want his activity like (IP Internet, address, and other things) about himself, transaction, and amount can be trackable. Cross-chain bridge is the only solution, P2P with other user are quite really hard to be found with a huge transaction. Now we have cross-chain, so better just using a cross-chain rather than P2P with other users. Some of user already giving a good advice from which service are good to be used for cross-chain like THORSwap, only the fee are quite high but sometime that the price you need to pay for privacy.",
