Also you can look into digital world if you are those that doesn't panic in every single invest, meaning you have to target some coin or tokens that could likely give you about 10x or more.

Most of those are lies as well, I do agree with the one talking about here, I wouldn't take any advice on \"how to get rich\" from people here, but I wouldn't really ask it to rich people neither to be fair.Elon for example got money from daddy first, sold a software company that his friends built, then he bought a car company others built, and he got rich, what could he tell me? Or Jeff Bezos, got 250k in 90's from his parents, great job turning that into tens of billions of dollars, surely, but what could he tell me? Mark? Built a website that went public for hundreds of billions of dollars, should I build a website too? Is that it? Basically no rich nor poor person could advice you, you have to find yourself, everyone has their own path to success.",

No doubt about that. Bitcoin even controls the market. But there are some new altcoins with real usecase that move faster in price at early stage.

This exchange is safe and sometimes least coins with good use cases at a very low market cap. They are also transparent with thier wallets/Assets.",

It can happen but that's by chance. The number of it happening is really infinitesimal. To be rich in cryptos, you don't have to be greedy to the point of bloating your expectations. By that I mean, you don't expect your $100 investment to afford you something like 1000% as ROI. It can also happen but don't let such be your expectations. You've to learn and know when to take profit. You can do that percentage sales of let's say 25% per each sale. Don't sell off everything whenever you're taking profit. Leave something on the table. The last, only gems can fetch you unimaginable ROI but you've to know how to identify these gems. This is where research becomes important.",

Investing in crypto and thinking of being profitable will take time. What I just realized when I've seen Dogecoin and thought of it somewhere around 2016 was that I should buy it since it's a known meme coin even back then, if I bought millions of it with little capital, then I'd be totally rich when it has reached all-time high and even it is no longer on the ATH, I'd still consider myself rich if ever I've got that millions of Dogecoin bought on that year and held up to present time. Many have thought of the same and with bitcoin as well, it will take time.",

New alts can offer this better but their risk are also very high.This is why they are not being advised especially if you are only just a newbie because you don't know how to play their game and you might lack of speed to sell your coin before it collapses. Don't know if you are shilling MEXC there but no doubt it's one of the top/safe exchanges nowadays. It's great if they are transparent. This is one of the things that are needed because so many exchanges are now collapsing. If only they are transparent about their funds, people can act quicker.",
