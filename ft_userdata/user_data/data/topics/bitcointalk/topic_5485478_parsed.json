  "content": "https://www.talkimg.com/images/2024/02/17/YSJBz.jpegI just stumbled upon this recently. After 15 years of Bitcoin the US has officially granted an honorary degree to Satoshi, what does this mean?  This confirms the advancement of payment methods and is completely legal with Bitcoins in particular and Blockchain technology in general; crypto has been recognized and award has been given to the invisible satoshi Nakamoto . This something should has been considered a long time  here",

(*though these ratifications/recognitions, always came with extended terms of uses)",

If it was actually true it would have been the discussion of today and alot of thread related would have being posted. Thanks for the clarity.Quote from: Despairo on February 17, 2024, 12:02:36 PMIt's a big joke they're saying Bitcoin is a new economic freedoms when they're the one who try to destroy the freedoms by adopting it in centralized institutions e.g. ETFs. Moreover SEC taking down mixers and want to censor everything related to privacy. They finding all means to take control but they cannot. Bitcoin was built as  decentralised. That even it's father ( maker) don't have control over it. That will bitcoin will keep on growing. And thanks also for contributing in this post",
