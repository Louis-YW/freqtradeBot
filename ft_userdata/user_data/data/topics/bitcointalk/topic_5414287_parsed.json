  "content": "Hi AllI have a few modular/semi modular PC psu's and was thinking of using the Â to pwer some S9 miners with 2 cards. Most of what i have are 1000w or higher.They will be worthless selling so might be better put to use on some S9s powered with2 cards, so i would need x7 ouputs all together.I think i could use an existing hard wired PCIE (6 pin or not) to power the control board.Then on the dedicated high amp PCIE modular ouputs could i not solder on connections and 'share' the load so x2 on each output?I have only seen x8 to x2 PCIE cables so could i not just splice in and solder another?If this works i could do a few more miers in thsi set up as it would be low power and quite when set to 700/800w.Anyone done this or got an opinion on it?The PSU's will either go to waste tbh.Pics attached.https://imgur.com/a/Kdjxb0vThanks",

      "body": "To be honest, modular plug PSU's all have 1 major problem: They are pushing the maximum current rating through the contacts and generally have only 18ga wires between the PSU and PCIe plugs.Ok, that's 2 major problems...That said, since you are talking about running at reduced power it may not be an issue, just periodically check to see how warm the PSU connectors get. Yes, I've had a few rather spectacularly fry over the years from when I used them to power s3's & s5's...Other thing to keep in mind is that particular PSU has 2 independent output rails. DO NOT connect power from the 2 different rails to 1 hash board! They will be shorted together and fight each other.",

      "body": "@NotFuzzyWarmYes i will be running only 2 boards @ 700w or 800w.Is that why 'common rail' modular PSUs are so expensive?The only PSUs i can see that have enough outputs (X7) are the EVGA ones and they are silly money, i'm surprised that nobody has found a decent PSU and 'modded' them for more outputs tbh.....I just can't find makes that suffice apart from that brand?I think if i open it i can see rails and go from there, 3 on each for the hash boards and an existing 12v ouput for the control board.Thanks for the advice.",
