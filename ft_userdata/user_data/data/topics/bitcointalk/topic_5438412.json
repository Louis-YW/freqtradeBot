  "content": "Hello dear moderators and admins, sorry for disturbing you but I have a little issue concerning the cooper membership. I sent 0.00152157 BTC for a copper membership but they asked me to add 0.00000711 BTC which is about 0.18 USD. I don't know why.The problem is not about 0.00000711 BTC but I can't send this little amount with my wallet because it's too small (the minimum amount that I can be sent is 15 dollars).Could you please talk to an admin for I can have my copper membership without paying the 0.18 usd (0.00000711 BTC)There is the proof of payment and the message that I got from the forum:You have paid a total of 0.00152157 BTC. This is reflected in the above prices. (To get the normal price, add this amount to the above prices.)Pay to the Bitcoin address 33icBemkQhgQ3XdL8t1Uar72b6mcT1xhki. Once your transaction has 1 confirmation, revisit this page and then use the form which will appear in order to wear your new membership. Your transaction will not be accepted until it has 1 confirmation. Bitcoin network fees and exchange/wallet withdrawal fees will not count toward your payment.Please help me. and thank you again.",

Are you using a custodial wallet or an exchange? Never keep your coins on centralized platforms, it is not your key, not your coin on blockchain.",

      "body": "Try using a different wallet, if your wallet doesn't allow you to send lower than 15$, maybe you are using a wallet controlled by a company or person. First move some coins from your wallet to electrum wallet then send the required amount to the wallet address you have to send to buy a cooper membership.With electrum wallet it is very much possible to send 0.18$ or lower. If you use an exchange for the purpose of storing your coins, move them immediately to a decentralized wallet or electrum wallet.",

All you have to do is download the Electrum wallet from here https://electrum.org/, transfer $15 to it, and then you can transfer any amount using that wallet.After you make sure that your device is safe, you can transfer all your coins to it, or you can buy a hardware wallet.If you don't have enough money and admins doesn't answer, donating less than a dollar to you won't be a problem, so say you wouldn't be able to pay and I'd send it from my wallet.",

I don't know why.This is because the current rate for Cooper membership is 0.00152868.This could have occured due to the drop in the Bitcoin price which causes the rates for payments on the forum to adjust inorder to maintain a certain amount range.The solution here is sending above the required balance so the transaction can be initiated or getting another wallet which allows you transact much lower amounts. It's a lot of hassle for such a small amount (and it would be cool if the admins could wave it off), but it might be necessary if you're currently using an exchange wallet for storage, which is the likely reason you cannot send such small amounts.",

And if you eventually get your hands on the perfect wallet to use, make sure you don't omit the required payment figure to avoid complications during confirmation if need be.There's not such much difference, both of Trust wallet and Safepal mobile wallet are closed source and often charge more fees which is not recommended to use. There are a lot guide by forum members [1] [2] [3], if the @OP is really can't use Electrum, then he can use Bluewallet.Another thing there's no such gas fee in Bitcoin, don't mix shitcoin terms and Bitcoin terms, it will confuse a newbie including @OP.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3456040.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5351743.0[3] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5240594.0",
