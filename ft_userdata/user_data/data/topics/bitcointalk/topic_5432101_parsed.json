That's probably their step to curb high inflation and to right against the currency devaluation. Which country you are referring to? El-Salvador? QuoteNo matter what the reason is, inflation is already very serious now. If some unscrupulous governments print a lot of money in order to repay debts and fight inflation, of course it will not be one time. Credit money no longer has credit.Money printing is not a solution to repay debts. That leads to hyper inflation like Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Rather adding bitcoin as a reserve currency, may help that country to repay their debt during next bull cycle. Probably that's another reason the government is adding bitcoins in their reserve.",

Buying a decent financial asset isn't the same as wasting the money for nothing.I don't think that it would be possible to buy BTC by using the national currency of some underdeveloped country. Bitcoin is mostly being bought by using stable fiat currencies like US dollar, euro, British pound, etc. Such government would have to print money in order to buy a stable fiat currency first, which will eventually devalue the national currency and cause hyperinflation.There's nothing wrong with buying Bitcoin in itself, the only wrong thing is printing money out of thin air, in order to buy Bitcoin.",

      "body": "There are a couple of problems that they will face. For starters printing money, regardless of where it is spent, will eventually cause inflation so there is no benefit in buying bitcoin when the currency is dumping hard against it and the country's economy is crashing down.Secondly, bitcoin price would start rising fast if someone starts buying large amounts and it will then cause a chain effect where others seeing the rise would start panic buying shooting the price down. So before they know it they have to print even more money to buy the same amount of coins they planned because the price will have gone to the moon.Finally, not all bitcoins are for sale. Only a fraction of it is available on exchanges to be sold if someone is making huge purchases and cashing them out, the supply shortage on exchanges would be an even bigger force to push the price to the moon.In short price would be multi million dollar per coin before they could even fill their coffers.",

I have some sympathy for Bukele, but so far, the decision to purchase bitcoins at an average price of around $31k was not a good decision. He would get praise if bitcoin shot up, so, on the same token, he should be to blame if the bitcoin price takes an adverse direction.There's a big difference between having the balls to take risks with your own funds and wealth and risking someone elses' funds (aka taxpayers' money) pretty much without any responsibility in case of loss.",

People, corporations put their funds into different investments that they feel would bring in profits either in the short or long run. Inflation is rising slowly and if a government prints more money in order to service its international debts and “fight inflation”, then they’re being highly irresponsible. Printing more money to service debts would only create more problems for the country and definitely increase the inflation rate that they say they want to fight to reduce.",

Governments that monopolize money are usually in favor of supporting their currency-- not one that leaves them with less favor. It'd make more sense to print that money and give them to themselves (either directly or indirectly) rather than switching to the separation of money and state, just because they can acquire bitcoins more easier than the rest in that way (and for once).",
