  "content": "I just got to know crypto earlier this year because of NFT. Since then I have learned about crypto, blockchain, smart contracts, and others. and now I want to buy crypto, but I'm still confused about deciding which exchange to use. I see every exchange requires users to KYC. and here's the thing, I heard there are many cases about private data leak/hacking. so I want to choose a completely secure exchange. I don't want my personal data to be hacked. so can you guys suggest an exchange that has a good level of security.",

      "body": "@lupa tidur, is there maybe in your country some crypto ATM, or some physical exchange where there is no need for KYC for some smaller amounts? Although this way of buying cryptocurrencies is the most expensive because the fees are 5% +, many use it as an alternative to centralized crypto exchanges.You can also try the proposed DEX (BISQ or LocalCryptos), and one of the CEX that supposedly does not require KYC -> Code:https://www.kucoin.com/",
