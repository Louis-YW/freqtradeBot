      "body": "I think this is your second thread here in this forum,  I guess you had to create a new thread and abandon your first thread because some users called you out for your poor web designs and also for accepting different projects  without having to scrutinize those project thoroughly. Now that you have created a new thread how many of the previous suggestion did you take into play? Because from the look of things you didn't work on your web design it's still looks as shitty as before, and I haven't checked the projects that are currently listed in your website but with your Op I think you're still accepting any projects that comes to you with the $50 fee. That's not good as it will only lead to you listing scam coins in your website.",

      "body": "Thank you for your feedback. You are correct that I had to create a new thread due to some users' concerns about my web design and project vetting process. I take all feedback seriously and have worked to improve my services based on the feedback I have received.Regarding web design, I have made several improvements to my website since my previous thread, including updating the layout, color scheme, and user interface. I understand that design is subjective, but I am always open to feedback on how I can further improve the website's appearance and usability.As for project vetting, I assure you that I do thoroughly research and analyze every project before listing it on my site. I also have a strict policy against listing scam coins and only accept projects that meet certain criteria. I take my responsibility to my users very seriously and strive to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information possible.I appreciate your feedback and will continue to work on improving my services.",

      "body": "I'd recommend moving your thread over to the Altcoins > Service Announcements board, considering that it is not a project that directly focuses on using Bitcoin or adding any value to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Another suggestion is to first focus on richer data, rather than selling out to projects seeking to pay for attention. Create a reason for people to visit your site and digest its content before trying to monetize it, not the other way around. You'll gain frustration and grow tired of your project quickly if your approach is to try and use a new website as a means of advertising, without having any user base.Good luck with your project",

      "body": "I went through the website and as a developer, here are some things that I want to suggest that you should take care of before advertising.1. Images are loading very slowly which means they are not optimized at all. You can google how to optimize the images to reduce loading time.2. Your logo on the top left looks really cartoonish for a project which is based on investment, that targets the audience of age above 18 mostly.3. The color scheme is very silly and looks very dull, maybe you need a UI designer all over again?TBH we don't need any more solutions to the problems which are already solved.- https://coinmarketcap.com- https://www.coingecko.comThese are already good enough and no point in future I see where your project will overtake these, maybe an option is to start listing shitcoins and then they promote it for you? wastage of time and money overall.Good luck with the project.",

Payment is made only once and your listing remains for life.I don't think any investors will use this platform for lack of great features that can help investors and traders, I'll still go for the two top market aggregators.",
