You need to surround yourself with good people, move away from those who bring you sadness and change your place of work, life, which does not bring you joy. And most importantly, rejoice in your victories and do not stop. 'Cause life is cool",

What did he expect? Intelligent, honest, good people do exist, but you're probably not associating with the right people or in the right place. The world can be a great place once you get out of our dirty, consumerism-obsessed cities.",
