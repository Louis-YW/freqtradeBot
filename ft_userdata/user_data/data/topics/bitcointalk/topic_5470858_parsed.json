  "content": "Someone reported a truthful comment on reddit and I was \"warned\" for harassment.Pretty much it was a fat lady who was unemployed whining that her bf's mom told her off after they split up.Effectively, she went on to directly whine about it to the ex-bf... which kinda implies she's the clingy type who doesn't understand they were \"done\".Not only that, she lacked a driver's license and overfed her cat to the point of obesity.",
