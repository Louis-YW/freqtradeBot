  "content": "Hello guys! I just want to ask what gambling platform has the best UI (User Interface) and UX (user experience).Can you guys also give me at least your top three gambling platforms and why their UI/UX is something that you liked? I'm doing this as a research to enhance my skills in creating UI / UX.As for some people's reference, here's a list of current gambling platforms that has an ann thread in the forum:No.Website1Primedice.com2Freebitco.in3Sportsbet.io4Stake.com5Fortunejack.com6Cloudbet.com7Bitsler.com8Crypto.games9Roobet.com10Duelbits.com11Betfury.io12Rollbit.com13Betcoin.ag14Bitcasino.io15Wolf.bet16Windice.io17Betnomi.com18Blackjack.fun19Winz.io20Owl.games21Bitlucy.com",

      "body": "When it comes to sports stacks, I choose Sportsbet without hesitation (at least because I trust Steve, not to mention that their platform has zero transaction costs). When it comes to poker, I prefer Betnomi (though as far as I know the Betnomi are currently considering my proposal to do zero transaction costs).Other areas of gambling are of little interest to me.",

      "body": "I don't use half of these, but I will say that Sportsbet do have a nice search feature that a lot of other gambling websites don't seem to implement. I actually, don't like the way Sportsbet is set out with the categories, but the search feature makes up for it. Even fiat gambling websites don't tend to have a search feature like this. So, if you're going to be designing a gambling platform, it's probably worth considering. I imagine most users lean towards using the search function rather than going through the categories manually. Especially, when betting on obscure sports, that you might not be familiar with. For example, with the World Cup coming up you might know France are playing, but you might not know it's the qualifying or the actual world cup, so typing in \"France\", generally clears that up for you.",

For me I do like the new site much better. Other than that roobet.com is also cool it does look like you are playing a game online and not gambling, I also do like the selection of the game there. Sportsbet.io also have a nice user interface as well undoubtedly!! There is not just one website that I can actually choose but I do think that all these that I mentioned above does have a really good customer service as well, which I do appreciate the most.",

Its simplicity and easy on the eye colors catches my attention so much that I prefer to play on it over any other dice casinos that are popping up almost everywhere. For sports betting, that would be a solid yes on sportsbet.io, with stake.com being the closest second. Other gambling platforms and other casinos do not interests me, but somehow as of late, crash games are creeping up to my interests though I haven't really played a game of those just yet.",

Presently I have preferred to use Stake, you can try it out and see how the site is good. But I have also liked Sportbet. Cloudbet is also good. But if I have to choose two among them all that I listed, I will choose Stake and Sportbet, but other betting sites are also having good UI and UX.",

That is a nice bait to keep the users in the site.And since almost all the games use the same slots providers in that area there is not much to change, the experience is the same in any casino.",

Actually for me, being called and considered the best depends on how easy to browse the site's interface. I even prefer a minimal, simple yet organized design for all platforms. I won't mention those sites I preferred as the entire list is honestly good. Generally, the selection will be based on users' preferences. For newcomers, maybe pick one and see to themselves if they will have a good experience using that platform. After all, there's a respective ANN thread for them to see and check some reviews and feedback before playing at those sites.",

As far as all sites listed by the OP are concerned, I can vote for all of them to have a good user interface.Maybe the good question instead is, what are the sites with the worst UI/UX.

Looking at the list, these are all reputable sites I can say. I'm glad that veteran sites like Primedice, Freebitco.in and Cloudbet were still competing strongly up to this point. That's already a good reason for newbies to try these sites.",

They're also good for times when you have unstable internet connection.Most casinos UI pretty much have similar concepts. It's just down to colors and other small details to represent their brand.",
