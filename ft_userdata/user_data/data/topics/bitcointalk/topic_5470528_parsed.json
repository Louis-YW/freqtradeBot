Do you mean crypto? I have never used any of the services you mentioned, but I know both are custodial services. As mentioned by _act_ above, you should always use non-custodial wallet for keeping your bitcoin.In a non-custodial wallet, you have access to your private keys and you have full control over your fund. In a custodial wallet/centralized exchange, your fund in controlled by a third party.",

Electrum is an open-source non-custodial wallet. In electrum, you can create a wallet, send and receive bitcoin and have full control over your fund. In the case, you want to use electrum, download it only from its official website and verify your download.Quote from: boggym777 on October 16, 2023, 01:21:19 PMI also purchased a cold wallet, In a hardware wallet, the keys are kept offline and it can give you a good security. It may worth mentioning that electrum can be also used offline if you have an airgapped device. Of course, you may not need that, since you have a hardware wallet.Quote from: boggym777 on October 16, 2023, 01:21:19 PMhowever I understood that for mining a warm one should be better, and the excess funds to transfer to the cold one, right?There's nothing stopping you from receiving fund from a mining pool to your hardware wallet.",

How can you tell? unless you meant to say \"miners should use noncustodial wallets\".?OP.First thing first, this has nothing to do with mining, mining ends the moment the pool sends you your payout to the address you registered on the pool's portal, what happens next is Wallet related, so your subject does not belong here.To answer your question, you want to use a wallet in which you control the private keys, ditch all web-based wallets, and thing \"Exchange\", preferably a hardware wallet but then again not something like Ledger, your topic has been discussed a dozen times in the appropriate section of \"wallet software\".",
