DeepBit Forum Profile here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=43544Bitcoin Wiki source: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/DeepBitTheir site is still alive but it offers gaming strategies it looks like gambling I'm pretty sure the current owner is not the owner of the old Deepbit pool.",

      "body": "It's too bad that you didn't think of your mining rewards earlier. DeepBit was indeed a bitcoin mining pool back in the day. There are snapshots of the site on Wayback Machine that show how it used to look. Here are two examples from 2011 and 2013. The last capture I could access dates back to 2015. I am afraid that you won't have much luck in finding and getting in touch with the people who used to be in charge of this mining pool.",

Given that DeepBit was closed long ago, it's unlikely there’s any current access or contact available. ncedcloudlogin.comBest Regards,James Henry",
