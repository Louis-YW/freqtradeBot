You were rightly advised by other users to stick to \"bigger well-known exchanges.\" And here you are asking for reviews on another unknown exchange. I wonder how hard it is to just choose those exchanges that have long and solid track records. Are you referring to margin trading? If you don't know how it works, you better avoid it. It's extremely risky. \"Usually\" gives 20% profit in a matter of seconds? It's either you didn't get it right or you're dealing with a scam. You seem to be easily attracted to this get-rich-quick promise. You're prone to be a victim of scams. Those who promise you this are scammers. Coinmarketcap isn't that strict in listing exchanges.

So as the Darker45 commented you should stick to exchange that are well exposed to people especially those that are more familiar with your country it reduces kyc hassle, like my country we are more familiar with Binance and kyc is just some seconds to pass with only ID number facial recognition that is all and you can withdraw any amount.",

It is difficult for a bitcoin exchange supported by Schwab Fidelity and there is no news about it in international newspapers, or at least on news sites related to Bitcoin. Fidelity's have Spot Bitcoin ETF, so it is difficult to get involved in supporting a new exchange, and if they did, they would choose Coinbase and not an unknown exchange.If edxmarkets.com is promoting this, it is a scam.",
