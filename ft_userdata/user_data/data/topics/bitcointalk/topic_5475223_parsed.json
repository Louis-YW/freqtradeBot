      "body": "A few days ago, we were debating the fee of a few thousand dollars, and now we are talking about millions of dollars just for the fee. It does not make sense, even though, in the past, it has occurred a few times. This doesn't look nice for the future of Bitcoin, and this is the longest congestion I have seen. At first, I was not curious about it because I thought it would fade away like in the past, but now I think the plans for congestion are something else.I am sure miners must be making money for Christmas; if they are making money for Christmas, then we might see a decline in the fee after Christmas. I just want to hope for something; that's why I came up with the Christmas idea, and it also fits well here.Miners must have made millions of dollars till now. And they still cry for no or lesser profits. I can't even bear to pay the transaction fee of $18 to $25, and these people are making millions. This does raise concerns like maybe the miner who is mining this transaction might have made it. But the question is, can they do it?",
