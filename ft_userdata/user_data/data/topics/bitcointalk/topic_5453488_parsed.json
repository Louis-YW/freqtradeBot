  "content": "Two days back I felt lonely as my girlfriend was not spending time with me. She got a new boyfriend and they started to have conversation. This gave me a lonely feel, and I don't know what to do. It was kind of frustration. This was running for a long, even I missed the campaign and got removed months back. The urge to gamble was the only thought that came parallel to the kind of frustration. I don't have balance in my wallet, the week I got removed from the campaign I was half paid which is around $30. Finally started to gamble, where I was able to spend some time winning and losing. Finally I ended losing all the balance. If I had more balance in the wallet maybe I could've got lucky, if not I could've ended losing everything. However I felt little bit of relaxed as I forgot the frustration out of loneliness, maybe if the amount I've lost is big I could've got into even worse situation. If someone feels lonely for anything, don't get into gambling. You have got more happy days ahead.",

Glad you lost all your balance, I hope this will help you get rid of the addiction you have.Agreed, everyone doesn't have the same thought on an incident. From my side it is just a sharing, and I'm not cheated. She have got her privacy and fault is my expectation. I haven't gambled for the past three months, maybe that could've triggered me towards gambling when there is little frustration. For this I feel like maybe I'm addicted and needs to have control over my gambling activity.",

But the way your girlfriend cheated on you is really sad. But one thing you cannot clearly present is why your girlfriend cheated on you and got into a relationship with someone else. Maybe you have many small mistakes in this case which your girlfriend doesn't like at all.Or you are busy with something that prevents you from giving enough time to your girlfriend. But people can fall in such situations in life and in that case you have to adapt to the environment with patience and know the system to control yourself.But at this time it is not right to think that gambling can help you to get rid of these situations. For many, gambling can help alleviate these sad events and loneliness, but the most helpful will be sharing your issue with colleagues at work. Or you can travel somewhere far away, or you can choose another girlfriend to end your single life or get married permanently. Another thing is that even if you are unemployed, you can quickly arrange a job where you can spend your busy time.",

She got a new boyfriend and they started to have conversation.So there are no other girls in your country? Is that the reason your girlfriend makes you feel very sad to the extent you felt too depressed.Quote from: KennyR on May 21, 2023, 04:32:37 AMThis gave me a lonely feel, and I don't know what to do. It was kind of frustration. This was running for a long, even I missed the campaign and got removed months back. You are doing something wrong because your girl left you. Someone that left you and she has no usefulness at that moment again.Quote from: KennyR on May 21, 2023, 04:32:37 AMIf someone feels lonely for anything, don't get into gambling. You have got more happy days ahead.When I feel lonely, I get myself to do somethings that will not make me feel lonely. I can go to my friends. And continue other things that makes me money which is what that is more important to me than someone that is no more useful for me. Gambling can not come my mind because of ex girlfriend. I can take beer though. No too much, but to feel good, relax and think better.",

      "body": "I think you should not feel lonely for this. Your girlfriend has left you without being by your side in your moment of danger. Your girlfriend is an opportunistic guy. With your girlfriend gone, I think you're out of great danger. If he loved you from his heart, he would have stood by your side in times of danger. So I think don't waste your life feeling pain for your girlfriend.Although it is not right for me to advise you but I would like to tell you that you should be active here regularly and you will definitely be able to participate in good campaigns. There is nothing to be upset about. You have a good enough position.",

If someone feels lonely for anything, don't get into gambling. You have got more happy days ahead.Gambling wouldn't help you get back your girlfriend, instead it will bring more trauma to you. Imagine that you lost your girlfriend and also lost your funds. She doesn't like you and you should see that and be happy that is gone. There are good girls out there that is ready to love you for who you are,so why do you allow your emotions to control when you are faced with reality of life. What will happen to you assuming she is your wife,take your relationship with females something that isn't a do or die affair because even married couples do divorce.",

People watch movies or they drink alcohol to escape the reality of life. The key thing for you is not to substitute gambling to fill a gap for something else on a permanent basis. Do it responsibly and have fun while you are doing it and still leave some money, so that you can go out there and find someone else to love you. Good luck.... there are many girls out there... and they can be more expensive than gambling.",

What's yours will come looking for you when you are not ready, for now I would rather focus on making more money than getting frustrated because of a female, most of them don't give a heck about male, if you don't have enough money you can't keep a female unless she really cares about you, now only 2 out of 1000 females in the world today really loves, for them it's always about money.",
