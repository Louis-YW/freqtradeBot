Thank you,As written here, you'll need to get to 120 activity and 100 merit.The activity is not hard to earn, you'll find in this post (among other things) also how it's calculated. Basically you need to post a bit more.The merit is harder to get. You'll need to post things people find really useful so they'll merit your posts.",

My apologies for the misconception.Perhaps I would look out more in course of my quotes next time and it's good you pointed it out as well. Your perception to my quoting pattern would definitely help and I got something out of this.Good enough, OP gets the idea to the requirements of the ranking profile now. Salute NeuroticFish!",

You mean you've been in this forum for over 5 years or so, and you don't Know what you could actually do to achieve 'em ranks? Shoulda rate this as some words outta fraustration of not getting 'em desires In the years past? Cus everything is repeated the same god-damn time in here..( and that has prolly been done more than a hundred times since your registration) what were your first motives in here??   I feel sad when I realize that \"even though alot is done, it doesn't mean we are getting alot more done\" ....So you're ready now, huh?

Can someone please help or explain how this works? Thank you,This question should be asked by a newbie who just joined the forum. You have been registered since October 15, 2017, meaning you were here before the Merit system was introduced. After waking up from a long sleep, you immediately make a topic that in my opinion has no benefit at all, start reading more forum rules to find out how to promote to Full member.You also need to improve the quality of your posts to get more merit. After seeing some of the posts that you have made, it seems normal without any of them being considered quality. Start interacting on more visited Boards (Merit Source) by leaving some quality posts there.",
