  "content": "Good afternoon. My story is like this. In 2019, I registered with this office. After a while, my account was suspended. I have been verified as a player from Russia. I showed them my passport, my place of residence. They unblocked my account and allowed me to play. I didn't use vpn then. Then in Russia their website was not blocked. My betting limits have been cut. That's why I haven't played for several years. Now I found out that my limits have been increased by accidentally visiting the site. I started playing again. I've been playing for over 10 days. Yes, I used vpn. But now in Russia all foreign bookmakers are blocked. While I was making deposits, there were no problems. While I was losing everything was fine. But as soon as I won a little and asked for a payout, my account was blocked. They asked me where I live. I honestly wrote that in Russia. Then all my money was stolen. I made deposits in the amount of 0.2 bitcoins, my account balance is 0.226 bitcoins. But even all my deposits were not returned to me. And only the last one in the amount of 0.05 bitcoin. Which is totally unfair. Next, I will attach my transaction deposits. There are different addresses because they have a denominational one.Here are my deposits.

In fact, you did not show a screenshot of the state of your balance in the casino itself, I'm sorry that this happened, but apparently a gesture of goodwill in returning 0.05 BTC to you seemed sufficient to them.",

The situation is a bit complicated here for this reason. I have sent an email to Playbetr support and asked them to give some updates here.@Virtykza, Maybe you aren't going to receive the refund of those deposits which you had lost there by placing bets. They have returned your last deposit of 0.05 BTC though. In my opinion, Playbetr team should have blocked the access of your account when they added Russia in the restricted countries list, because your account was KYC verified as a Russian resident.",

Here keep focus when OP getting loss several time never have any issues or banned account, but when he got jack pot why his account blocked?I hope have solution way for OP and Playbetr.com, its hurt when suspending account after winning and nothing happen if get loss. I think all user gambler right now used VPN with casino gambling still illegal website accessing, not matter for using VPN when gambling website blocked in our country.",

Use VPN and never admit that I'm Russian, play dumb if they catch me, hope that they'll let me off with a warning.2. Not use any financial service that blocks Russian citizens. If the casino made it clear that Russians are banned and the use of VPN is also not allowed and you broke both these rules, you can't blame them. If I were the owner of the casino I'd resolve this but counting up all your deposits, subtract withdrawals and again subtract the remaining number from your current account balance. Therefore, the casino should send you back your deposits and keep all your wins, because you had no right to play in the first place. This is my opinion, you shouldn't be surprised if they take everything from you.",

They want to know if the withdrawn money came from a legit win or if there is a player who are violating their rules like using a VPN only to play on them. Non-KYC casinos doesn't always mean that they are decentralized but it mostly means that they are unlicensed which can be a bad thing in terms of security.",

This is in our terms of service, and had he attempted to place bets without hiding his location, he would not have been permitted. If he snuck by our KYC team in 2019, it does not mean that play from within Russia was permitted then and certainly does not mean that it is permitted now. His account was not on our radar until recently, because he had a nearly 3 year gap without play until he returned on 23 Nov. This player's most recent deposit was returned on 13 Dechttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/5bb0f91443671a91e6b481d05c2e12550d801c3fc3660d84cb9792555deb0808We do not refund previously lost deposits, which is standard procedure among all operators, and the recommended action of all mediators. The reason for this is if losses were returned, any player who lost could just come back and break a rule to get their losses back. Additionally, the player was up over 3 BTC from his play in 2019, so he should consider himself fortunate to have received anything back, as we had no obligation to do so. Unfortunately, I can't see my account and payments on it in 2019. But I can say for sure that I didn't win any 3 bitcoins back then. That's a lot of money. And I did not bypass your verification rules in any way in 2019. I verified as a Russian citizen, playing from Russia, and then your site was not blocked in Russia. Everything you wrote is a lie. As for the payment of 0.049 bitcoin to me, I have made a total of 0.2 bitcoin deposits since November 23. My account balance is 0.226 Bitcoin. You haven't even refunded me all my deposits.",
