Along the way, you get to learn a lot of things as you experience them first hand rather than just be told answersAnyway, try MEXCI sent some USDT TRC20 out of it a few hours ago.",

      "body": "Approximately six weeks ago, we shared our expectations regarding the integration time frame with you, noting that it typically takes between 2 to 6 weeks for crypto assets to be integrated within exchanges. Today, we find ourselves nearing the end of this period.We now looking forward Nexa (NEXA) to be listed on the BingX exchange in the second part of February, which is approximately three weeks from the time we writing this article. This adjustment to our initial estimate is due to the complexities involved in the integration process.https://medium.com/@nexacoin/important-update-anticipated-listing-on-bingx-exchange-cda245f12f41",

If I look in coinmarketcap, try Mexc to sell your Nexa. Now, Mexc don't has KYC to withdraw and It's better if you choose in below list in CMC like coinEx, Xeggex orÂ  etc. If you can see red sign in cmc, I think it means deposit or withdraw not available. I don't check it but actually I often like that.",
