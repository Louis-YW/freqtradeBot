I see that they have different reviews: some are good, some are bad, some are shady.Do you have any experience with them? Any thoughts?",

Saves you from all the red tape from KYC.As for other altcoins, it depends on the type of store you are running.If it's a WooCommerce store, you ought to use a payment processor that keeps an up-to-date plugin (this applies to other store types as well). That means CoinPayments or BitPay - although people here tend to prefer the former over the latter.It's best to read the TOS of each payment processor to make sure that they can't seize your profits for whatever reason, particularly if they want to close your account. The shorter time it stays in the hands of the processor, the better.",

Now, if you lack the technical knowledge, and you want to use a third-party site to handle everything on your behalf, then I'd go with OpenNode instead.If you want to accept alts as well, CoinGate is a good option. I'd definitely recommend it over BitPay and CoinPayments which both can be very strict, not only to the merchants but also to the person paying. There's also Coinbase Commerce as an alternative. The good thing about it is that you have full control over the funds and you don't have to verify your identity, but sadly, they don't support as many coins as CoinGate does.",

That is new information to me.So you've verified that Coinbase Commerce doesn't require any ID verification? As in, there is not even a cap on the amount of crypto your store can process?Regarding supported coins: All stores should be good with just BTC+LN, ETH, Bcash, LTC, DOGE and USDT (any network). Other coins are extraneous to most buyers, and most processors don't list XMR for regulatory reasons.",

I don't remember reading anything about a cap on the amount you can store. It wouldn't make sense to enforce that anyway, not when your users can simply restore their accounts elsewhere with the seed phrases.",

That's the difference of using Coingate and BTCpayserver. Do you still trust Coingate to hold your funds?

Your answer does not make sense to me. What does your mobile wallet have to do with accepting bitcoin payments on the website? Since you asked about CoinGate, I assume he has some sort of online store or that he provides his services on the website. A personal wallet isn't useful in this case unless you want to use a fixed address for all payments.",
