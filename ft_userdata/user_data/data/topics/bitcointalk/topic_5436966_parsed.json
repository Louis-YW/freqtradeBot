However, as you said you want a reliable source that people can easily understand about bitcoin then here I am giving you a link to that blog. https://coinremitter.com/what-is-bitcoin read this carefully.Apart from that, the idea you have about stickers is quite good but we need more effective and social media is one of the most effective things. After all, we need a digital thing to spread awareness about digital currency. I am giving you a suggestion. You better go on Facebook and find a community group of your country and post in that group accordingly. Share some photos on your WhatsApp groups and do on.This is the thing I am suggesting you.",

For me, what he said in your previous topic entitled My step to promote bitcoin is the best solution to avoid things that are not in accordance with your original goal of promoting Bitcoin in your neighbourhood.Unlike us who cannot directly promote because Bitcoin still cannot be fully used as a means of payment.On this occasion, I would like to say that it works great. Then you are among those who really appreciate every suggestion and input given by others for positive progress. Keep it up my friend.If I may know, do you already know how to make a QR code? or you need to learn to be able to make it.We're looking forward to the next result.",

Not only it explains bitcoin in a beginner friendly manner but it also provides funny illustrations that will make the learning more enjoyable and interesting especially for visual learners.There are other resources as well:- Compiled resources about BTC - https://www.lopp.net/- Anything related to security - https://cryptosec.info/- Videos - https://youtube.com/@aantonop",

That is best way to direct them towards successful bitcoin adoption. I think spreading link about the bitcointalk forum can also add much of the value to this. I’m not saying this because we love this forum but out of one vital point and that’s Mr Satoshi’s earlier presence in here. That would some interesting content for them to read about. I think there are some threads which has collected all the posts from Satoshi which can also be linked to this QR thus creating loads of interest in the whole thing. :-)Good luck and you are doing great job.",

So many individuals will see the stickers. However, it would be great if the website had an instructive slogan and QR codes. People can look up additional information rapidly.

A direct approach is more likely to turn into success.Use the interest of each person you talk with in the favour of bitcoin. Let's say the person likes gambling, then talk about crypto casinos. If the person is a merchant, tell him he can import goods paying with bitcoin. If the person is an investor, promote bitcoin as an asset to be held on long run.

They must also know about why one transaction is confirmed shortly within a few blocks and another one has to wait for many hours or days. If they understand it, they understand how Bitcoin network works to confirm transactions and won't be panic when their transactions are stucked on the network by waiting for confirmations from miners in mempools.A first and very important step to learn is how to store bitcoin very safely, how to secure their wallets.

Have in mind that bitcoin at the moment is popular and not mainstream with less than 2% of the world owning it. You made a good point and that is why I always make the call for self inclusion,  let the quest for knowledge be the motivation behind every step taken toward bitcoin and if investment or trading is put forth it may lead to frustration as the individual will get discouraged if the market goes against them there are several things to take note of when it comes to bitcoin awareness which are: -What is the motivation behind the equation of bitcoin, several others see Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme which is the wrong mentality of the whole concept of bitcoin and its volatilities. -Bitcoin alternative should be the only reason behind Bitcoin adoption and since bitcoin is not a crcrowdfundingcheme there is no need for printing stickers or what have you.",
