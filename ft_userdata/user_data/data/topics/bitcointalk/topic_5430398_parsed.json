It’s better to focus on yourself and be Better than yesterday.Maybe you could use some freelance programming and set up something to have another Source of income.

Many people do not know about crypto, that is why they will blame you for believing in crypto like bitcoin, but the right thing is to not trust an exchange and other centralized platforms and to stay away from shit coins.Sorry for your loss.",

So I think that you're looking at the things from the wrong angle. If you feel it's too low, you may want to adjust your spending habits.And if you have \"some skill in programing\" I am sure you could look the things up and set up yourself a cold storage if you don't want to invest in hardware wallet.Loser? I wouldn't say so. You're one of too many and all this stuff has a learning curve you've \"missed\". Lazy instead? Most probably, since you could have been reading this or that in the past 3 years and understand why keeping your savings in a/any centralized platform can easily turn into a huge mistake. Take this opportunity and at least learn from your mistakes. Get more knowledge and do the things right next time.",

You should be grateful already for that amount too. Since you have skills on programming, you could increase your income if you venture or work out on some pretty good company giving a lot or bigger compensation. Maybe appreciate what you have cause others are literally struggling compared to you.",

If you add value in a particular area, let's say you remain insistent on earning with the programming skill, it will spur you to hone the skill better and make a name for yourself. It is being known for a particular money making skill that actually makes you money. Be great at what you do, no matter how long it has taken, because if you remain consistent, success both in the form of patronage and money will be assured.",

FTX/FTX.US ain't a bank.If they start the refund procedure then likely they will get it but don't think so full amount will be refunded and part payments will be processed if it happens and they recover some funds from the FTX.But that's not happening around in near time if we see it but they can keep hopes but for me those who have funds there have been lost.Not only him many others have thought FTX to be safe heaven for keeping their funds and some also holds their native token FTT which completely lost it's value and those who like him beleive CEX are safe have big lesson to take from this scam and dramatic downfall and insolvency of FTX and people like SBF have only one motive which is to earn profits out of your pockets.But I would ask @OP how much total you have lost? See we all learn at some point and no need to feel lile loser because you can earn good profits with knowledge here and then those people will seek advice from you and don't feel demotivated by any wrong comments instead gain knowledge of market.The $14/hour pay job might be low in your country but people have been living at wage rate comparatively really low in third world countries and still investing in bitcoin keeping their expenses aside so you can manage your expenses accordingly.But you can also develop some skills to gain more high paying jobs with different opportunities and rise your financial status and one more thing you can share whatever you want with this community learning from here as well.",

What I can tell you, is to keep up with your 14$ hr job in addition to whatever your programming skills can add to it, cause it better to start with a little than nothing at all.",

I think the issue here is dwelling on the past, hoping yo recover what was lost sooner than later but, that isn't going to let it go away. You should just start from where you are at the moment, try buying some more bitcoins and this time, try using wallets in place of an exchange.  Exchanges aren't wallets and should be avoided from saving large some. Be the sole admin of your finance and not have a third party in your business, that's the bitter lesson from FTX and I hope you learned it good.You've got skill and time @OP, use it.",
