In 2014, few people believed in the success of Ethereum, now the same thing is happening with the metaverses.If rumors are to be believed that moving around the world will be very expensive for most people, then the metaverses have great potential.",

NFT will more valuable when Ethereum regain its momentum for price recovery because crypto investor is crazy and greedy. They will always look for another asset to invest with inside Ethereum that gains hype. I think the price pump on ETH will revive the dying NFT market because investors will value more ETH so it means all of the goodies inside of its ecosystem will share those gains since money usually just circulate and jump from project to project once it enters on a certain blockchain.",

So, if you're good and waiting for the anticipated transition of PoW to PoS of Ethereum.You should be able to sell some and save for yourself. It's your decision whether to sell them off, this is how the market works for us and don't be too emotional when you sell or buy because you might just be FOMOing on the other hand.Thus, verify what you think and feel about the market.",

Maybe time to cash out...It's up to you whether you want to sell your NFT or not, but for me personally I will not sell my NFT for now, because if I sell it now I will definitely lose, so I choose not to sell it until the price is high enough. Moreover, the NFT that I buy can be staked and the reward can be used to buy other tokens, so there is no loss in holding this NFT.",
