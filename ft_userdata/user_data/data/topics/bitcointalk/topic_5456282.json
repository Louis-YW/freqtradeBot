  "content": "The most controversial topic in the world today is about artificial intelligence because of the boom in the development of artificial intelligence applications, and I mean in particular Chat Apps such as ChatGpt and Writesonic and many others, which are able to issue content that was produced entirely using artificial intelligence without human intervention. The content can be anything (article, photo, video, chart...). And in a short period of time, the demand for many sectors decreased, especially those that require creative skills such as translation, content creation, and even programming.The crisis became clear after the rise in concerns about intellectual property rights on the Internet and the decline in the popularity of search engines, in addition to the intrusion of chatgpt into universities, and many cases of cheating by students were discovered.And since we are on a public forum open to publishers of all categories, the development of this smart software poses a number of challenges about the level of reliability in what any account publishes. In simple words, some logical assumptions can be put forward to know the reality of these challenges:- Since upgrading membership on btt forum requires effort to increase the number of posts and at the same time obtain merit points, anyone can create an account and publish very distinguished posts of high quality that qualifies him to upgrade his membership and open up horizons for him that he may not deserve.- Members participating in signature campaigns can also easily produce publications using artificial intelligence and get paid weekly without the need for any diligence.- Anyone can publish an article that he produced using artificial intelligence and claim royalties from anyone using it after him.- If it is not forbidden on btt forum to publish content produced using artificial intelligence, how can intellectual property rights be achieved and cases of Plagiarism be dealt with?I cited Bitcointalk forum as an example to analyze the matter from a small angle, but the issue is much larger than that. It can be summed up in two questions:To whom does this right belong to the commercial use of text and images generated by artificial intelligence? Is it possible to sell these texts, images and even videos and benefit from copyright?",

Some even go as far as promising rewards for any user that catches another users post in the campaign as a post generated by AI. Any user found will also be disqualified from the campaign, it is clearly written in any campaign managed by Royse777.Quote▶️ If I find campaign members breaching these terms, I will remove them from the campaign immediately.▶️ If you find AI-written posts for this campaign and report them to me publicly or via PM, you will receive the weekly payment instead of the accused campaigner (if your report was successful). Please include as much evidence as possible when submitting a report.If you are a participating member in a signature campaign you have to do your best to put in the work and put out quality original post and topics. Generating replies and post with AI shows that you have nothing in your head for another person to learn from.",

      "body": "I understand your point of view and your concern regarding post quality and the possibility of AI usage by forum users. However, it's not that simple. AI shows some signs that indicate that a post may be written by automated software; sometimes it's quite noticeable, especially if the post is created by a newer user with a questionable post history. Moreover, there is already software that specializes in spotting AI usage. Certainly, some users will get away with it; you can't be using AI detection in every post you read, but as I mentioned earlier, there are a few signs to look for that may make a post suspicious enough to be checked.Even if a user manages to enter a signature campaign by taking advantage of AI platforms, he'll eventually be caught, kicked, and probably red-tagged.",

You can somewhat tell when someone is using AI to type out their responses because the prose reads robotic and generic.Anyways, I've thought about AI content and intellectual property in the past because it creates a bit of a dichotomy when it comes to monetization. Who owns the intellectual rights to something AI produces? Easy to suggest the parent company, owner of the AI platform, is entitled to all work, but think of this example: Does Adobe Photoshop take ownership of all works created using their program? Surely not, as there's input required by the user for digital creation. AI works in similar way - AI content, as of now, requires user input before producing content. Something like ChatGPT does the heavy lifting in that regard, but you're still required to input the parameters.",

I think while AI is awesome and will change the world, perhaps people are thinking it will change the world a little faster than it will. It took over a decade for the internet companies to get their valuations and businesses figured out. AI will likely be similar.",

So please just try to check one of the posts subject of accusation in that thread by using all the tools mentioned in above posts and let's see if you can determine whether it's AI generated or not.Also note that the restriction on using AI is only limited to signature campaigns rules (only mentioned by Royse77 for now) and not included on the forum's rules, if not anyone found using such to post should be allowed to face the consequences by forum administration and not by users using the trust system.",
