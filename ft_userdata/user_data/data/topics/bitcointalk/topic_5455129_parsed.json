  "content": "Federal government wants to remove fuel subsidy, but NLC are going against it. They want to strike, and Electricity workers are also in support, also planning to leave the nation in blackout. According to what I read from Punch:Subsidy: NLC shuns FG meeting, electricity workers back strike:https://punchng.com/subsidy-nlc-shuns-fg-meeting-electricity-workers-back-strikeQuoteDuring the meeting attended by the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, Managing Director, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Limited, Mele Kyari, Dele Alake, and others, the NLC had insisted on the reversal of the fuel pump price pegged at between N488 and N540.According to what the president had said, PMS (petrol) exported to Benin Republic, Cameroon and Republic of the Niger are also subsidized. What I am thinking is that if fuel subsidy is removed, this will lead to inflation. But why subsidizing what that supposed not to be subsidized? I did not know who or the government that came up with such an idea that is now giving the country problem. What do you think about this? Are the NLC right about this? Or fuel subsidy should just be removed and see its effect on economy?",

I  wonder the amount of money that has gone for this singular act of scam called fuel subsidy. Does it mean that they have been robbing and milking the nation dry of her hard earned income? If you can recall the immediate actions from the filling stations and Lots more upon the President inaugural speech when he made mention of removing fuel subsidy and I asked myself why would they react so fast to the point that virtually all the filling stations closed I would use my area for example all of them shot down and upon the opening, pump price sky rocket to a high price. Now I asked a question who is doing who? I just see this a as a situation of one taking advantage of another situation at their own advantage and to the detriment of others.NLC going to strike is not a new thing but have they sit down to think about it and give this new government a little time to see their out put first before thinking of their next actions?With all these fight amongst these bodies, the masses are the ones suffering for it.Them say \"when two elephant dey fight na grass dey suffer am\"",

It is not fair. Why the sudden reactions so fast that it shook the nation just within few hours after the speech of the newly sworn in president was made clarifying the nation on the position of things upon handover. Those filling stations that shut down when did they buy the fuel  compared to when the speech was made?  Do you not think it was intentional by their act. How so sudden the actions baffled me that I begin to wonder how fast they grew such wings. I asked myself again, if it were to be a military regime would they have had the guts to try this nonsense they did?Well since you have said it is their business and nobody could tell them what to do, No issues about that but you and I know the truth and it was not what it should have resulted to.",

Subsidy is not going to be restored, If they decide to go on strike, it will only make living conditions more difficult for the citizens. The present administration will not bend their will no matter what and anyone who decides to join in a protest is just wasting their time. Subsidy was planned to be removed by the candidates from the three major political parties, if any of them had won, they would have done the same but many in a different manner and approach.",

Or fuel subsidy should just be removed and see its effect on economy?I don’t really know what fuel subsidy meant all this while not until recently this new government emphasised on its removal before the implementation when he was sworn in as the president. After finding out the meaning of fuel subsidy and seen the impact it has done to the economy of Nigeria, I’m in support of what the government has done and he should not go back on his words. There should be other ways to compensate the Nigerians for this hardship they’ll face after the subsidy removal. I just saw that the minimum wage will be revised and increased after the meeting held by FG and TUC which NLC neglected and didn’t attend. This is a welcome development for Nigerians to feel the relief of the hike in price. If the money spent on subsidy can be saved for other sectors, I believe the Nigerian economy will grow and we shall reap the rewards of our sacrifice and hardship we’ll face now. I believe there are better days ahead, and for that to come to pass, we might just have to pass this process in a tough way. The government shouldn’t go back on their words. NLC just want something that I feel the government is not ready to settle for with them. And maybe those oil moguls that have being benefiting from the subsidy are the ones encouraging them for the strike.",

It was sudden and shocking from the president as the subsidy had at least 2 months and that be the month of June and July to elapse but, the president already made his declarations and as Nigerians would have it, they take advantage of the situation.I won't really say they did much wrong, at least the product wasn't hoarded for a long period of time before the subsidy took effect. Stations did sell the product and after the declaration, it took effect the next day.Now the issue for the filling stations is that, they hope to buy same quantity after selling there available stock and the only way to do that is sell with a currey price.",

This morning we are greeted with this news that is already littered across news platforms and the internet. QuoteThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has suspended its planned strike over the hike in fuel price as a result of subsidy removal. The union had mobilized for a nationwide strike, asking the Federal Government to revert to the old rate of N197 to prevent the strike. But government had filed a suit to prevent the strike and the court ordered NLC not to go on strike. News of the court order broke while government representatives and NLC officials were at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, for continued discussions after initial deadlock. At the end of the meeting, NLC announced that some measures had been put in place and an agreement was reached for the strike not to go on as planned. https://dailytrust.com/breaking-nlc-shelves-planned-strike-after-aso-rock-meeting/Bunch of disgrace to the entire nation. They have gone to collect their own money that will seal their mouth. I told y'all these guys are all bark and not bit. In a photo OP they took I saw Adams Oshomole in it. The government used on of its own who know the tricks to shut them up.",

Then I'm sure that will create an enabling environment for investors to come do business and create more jobs.

There is so much unhidden stuff going on in this country wey we as citizens don't know about. I could remember during the time of Goodluck Jonathan's administration as the president of Nigeria. He talked about the removal of fuel subsidies, the same APC governments that have been running us kick against it completely. Saying that Nigeria shouldn't accept it, which makes Goodluck Jonathan not go on with the plan of removal of fuel subsidy. Now, am kind of surprised that the same government that wasn't in support of the removal of fuel subsidy close to 10 years back has finally moved to implement it. That's so funny you know(this our country na cruz country)In whichever way, am kinda support the removal of fuel subsidies but NLC should choose their fight wisely. Make their demand no be for FG to put the fuel subsidy back unless they want to tell us sae, them d get something indirectly from the fuel subsidy because as for me, this fuel subsidy na pure scam wey FG d use cash out big time. Nevertheless, I go make NLC demands for subsidizing our economic sector wey go get impact for the likelihood of the poor, no be only for the rich.",

Dat subsidy money was been embezzled and that's the hard truth. A selected few were just eating the subsidy money and only a few part of the money was been used to subsidized the fuel. Or dem be dey over estimate the subsidy more so dem fit pocket some. Let that money now be used for something more important in the country. I don't understand why the NLC are striking or are they just lookimg for a compensation on their part. We have been subsidizing fuel for how many years now and still it hasn't changed the situation of Nigeria. Let the government try something new to see if they'll get a different result. We have to let go of all old policies and try newer one and I'm glad the new administration are thinking about this. Fuel are been exported to other neighboring countries and we don't need the president to tell us that because we can feel it ourselves. We get fuel crises often yet our neighbors that don't have oil don't get fuel crisis, what does that say. They're benefiting from our corrupt politicians and business owners because they can move the fuel to those countries and sell higher so why will dey bring it here that subsidy makes them not to make the kind of profits they make else where",
