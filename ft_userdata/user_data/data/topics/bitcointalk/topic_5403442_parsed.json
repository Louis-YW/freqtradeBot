Sometimes it is \"Error 520. Web server is returning an unknown error., You - Browser working✅, Singapore - Cloudflare Working✅, Bitcointalk.org - Host Error ❌\". I thought that I am the only one who is going through what happen earlier and I was thinking maybe it's my browser or the internet connection but after playing a video on YouTube made me think that other people did also go through the same thing as me.",

Seems like this kind of problem has happened quite often on the forum even though the problem was solved in such a short time, but wait is this some kind of premeditated attack?Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on June 21, 2022, 08:01:03 AMBut the confusing thing is that when i tried accessing the forum from my phone, it went through fine , but it wasnt going through from my laptop, i had to keep trying until finally, it started working.Laptop and android didn't seem to make any difference to me, both didn't work for a while before the problem was fixed.",
