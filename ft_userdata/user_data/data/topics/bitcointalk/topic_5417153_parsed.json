  "content": "Please consider the following.Fossil FuelsMost nations import food from regions outside their borders, making them dependent on stable fossil fuel prices to maintain shipping costsWhen the price of oil rises and shipping costs inflate, the additional costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher food pricesChemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides used in commercial agriculture are often derived from natural gasRising chemical gas prices can greatly elevate the cost of fertilizer, herbicide and pesticideClimate ChangeGlobal warming gives us hotter summers, while another climate change phenomenon known as global dimming (airborne pollution particles blocking or reflecting sunshine) gives us colder wintersFlooding floods crops and harvestsDrought makes water scarce, increasing the price of water needed for agricultureEconomic DowntrendLiquidity and credit can dry up in economic downturns making it more difficult to sustain agriculture operations in times of crisisMany farmers do not own their farmland and make monthly payments which can be destabilized by rising interest rates and inflationIt seems clear we have future agriculture issues. Perhaps governments of the world could further subsidize agriculture production to incentivize markets against higher fossil fuel prices, climate change and other negatives. But there is a considerable lag time for growing food that is measured in months from seed planting to harvest. If shortages arise, it would take a minimum of months to address them. From past history we know food shortages are a massive ecological disaster. Hungry people try to eat grass, leaves and random things growing in the wild. Destroying forests and nature. I hope everyone realizes getting in early and preparing is the best strategy for mitigating these types of potential disasters.Don't sit and wait thinking governments will save you. While agriculture and plants are one food option. There are definitely others. Its easier than ever to farm fish and shrimp within a small area. It is also a good time to learn to hunt and fish. Or find places where there are food sources growing naturally in the wild.",

The problem is not with food shortages, it’s about the lifestyle and population as well. Why I am saying lifestyle? Well remember the topics from history books about our ancestors and how they survived? The farming was not even in practice and yet humans lived on fruits, meat, and raw food material available readily in the nature. They survived, they never needed cheesy pizza or compulsory nutrient diet with measured values??? We can still survive without any further stress considering the technological advances we have at our hands. We are in still far better situation if we “adjust” few things in our lives.",

You say we're very far from food insecurity. But have you seen prices in stores? They're becoming unaffordable for many.We are currently facing severe oil and natural gas shortages. Despite those fossil fuels being critically necessary to the function of the economy and peoples lives.One method of reducing prices in stores is for everyone to grow an abundance of food. Until market prices are forced to decline by increased supply.We can also grow crops which can be refined into biodiesel fuel in an effort to reduce shipping and transportation costs in the country.If anyone wants a hot tip for founding a start up. Think about growing things that can be refined into biodiesel. Then selling at the record high prices we see today to reap a good profit.",

For example, cutting down on meat consumption would involve health benefits, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, freeing up some lands, using less resources like crops and water. Another thing is promoting living in smaller spaces, in flats rather than houses. This also means spending less resources, which is important for the future of humanity. Being mindful about at least basic waste sorting, trying not to overuse electricity when it can be avoided (maybe you don't need enough heating to walk in a t-shirt during winter or that much air conditioning at summer because you just like to feel chilly) and/or switch to better sources of energy when possible, favouring public transit over a car, buying the right amount of food so that a big portion of what you buy doesn't end up becoming waste are all things that can help and can be promoted. But, of course, there should also be structural change, and the sort of changes required depend on countries, as some have clean energy but bad public transit, some have too many factories that harm the environment etc. As for food, too much of it goes to waste that could instead be given to people who need it before that happens, so focusing on food-sharing initiatives, free soup kitchens and stuff is crucial. There are solutions, but humanity must get committed to them for them to work.",

GARBAGE bin!This applies, of course, to countries with an average and higher standard of living.The second part of the problem: let's honestly and objectively determine where there are problems with food? For the last 30 years, I've been hearing that the problem with food is mainly Africa. The question is what is wrong with Africa? Why are most of the starving people SITTING AND WAITING FOR FOOD? Who forbade them to engage in agriculture, grow livestock, vegetables? I do not remember the prohibitions... Although I agree, there are regions on the continent of Africa where it is difficult to conduct agriculture. BUT why is Israel, which actually does not have fertile land, not only provides for itself, but also exports fruits and vegetables?No, I'm not a cynic, and I'm not an anti-humanist. I am worried why some should work in elephantine conditions, while others should demand and wait when those who work and produce will support those who do not want to work and strain? I agree, it sounds a bit ugly. But justifiably prove me wrong!",

Many have acquired a huge volume of property for agricultural production. This will finally cause huge economical blow over the small scale farmers who are into agriculture with small piece of lands. In such situation we'll have increased production, and the price will be fixed by the corporate. End of the day the small farmers will be working as corporate employees which is a very sad thing.",

A report by the UN Environment Programme’s  (UNEP) in 2021 indicated that about 17% of global food production may go wasted, this is about a 100% increase from previous estimates. And I am sure this report is reliable because the amount of food waste in my country recently is becoming a national concern. And one of the highlights of this report is that household food waste per capita is similar across high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income countries. Therefore there would be an even increase in food production if necessary steps are taken to reduce waste through improved food storage systems.  Quote from: Flexystar on October 15, 2022, 05:37:13 PMThis reminds me few chapters from the history book and how humans are making it too difficult to live these days. The problem is not with food shortages, it’s about the lifestyle and population as well.Conflict, rural-urban migration, and natural disasters affect the world's food production more than the population. Most food shortages experienced are manmade. A clear example is the case of the Russia-Ukraine conflict which led to the scarcity of certain agricultural products. In my country, farmers are fleeing from their farms because of communal clashes and constant attacks by heavily armed herders. Due to the lack of infrastructure in rural areas most youths that were active farmers are leaving the rural areas for the urban areas. This has led to the reduction of manpower in the agricultural sector. The case of flooding and other natural occurrences also affects farmers negatively. So many farms have been destroyed by floods in my country and there are still predictions that it would not end until next month.I think mother earth has enough food to feed its children regardless of their population.",

I am also with this concept, if people won't totally rely from their market to cater their food needs, I believe the impact of inflation or food shortage won't be that much to everyone. As you said, if everyone has the initiative to produce something out of his garden/backyard/front yard,no matter how small the area is, it will give you some produce that may not only sustain some of your kitchen needs,but you can also barter it to your neighbors and be at least self-sufficient with some food supplies.
