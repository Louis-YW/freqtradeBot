Another piece of advice does not sell your BTC to pay the debt. It's not a good idea to sell your assets this way. Instead, invest your assets somewhere to earn some passive income and use that income to pay the debt. In my opinion, assets should only be sold to make more assets other wise you are just wasting your assets.",

Is it a bank or a credit card company? What is the default interest rate on your debt? Are there any repercussions if you don't pay them on time? These are all things to consider. But, generally speaking, repaying all your debts before you move on with your life is preferable.",

If you have at least 20% of your total monthly income that you can save or turn into free money, you can share it as investments and savings. It's small, only 10%, but at least you have an allocation for investment. Of course, paying debt is number one, but if you can still pay the monthly installments, there's no problem setting aside for investment. but investing in crypto is high risk, better to choose bitcoin than altcoin, don't forget to do own research before you decide to invest.",

So I would throw something new into the mixand suggest paying off the loan ASAP within the next 12 months and then take outanother loan this time next year before the next halving and pay off the loan in total about 12 months after the halving.I would like to add I am NOT a financial advisor, just my 2satoshi's worth of an idea.A safer approach would also be to do both, pay off the loan and DCA Bitcoin as othersgave posted above.",

Highly unpredictable situation. There are so many external variables beyond your control. One the other hand, it depends on how urgent you need to repay the debt. - 1 month? 2 months? 6 months? Another factor to consider is how much you intend to DCA. This should inform your decision whether to go ahead with DCAing or straight up pay your debt.",

But since there is no 100% guarantee in cryptocurrency, you need to reduce your debt and stop using DCA in order not to increase it.",

The current position, you are doing that. Your profits from investing will only go to the interest of your loan borrowed, so for me it's only a waste of time and effort, pay off your debt first before taking another step. After all, investments will always be there. You just need the right timing when to invest so that the outcome will be most likely successful. And always invest on your extra money, not on the amount intended to pay your bills or for emergency funds.",

Keep investing and ignore the debt won't be a good idea, you may end up with a bigger debt. Most of the debt has an interest, \"the longer the debt, the more interest to pay\". If you have enough money to repay the debt, you better prioritize it, so it will be over soon. Once you have done with your debt, you can plan to have another investment. In my perception; paying the debt is an obligation, while adding a new investment is just an option.",

What kind of debt it is, a bank loan or money borrowed from a family member? How are you supposed to pay it back, all at once or little by little?I'd say if it is a bank loan and the payments are small you could still pay the loan back little by little and still buy bitcoin with any extra money you are left but if it is borrowed from someone else or you have to pay it back all at once then you should do it before you buy more bitcoin.Keep in mind that there is always more ways to acquire bitcoin than just investing part of your salary. For example over the past 2 months I have been doing some sort of spring cleaning to sell stuff I have laying around that I don't need anymore, then use that extra money to buy bitcoin.That way my salary is not touched and the plans I have for that are still intact, meanwhile I still buy bitcoin at the current discount in the dip.",
