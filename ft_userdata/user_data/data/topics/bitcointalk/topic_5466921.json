However, we can't tell you what to do with your money; that's up to you. As someone who has also missed some great market periods, I can relate to what you're feeling. First of all, how much money are you planning on investing? Personally, if I were you, I'd start purchasing because prices are still relatively low; the recent dump got them down to $25,000, which was quite a bargain after a few months. You could also start purchasing through DCA, acquiring Bitcoin as frequently as you want and, at the same time, lowering your risk.",

As for Altcoins, I dont advice you to spend your funds on them. Quote from: stardustin on September 15, 2023, 05:08:43 PMIn 2016 when I was a kid,  Finally, I finished the university and gained PR but the money that I have spent in all of these makes me cry every day. If it weren't my parents, I would invest in bitcoin in 2016-2017, I would be a millionaire today.  I'm having trouble understanding some parts of your story. In 2016, you were just a kid, and you were already thinking about investing in Bitcoin. Were you planning to use your pocket money for this? It's important to note that Bitcoin doesn't typically work that way. While you can make profits from it, becoming a millionaire through Bitcoin can be challenging. Remember that education should be your top priority it's valuable, and your school investments are not wasted. Your education can also be beneficial for your future investments, as the knowledge you gain in school can be applied in the future. So don't regret time and money spent.Quote from: stardustin on September 15, 2023, 05:08:43 PM it would make me sad to lose all the savings but life in Canada is getting expensive every fucking day.It's all up to you mate. Nobody has a say in your life. If you wish to invest in Bitcoin then that's up to you.but remember that you shouldn't put other important part of your life on hold because you want to invest. If it's little you have, from time to time you can buy some store in a secured wallet.",

If you want to invest your life saving in Bitcoin because halving is coming, you should do it in a controlled manner.For example, go with a Bitcoin purchase of 10% of your earning per month. This way, you never go bankrupt and you are also a proud BTC hodler. What else you need? Prefer growing slowly and steadily. In long run, you will surely win.",

It's hard to predict the price movement of Bitcoin these days it is not similar to the price movement before. Maybe it was just me who saw the market being different.Why? Because crypto before was not regulated unlike today so there is a possibility you won't be able to see the \"Boom\" again just like what happen in 2020. That is why I suggested you to invest your savings not only into Bitcoin but also in physical assets.",

If you may wish to know this, Bitcoin is still at its early stages and this alone is the reason why the boom is still expectant. Moreover, it is known that after halving, there is always price surge in Bitcoin and in less than some months from now Bitcoin halving would take place. So if you can, now is the right time to hop in and make your purchase but note that the market is volatile and you should do investment with what you can afford to loss. Do well to store your assets in a self custodial wallet if you decide to purchase your Bitcoin so you do not wake up to stories someday as it relates to third parties.",

Which one? I don't have health problems and don't have to worry about job security but it would make me sad to lose all the savings but life in Canada is getting expensive every fucking day.History has it that after every bitcoin halving the bull run follows and bitcoin increases with at least 2x of the existing ATH. This will actually give you hope that such thing will happen again and investing into cryptocurrency will be tempting but I want to tell you that even with that history no one will certainly tell you that this coming halving will yield same result and as such experience investors will tell you that the first rule of investing will be to invest with an amount that you can afford to lose. With this even if the anticipated gains doesn’t happen you can still leave off your coins and expect a better return in future. But investing with your savings seems risky to me because from your post this is not an amount that you can lose. I will also advise you against investing into Altcoins against bull run because there is nothing like a guaranteed return on all these Alticoins even the top rated ones. They can go dump anytime even before the bull run comes. So without the certainty of it not dumping you should stick to bitcoin that is guaranteed of not totally dying. Alticoins are know to increase highly during bull run and as such people lean towards it just for that. So if you can actually take the risk of losing your funds or gambling them no problem but do not take expect any return.",

I totally missed 2020's boom because of my situationThere was not boom in 2020 instead the latest ATH was in 2021 after the halving in 2020, maybe you are referring to that period by calling the halving event which took place in 2020 but I think it is better to name the correct date which is 2021.

Because money is not everything, but if you are after making money then for quick money you can go for ALTs, because they are more volatile but if you are after a good and less risker investment then BTC is best choice here. But you have to be sure that, the ATH will not be sure after the halving. As bull run continues for hell lot of time. In the previous halving, the bull run continuous for like 6, 9 or 12+ months. Means the ATH was made after that much months. So, you have to invest with clear and educated mind other wise you will fall prey to market sentiments.",

But no one can tolerate losing all of their savings by making some dumb mistake. And before making that investment, one must think for a second that, either he has to invest the savings or not, and in that tension, you make this topic. But believe me, not a single answer will help you until you will make up your own mind. Put every option you have in front of you, and then try to decide according to the resources you have. Then you will think more clearly and can easily make a decision about whether you should invest in BTC or not. According to your story, you are just being skeptical about the price or volatility of the BTC. And afraid that you might lose your amount, but in your own words, you feel confident about the BTC. Then what actually is stopping you from investing in BTC? Before investing in it, you must make a plan, in which you must have the profit and the time of holding in your mind. Because without them you will lose your funds. I mean, you can make lose. One thing I do know and following it, is that after halving there comes a bull run and in the bull run BTC makes a new ATH and in that ATH BTC might touch $130,000 and that is the most I think it can go. But no one knows for sure and no one can actually tell you to invest in BTC just because you want to hear it from others. You have to be confident and have to listen to yourself.",

Yes, even myself did miss out those bull runs which i have might be able to consider myself millionaire if it wasnt the reason that i had spend out those coins so easily into those days because of primary needs on which i didnt really have regrets though but some point i would be having those thoughts that what if i had saved up a little portion of those coins on that particular years? For sure i have some considerable or significant amount of money as of this moment.When it comes to your situation then investing decisions will really be according into your own risks taking since not all would really be that have that courage on investing into something which is volatile but since we do know on what we are dealing on here then it is really just that normal on having that approach on which investing on the amount which you are really that prepared on losing it and dont go on having that allin kind of behavior because its never been that recommendable in the first place.",

Don't allow your past influence your decision to invest in cryptocurrency.Bitcoin investment is the best for security and assurance because it is decentralized, transparent, and visible by everyone utilizing blockchain technology; hence, the chance of losing your money in Bitcoin investment is negligible when compared to investing in altcoins.Although, if you do your study and find an altcoin that is strong and has good potential, you can invest some of your savings in it, I recommend that you buy Bitcoin and keep it for the long term, just as others have been holding it since 2015/16 and you were intending to buy it then.",

I won't recommend to invest in altcoins as they can go zero in value anytime and if you're still into altcoins then go with the ones that have been doing well for long time. I still recommend you to go with Bitcoin because that's the only option that's safe for investment purposes. The Bitcoin will definitely go high in value after the coming halving event and if you start investing it from today then you may earn some good returns from your investment within two years, but if you are someone who can hold for long periods like decade or two then you will surely be among the millionaires if manage to get 1 or 2 Bitcoin in your portfolio.",
