  "content": "Hi guys,In the past few weeks / months, I studied the first few thousand blocks in order to tell future generations what happened during the first years of Bitcoin To do so, I have developped some scripts, enabling me find direct links betweek coinbase rewards, consolidation transactions and some miners / Bitcoin personnalities (as D. Trammel, H. Finney, Patoshis, etc..)I have done so deep on-chain links & analysis with Maltego's software too.After tens of hours, I'm currently at block 2813; and I wrote 14 articles (called Bitcoin Blockchain Fun Facts - #BBFF) about my researches. Some are about first miners consolidations, others about the first transactions of Finney or Trammel, about weird stuff, Patoshis, the first use of fees, etc...I also continued @Taras work from 2014: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=507458.40 ; finding new informations.My goal would be to study the first 105.000 / 110.000 blocks deeply; then, to study datas about the 730.000 others with easy finding facts (first coinjoin, first musig, first inscription), with historical transactions (OP_RETURNs, ..); and a mathematical approach (block time averages, block fees averages, etc...)I still have a job currently, and I also need some help 'cause I don't have enough time to do it alone:1) I currently request the API of https://blockchain.info/rawblock/ for having block informations, instead of using my own nodes. Perhaps don't they list everything; I'm also wondering if I'm not \"losing\" datas.I currently request: block number, block time, block height, block weigh, block base chain, number of tx in the block, sats output for a block, block fee, max fee tx, max output, max height output, max weight output, double depense. Is there something interesting to request too? 2) Requesting an API is a long procedure. How could I request my own node easily? (I searched that a few weeks ago, but didn't go further).3) Which creterias should I use to decide if 2 adresses come from a same miner / person? (got my own, atmÂ  )4) Is there someone there who could be interested in my work? Someone there who could help me? I could share all my current spreadsheets and make them clear.ith infinite time, I'ld already have finished; and shared all my work for the community.However, I'm a meet-up organizer, I educate as much as I can about Bitcoin with youtube videos, talks and flyers (all \"open-source\"). Plus a job I like (I'm a math teacher). And I can't do everything.My only goal is to help the community and to developp the ecosystem for our 2140 hyperbitcoinized world. I also hope to find some people interested in Bitcoin archelogy ---NB: some pictures of my workhttps://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd822e28b-afc6-46f5-9ecb-0e145e06e419_581x1519.pnghttps://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faafab2b2-c6b7-4010-978a-4671d83ca423_1216x623.pnghttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zudvklgo4o67m0j7hv49l/2024-02-17_180841.png?rlkey=wsjtt6uqkfystuw32zm6415xh&dl=0",
