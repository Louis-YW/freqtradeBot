With Taproot (P2TR) transaction, you will save more transaction fee as size of transaction will be smaller.Transaction fee saving can be like thisWith Legacy address (1): most expensiveWith Nested Segwit address (3): medium savingWith Native Segwit address (bc1q): most savingWith Taproot address (bc1p): most saving How do I know a Bitcoin address is a Taproot address?Bitcoin Taproot address (bech32m) starts with bc1p. It is a little different than Native Segwit address (bech32) that begins with bc1q. Remember the minor difference with p for Taproot and q for Segwit.Other address typesLegacy (P2PKH): starts with a 1.Nested SegWit (P2SH): starts with a 3.Native SegWit (P2WPKH): starts with bc1q.Taproot (P2TR): starts with bc1p.Short Bitcoin Taproot explainerWallets that support TaprootCheck in Bech32 adoptionSoftware walletsHardware walletsWeb walletsExchangesPayment processorsBlock explorers, Mining pools, please get details in Bech32 adoptionCreate Taproot address for your BitcoinThere are some non-custodial wallets that support Taproot.Create Taproot address for your BitcoinReceive or send your Bitcoin with Taproot addressReceiving: you can use any Bitcoin address type to receive Bitcoin from any other Bitcoin address type.Sending: it depends on your wallet software, exchange, platform. If they support to send Bitcoin to Native Segwit (Bech32, start with bc1q) or Taproot (Bech32m, start with bc1p), you will be able to send your Bitcoin to these address types. If they don't support it, you can not make such sending. Their softwares will reject your withdrawal request.Check Bech32 adoption with chartstxstat from BitMEXBitMEX has built a site for Bitcoin statistics.

A taproot input is 10.5 vbytes smaller than a native segwit input, but a taproot output is 12 vbytes larger than a native segwit output. Therefore, a transaction consolidating many taproot inputs will be smaller than a native segwit equivalent, but standard 1-input-2-output taproot transaction will be larger than its native segwit equivalent.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on July 14, 2022, 02:53:21 AMOther address typesLegacy (P2PKH): starts with a 1.Nested SegWit (P2SH): starts with a 3.Native SegWit (bech32): starts with bc1q.Taproot (P2TR): starts with bc1p.Native segwit is called P2WPKH, not bech32. Bech32 is the name of the character encoding scheme.",
