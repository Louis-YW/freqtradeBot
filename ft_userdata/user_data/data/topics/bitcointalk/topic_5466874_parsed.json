  "content": "AssetX: The Future of Asset MarketsWebsite: www.assetx.network  | Whitepaper: openInvest in tokenized assets from around the world, such as art, real estate, sports and cryptoIntroductionIn a world abundant with valuable assets, from select artworks to prime real estate, accessibility often proves challenging due to issues like illiquidity, exorbitant costs, and intricate ownership processes. Acquiring a masterpiece or investing in foreign properties may demand extensive resources, trusted intermediaries, and involve considerable documentation. This results in prolonged and costly transactions. These hurdles hinder the asset market's potential, perpetuating inefficiencies and inequalities.What is AssetX?AssetX is a revolutionary platform that grants users access to exclusive, carefully curated high-yield generating assets through the power of blockchain technology. With AssetX, individuals can partake in the benefits of asset ownership, including income generation, capital appreciation, and diversification, without the burdens of asset management and upkeep. The platform leverages smart contracts to create and oversee tokenized assets, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.Why AssetX?AssetX addresses critical issues faced by investors in the traditional asset market:Lowering Entry Barriers: AssetX allows users to buy and sell fractional ownership of high-yield assets with as little as $1, making investment opportunities more accessible.Boosting Liquidity: The platform establishes a global marketplace, enabling users to trade tokenized assets 24/7 with minimal fees and swift settlement, mitigating the challenges of illiquidity.Streamlining Transactions: By harnessing blockchain technology, AssetX eliminates intermediaries, paperwork, and bureaucracy, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability throughout the asset transaction process.Enhancing Interoperability and Scalability: AssetX breaks free from the limitations of native blockchains, offering a more efficient and interconnected market for tokenized assets.How does AssetX work?AssetX consists of three main components:Asset owners: These are the entities that own the real-world assets and want to tokenize them. Asset owners can use AssetX to create tokenized assets, set the terms and conditions of the token sale, and distribute the tokens to investors.Asset investors: These are the users who want to invest in tokenized assets. Asset investors can use AssetX to browse and buy tokens that represent fractions of real-world assets. Asset investors can also sell their tokens on the secondary market or redeem them for the underlying asset (subject to availability and conditions).Asset managers: These are the entities that manage and maintain the real-world assets on behalf of the asset owners and investors. Asset managers can use AssetX to monitor the performance of the assets, collect and distribute income from the assets, and handle any issues or disputes that may arise.What is $RWA token?$RWA is the native token of AssetX. It is an ERC-20 token that serves multiple purposes on the platform, such as:Exclusive Access: RWA opens doors to a curated selection of high-yield generating assets that were once out of reach.Fixed supply: RWA Token has a fixed total supply of 100 million tokens. No more tokens will be minted or burned in the future.ERC-20 standard: RWA Token is an ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that it is compatible with most Ethereum wallets and decentralized applications (DApps).Governance rights: RWA Token holders can participate in the governance of AssetX by voting on proposals and suggestions that affect the platform. Each RWA Token represents one vote.Fee discounts: RWA Token holders can enjoy lower fees when using AssetX services, such as creating, listing, buying and selling asset-backed tokens. The fee discounts are proportional to the amount of RWA Tokens held by the user.Staking rewards: RWA Token holders can stake their tokens on AssetX to earn passive income. The staking rewards are generated from a portion of the fees collected by the platform. The staking rewards are distributed to the stakers based on their stake ratio.$RWA Distribution:Presale: 20,000,000 Public sale: 9,700,000 Team and advisors: 14,550,000 Partnerships and ecosystem: 14,550,000 Staking pool: 19,400,000 Validators and oracles: 9,700,000 Reserve fund: 9,700,000 UNCX fees: 580,000Total: 100,000,000AssetX RoadmapQ3 2023 - Research and Development, Idea Presentation, Initial Funding In the third quarter of 2023, AssetX is fully focused on its research and development efforts.
