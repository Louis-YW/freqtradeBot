  "content": "The market has been on a downtrend for quite a while now. Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies have seen their value wiped out within a matter of days. Investors are quite disappointed with how prices are falling at a fast pace. Some are beginning to believe crypto is dead (which we know that's not the case), while others see this as a huge buying opportunity to buy lots of coins at a discount.One of the coins that was severely affected is Dogecoin. The \"meme\" cryptocurrency has seen its price up go mainly because of Elon Musk hyping it across social media platforms. But right after the Terra/LUNA and Celsius scandal happened, things have changed. Elon Musk has been silent (as far as I'm aware) for quite a while. Without someone to \"pump\" Dogecoin, prices will continue to decline like there's no tomorrow. The coin is changing hands at around $0.05 (at the time of this writing), but it could fall lower if BTC dives lower in price.I'm wondering if DOGE will go back to sub $0.01 prices ever again? If it never does, will that mean DOGE will someday go all the way to $0.50 per coin? I'd like to know your thoughts about this. Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

DOGE is still on the top among quality high market cap altcoins.To be honest, recently I started to buy DOGECOIN using my extra funds on different exchanges like the dust amounts and converting them to DOGECOIN.If ever DOGECOIN will go back to sub $0.01 I will expect BITCOIN will do a massive pump too. Because it seems DOGECOIN is my signal for trigger of bull run.",

I think that the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) will periodically fall. There are no use cases there, the supply is increasing all the time. This has all become a real reference for not buying Dogecoin (DOGE) again. It is also possible that we will see the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) before the crazy price increase. We will see later.",

Dogecoin has been my biggest hold for all of this year as it is the best coin to actually be used as a currency. BTC is too slow and ETH is too expensive; DOGE is just right for transacting. Plus, you can also use it to make NFTs for super cheap.",

In cryptocurrency space all things are possible. I have not imagine in June last year that bitcoin and  other coins will be were there are today but it happens. It is very possible for us to see doge again even below $0.01 and it might happen this year.",

They have no other words to say but as usual, telling the market is dead because it's down.The current pricing of Dogecoin is $0.06 and that's still a decent price to tell. It's possible that we may see Dogecoin goes back to $0.01 if this bear continues to dominate the market. And for it to go up, Elon is needed again and we don't know if without him and its just bitcoin alone going back bullish again if it will recover.",

Since we are still in bearish market, it will be favourable to invest a huge amount of capital on Doge than Bitcoin because BTC price has started increasing in the market  for those that bought at lower price to start earning from their investment. I think, Bitcoin price will soon move to $40,000 because the price just increased to $20,000 which the green light is about to stable through out this year.",

Though it's hard to believe Dogecoin still exists and remains strong nowadays, we will always judge its current market price, and right in front of our eyes is the evidence. Maybe Elon Musk is not really trusted when it comes to altcoins commentaries but when it comes to DogeCoin he is the main person you want to hear if you really want to know its future.",

As meme coin trend is dead, Elon Musk has switched to other business that crypto, or it seems he has no interest in it at all right now, I dont expect any natural price growth.",

There are so many resistance in the market for bitcoin to go up. I may think we will stay at the current rate even longer than before. you must also know if the fact if doge coin can go back to the 1 cents but it can also go to the 50 cents if the next bullish market will come. Doge coin is tied to the bitcoin and so any movement that will be made by bitcoin is giving impact to the doge coin. These days are so difficult to predict where crypto will be going on.",

Even though i dislike meme-coins with all of my heart because i really think that the meme-coin hype wave of last year where hundreds of new meme-coins appeared each and everyday were very harmful for the crypto market as a whole because they took away attention and also funds of course from \"real\" projects that were actually trying to achieve something, i have to say that i will always have a soft spot for Dogecoin. I will probably never invest into Dogecoin myself because i simply avoid meme-coins but i think the project as a whole is pretty likeable.Regarding the price of Dogecoin. I don't really know what to expect from it because especially meme-coins are extremely hard to predict in my opinion. I think both outcomes are possible.",

But if bitcoin slides to the bottom and hits $15k or lower, Dogecoin could likely fall again. And if that happens, we don't know what the bottom price of Dogecoin will be and we can only guess. With a large amount of Dogecoin currently circulating, it might be difficult to raise the price unless there was an event like yesterday where the price got a pump so it could rise sharply. We can only hope that what will happen next can bring good changes for Dogecoin and make its price increase again.",
