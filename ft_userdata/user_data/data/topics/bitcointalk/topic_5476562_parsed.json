But if you know that you want to have huge amount on a gambling site, better to use more than two bookies.I will prefer Stake.com. After the hack of over $40 million, the gambling site is still not shaked but sturdy.I do not know how rich you are, but I think I should say that you should gamble responsibly.",

Both sites have been online a while, has a long running signature campaign and you don't see a lot of complaints about both sites, so I think it is safe to play with larger amounts on there, but I would just test them out with a smaller amount and see what you think of it.",

I'd be more worried about their limits because you might have problems placing that amount in some of their markets. That said, I also recommend their suggestion above and try to open more accounts in other sportsbooks. This way you still have a backup if one of the sportsbooks you regularly use starts to place a cap in some of the markets you take.",

Although I don't often use those casinos, maybe just once in a while so this isn't a full recommendation, it's just a contribution and suggestion.",

I played at both the site many days back, and had no issues while withdrawing. Still I would suggest to check the recent reviews before depositing and big amount in either of the site.If you don’t break any terms and conditions of the site, then definitely you won’t have any issue with them I am assuming. Moreover if you want, you can try playing at Stake.com, currently it’s my favourite for placing large bets in various sports events.",

If it deposit big amount in these platform they are quite trusted and don't worry for the platform to steal your funds but if you gamble all of them in one game then you will lose all of it.On the other hand if your plan is to gamble with small amounts or moderate amount then you can deposit only that amount first and play , withdraw if you win. In summary we won't have a problem the depositing amounts in this platform but we can lose money by betting or gambling with big amounts.",

They have their fair play model and they have been doing good for a long time. I would say that it's better to have KYC done on such platforms before betting on those platforms. I believe that there may be many high-rollers having 10k or more on those platforms and so far there haven't been many issues with those platforms. I would still say that you'll have to use your original documents for KYC purpose and only start depositing on those platforms when your KYC is completed.",

I don't mean that you won't be able to get your money back but I think you might face problems like KYC and delayed withdrawal because there have been cases like these with huge wins. Check the trust on their bitcointalk profiles, check references and you'll understand what I mean.I think it's safer to bet high bets on sportsbet.io and stake.com. By the way, in any case, if you bet high on FortuneJack and Rollbit, even if you face problems, there is a very high chance that you'll be able to get your winnings with the help of the community.

But those casino you mentioned is reputable so I guess they can be trusted with that amount but make sure you read their rules and also you are ready to submit your KYC since this is required before you can use all the feature that you want from them. Also take not on this that casinos is strictly implementing a AML policy so just make sure the money you want to deposit is really clean, because you know for yourself what will happen if this funds came from illegal.",
