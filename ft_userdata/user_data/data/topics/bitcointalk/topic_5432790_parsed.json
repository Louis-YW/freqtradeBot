Do you think that you can beat institutions and Fed, the place that prints money?Better think again and stop with these stupid ideas because the more you try to push the bears, the more the bears will kill your hopes by burying your positions and liquidate you. Losing $5 alone won't matter a lot, but losing millions of dollars collectively will lower the confidence of both, the investors and the traders who go for this.A few important questions:Who will hold the funds here?Who is trustworthy enough to execute your plans in real?If we are here for pumps and dumps only, where is decentralisation and what is the point of crypto if we only want more volatility and profits only?",

You need to make your post meaningful.To binance liquity donation or anu other EXCHANGERS.No matter how we make profit but profit and volatility must be there .Exchangers should collect funds to execute big dpms or pmps but big ones like 50% up or down. So if i entry on position with high leverage i make in few hours from 1000$ to 10000$ either short or long.",

It's not clear what you are suggesting. Are you suggesting that individuals should donate money in order to improve liquidity and volatility in the futures markets? If so, it is unlikely that such a scheme would be effective. The liquidity and volatility of financial markets are influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, market regulations, and investor sentiment, among others. It is unlikely that small individual donations would have a significant impact on these factors. Additionally, it is not clear how the money collected from such donations would be used to improve liquidity and volatility in the futures markets.",

There are for sure, those people who did not trust who will hold the fund. There is a question above that I want to ask again since you did not answer --who holds the fund? is this trustworthy enough? We know money is the root of evil, it could create any crime once it is a huge amount. However, I don't think it will help, you need a large chunk of money before you can control the market. Even big whales now have hard to manipulate the market, because it cost too much of dollars before they can play the market.",

This could lead to potential exit scam, i dont think anyone will be a dump to the extent of sending donation to a random address to aid liquidity during volatility, the question is how long will you continue the pumping and what mechanism do you have to suppot the stability of liquidity supply in form of the so called $5 donation.Quote from: Osama Maaz on January 03, 2023, 11:01:00 AMIn crypto field if you are helping your self then you dont need anyones help this field need high experience and knowledge , And you are talking about  liquidity and volatility patience is the key dont take high leverage trades and stop panic trades.I think ops is confused and he is over thinking things in his head, and no one will buy into that idea.

No one will agree with your idea, and my guess is that you don't even have details about it yourself. $5 is relatively small and if collected by many people it will be a lot of money but we will not be able to fight the whales and the Fed who have not only money but the ability to make regulations that can change the direction of the crypto market, sometimes it is the regulations that have more impact than the money they have.",

If you are trading on high it is good for profit because in a twinkle of an eye you are up in profit but that is same way that you will run in losses when you are losing. Which do you prefer then?
