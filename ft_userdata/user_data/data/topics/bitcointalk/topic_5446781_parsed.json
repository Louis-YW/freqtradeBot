I mean, who needs AI-generated footage when you can just slap together some random clips from various sources, right? Prompt: \"Colorful aliens skydiving above island\"Shows stock footage of Wingsuit Flying over the Maldives Islands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6VpZ3bnnKIPrompt: \"Parrot eating on the tree\"Shows stock footage of a bird on a tree branch eating: https://videohive.net/item/a-wild-turquoise-fronted-amazon-bird-amazona-aestiva-perched-on-chinaberry-tree-eating-melia-azed/37132960So, your so-called \"revolutionary text to video AI generator\" is nothing more than a cheap and dishonest trick.",

Your whietepaper... well, litepaper, also didn't cover anything about this or other important details.It also came to my awareness that you previously raised two projects, one far back in 2018 and one only last year, which no longer accessible today.",
