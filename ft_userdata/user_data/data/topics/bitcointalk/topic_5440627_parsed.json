Since at some points it has some compliments bof luck.After some time of discussion, he has been told that it's just for them to choose on the candles sticks if it's up the they want to choose or the one going up just with this idea can they trade with such an idea.so I wan to know if it's right for the person to begin trading?",

Whether in stocks or crypto. And they told other people and they also started to trade. And its all good until the bubble pops. I had so many of my friends trading in 2021 making killer profits. Both in stocks and crypto. Then 2022 came and most people lost all their gains.You wont make any decent money just by following candlesticks patterns, because they work half the time and the other time they dont work. You need to find out what trend we are in and trade that way using candlesticks. So basically in 2021 if you traded using bullish candlesticks patterns it would help you. If in 2022 you used bearish candlesticks patterns it would help. However you don't know what kind of market you are in until its too late or in hindsight.My advice try and trade with a small account and see how it works out. Or trade demo. They got it available for all cryptos and stocks on tradingview app.",

The most important thing is for he to save more money and settle down to learn more about crypto trading before he can start with small amount of money to test his self before he can increase his capital in the crypto trading. The type of coin to buy in the market, is very important for newbies to know before investing, because know the type of coin to buy will determine the profit you are going to achieve when the price of that particular coin increase higher in the market.",

Every trader out there started as a beginner. So. for me, it's either good or bad. Good if you trust the process if you learn and are dedicated to learning how to trade, and bad if you don't want to learn or you become greedy. Trading is a difficult job for me, it involved money, and you may become bankrupt while trading which is the normal case, a lot of people already experienced this.And take note, most of the beginners or new in trading are intended to stop trading because of various reason after there few trades.",

For sure, he will just deposited it and guessing the price on where he trade without proper strategy, and he will end up losing his couple of months' savings. Though he can do copy trading, but for sure, he doesn't know anything or what's going on if he puts his money on it.

Just to add that trading is promoted a lot because the houses earn a lot of money in commissions. That is, they earn every time you buy or sell, so they are more interested in their clients trading than Buy and Hold, which is a safer way to earn, as long as you buy bitcoin or premium products.",

Is trading good for beginners? Professional traders started as beginners as well right? I mean what kind of question is that. As we start trading, we are all beginners already. As you have that experience in trading, overtime you will not be a newbie anymore. Maybe change your question to \"Is trading good for people who don't have knowledge at all?\" That would be a better question. Trading without any knowledge is like having a quiz without any knowledge regarding that particular topic, and you will fail miserably. If you don't want to learn first, just don't try trading at all. Even those who are trading for a very long time are experiencing losses still. Go try demo accounts in different trading platforms such as Binance since they have one. Instead of putting your money into trading, at least put your money into yourself.",
