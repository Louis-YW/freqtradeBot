And which exchanges have the cheapest listing?You can start a bounty campaign, make referral system, give advertisement to well known news sites etc.If you are looking for exchanges with cheap listing then that means you don't really believe in your project. Good projects get listed without even giving any money to exchanges. Your impression you made here is that you have a copycat coin that you want to sell ignorant people to get rich quick.",

Is there a real use case for it, or is it more of an idea without a product behind it? The first step would be to introduce the concept and your product to the relevant community, like the one here.  If the idea is solid and the token actually serves a purpose, it should gain traction naturally. Or are we talking about yet another useless \"pump-and-dump\" kind of shitcoin here?",

You can hire someone to take care of it for you.Go to this board to have an idea on how to promote here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0As for the exchange, not sure about it, maybe you have to go to some exchange and ask them directly. Of course, if you are looking for the cheapest, then most likely it could be just second tier exchanges.",

Top exchanges as far I know, charges huge amount to get them listed, again, if my memory serves me right,  could be around 1 BTC. But this is way back around 2017-2018. So for sure listing in top exchanges like Binance could have hefty sum of money.Quote from: Wiwo on September 02, 2023, 10:04:44 PMAny exchange that takes fees from projects to list their coins is not legit at all since scam projects could easily pay the fees just to get their coin listed and thereafter do an exit scam on the coin holders. Exchanges take fees because it's business though, I mean it's like they are the facilitator, so as a project, you will used their name to have your coin on them. So it's mutually exclusive, exchanges facilitate you pay them, you used their trading platform. Your project them will be exposed to traders.Maybe in the beginning, this project doesn't have any money to list to top exchange that's why they chooses the cheapest, but for me, this is not good practice.Better to start your foot in a good exchange regardless of the fees because for sure you can get it back.",

There have been some answers like making your own campaign in this forum. You can also start to build engagement to the public by offering incentive task for anyone who participated in your campaign. There are some like zealy or something else which will also help you in increasing the engagement from your project to the public. You can consider this as one of option to promote your token. Listing your token to the exchange site can also give you a lot of demands to your tokens.

You just need to provide liquidity for that. If this belong to the cex and my answer will be MEXC",

But most effective how to promote your token need spent budget and advertising on website are more popular in cryptocurrency like advertise with Coinmarketcap website banner. Looking for exchange with cheapest listing seems LBANK or exchange with medium level.Actually I like with token listing in Hotbit but this exchange have stop operation and looks Gate.io are similar exchange like Hotbit and have cheapest listing fees than bigger exchange like Binance, Huobi or Kucoin. Better advertising for promoting your coins and easily become popular than promoting trough bounty campaign or airdrop way.",

Promoting a project is very important but if the developer focuses more on its fundamental and for being a good project, then for sure promotions will come on its own and the investors will make voice to promote such project. This is why the project developer should not only focus on the hype but instead focus more on their progress and their roadmap.",

And which exchanges have the cheapest listing?The easiest way will be through exchanges although they cost money,  a lot of it I'd say. I doubt there's any exchange that would accept cheap fees,  so just expect it to be rather costly.  I looked it up and topmost result says small exchanges charge a minimum of $6k, max of $30k.  It'd probably be better to look for it yourself but that should give you a frame of sorts to work with.Another way is through social media. With how it's grown, it's reach can affect a LOT of people if done properly, so I suggest hiring a manager for that. This can cost less or more than listing your token in an exchange depending on how much visibility you want your token to have. I'd say hire some shit posters if you really want it to be cheap, but hey, cheap solutions come with cheap results.",

You will pay your participants at your own chosen payment options. Bounty hunters are more interested on rewards with value, for sure your bounty campaign will have a lot of participants if you choose a campaign which offers fiat payment. Another method is by utilizing social media, post some promotions on various social medias. I don't have any idea of the current pricing of centralize exchange listing fees but as far as I know, listing it on decentralize exchange is way cheaper but you have to provide liquidity for your token.",
