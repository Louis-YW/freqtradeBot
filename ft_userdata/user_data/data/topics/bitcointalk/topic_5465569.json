  "content": "BTCORC-CASH is a token standard based on the Ordinals Protocol, designed to best suit the UTXO security model. This is a simplified version of the ORC-20 Standard for easier implementation and wider adoption of all UTXO-based Blockchains, most of the rulesets are inspired by BRC-20 & ORC-20 Standards including the OIPs proposed by community members.https://docs.orc.cash/overview/how-it-workhttps://infosat.io/Design PhilosophyThe design of the ORC-CASH Protocol is based on a few fundamental ideas:A token protocol on UTXO-based networks like Bitcoin should be a Cash System just like the native coinsTokens deployed on such networks should be maximumly protected by all the Hash Powers on each networkA complete transaction record should be kept fully on-chain to be Immutable and Transparent for any indexer with the correct rulesets to interpret and conclude exactly the same resultA token protocol should be Project-Friendly and allows Multi-Purpose deploymentsA token protocol should have a Stable foundation but also be Flexible and ExpandableA token protocol should be fully OpenSource and Community-DrivenThe 'O' in ORC-CASH stands for Ordinals & Openness.'CASH' as it suggests, introduces a cash system that utilizes the Ordinals/Inscriptions as the tokens themselves which can be transferred freely and securely through the network that is authenticated by each and every node on the network.Once a token was deployed, the 'Deployer' inscription/ordinal represents the ownership of the token project itself and allows the holder of the Deployer future upgrades to the token specs, this ownership can be traded/transferred by changing ownership of the Deployer ordinal. The same ticker name can be deployed multiple times, each time with a different Token ID.When a token balance is minted or transferred, the inscriptions/ordinals (Mint/Send Inscriptions) themselves become Cash Bills with a serial number and can be traded/transferred freely and securely through the network, the token balance is always attached to and follows the UTXO that contains the inscriptions/ordinals unless they have to be Split into smaller denominations.Splitting the cash bills that carry the token balance works with a designated burn/blackhole wallet address (Burn Wallet) on each network, the cash bills to be split need to be sent to the designated Burn Wallet address on each network that functions like a universal ATM (Automated Teller Machine). Â Sending any valid cash bills to the Burn Wallet will create a Token Credit to the sender's wallet address, which enables the wallet holder to create additional valid cash bills in smaller denominations to their own wallet, by inscribing Send Inscriptions with smaller amounts until the Token Credit runs out.The Token Credit system is an important addition to the cash system:It floats on top of wallet addresses, and can only be moved by inscribing additional inscriptions/ordinals (Send/Sell/Airdrop...).It adds more flexibility for the token holders in how they manage their token balancesIt enables the introduction of additional features that also cost Token Credits, like Sell and Airdrop which can move them in more interesting ways but still have immutable on-chain recordsThe combination of the Cash System and the Token Credit System gives the ORC-CASH Protocol the security and simplicity of the UTXO cash function in daily usage, while also providing more functionalities to potential token projects that want to adopt and utilize the token standard.https://twitter.com/TheBitassets/status/1698156190386065525?s=20",
