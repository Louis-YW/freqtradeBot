  "content": "Cointelegraph a few days back reported on Gemini Exchange setting up an Engineering hub in India. I understand India has a big talent pool to support them. Imagine how much FDI can be achieved if a concrete & crypto friendly regulation can do for this country to achieve a 5 trillion dollar economy.It pisses me off whenever I see a Herbalife advertisement being displayed in an IPL match. They would support a known pyramid scheme whereas would discourage the future to become the present of India. Considering the number of scams happening in MLM till today I think it is far lesser than what Crypto has done. By seeing the activities on our western neighbor's local board. I feel this harsh decision was taken to prevent illegal activities. Unless they find a solution to it I am certain that we will live with severe restrictions on crypto. That might take a decade knowing how long our government takes to a single decision. Do share your thoughts on my outburst!",

Jumping straight into Herbalife & sharing my experience. They are just a bunch of retards who are promoting primarily a protein shake.How do they find a scapegoat?You will find these mindfucks outside of any mall. They screen those fatty & old people. They would approach you, ask you if you want to check your weight for free. We Indian love anything which is free. Go back into the past and try to remember. There was a time when every Indian would stand on those weighing machine at a railway station to check their weight. I don't see them enough know.Coming back to the scam scheme. You would certainly go and check your weight. They would then tell you that your weight is bad after asking your age. They would then suggest you to come to their convocation. As an Indian you would have heard from your mother, wife & sometime from your father that you are gaining weight. This statement is what makes you feel at their screening process that you are over your weight limit. You are now in that state of mind that you are going to die as your weight is above their standard. You go to their recruitment hub and they would make you pay 5k. After joining you would do the same. This is so bad that many senior citizens have lost their retirement earnings and some have died after consuming too much of their supplements. Such MLM are more scary than crypto as they target senior citizens and the government is doing nothing.",

You forgot to add PS this timeÂ  Â Please don't suspect me as a part of that sin based MLM company. I found about because a lot of near and dear once joined it. Ultimately they failed and cribbed about Herbalife. After Amway got banned in India this group got a huge boost. One of the reason would be, none of the down line as reported it to the police. As they are busy drinking protien shake.",

It is very simple, restrict everyone from the middle class to gain financial independence &make them realize that government is the god as well as saviour of your problems. Isn't it what has been happening for a decade now. Lol! What @Bureau told is correct, now they have a different way to approach people and convince them to join their MLM. I would create a topic on it in the coming days.",

Tax benefit, cheap software developer, easy policy to setup an infrastructure, cheap rent and many more benefits. I agree we as a country need these companies. I do not agree with the hypocrisy towards and industry related to trading crypto.",
