Once you find the corresponding changes, work backwards and reimplement the feature. It doesn't seem like a big change though, so it shouldn't be too hard. Make sure you have a dev environment set up so you can compile and debug. If you need recommendations or even an OVA.OVF with everything ready to go let me know.",
