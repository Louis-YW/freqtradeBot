  "content": "I have been recently trying to find out which crypto projects can become an Ethereum killer? I did a few search and found out that Cardano could have become the next best cryptocurrency after Ethereum. It could have even become better than Ethereum. It was launched in 2015, by Charles Hoskinson who was also the co-founder of Ethereum. At that time it was way ahead of the Ethereum blockchain. It was scalable, energy efficient & used POS protocol. What I see now is Ethereum is following its footsteps. What I want to know is why it failed? I do know that the developers were lazy and they did not provide the necessary support. What else can be the reason? Help me with the reasons and do tell me is it worth staking Cardano? I see the price very lucrative but I don't know how much it can make a difference in my life if I purchase it only for the purpose is staking it. Thanks.",

Although the results are better than Ethereum and when compared to the price it is more comfortable for anyone to purchase & stake it.My opinion is that except Bitcoin (if you bought before 2011) you wouldn't be able to create financial freedom. That being said, the price point of Bitcoin at the moment is encouraging. I know that Bitcoin is too costly, investing in small amount can lead you to financial freedom. Whereas investing in altcoin is beneficial if you know what to do!If you can DYOR on that project before investing.",

Â Not everyone can afford 1 Bitcoin, you need to invest in it every month, and sometime in the future, you would accumulate 1 Bitcoin. Through staking, you will be able to do it fast using a cryptocurrency like Cardano. 1 ETH is out of reach for a common man, you can start staking with a small amount, but the desired return won't be high. If you are completely focused on the staking process of ADA at its price point, you can purchase more than 1 ADA and start staking with good returns.",

The team has been delayed it's progress to such an extent that I don't know whether it is good or bad to invest in it. I do agree with your argument on staking. I would still leave it as it if you are asking for my opinion.",

But there are tons of NFT and DEFI projects on Cardano that seem to be making progress on it. The latest news I saw on Twitter about ADA was Vodafone releasing NFTs on the platform. Nothing really that might contribute to ADA being one ETH killer but for those who ikes staking I guess the token will still be attracktive.",

That won't considerably affect thier price but might help them to gain good market cap. When the next Bull run comes that would automatically increase thier value. Still, they won't be able to kill Ethereum unless the teams show significant developments and regain the lost trust.",

As per your saying these so called Ethereum killers are copying what Ethereum has already done. They are not unique as Ethereum has been through its inception. Ethereum to an extent was unique in its own way, whereas these other projects started with something unique but are now following the ETH path.",

Just checked it on CMC after reading your reply. I do not want to say this but do you think SOL will be able to hold its position? There are better projects than SOL & ADA on that list. Recently I was going through the whitepaper of ALGO and I found it to be very easy to understand. I think most of us have not even looked into it. I do believe that in some time like 5 years, this project might be in the top 10 on CMC. What do you think about this project?",

I won't be able to comment whether it can hold is ranking but it did surpass ADA. Algorand is a good project but it lacks trust as it is still being worked on and it is a new project compared to the others we are discussing here.

ADA might again regain that spot in a few months time. ALGO looks promising to me and I am planning to use it for staking purposes. There is speculation that it might go up to $50 by 2030. I do agree with your point that it is a new project and that is the reason I feel this project has the potential and investing in it can be beneficial for long-term gain.",
