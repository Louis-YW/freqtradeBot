Are they paying? First of all to clarify this, you know SUI has no plans to airdrop to the community. But if you are referring to Crew3 platform then I think it is quite good for people looking for airdrops or bounty programs, however what I observed is that the platform is also having censorship issues quality of participants when the problem of fraud still occurs a lot.",

This airdrop farming is becoming a crowded trade recently and the developers are watching, something tells me they are going to surprise airdrop farmers, SUI is a well-funded project and the tech looks promising but I will advise you to use the Dapps on the chain rather than doing all these social media promotions giving out points, you don't know if the points would be converted into tokens in future.",

Are they paying? The primary rule when it comes to airdrop is never ever make yourself do make use of your main wallet whenever it does involved on connecting wallet like Metamask.Im much aware about that SUI project which it is indeed true that they arent giving out any airdrops and its been clarified out.About that crew3xyz then i do have those kind of doubtsconsidering that name itself xyz thing is just really just that generic.I cant really just trust up any projects like that having those type of names.Speaking about airdrop as long you arent shelling out money or having kyc then that what it matters.",

And every few minutes there is somebody coming in the channel asking \"how do I get the airdrop\". They basically saw how people made a killing with BLUR and ARB recently, they want to get ZkSync airdrop next.However I am pretty sure it will be more work than its worth unless you are doing extremely large transactions. If you are only doing $50 worth of transactions once a month, I dont think the airdrop will be much. Many got a few thousand ARB tokens because they had like $500K running through their network.",

Are they paying? OP I've never used an airdrop like the one you mentioned. But there is no airdrop of all projects that will bring you success. Few days ago ARB went on an airdrop where people got good profit by joining. With time some projects come which can get good profit if you join them. Besides, most of the airdrops nowadays are very bad natured with no chance of success.",

Are they paying? The airdrop season is getting hyped again, and as far as I know SUI will have no airdrop so don't expect for that.Also, you have to be more careful on choosing the project because not all those who claim to have an airdrop is worth trying, most probably they are just riding with the hype so better to do your own research as well about the project and see its true potential. Be careful with the fake project and fake airdrop, you might be giving too much information to them that can result to a collapse of your own wallet.",

Are they paying? I am also new to Crew3 and I observed that their are thousands of accounts registered on the platform, so it is not easy to reach the top 20 or 50 position and qualify for rewards.However for Sui, they said every XP earned will be converted to Sui points which qualifies one for their airdrop, I'll advise you to join and connect with a new account. In this particular case, you will even need a new Sui wallet to claim your airdrop.",

I often use the platform to get NFT and yes, all the tasks you complete will be rewarded with points, when your points and level have gone up, you can get your reward from the projects.I just completed some tasks from Galoswap on crew3 and the platform is working fine.

Are they paying? They don't pay anything, because this platform doesn't hold any tokens, it just provides an opportunity to be active in certain projects by connecting your social networks and your wallet, via web3. SUI promises to be very generous, but if you complete all the tasks in crew3, it doesn't mean you get paid anything. In addition to crew3, SUI also has various activities, including signing up for various services, participating in testnetworks, and more.",
