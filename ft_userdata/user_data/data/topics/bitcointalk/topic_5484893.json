  "content": "I don't wanna download the whole 500+ GB of blockchain data and verify it again. It's already fully sync (100%) on my windows laptop. But I was thinking of changing OS, probably shift to any Ubuntu flavour distro. I would have re-downloaded everything but the thing is my Internet speed is the worst. It'll take more than 15 days to download and verify the whole thing. And I don't have the patience for that. So I was thinking if it's possible to maybe somehow, you guys know what I mean.Note: please ignore any misconception/mistakes or wrong terms if used. I'm new to Bitcoin core. I was curious, so I'm trying to understand these things. Thanks...",
