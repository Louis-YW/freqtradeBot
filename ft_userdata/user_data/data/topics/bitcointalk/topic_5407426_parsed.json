  "content": "Zenlink is a basic DEX cross-chain protocol based on the Polkadot network, which aims to create a highly scalable next-generation DEX cross-chain network. By integrating the Zenlink DEX module, the project allows parachains to easily and quickly access all DEX capabilities and share liquidity with other parachains. Zenlink DEX Aggregator can link all DEX decentralized applications on Polkadot, it's like Curve + 1inch in one bottle. In simple terms, Zenlink is a DEX through which any parachain can deploy its own internetworking DEX, which provides users with the ability to easily and quickly exchange with low slippage. Zenlink consists of: ● Zenlink Protocol: Upper layer unified general DEX protocol.● Zenlink DEX module: is a module that allows parachains to integrate to exchange liquidity with other DEXs on other parachains.● DEX Aggregator: Easy and convenient entry into the world of DEX, which is compatible with almost all DEX on Polkadot, with which users can do a couple of clicks, perform an operation with DEX with low slippage.● Zenlink Token (ZLK): Zenlink DEX protocol token, which is used for administration, liquidity.● Zenlink DEX Network: A decentralized exchange network consisting of the Zenlink DEX module, Zenlink DEX aggregator and other DEX applications on parachains.  Zenlink has already received support from major investment funds such as Alameda, HashKey Crypto, Okex Blockdream Ventures, IOSG Ventures, D1 Ventures, Continue Capital, Youbi Capital, SNZ Holding.      Zenlink received two grants from the Web3 Foundation: ● The first of them was awarded for the development of a prototype cross-chain module for the Polkadot network. More details can be found here - https://medium.com/zenlinkpro/zenlink-receives-web3-foundation-grant-to-develop-cross-chain-dex-module-prototype-for-polkadot-c19bae267b10● The second for the implementation of the WASM smart contract - https://medium.com/zenlinkpro/zenlink-dex-smart-contract-is-open-source-9b0b9e0ebfa2 Tokenomics  Community: 50%● Trade mining: 15%, non-linear unlocking● Mining liquidity: 25%, non-linear unlocking● DAO: 5%, will be used upon request to cover development costs. Supervised by the community and Zenlink team.● Community Incentives: 5%, which are used to reward active ZLK community members and parachains who integrate the Zenlink DEX module.  Early investors: 26%:● Seed round: 7%, linear unlock every 3 months, 1/8 unlock every time● Angel investors: 11%, linear unlock every 2 months, 1/8 unlock every time● Series A: 8%, linear unlock every month, 1/8 unlock every time● Command: 20%, linear unlock every 3 months and release after 24 months (no unlocking during the first 2 months after launch).● Foundation: 4%, reserved, no unlock plans yet. Zenlink works with many big companies such as Math Chain, Chainlink, Web3 Foundation, Bitfrost, Plasm Network, Phala Network, Darwinia, OpenOcean, Sakeswap, Bondly.  Zenlink DEX DApp: https://dex.zenlink.pro/     Twitter: https://twitter.com/ZenlinkProWebsite: https://zenlink.pro/Wiki: https://wiki.zenlink.pro/Github: https://github.com/zenlinkproMedium: https://medium.com/zenlinkProWhitepaper: https://zenlink.pro/en/whitePaperTokenomics: https://wiki.zenlink.pro/resources/tokenomicsDiscord: https://discord.gg/8q75ZfUE8hZenlink Branding Resources: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eayLasEbZP5KkP02BbrKhec2orTF2D2GCoinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/ru/currencies/zenlink/",
