Visiteu el Repositori del paper blanc de Bitcoin a GitHub per obtenir instruccions i obrir un tema en cas de dubtes.But the git hub repo they link to, doesn't work at all... so, not sure about how to add the Catalán page again. And if it was there at some point, maybe you can find it on the way back machine page.EDIT:I found it: https://github.com/vsus/Bitcoin-Llibre-Blanchttps://bitcoin.org/files/bitcoin-paper/bitcoin_ca.pdf",

Perhaps, another way of trying to get it back up would be to contact the author of the Catalan translation, though he’s barely active on Twitter and his personal site is down.",
