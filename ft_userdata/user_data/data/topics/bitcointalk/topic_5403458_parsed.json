I didn't mention any of them, but you can check the list on the top 10 exchanges in coin market cap. You should research first to choose any exchange according to your needs, so don't easily trust anyone on the internet, especially about exchanges that you never know.Please check the list here: https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/",

Based on my own experience, after my account got verified on them (Personal Information, Government-issued ID, and Facial Recognition), until now, I have never encountered any hassles with regard to the KYC.My account also on other exchanges has been already verified like in Kucoin and Coinbase but I don't use them often, unlike in Binance which is already enough for me.",

Binance US is very strict on policies compared to their Binance.com domain.Be careful on using Kucoin if you are planning to trade there without KYC because you won't be able to withdraw without passing KYC verification. I heard someone experienced this and never solve his issue with a large number of funds under his account.Actually all exchanges have strict policies if you want to avoid them then the only solution is to use P2P exchange that doesn't need any KYC verification.

They're not really strict after you've verified your account since it became mandatory to all users that want to use them.And after Binance if you have changed your mind and you like an exchange that don't enforce a mandatory verification then kucoin is the next choice for you.",

You can't live hassle-free life in the crypto world at all unless just stick with Decentralized exchange. Don't try to verify multiple accounts with the same documents. You might be in trouble near future even if you skip trouble now. So be polite choose a high reputed exchange if you intend to use centralized exchange and follow the exact policy. Those are strict in policy they are the best. A flexible policy would hurt you later.",

What do you suggest?ThanksHonestly, I really think a lot of people are gonna have different experiences because I believe that the type of document one is verifying with also contributes greatly to how long and easy the verification process would go or last, for example, the experience one applying for a kyc verification with a plain id card will likely be different from one applying for the same with an international passport. On the note above, i will like to let the op and everyone else know the exchanges am currently verified on and how long it took -Binance exchange - less than 1 hour and on first trial.Kucoin exchange - less than 30 minutes and on first trial.Gate.io exchange - less than 1 hour and on first trial.Mexc exchange  - no longer sure how longer this took but i guess its less than an hour and on first trial.Digifinex exchange - almost 24 hours after second trial.Xt.com exchange - more than 3 days after third trial.Remitano exchange  - less than 5 minutes and on first trial.It might also interest you all to know that i used the same document for verification on all this exchanges, which my drivers license.",

Pretty standard. Agoradesk has an onion address too.Bisq penalizes users for needing KYC, which literally forces users in certain jurisdictions to break the law. Also a risk when accepting reversible payment methods. No thank you.Localcryptos admins are clueless and disrespectful based on my brief experience trading there. I would never recommend it. It's Ethereum-focused too. Has far less traders than Agoradesk.I checked Hodl Hodl and there were very few ads. It looks like no one uses it.",
