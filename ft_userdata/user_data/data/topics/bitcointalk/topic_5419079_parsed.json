  "content": "Hey everyone  We're a relatively new website that was mostly focused on PayNPlay gambling sites.We did add some crypto options as well and hope to expand our reach, so we thought that some of the readers here would be interested in our expertise.We'd love to hear more from anyone who has ideas on how to improve our crypto section.Also, at the moment and until December 1 2022, we have exclusive casino bonus codes with four partner casinos. Feel free to check them out on our website. We won't be spamming you with links here, but the offers are easily findable through the homepage and main menu bonuses->exclusive bonus offers.If we have some fun news for you or discover something interesting, like more exclusive bonuses for crypto gamblers, we'll post them in this thread.Hopefully, as we grow, we'll have even more time to become a useful member of the community.  Cheers and happy gambling.",

We'll check the copper membership and see if it's a smart move for us right now or in the near future when we'll hopefully have more funds to invest.  A copper membership is always a smart move for any business owner on this forum that doesn't want to hire a manager for the sole purpose of making a professional announcement thread, the copper membership cost about BTC0.00147829 which is currently worth around $30.28 based on current Bitcoin price.Please note that a professional announcement thread will attract more users to your service since it installs this idea of a serious business in the minds of people.By the way, its my first time visiting and i think the site looks great, will stick around to see how the project progress and possibly make use of  your service along the way.",

I still find the site a bit old-designed. The site doesn’t have night mode, and the white background is really annoying on the site. Nevertheless, I saw the pop-up that says to claim the bonus. I will definitely check the bonus and will update the review about it. Moreover, do you guys also do paid promotions and reviews of the site? If so, then it’s better to keep a separate section for this and then promote the casino.",

I think your website needs to have an option for people to switch from light to dark, another point is that looking at all the casinos listed on your website and then clicking here:Best Casino ( https://www.casinos.com/best-sites )Mobile Casinos ( https://www.casinos.com/mobile )New Casinos  ( https://www.casinos.com/new )Live Casinos ( https://www.casinos.com/live-dealer )They are the same casinos that are in these categories, perhaps it would be a case of placing different casinos in each category and not repeating themselves in other categories. And that way, in each category that you put a casino in, you could review that same casino. for example, if a casino X was in the best casino category, you would review that casino Therefore, all casinos that are in the best casino category will also be in the Mobile Casinos category. I don't see any reason to have many categories, if in fact it will be the same casinos in all categories, in my opinion. I could be wrong.That's why I'm going to take the opportunity to ask you the following question:Why did you create these categories (Best Casino, Mobile Casinos, New Casinos, Live Casinos )?",

      "body": "Hello everyone,As promised, we negotiated an exclusive bonus for our readers, and you can find it here - https://paynplay-casinos.com/exclusive-casino-offers/#Limited-Time_No_Deposit_Casino_Bonus_Code_Available_Right_NowIt's not too much, but it's a solid deal, so you can try out this new online casino. It's VPN friendly, crypto friendly, so we think you'll like it.We're working on another one, will post it here as soon as we confirm it!We're a small team, so we update things as we go and when we see cool things worth sharing.Let us try and answer some of the points you brought up without replying to everyone individually.- Yes, many of the casinos aren't that famous or well-known. But what's the point of us recommending sites that you all know? No promotions are paid, we list casinos that we like and that we think aren't too famous because everyone knows the famous ones. We do take commissions like all other affiliate business models but don't sell places on ranking tables or anything. We test the sites and then rank them as we believe they deserve to be ranked.- We try to negotiate exclusive deals and list them on the page linked above. Those get the best value for our readers because standard bonuses can be found anywhere.- There are many affiliate sites, as you know, and some of them are similar to ours, that's impossible to avoid. But we like online casinos, we like casino games, and creative methods of adding money and cashing out. There is so much fake and false info there, so we try to keep objective in the sense that we give you the facts, and you can decide whether you want to play. We're not saying you will win because you may not win; that's how gambling works. And many of the readers here are aware of that, but also there are many new players who believe things they read without double-checking.- Pay N Play is a payment feature created by Trustly, it's used in Scandinavian countries. It's an awesome feature that lets users deposit and immediately have an account through BankID without completing registration. BankID would do the registration and account verification in the background, so players wouldn't have to complete all those steps and waste time. We really think it's an awesome concept and that's why it was the main focus of our website. However, Pay N Play is available in only a few countries, and many of our visitors couldn't use it at all, so we decided to expand with alternative payment methods we think are worth your attention. When we added crypto casinos, we believed it would be useful for us and for you here to check our website and see what we have.The theme is obviously popular and one we'll keep using for the time being. Thanks for your feedback on it, any changes and improvements take a lot of time and resources. We don't always have either or both, but we really appreciate any feedback, even when it's negative. We'll see what can be done about the night mode.- Regarding the categories, in our opinion, the best casino overall may not be the best live dealer casino or the best mobile casino. Also, not all of the brands we recommend have the same payment methods, so the best casino with Trustly may not have AstroPay, and that's why we need separate pages for separate points of interest. Of course, you can open the best casino and see what it offers, but someone may search for a specific phrase, and they will land on that specific page and get that relevant information. That's how our team sees it; it's possible to be wrong, but for now, it's easy for us to organize what we've published so far in the way we have it. It can be reconsidered, but the results so far have been promising.Thank you all for your comments and feedback once again. Reading everything and responding while working on the site and having other activities in life isn't easy. We're slow sometimes (sometimes it takes us 2 years  ), but we always work to add cool info and cool casinos that you may not have tried. We're going to conferences, seeing the trends, reading news, so we're invested in this to give value to our readers.We're creating a VPN casinos page next and a CoinsPaid page also.Stay good, stay healthy, and stay lucky!",
