It's a reminder of the importance of education and understanding, both for individuals and society as a whole. Hopefully this experience prompts more open-mindedness and willingness to learn about emerging technologies like Bitcoin rather than jumping to conclusions based on hearsay. It also underscores the need for caution and diversification in investments especially when societal perceptions may not align with reality",

What makes me skeptical to believe on this kind of story is how did the parents got alarm on the son activities on Bitcoin if the subject is doing well on his investment? Besides, he is already 21 years old which is already old enough to do whatever he wants without the parent consent. Dragging authority against their son is surely a disaster if this story is legit.",

Before calling police, parents must try to handle this issue inside family and calling police is very last step to do.This story is for a single family and I does not see it is too popular in society, in any country.",

Obviously this is dangerous, his parents is his biggest enemy that ruin his privacy, but this case is rare because only few people can change their life when they start from poor.Even if the story isn’t about the OP it is clear that the story (if it’s true) must have come from a family in the third world countries. This is places where youths engage massively in cyber crime and the stereotype is transferred to all youths doing a remote job. You can blame a parent that basically sends his kid to very funds even for upkeep not to be concern when they see him spending lots of that money later. It might be a thing of luck but we have seen lots of people getting lucky with even airdrops that changes there lives some of them might have got lucky the coin pumped to more than a significant amount and later they invested into others and that’s how they grow. Even a signature earner here on the forum can be worthy in a remote society   That’s how bad some places economy are. But the parent made a big mistake by calling the authorities, now the child isn’t save again",

I expected him to have been able to present it in a way rather than saying it out to his parents who are not educated about it.Okay what if he is sincere and genuine as the case may be but  in the process of buying the bitcoin maybe a p2p purchase or so and the source of the purchase is from a flagged wallet address unknown to him would this not have resulted to another issues which he never have had in mind all in the name of his parents being ignorant to the fact that their son is a bitcoin investor and if that had happened believe me the police would not want to hear anything but explanations from where and how he managed to get the coin from that wallet and this would have resulted to another thing.In some cases, one needs to be smart as to telling people the source of their income. Not everybody you should open your mouth to tell your source of income most especially when it happens that you mostly do remote job which requires you to sit at home and work just like as it is here. Your source of income you be between you and your God so that you do not put yourself into problem. I believe the young man has learnt his lesson and would be very much careful next time.",

It's even worse when you make your crypto engagement your major source of earning and people don't see you leave your home and come back like the 8am to 5pm dudes do.
