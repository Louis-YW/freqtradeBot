      "body": "I like to ask what are coingecko, coinmarketcap, pancakeswap's contributions to projects that present them as partners. The fact that a project is listed on those platforms does not make them partners in my opinion, and it does not attract traders or investors. As the new start-up season begins, new altcoins should avoid this pattern. The team twitter links do not lead to the member's profile",
