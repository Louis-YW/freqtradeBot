I like fiat because of that, I can spend it, but I can not hold it. Bitcoin has limited supply, just 21 million coins. What is not scarce but available to everyone with ease would have little value, but the 21 million supply and the demand, makes bitcoin valuable. Bitcoin become a means of investing, people buy it and hold it because of its value that appreciates over certain time. Also helping peopole in long term as an hedge against inflation.I will say bitcoin is more than portable, because it is digital, not something physical.",

Not to mention all that gold found on various asteroids or other planets in our solar system. Bitcoin has a far greater advantage here and has a far fairer and cleaner way of mining, regardless of all the theories that it is energy demanding and has a negative impact on the environment.When it comes to resistance to censorship, Bitcoin has its advantages, but only if we remove centralized crypto exchanges and potentially bad Bitcoin miners from that equation, because both can censor our transactions or freeze funds at a certain BTC address.As for authenticity and forgery, not everything is as clear as it seems - because we have some BTC forks that are still presented as real BTC, while on the other hand, anyone who does not have enough knowledge about Bitcoin can buy any coin called Bitcoinxxx, or can be scammed to buy testnet coins.Is Bitcoin the best choice? Maybe, but only for those who understand it at least in some basics.",

Do not all three have the same strong drive in how the market works. Investing in Bitcoin for gold lovers is of course often not considered a hedge because of what they think is the type that can be seen. But for us having large amounts of money in Bitcoin gives us freedom of sole rights and cannot be owned by any party. Having a large amount of gold will continue to be monitored, as well as fiat which only makes you focus more on ownership taxes. While Bitcoin is loose",

You can be charged as low as $0.0.. depending on the speed you want. This is really friendly to bitcoiners. However fiat is still standing in the minds of many especially non risk takers that prefer to hodl in fiat because they can easily monitor it because of stability.",

For the now bitcoin is the best choice, but we can't say it will always remain the best choice.

I like fiat because of that, I can spend it, but I can not hold it.Just like you, fiat should not be kept long term as it always loses its value. Fiat is only to be owned as a means of everyday payment whereas bitcoin and gold should be considered as long term investment assets. I don't plan on having fiat as a bank deposit, it won't do much in the long term.Quote from: Charles-Tim on September 04, 2022, 10:36:32 AMBitcoin has limited supply, just 21 million coins.

Therefore overtime people might try and switch to much greener options, might happen, might not happen, might be forced to happen, who knows ?

Despite its short history and volatile character, it may be studied and understood in contrast to other systems that are controlled by those in positions of authority. It won't be an issue to hodl it, and it will be the greatest option for one. Every other choice in the table has provided a clearer explanation of why holding bitcoin will be the greatest option for storing money.

This is why its clear that bitcoin is something that will take a bit of time before it could calm down and it will always be volatile. There isn't any problems with the situation we are in right now, its quite alright and we shouldn't be shocked with the fact that nobody really cares about stabtility and they all want volatile because traders are main interest group and they love it when it goes up and down.",
