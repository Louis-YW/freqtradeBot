I clearly recall thinking that cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) was a Ponzi scheme in 2015 when a buddy first introduced it to me. So, one day when I was browsing YouTube, I came across a video that was clearly explaining the idea of Bitcoin and the Blockchain network. Wow, this is wonderful, I thought. I went online to obtain more resources to help me since I was intrigued and found the use of Bitcoin to be increasingly fascinating. Now that I know more about how it operates, I'm thinking about investing in it. I ponder getting a loan from the bank even though I don't have enough cash on hand, but I later decide that's not the wisest course of action, due to the danger involved in an uncertain situation. I went and told my uncle about Bitcoin. I informed him that this was a new method of generating income. He was first reluctant to invest in it, but I persisted and even made a pledge to accept responsibility for whatever transpired. Life is all about taking risks, he added, so I wasn't worried about losing it all. I simply wanted to give it a shot. He offered me a sizable sum of money to put in Bitcoin while the price was low, but when it skyrocketed, I thought about selling it out so we could profit greatly from it.

I don’t fancy taking loans to buy bitcoin, you took a lot of risk financially and reputation wise, if you can’t afford it or buy from your own pocket then you shouldn’t. There are rare cases where taking such risks are rewarded like your story. Rest assured this is only a good story because it has a happy ending where both investors made profits. Anything other than that I’m sure you will be singing a different tone.",

Im assuming its on $ right, but when I checked your profile history it seems that you are still doing bounty hunting for tokens. This is quite weird instead of doing that might learn on trading or put some of that cash on business instead. Thats a lot of money already to do free hunting tokens.",

      "body": "OP you and your uncle are some of the few persons that believed in bitcoin when many saw it as worthless. I will say you guys were brave and also lucky. I didn't have such opportunity in 2015 because many people have been scammed in my area using bitcoin investment which made me to loose interest in the sector. I would not say I am late because the bitcoin still has the same opportunity it had in 2015. I am very glad that I am now part of this great movement.  Quote from: Hyphen(-) on December 05, 2022, 06:32:21 AMTaking a loan is not recommended because Bitcoin investment involves very high risk; rather, you invest your personal money; however, as you stated, it ends up being good for your investment; I hope you make good use of the money.Looking at your profile, I see that you are involved in Bounties in the altcoin section of this forum, which are mostly worthless as they are almost all scams these days.

But he said he is still a millionaire till date. It might be possible that he is fond of bounty hunting or he sees it as a hobby.",

LOL you have to be realistic enough about the price of bitcoin reaching $1 million, I would even say that Bitcoin can also go up to $100 million, but who knows how many years. don't think too much about the target which is still very far away, just hoping that bitcoin can reach the latest ATH at $ 100k is already a good target. Regarding bad and good actors in the crypto market, they are just manipulators who can only influence prices but not completely because bitcoin cannot be regulated by anyone. enjoy the ride with bitcoins buy now and hold on to new ATH targets, that will be enough and Bitcoin will improve the lives of all of us.",
