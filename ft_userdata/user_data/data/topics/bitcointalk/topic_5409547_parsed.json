  "content": "Hi everyone,I don't know if anybody will read this but if I can help one person not get scammed, I've done well Beware of this person - https://www.facebook.com/Bruno0Carvalho1 (he changed the link to his profile)He says his name is Bruno Carvalho, his Facebook profile states he trades for other people. I was very curious so I messaged him and he explained that he places trades and you can \"copy trade\" his trades. He would get 20% of the net profit, no monthly fees. It all sounded pretty good.Anyway, when something seems too good to be true, you MUST get suspicious. For the fun I decided to go all the way. So he had me download Trust Wallet and deposit $300 worth of BTC. I did it.Then he sent me to this website https://tradexpats.com/ where I was supposed to transfer my crypto to. This is where I was like Ok this website has no contact info, no nothing. He said it's a trusted website and he's been using it for about 5 years.I checked the domain's WHOIS and it's only been registered for less than 2 months.I called him out. He blocked me Â Here is a screenshot of our conversation for whoever is curious - https://ibb.co/PQPt541 . Enjoy reading PLEASE PEOPLE DON'T GET SCAMMED.",

Apart from that, copy trading has become fashionable and I would say that the trading houses themselves promote it because of the commissions they get.I would not invest even in a legitimate copy trading because traders who have profits regularly and long term are very few in percentage and even if a trader shows you results of a few years, even if you believe what he shows you is legit, you can not be sure how much is due to positive variance.",
