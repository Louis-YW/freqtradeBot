  "content": "Imagine you have to select a website for the best Bitcoin site today, is a tricky question and I know a lot of people would say BitcoinTalk is the number one, I mean, this forum is a legend. But we have some hard competitors like the blockchain web page, the fact that you can track transactions and addresses is awesome. After 9 years in this crazy crypto world, I have seen some crazy stuff, markets, on-chain casinos, coin mixers. Those guys use the cryptos in a crazy way, and for some people, these ones could be considered the best sites.But from my point of view, the Bitcoin website that most impressed me without doubts is Secret Scan. They have a calculator where you can get the value on each step of address encryption from Hex keys to uncompressed addresses, and some other tools. (https://secretscan.org/PrivateKeyHex), A tool like this is not secure with sensitive data, but is awesome for educational proposes and understanding the Bitcoin addresses step by step. For me as a developer is awesome to see tools like this.From your personal point of view, what would you say it's the #1 Bitcoin Site?",

Many pages that according to what they do determine that quality to give it a quantitative position.For example, mempool.space is a page that should be referenced but not in the comparison with (better than) our forum.Within our same niche (BTT) there is a range of sites that make life and that the subject of Bitcoin is directly and indirectly decisive...But anyway, if I stuck to your idea, I'd say it's bitcoin.org",

And also use it to know the profit. But I have forgotten the website and must of the things the instructors said in the seminar. And I also wanted to buy coins from one of the participants but he refused so I left the whole stuff and idea until a friend reintroduced me to this forum again before last year. As for me, I have not really seen a site that  I like except this forum. Even the one I said I knew from you is uncertain. Because I don't know the site again.",

I like how easy it is to pay with Crypto right now with the tools integrated. Should be more easy if they implement Lightning Network and then it's accepted everywhere around the globe. That will be so good. And yes, Twitter ofcourse which is now X.",

Just to see the pulse of the market and what they are talking about the crypto in general.This will give you a hint also what are some big news surrounding this market. And may suggest what you need to do with your portfolio.This will also provide you some background of what popular personalities or top companies are up to these days when it comes to crypto.",

Honestly, it's only here, bitcointalk forum that I lurk most of the time since then. I'm using several crypto-exchanges and services as well but not to the point that they are my favorite sites. Just use their service as I need.Depends though on anyone's preferences based on how they use the certain site.

From there, the information was relatively fast and I even found many studies and discussions in this forum that were raised from perspectives found on Twitter.",

While sometimes discussions aren't very productive, I often find the posts to be quite respectful and containing useful references, especially if we compare this platform with social media like Twitter or Facebook.I don't use blockchain explorer much, but I do recognize that it's a valuable place. And so are websites that help see the dynamics of transaction fees, not to mention those monitoring the price. I just think they should not all be held against one another in a competitive manner.",

Although Twitter also offers advice from experienced people, discussions on Bitcoin forums are more informative. So I finally want to say that the BitcoinTalk forum is always good.",
