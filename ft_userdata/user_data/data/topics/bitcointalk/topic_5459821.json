Yes the bitcoin price is quite high if you check mempool.space . I would advise that if you are not in a hurry you should try to make transactions like this in the night or probably during weekends. Quote from: Agbe on July 14, 2023, 05:19:49 PMOr is it that the units of bitcoin is high?The size of your transaction actually affects the fees if that’s what you mean. When you have multiple inputs the transaction fee is usually higher because basically each input is charged, since the bitcoin block size is between 1mb to 4mb ( increament was as a result of the SegWit soft fork). The best thing is to consolidate your inputs into one and then send it to the blockchain Quote from: usekevin on July 14, 2023, 06:23:24 PMThe fee raise is common one at the time of bull market.The value of same coin value may changed at the time of the pump.Pump in bitcoin is the one of the reason for changes in the price of most of the coin.The price of XRP was raised over 60% as compared to yesterday value.Many of the XRP holders may had huge profit from the XRP now.If they had holding of 750 XRP,the current profit will be 150$.The profit of 150 dollars for the 750 dollars will be the very high margin profit.OP isn’t talking about the increase in price of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather the transaction fees and which one is more efficient in terms of speed and value",

I made a transaction this morning, and as usual I always check the mempool before making such transactions. The fees for low, medium and high priority were as low as 6sat/vB. If you are looking to make cheap transactions, do them at a time when you know that the mempool will not be crowded, like late in the night or the early hours of the morning.",

Even LTC isn't that expensive if you compare it with something like BTC. So i think BTC is worst when it comes to fees these days even after Segwit I somehow feel we have already reached to that point where it is as good as what Original BTC was sometime ago.",

Agreed I mean Bitcoin is always go to choice maybe the OP can start using native segwit to send so will get a better fee as far as I know that native segwit can save transaction by 42% on fees. which very ideal an cheap.Tho there is ton other chain out there that also give a cent for transaction fee you might can use USDT in tron or ETh right know since both of them using proof of stake mechanism so offer cheap transaction fee",

You have to pay such on-chain transaction fees and after that, when you trade, you will have to pay trading fee on their platforms.You can choose times when the USA., European countries are in sleep times to have cheaper transaction fees.You can pick altcoins to have cheaper transaction fee than Bitcoin but don't pick Ethereum which always has very expensive on-chain transaction fee.If you decide to use altcoins, you have to accept risk that those altcoin networks are more easily attacked because they have lower network hashrates and their networks are more centralized.Use https://bitinfocharts.com/ to get comparisons of transaction fees among top altcoins.",

My understanding is that the gift cards sold on this site are not coming from authorized resellers which means there is a possibility of getting scammed. You could end up with a gift card that was bought with a stolen credit card and then your account might get suspended by the merchant when you try to use it. There are better options for buying gift cards like Bitrefill and Coincards which accept Lightning Network payments so you can pay with BTC with very minimal fees.",

Don't bother trying any tokens on the Ethereum network since the network fee itself is highly insane compared to other blockchain.",

It has cheap transaction fee and fast transaction confirmation compared to the leading L1 blockchain project. The only disadvantage of this block chain is its centralized but you won’t be thinking that much if you are just a regular user making a normal transaction.But if you want the most cheapest and fastest crypto then go for the side chains like Matic.
