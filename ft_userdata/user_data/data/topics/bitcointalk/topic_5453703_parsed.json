Well, only blockchain developers can answer this question, for many of us who are just investors and traders, there is no way to tell what the future holds in term of technicalities and security of both the blockchain and it's underlying technology, those who are running blockchain projects, building on the chain, or working in the security department of most big crypto projects, are the ones who can truly tell whether or not, the chain is secured enough to withstand any type of attack now or in the future.",

The most extreme outcome there is we have a crackdown on unregulated bitcoins and they have to trade them in a sort of Bitcoin black market.There should also be a increased demand for KYC requirements when trading.How to curtail this would be by an increased usage of decentralized exchanges boosting liquidity on those P2P platforms and reducing the control of CEXes.Another one is the scalability issue increasing and transferring bitcoins becoming slower and more expensive as mining rewards trickle down to zero. BIPs which improve scalability can potentially solve this issue along with off chain solutions.",

Developers could work on improving some proposal as more of them arises. But for the traders and investors alike we moving towards decentralized platforms could reduce the need of centralized ones which are the areas been hit by the government ones they are after bitcoin and decentralization. The government intolerance to the technology is the biggest threat currently been faced by the technology, and as more people hold bitcoin on centralized platforms it gives them more liquidity and popularity and therefor making decentralization looking more unrealistic. The other thing that could hinder bitcoin in the future is the treatment of Altcoins. The more Alticoins are been created and more people turn attention to them, scammers will continue to steal peoples funds through it and could only discourage potential investors as they would classify even bitcoin part of them, which will only hinder the mass adoption of bitcoin which will be key to any future saga. Bitcoin should also be treated strictly as an alternative currency.",

That's what I've understood from the speculations that I've read all about it. But then, it's gonna be a long way to go until an attack manages to successfully penetrate a blockchain that's been fully secured through POW and has got a lot of layers of security unlike those POS algo by other altcoins.",

I actually love a world of total reality; I don't leave in a world of assumptions; what I actually care about right now is today and nothing beyond 5 years. Of course, there is a lot of technological advancement, and we cannot deny the fact that hackers and attackers are actually looking for vulnerabilities to penetrate the blockchain. That's why we have active developers who are always upgrading the network. So I believe they will always see and detect attacks that are coming to the blockchain and possibly stop them before they cause any harm to it. I don't actually have more knowledge than the developers, but what I could say is that Bitcoin will be fine as long as the developers are constantly building and upgrading the network.",

As long as only a small percentage of the population use Bitcoin, that threat is real. The solution only I see is to create more real world use case beyond speculation. It will also help a lot if pro-bitcoin or at least more open minded candidates get to congress.

Whether the market is decentralized or centralized, the government will find ways to control and regulate it. They will not allow anything to exist and grow without their permission. That is their strength, and we cannot resist. I have no opinion about an unforeseen situation because it is the future, no one can predict what will happen. In my opinion, with a new market like cryptocurrencies, once we have accepted to participate, we should prepare for the worst case scenario.",

Well, recently there was some kind of foolish decision to try to create a Ledger wallet recovery phrase backup system in the cloud storage, but I think those plans have been denied and aborted. That gives me a light that probably in the next twenty years to come, there is going to be some kind of new unwise and harmful decision by some technology company who even greatly supports Bitcoin now, but in years to come, some of their decisions will be against Bitcoiners, so I suggest Bitcoiners should just be wise enough to know when some harmful decision will be coming from some platform they have trusted with their Bitcoin in the past, and when that happens, it is time to give them a red flag. Some centralized exchanges will increase their KYC to the extent that they might even be requesting for users zip codes, house addresses, room numbers, and house colors, but when all that starts happening, it's time to give those platforms a red flag. By the way, now is the time to even stop using centralized exchanges to buy and sell our bitcoin so that when all that starts to happen in the future, it won't be difficult to use some DEX.",
