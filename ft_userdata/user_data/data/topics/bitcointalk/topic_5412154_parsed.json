Planned tightening by the Federal Reserve in the form of interest rate hikes and a reduction in its balance sheet could have a negative impact on the price of bitcoin, according to Bannister.\"In 2022, we see bitcoin in a broad trading range bounded by year-to-date intra-day levels with greater downside risk in 2023 if the Fed continues to normalize policy in a 'standard' two-year tightening cycle,\" Bannister explained.s/markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-outlook-10000-2023-3-macro-headwinds-interest-rates-2022-2%3famp]https://www.[Suspicious link removed]s/markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-price-outlook-10000-2023-3-macro-headwinds-interest-rates-2022-2%3famp",

The real concern would be if other countries follow suit in a relatively short time, that's when you'll see a real panic. This figure of 10k is just being plucked out of the air, rather than having solid reasoning behind it. Will we see a drop? Probably. However, predicting that accurately isn't going to be an easy job. Although, I will say that I think it's coming at a good time, pretty much when we're already down, they're going to give us another kick, but also the interest in Bitcoin right now isn't that big due to people being a little more concerned about other things happening in the world, like the war, and the rising living costs. So, this news might not have as big of an impact that we would like to think it would. I'm not too bothered of Bitcoin dropping a bit more, and anyone that's in it for the medium or long term shouldn't be either. Just see it as a opportunity to gather a bit more Bitcoin.",

They have always been doing that but it doesn't change anything to people who believe in btc. Btc might go below 16k$ but me I don't see 10k below anytime in 2023 and even if it do happen btc bad days don't last forever. I see nothing to worry about in that article, lot's of people have predicted the fall to go below 12k$ this year but I have not even seen 14k$.",

It may fall below the $20k mark, but it will almost certainly not fall below $10k. Since the beginning of the year 2022, Bitcoin's price has fluctuated around the $20-$25k range, and now the year is coming to an end and Bitcoin has not risen; perhaps it will fall below $20k, but I am confident it will not fall below $10k.",

The last time when something like that happened was when the initial COVID-19 restrictions were announced and Bitcoin suffered a 50% crash in almost a day. This Fed announcement won't have such effect, as it is more predictable and not as dramatic for the economy. Also, when that covid-related crash happened, Bitcoin very quickly recovered and a year later it entered a huge bull run. So don't think that a crash is the end of the world.",

When bitcoin was 3000-4000$ during the early covid days, i heard voices saying that bitcoin will reach 1000$ etc but that never happened. Similarly, we are again seeing people thinking bitcoin to reach below 10K, which may never happen. If you want to invest in bitcoin, do not wait for your bids near 10K and left out. Better to buy some now and buy more in case it reaches those low values.By the way, i don't think fed news can make people sell all of their bitcoin, I really don't think it will happen.",

At least it provides another round of opportunities to those who wish to buy Bitcoin at a much lower entry point. However, while the Fed is trying to strengthen the USD, many of the world's currencies are falling in value quite fast. Therefore, Bitcoin is still a good currency or asset of refuge. In Argentina, for example, many would still choose Bitcoin over their fiat despite the bear market. With Bitcoin losing so much for the last months, it is still the less risky choice.",

The market situation is indeed not good because many FUDs are being spread to disrupt the stability of bitcoin. Before hitting the $10k price bitcoin must also break through the $17k barrier which is the closest wall to reach a lower drop. indeed there is nothing to worry about if we are ready, that is, ready to buy at the lowest price with the spare money we have and ready to go up and sell at the new ATH. a bear market is certain, but a bull market is also certain and will come soon if we can be patient and can manage the strategy well.",

Otherwise what the FED does is not affecting bitcoin.It's funny you should say that because it does have an effect. The recession is largely caused by monetary policy to combat inflation. What the Fed and other central banks are doing now is reducing the money available. With less money available, people have less money in general, and with less money in general, if they have to choose between spending less money to invest or buying bitcoin, and meeting their basic needs, they choose the latter. In more serious cases of needing money, people sell what they have of value, such as bitcoin, gold, shares or whatever, to cover their needs, as you said.So in reality the Fed's policy does affect the price of bitcoin because it is largely responsible for the recession.",
