  "content": "QuoteUsing mathematical computation based on standard measurements, Nigeria generates about 542.5 million tons of the above selected organic waste per annum. This in turn has the potential of yielding about 25.53 billion m³ of biogas (about 169 541.66 MWh) and 88.19 million tons of biofertilizer per annum.The quoted text above, na from one book Biogas potential of organic waste in Nigeria  by some students way dey the department of microbiology, Federal  University of Technology Owerri. This book come outside 2013 and the book dey talk about how biogas go tel help Nigerians in light, Agriculture, Environment and Economy matter. My own concern na be say since 2013 till now, no body don really support biogas production of light for Nigeria, one community for Abuja be dey use m dey generate light before they come shutdown 2021 because of lack of support, they start to dey use am 2016 and that time na chicken waste them be dey use but the bird flu way affect Abuja 2017 cor make most of the poultry farm from that community shutdown 2018, this thing cor affect them bcos na two medium poultry farm they be for dey get the chicken waste, they be still dey buy the waste from other poultry way dey other community but those people dey only sell small for them bcos Hausa farmers(from the North) cor dey buy m with big money from them, the Hausa farmers dey dry m carry go their side bcos them dey use as fertiliser but during rainy season they nor dey buy bcos of no sun to dry m and so they go cor sell m to them (biogas people) but the money to dey buy cor be issues for them bcos inside people way dey use the light, nor be all dey pay their monthly light bill of N500 and the money way them need to dey manage m na N30,000 but na Only N500 0 to N10,000 them dey fit gather every month end, but when they first start before the bird flu, people nor dey pay light bill and light dey constant bcos them dey get the waste for free from the two poultry. This thing na community work but as no support them shutdown.If person see where to dey get poultry farm or cattle waste and fit set up the machine to dey transform the waste to light, this thing go help the person to dey mine Bitcoin without the person thinking about light bills.If you nor understand watin that quoted text dey talk about, you go fit get the pdf from here:Biogas potential of organic waste in Nigeria  but just know say the 169 541.66 MWh big pass watin naija dey use and even come dey cheaper well.",
