You probably don't just need one new big user case, but rather more a large cascade of them.Disregarding the controversy of the payment proposal itself, bear in mind that, as of 2021, there were roughly 400K verified accounts on Twitter, which is the target of this recurrent payment. That is less that 1% of all Twitter accounts, and those willing to pay with BTC and or LN are bound to be a dip in the ocean in the big picture. Not to mention that is should be a recurrent payment, which should likely be automated in some way to be effective.",

      "body": "Elon Musk using btc as accepted payment? I think he would rather prefer Doge  Definitely I don't see it having any impact on bitcoin adoption. Only government policies can actually influence it. Moreover I think most people on twitter are already into bitcoin or cryptocurrency, so the high percentage of people that don't use bitcoin are outside social media. So any mass adoption of bitcoin will be an initiative that brings those outside social media along, which I think will be its legality been approved by government",

Mass adoption does not mean that little number of people will start using Bitcoin.There is only small amount of number of people using Twitter that does not use bitcoin, so Twitter incorporating bitcoin for payment will not mean mass adoption. mass adoption of Bitcoin will only happen when government of different countries come in and make it necessary and legitimate for their citizens to start using Bitcoin.Apart from that there is no how mass adoption of Bitcoin will happen.",

It will still be a long and hard process before we finally make it happen. But I’m happy if this one will eventually happen, because I know in the long run, Twitter will also influence  other big companies to trust bitcoin as a payment system.",

Now Assuming this happens, do you think we may see the technical mass adoption of bitcoin?I think it helps but adoption won't rely on that entirely.  All i can see is Bitcoin exposure and as far as I know user's have several non-crypto payment option so I think most users will just pay with whatever they had linked on twitter.  Government has a huge part in crypto mass adoption because the government has the authority to accept or reject Bitcoin in its jurisdiction.Quote from: uneng on November 02, 2022, 09:12:27 PMOn the other hand, to send tips inside the platform through bitcoin could be a more effective feature to boost bitcoin price, because it could be used by a different range of companies, groups and sectors to promote their products, brands and ideas, while paying employees inside the platform itself, without further bureaucracy and difficulties. Even for bounty campaigns it would be a good adoption.I think Bitcoin as tip option in twitter will be a great help to have users a firsthand experience with Bitcoin transaction.  It is a very helpful option for Bitcoin exposure, remember not because someone received a Bitcoin, he will automatically adopt it.  Others just accept and sell Bitcoin and forget.  Also we all know tips isn't a huge amount, so I think the effect of it to Bitcoin price is marginal.",

Of course we should start one step at a time and maybe this news about Twitter is a great start. Once it succeeds, bitcoin won’t stop there and just wait until other big companies start to notice the potentials of bitcoin. So in one way or another, Elon Musk will also be a great influence to make this finally happen.",

Although this is still a survey that may get positive or negative results from the audience, but if Elon Musk will push through about this, this will not just bring positive feedbacks for him but eventually, it will create large benefits to bitcoin owners and users.",

If he integrates bitcoin into twitter it will cause contradiction between his words. His use of bitcoin as a payment method for twitter just like other companies accept bitcoin, which would be positive news for the market but not enough to lead to mass bitcoin adoption.",

A lot of people were saying it's likely cheaper and more efficient to impersonate someone now by buying a blue check then it is to stay genuine.I had a thought verified users on other sites could circumvent this by linking to them - perhaps another site could take over twitter that does the same thing (it might have seemed like a big 4 giant in social media at some point - but I don't think it does now unless it gets a thorough reinvent: similar to tiktok but hopefully different enough to not be reels).",
