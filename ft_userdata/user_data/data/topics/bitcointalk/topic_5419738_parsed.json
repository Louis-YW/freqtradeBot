I am holding them and will continue to buy if the market continues to fall. In my lowcap portfolio, there are ROSE and FLOW, IMX. If you really appreciate ROSE, you should also check out the 2 projects I mentioned. I believe the commissions will explode in the coming bull season, this project seems to be little talked about and that is a good thing.",
