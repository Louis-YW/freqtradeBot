Ethereum has proven a lot of things already although the transition of it from pow to pos isn't likable by many.But as it changes through that algo, that has made a lot of interest for people to make more money from it by holding and staking it.",

      "body": "Tron never become a better thing compared with ethereum. How centralized the blockchain can be seen from how many validator that exist in the network. It depends on what people define the decentralization is. When you are seeing POW and it's been called as decentralized caused by people believe if nodes that running by miners were fully decentralized and not doing any collusion while the fact that if in the history of bitcoin and ethereum, miners were doing so many collusion. They were trying to take control over the blockchain caused by any improvement proposal must have passed the vote my miners which can be manipulated. I see now difference between both. Ethereum is far better than tron. Tron is more centralized.",

Because justin sun, the founder of tron, is someone who is completely unreliable and does not know what he will do tomorrow. He has done serious damage to the crypto money market with very bad news by trying to manipulate the market as he wishes, purely for his own interests.

      "body": "TRON and ETH can be argued that both are highly centralized blockchains, but there are some significant differences between them.TRON uses POS consensus algorithms while ETH uses POW consensus algorithms. In contrast with POW algorithms, POS algorithms allow you to stake your coins for some time and gain rewards for doing so. The problem is that those who have high amounts of coins will have an advantage over others when it comes to staking their coins because they will be rewarded much more than others. Which means they will accumulate more coins. This can increase centralization in the network.",

Also, just because some coins use PoW doesn't mean they will be decentralized.Back to mechanism consensus, there have been long discussions on [Megathread] The long-known PoW vs. PoS debate, and it does indicate that PoW is in favour within a decentralized system, compared to PoS. With that in mind, there is a degree of centralization on both coins. So, if you are researching to choose which coin is better for investment purposes, I don't think whether it is decentralized or centralized matter in these particular coins.",

Investing in Tron is no different than you are investing in stable coins, you can use it to transfer money because of cheap transaction fees but never invest in them.I think Tron is far from dead, Tron is fast and flexible, with low transaction fees... it's easy, simple, and cheap to use! I agree that investing in Tron can look like investing in stablecoins, the price of TRX is pretty stable at some low levels, and it seems it can't move from there for years. That can change in the future, I like and use Tron and I think there's some potential, for sure we can't expect some miracles (the all-time high was $0.23 5 years ago), but I like to believe that one day Tron will touch the $1 price.",
