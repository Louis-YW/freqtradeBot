  "content": "I'm developing (on GitHub in C#) a blockchain analysis tool for addresses. Here's some basic functions.- Multiple coins (starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon)- Analyzes NFTs - Detailed JSON-formatted files for advanced users- User-friendly GUI- Full C# using WinForms and GunaUI- Sleek and sexy This software is aimed at individuals trying to avoid scams, analyze someone's address (if giving a loan), or analyze their own address. This also lets you use features not all websites (like Etherscan or Blockchain) like NFT transactions, and a full analysis of a NFT or token stored on someone's account.Right now, I'm taking suggestions for features that you'd use, and I'll implement them for our first release (expected in a week or so)https://github.com/OnlyPunk <- Repo will be on my GitHub after all suggestions have been implemented!",
