So I don’t see it strange seeing older generations having the same feelings towards bitcoin, we only need to tell them why bitcoin is different.As for learned parents I think they are best suited for bitcoin because of their patience in saving and this is key to holding for very long term",

EAbsolutely right on which there are no age restriction for this, as long you are really that been aware on what are the things around you and able to know the basic concept or definition thenanyone could freely make out engagement and able to learn it out.Bitcoin doesnt really mind nor have those qualifications on whose gonna able to deal with.Its a digital currency on whicheveryone could freely access and do own as long you are already aware on what it is.This is why its always been good the early the better on where young minds should really be getting involved with or really be that aware on its existence.",

I know one of the early members of this forum who is around 70 of age and is invested in cryptocurrency and Bitcoin since 2015.  There are also lots of mid adult to seniors who are investing in Bitcoin because they are the one who have established their livelihood and more likely to have extra money to spend.  Not because most of the people in this forum are young adult, it means majority of Bitcoin investors and Bitcoin enthusiast are within their age range.  Remember those who have the capability to invest are those that have stable jobs and enough savings and it is hard to be seen in teens and young adults aging from 16- 21 yrs. old.Btw, the internet had been around for too long now and most seniors at the range stated by @OP already knows how to access it.",

If they're probably into crypto why are some of them advising their children to diseased from internet?Very few of them are and they are the ones who were ahead in time compared to their own generation, so naturally they are prone to adopt new things their fellows who belong to the same generation aren't. Of course, the regional factor also plays a big role, what means an elder from a country like UK, Germany or USA is much more likely to adopt bitcoin than an elder from third world countries, who have never had any contact with technology and modernity along their lives.For your second question, the answer will depend on who you are talking about. The old people who are part of bitcoin aren't advising their children to stay away from internet. So there is no inconsistency on this behavior from them.",

IMHO, nothing wrong with them putting themselves into bitcoin as there's no requirement for being aged or a young kid. But their resource like pensions should be spent wisely and they could still be reckless with spending their money which might result in the misallocation of their budget. I want them to understand bitcoin but if it's about their attitude towards investing, I think that there's gonna be a gap with that because you know that our young at heart folks might be intimidated by small volatility upon looking at their portfolio value.",

Older generations are also aware that the world is changing although it isn't that much felt but after experiencing the pandemic and the sudden change on the norm, it all felt clearly that the changes is leaning towards modernity.Regarding the crypto related aspect, I should say that it's relatively a challenge to teach older generations and convince them to adopt to it, but only if there is an easier way to explain things such as crypto to them, I'm pretty sure there's not much hassle trying to tell them.Even if we say that they are aware, not interested, or even hard to keep up with the knowledge, as pace of the changes right now, we could certainly say that it would only took a little bit of time for them to learn if you slowly tell them the basics and the important parts. Based on my experience, my Grandma, who's 74 years old right now is already aware of the cyber related stuffs like facebook and some offline gaming apps. She even has her own ATM card that we personally made for her, but didn't even bother to use it not unless when she's in the mall. I'm also aware that not everyone is like that, but based on that alone there's a huge possibility that it may not be now but soon more and more old timers would learn the modernity.",

If they are well educated, they are mostly familiar with the new things including Bitcoin because they can also hang out online using their smartphones, pc and laptop. They will also read it in the news on the TV and news papers however if they are extremely aging then that can affect their ability of learning and using a Bitcoin because they can't see properly or unable to move properly. Let's not make them bother about these new things but we shall let them rest. They needed it the most.Some parents are only over protected about their kids, that is the reason why they are afraid of something they are unfamiliar with but as long as we explain it to them carefully and show them proofs that it wasn't dangerous, we can convinced them to join us as long as they are still capable of doing it.",
