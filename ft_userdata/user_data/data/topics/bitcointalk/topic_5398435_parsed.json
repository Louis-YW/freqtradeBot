  "content": "Offline wallets are most secure, a good idea is to transfer just small amount from offline wallet to online wallet if you see online wallet necessary for making transaction often or get a hardware wallet which is cold wallet that you can use often for making transaction. If you need online wallet for making transaction, it is not good to use a mobile phone wallet, use a desktop wallet that you do not carry about like phones and that is safe from malware.See what is happening in London‘Crypto muggings’: thieves in London target digital investors by taking phonesQuoteThieves are targeting digital currency investors on the street in a wave of “crypto muggings”, police have warned, with victims reporting that thousands of pounds have been stolen after their mobile phones were seized.QuoteOne victim reported they had been trying to order an Uber near London’s Liverpool Street station when muggers forced them to hand over their phone. While the gang eventually gave the phone back, the victim later realised that £5,000-worth of ethereum digital currency was missing from their account with the crypto investing platform Coinbase.QuoteIn another case, a man was approached by a group of people offering to sell him cocaine and agreed to go down an alley with them to do the deal. The men offered to type a number into his phone but instead accessed his cryptocurrency account, holding him against a wall and forcing him to unlock a smartphone app with facial verification. They transferred £6,000-worth of ripple, another digital currency, out of his account.QuoteA third victim said he had been vomiting under a bridge when a mugger forced him to unlock his phone using a fingerprint, then changed his security settings and stole £28,700,QuoteIn another case, a victim told police that his cards and phone were pickpocketed after an evening at the pub, with £10,000 later stolen from their account with the investing platform Crypto.com. The victim was using his phone in the pub and believed thieves saw him type in his account pin, the report said.These mugglers will know that crypto transactions are not reversible and if crypto wallet is set up properly, it will be very difficult to trace the muggler after the attack. People should not be telling people of the bitcoin and altcoins they have because no one can be trusted, anyone can send someone to attack. This has just been the start, there are many other harmful ways there can be people that can be physically attacked to steal cryptocurrencies from them, some might lead to wound or beyond. Let us be careful.",

      "body": "While I do agree that there is a risk to have easy access to a wallet through a very easily visible app on one’s phone, and I also commented on the fact on my local board within a greater context, I do find that the reported cases by the media:-   Are not quantified, to get a sense of proportion or magnitude, in order to see how widespread it is.-   Are exemplified through only a handful of cases, which may be lucky lateral findings.The thugs do have enough crypto knowledge to make the crypto TXs though, and possibly acting in the financial district of London, do have crypto in mind as a by-product of their mugging expectations. The reported cases though do not really tell us exactly how they accessed the victim’s accounts; whether they were cohered to hand the passwords over, or whether they has some kind of auto login. I’d suspect the former. Some phones do have features to hide, or at least make app less easy to spot, and it could be a thing to consider. Nevertheless, I figure one also has to be rather conscious, and in addition, gain a habit of deleting the apps from the list of recent apps or background running apps.",

      "body": "Classic sensationalist headline, DdmrDdmr is spot on in my opinion. The thing is phones, especially online phones have never been a good idea, at least for storing a significant amount of Bitcoin. However, I can see their uses for small amounts. Android has a good permission system, the locking system on it is decent, depending on the options you choose i.e don't use a pin or fingerprint, use a password. The problem with phones is people are more inclined to download apps which they haven't verified or know they can trust, and also connect to networks which they don't trust. Otherwise, they are pretty decent apart from a few issues. The fact is, even if you do have a Bitcoin wallet on your phone, it should still be encrypted, and should lock after exiting the app even if it has been kept in memory or the open apps drawer, and you should be able to hide the icon. Android, at least custom ROMS usually have this option.",

What is most risky that I do not like about phone is that people are using fingerprint for everything they want to access, making the risks of this kind of coin theft to be high, but following security way of handling phones can help just like you said.",

If there is access to the phone, then they can manage to log in to the app (they are probably hoping that it's still logged in) and then probably withdraw in some way. They could also put to use the wallet apps. Imagine custodial wallets just requiring you to receive an OTP to your device, and you can then send the balance you have on that wallet to another one. It's going to be a hard thing to do, to manage everything in one device and then lose it. People should be vigilant with their smartphones.",

Custom ROM's usually utilize preexisting launchers that you can get without actually running custom ROMS. Although, I'd recommend a open source one if possible. I'm not too familar with Nova launcher that you've recommended, so can't comment either way. Whilst on that topic. Open source custom ROM also.
