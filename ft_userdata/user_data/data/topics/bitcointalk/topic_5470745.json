Thank you very much.https://t.me/RanShuo_GraphicI thought you were giving the price signals from China only. But after checking your channel, it seems you are also selling GPUs. Forum members are unlikely to buy any GPUs or anything from a newbie without using an escrow service. Moreover, you did not mention in your post that you are selling GPUs in your telegram channel. If I am not wrong, most GPUs are not profitable enough to mine coins now. So, why would people buy GPUs as mining gear unless they want to play with it? I guess those are used GPU, and those were used to mine coins. So, I don't think those cards will give the best gaming performance.",

      "body": "I so use aliexpress to buy some GPU's for mining and also some basic miners, but OP I am not so sure that I will buy such expensive things from you, because you are a newbie, I have my way to making contacts on aliexpress and it's very easy but I can't trust you because you have no past reviews from customers you sold some goods to. If your products are available on alibaba or aliexpress you should give is the name of your store I will look into it and see what's up but a newbie account telling us that he is a suppliers from china? You should know that both of these websites have escrow ways of releasing funds to seller after buyer get their goods in the same china, if not you can always get your refund from the website customer care but how is that going to work here? As a matter of fact you got nothing to lose, there isn't anything stopping you from taking cash and running away as you can always open a brand new account again.",

Can you drop link to that? If people are going to patronize you they will need assurance that they are not dealing with a scammer, asic miners are too costly to buy anyhow.",
