I hope I'm clear, sorry for bad english skills.You mean users can see it via a landing page or website, right? The term is called \"embed-ing NFT\".There is a piece of information referred on Announcing embeddable NFTs about how to do it. Depending on how the website is built and your comprehension of web development, you can adjust the displayed NFTs or just simply use the default option.",
