Mining without using any hardware, or without software? As hosseinimr93 said, mining Bitcoin without hardware is indeed impossible. Additionally, mining software is necessary to manage and monitor the mining process. So, both hardware and software are vital components for Bitcoin mining.",

Because old Bitmain units are not profitable unless you have free/cheap power.",

However, I think it will be difficult to get access to attractive prices. If I depended on such systems for mining, I would personally stop and buy coins directly, I think it would be more profitable.MiningRigRentals is really expensive, even more than Nicehash. And Nicehash has the disadvantage of an auction system that makes renters against each other. This makes the hashrate unstable and sometimes extremely expensive (especially when the mining difficulty drops a little, which is rather frustrating for renters).If ever, OP, I can rent you P2P hashrate. If you're interested, we can agree on a price per share or per hashrate for a specific period of time.",

Thank you for the answer to my question, God bless you It's up to you to decide how much risk you're willing to take. The difficulty is very high, so solo mining is currently difficult, but we could also assume that in a long term perspective the block reward will inevitably decrease, and the difficulty will increase, so right now could be a rather interesting period.It depends on the price of your electricity, your hashpower, your ability to pay electricity bills without getting anything in return.Every situation is different.You can calculate your chances of finding a block based on the block difficulty, your hashrate (rented from Nicehash or from ASICs if you have any), look at how long it would take you to solve a block, and know whether you're willing to pay the price (electric or Nicehash) of such a lottery ticket, it's up to you. In any case, it's totally random, so the probabilities calculated are only indicative. You could find a block in 10 minutes if you're the luckiest man in the world, or never find one at all.",

Thank you for the answer to my question, God bless you Do I think it is okay to gamble at slightly unfavorable odds?Yes if you don't have a gambling problem.No if you do have a gambling problem.You can spend as little as 0.001 btc to rent the gear to try to win a block.But you can spend way more which is an issue if you have a gambling problem.Only you know if you have issues with gambling.if the odds were true 0.001 btc means about 6250 to 1 shot at a blockwith fees and high rent demand the odds are not true which is why it is gambling not investing.I would estimate your odds are about 7200-7500 to 1 and you get paid 6250 to 1.So with \"normal \" luck you lose.",
