So, let me say in advance that I can't do this!Could you help me allow anonymous connections? I suppose that in this manner, I won't have to care about port forwarding.Thanks in advance!",

I suppose that in this manner, I won't have to care about port forwarding.Thanks in advance!In that case the most suitable option for you is to use tor and run your node on it because it doesn't require port forwarding to allow the connections. You can also run the node on a VPS server where you won't need to forward the ports. You will only need to allow the connections through the firewall of the VPS and that's accessible to you.",

I have added -listen=1 option. I haven't added the onlynet=onion option because I want to receive and send all kind of connections.However, it looks like I still don't get incoming transactions. BUT in bitnodes it looks like my onion address is discoverable.----EDIT----I am so happy! Thank you!
