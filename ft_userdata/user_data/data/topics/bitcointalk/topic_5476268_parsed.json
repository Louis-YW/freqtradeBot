I have never heard any of them so I'm not going to choose any from those. But if you're really requiring us to choose, I'll just have to pick what's on my mind and not on that list and if you think that we've got a better option, you can choose them as well. Here are some picks of mine if I'll buy it, it's either divided on these altcoins or can buy that whole $500 to only one of them.ETHBNBSOLLitecoinXMRSo, most of them are oldies already but I still believe that there will be the time that most of them are going to have some good runs for this upcoming bull run. It's gonna be unknown yet as of now but we're seeing that some of them have been pumping like crazy.",

My advice is to stay away from it, but if you want advice on altcoins that have the potential to rise in the next bullrun, I recommend ETH, SOLANA, and the third XRP. it is my favorite altcoin and is included in my portfolio but this is not investment advice.

I’m not familiar about the tokens you’ve listed here OP, but if you are looking for a small project with a small marketcap and have the full potential to rise then do more research about it, there’s a big risk here too so you have to be more ready for that.",

Choosing the right project will be hard but most of the time, a new project performs better than an old project in the bull run especially a project that is working in a narrative that hasn't seen any bull run. If you are lucky enough your project can give you 100X by the end of the season.",

After all, after CZ was banned from leaving America until a court decision was issued, we cannot rule out such a development. So it's worth refraining from buying BNB, especially since there are such a huge number of coins on the market that have lost value, but have a chance to restore their value.",

Bitcoin should be the priority for our investment. If we have big funds, we must buy Bitcoin as the main asset. Having $500 is quite good amount of money, it will be too risky if it is used to buy those unfamiliar coins. If I have $500, I will also do the same thing, I will use a half of the money for buying Bitcoin and a half for buying 1-2 top altcoins (ETH, ADA).Quote from: kevinzxz on December 02, 2023, 02:33:09 PMbuy BNB, because the price of BNB is still very cheap and has not increased in this year, so I still have the opportunity to get a lot of profit from investing in BNB at this time, because I am sure that when the bullrun occurs, then the price of BNB will definitely increase, so if I take advantage of the current situation to buy BNB at a cheap price, then I will make a profit easily in the near future.BNB was a recommended altcoin to buy. But since CZ has a case with US authority, the future of BNB seems a bit doubtful. How if BNB fails to skyrocket in the bullrun because the demand is decreasing a lot due to the case of CZ. I think you need to consider this, the potential of BNB is no longer the same as previously.",
