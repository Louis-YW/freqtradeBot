  "content": "Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts, I wanted to share a personal experience that I believe holds valuable lessons for all of us. Recently, I found myself drawn into the excitement surrounding a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and decided to explore the potential gains using leverage. Unfortunately, my journey ended with a loss of 2 BTC.This serves as a reminder for all of us in the crypto community: caution is paramount. Cryptocurrency investments are renowned for their volatility, and the allure of quick profits can sometimes lead to equally swift losses. It's essential to approach such opportunities with a discerning eye and an understanding of the risks involved.Here's what I've gleaned from my own experience:Thorough Research Matters: Dive deep into the specifics of your investments. Understand the market, the cryptocurrency involved, and any associated financial instruments. Knowledge is your best defense.Hype Can be Deceptive: Crypto markets are often influenced by hype. It's important not to let market sentiment alone dictate your decisions. Always balance excitement with a solid grasp of the fundamentals.Manage Your Risks: Leverage can magnify both gains and losses. Only invest what you can afford to lose, and be mindful of the potential consequences of using leverage.Stay Informed and Adaptive: Cryptocurrency markets evolve rapidly. Stay abreast of the latest news, trends, and developments, adjusting your strategy accordingly.Consider Seeking Advice: If uncertainties persist, seeking advice from financial professionals or those with experience in crypto investments could provide valuable insights.Experiencing losses in crypto investments is undoubtedly disheartening, but it's crucial to learn and grow from these setbacks.For me i have lost a lot, but i still hold some BTC for long term",

      "body": "I am sorry for your loss. It is a bold plan to say the least to use leverage during the etf approval 'hype'. The ETF would never have brought instant increases in price. If the ETF would ever influence price it would be in the mid to long-term. Using leverage in crypto markets is crazy in its own right. They are so volatile and driven my emotions and FOMO. Perhaps you experienced this when you decided to use leverage trading. A useful index when investing is the fear/greed index. Right now its set on greed and few days before ETF approval it was 'Extreme Greed' which is clearly unsustainable. The base price of Bitcoin is really what the miners need to cover their expenses. You can gauge what this value would be by looking at average global hash rate and mining difficulty. Anything on top of this base is supply and demand and/or FOMOWhen investing in crypto always remember to treat your investment as 'expendable' money. Markets are so volatile and the value of your investment can plummets overnight. Hopefully in your case if you can hold out for a few months the price should recover as we near the halving.",

      "body": "In the end, the ETF was just priced in and the shorters were proven right, but that's only after BTCUSD reached a scam whick of epic proportions liquidating most of the shorts in the process. It just goes to show that when a market has high speculation, there will be high price fluctuations also. Shorting or longing BTC based on logic makes little sense. All leveraged positions will be targeted to be forced into closing one way or another. And the high leverage offered on crypto exchanges, as well as the amount of traders with no idea of what they're doing, makes BTC just an easier target for whales to manipulate the markets as they wish.",

Individual mistakes are the most obvious, failure is not so strange as just stopping at that point without trying to overcome challenges. In any case, the journey of bitcoin development up to now has achieved admirable achievements, and the rule that wealth is not for the crowd manifests itself in every field, competition is truly fair, if you are good you will get worthy results. There are really many things that we need to learn and adapt to market changes. Speculating about the future only partially reduces the risk, or no matter how solid the plan is, it just hasn't been broken yet. Nowadays, each person will have their own approach, just don't give up and you will achieve success.",

Going into leveraged trading with crypto is a russian roulette.I don't know what the Buffett quote has to do with the last two sentences, but the former is a nugget of wisdom and the latter I absolutely agree with.  It's easy enough to get wiped out in the stock market if you're using too much leverage, and the swings in stocks are nowhere near as mind-blowing as those in crypto.Quote from: riverdip on January 19, 2024, 10:25:05 PMUnfortunately, my journey ended with a loss of 2 BTC.Dude, I would give my remaining nut (RIP, lost nut) for 2BTC.  It's hard for me to wrap my head around losses that big, as I've never had that much to play around with.  From the tone of your post, you seem to be taking it in stride and thus I have to assume you're a muthafukkin' baller.  Hope you learned a good lesson.",

Another thing that I like to add to the list of lessons is that it's just bitcoin, you can always buy it back little by little, that's the beauty of bitcoin, you can reinvest and get back even just a little as $1 unlike with stock market that is stable but you're going to need a lot of capital to even make a decent money out of it.
