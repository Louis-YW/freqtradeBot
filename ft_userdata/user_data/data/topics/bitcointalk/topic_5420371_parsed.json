      "body": "I will say that you don't need to wait 20 years, at least a good hedge in crypto is one full cycle, i.e. bears/bulls.And with that you can truly see how your investments goes for you, if you made good money already or you will have to wait for another 4 years. Of course it's better if you can hold for 20 years, but again, in crypto that is too long already. And this is still the best time, the price just hit a all time low and so crypto is very cheap and we can buy and accumulate tons and wait for the next bull run in 2024-2025 to profits.",
