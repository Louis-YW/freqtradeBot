The main reason people are being kidnaped unknowing is when they keep spreading news on what kinds of business they does and to what comes their ways, I can permit to tell a blood relatives but I am not permitted to disclose anything about income to an outsider because I wanna brag to them that earn such amount. We are living in a wicked world where even blood relatives doesn't want our progress and they would try everything possible to bring you down just for them to take over you including friends most of them does that but know one thing in mind that the number one enemy human has is the household enemy they envy every little bit of your progress, they compete and jealous you in every single thing you does.",

So much even you dey admire the lifestyle of some yahoo boys make you nor forget the risk wey still dey associated with their luxurious life. Especially now wey EFCC dey very active to find fraudster, life wey you wan enjoy go come dey hunt you down, if there is anything I have learnt, one of them is to contented with what I have and no try to impress anybody. E get one talk wey say, \"don't try to impress anybody, if only you know the rate at which the dead are forgotten\" the best life wey any crypto enthusiastic fit leave naim be to dey on a coded low-key life.",

But the fact still remain that some people will never change on there lifestyle because it has been a part of them. People get excited and talk out loud without knowing they are in private place, and that can bring enermy around them. I noticed this each time someone is making a financial call, people will be concentrated to know about what you are saying on phone. Sometimes after making call they will stay hailing you like \"odogwu! na man you be\" so  I have device a means of communicating my friends in public when it comes to financial discussions. When they call me in public and it's about financial Issues I tell the to end the call and later call them in more safe and secured place or I tell them to hit my DM on Facebook or Whatsapp to communicate via chatting. I think with this we can avoid speaking out loud in public places because we are always a victim of that.",

      "body": "The simple truth be say that guy wey dey brag of having such profit in his forex business is not saying the fact. Maybe the person still dey learn with all those account wey no be real money and him dey see the kind money wey him no fit withdraw self. I know say people wey get money no dey always brag but if you don dey brag like that, you have to look the person two times. I no suppose say person go dey put him private life outside because dat dey dangerous as people fit plan the person and rub am or harm am.As always everything about bitcoin dey decentralised and anonymous, na if you want make person sabi about wetin you get the person go sabi but if you no want anybody to know, dem no fit small ground to know about am.",
