  "content": "The Level at which the price of Bitcoin is resisted @$31k is, technically, generally the critical and very decisive one for the entire cryptocurrency market. Based on the current Market structure, this pattern shown in the picture below is an inverse Head & Shoulder formation drawn from the weekly timeframe.An H&S pattern from the technical analysis perspective typically is a reversal pattern and inverse H&S is a bullish signal if found at the bottom of an extended trend, Which structurally suggests a possible endpoint to a trend if occurred in the major time-frames such as monthly, Weekly, and daily. The reversal of such a pattern is usually back to somewhere close to the beginning of the trend, which should be around ATH 69k. From my analysis and the overall picture of the market, 1. Bitcoin needs to break above $31k to correct this impulse and to complete the H&S pattern. 2. if failed it may result in the Double top formation known as the M pattern whose target is $25k, $23k, and $20k.",

The market has sure felt like it’s been drifting lower lately and during a time when funds and microstrategy have been aggressively buying. I think that shows signs that the retail investor is starting to be effected by the economy’s slowdown.",

If you do make out some spot trade then it wont really be that an issue but if you are making out some futures position then it would really matter on which you would be mindful about on your entry and exits of course. This is why technical analysis wont really be that precise most of the time but this had been mostly the tool on which people would really be using because not all the time this market does have some news or fundamentals on which you could be able to check on.This is why decision making would really be crucial and risks taking would really be that relevant on these kind of times.",

I don't know if the scenario on the chart will come true, but if it does, it could be a better buying opportunity.With short-term investments, there are too many surprises and that stresses us out.

The \"M\" pattern which I'm talking about is about to form and not yet formed, and its formation will be base on if Bitcoin failed to break above $31k current resistance. Thank you for the screen. Now we are definitely on the same page without any doubt. As for the M pattern, I think it's way too early to mention it at all. Technical analysis is not about guessing the next pattern that would look the best in this place, but about finding completed patterns and playing targets that result from patterns.As for the H&S pattern, you can actually say that it is in the game, although it's not the most beautiful pattern I've ever seen.Quote from: Franctoshi on July 31, 2023, 10:05:08 AMThe reversal of such a pattern is usually back to somewhere close to the beginning of the trend, which should be around ATH 69k. \"The target of an inverse head and shoulders pattern is calculated by measuring the distance between the head and the neckline and then adding it to the neckline breakout point.\"https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/inverse-head-and-shoulders/\"A suitable profit target can be ascertained by measuring the distance between the bottom of the head and the pattern's neckline and using that same distance to project how far the price may move in the direction of the breakout.\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverseheadandshoulders.aspSo the target is around 34k not 69k and considering that we were already around 32k and that we are in a bear market during which traders often take profits earlier (below the target), it can be said that the target has already been met or at least there is not much fuel left from this pattern.",

This already happened when binance was sued by the SEC and I don't know for sure what other sentiments will occur in the next few months. An H&S pattern will usually show three positions and the middle position will be larger and slightly defensive with the other two positions. Hopefully it may not be up to $20k going forward nor is there a guaranteed return, just trying to stay calm and take advantage of the accumulated buy-in adjustments.",

Remember that this is a reversal pattern and this pattern is formed to take the price /market back to its starting point. This pattern is not a scenario that I'm expecting to complete anytime soon, rather it is a futuristic trend that will last for months on my watch list. Still, when there is a strong bullish or bearing momentum in the market, we do experience a situation where we would get an extended M/W and H&S formation, and the trend goes way above or below the target and this scenario may play out because many people will get more interested in Bitcoin when the price smashes pass $31k-$35k price level.",

The point we can take away from the process that occurred when Binance was sued by the SEC is that bitcoin has gotten stronger and even though the correction has occurred it has only been short term and people don't panic like they used to when an event that brought bitcoin a severe correction. I also share the view that when the first half happens bitcoin will be close to the 40k level and realistically it will happen even if it's not totally guaranteed. Speculation is only a matter of prediction and of course it can't always be right or right, that's the condition of market travel that we may often encounter.Anyone might not expect to go below 20k again, but who knows? So take advantage of all the possibilities that occur and what we have to do is how to collect as many bitcoins as possible for investment assets. However ATH will be in the middle of the road going forward and that is where we will collect profits from the investment process that we are undergoing.",

The $25-$20k support is strongest in that price area, we all hope that it will continue to be a support that remains strong so that recovery above the $30k price is faster.
