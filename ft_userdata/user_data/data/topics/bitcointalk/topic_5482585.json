A lot of other people also worked with Satoshi and now they all are working on the Bitcoin network in different sectors like research, design, development, identifying valuernabelities, etc and it is very hard to post all of them here. Some developers did not want to share their identities and remain hidden like Satoshi Nakamoto no one can know where he is, or whether he is alive or dead don't know and now the Bitcoin network is run by these developers whom we call \"Bitcoin Core Development Team\". So if someone wants to know about them just go through the link you will find them and also if you want to appreciate them send some satoshi to their addresses.",

Providing screenshot also takes time too I think since you need to screenshot more than once for all devs to be seen. I think it's better if you type each name like this \"reply to the thread and use the BBcode (/code) and open new window for the site that you provided and just scroll when you need to type the rest of the devs name.  For screenshot, uploading to talkimg for example and use the img BBcode and then paste the link of the image uploaded. If you ask me what I would do is I'll do what you did but up to 20 devs starting from number 1 to number 20 and then provide the link. I am sure you know that Satoshi started the Bitcoin being a dev with some help if I am correct and then later on, other devs started contributing for Bitcoin network.",

But I want to add couple of things which might clear out couple of confusions you may have after knowing that there is a development team for Bitcoin. Bitcoin developers cannot implement of force any change into the network. What they can do is to make the required changes in the algorithm and pass it to the Bitcoin network for reaching consensus. If 51% of the miners agree to the change, that is accepted in the network. Those who do not agree, they will fork out. So even if a list of developers is available, Bitcoin is still decentralized.",

Although crypto is not all like that, especially altcoin developers openly open their identities but that is entirely their own responsibility. However, bitcoin gets treatment and market trust that is timeless despite the fact that bitcoin has more great people behind the scenes that's for sure, but I look at the knowledge that flows in this forum.Although all are anonymous but the knowledge of bitcoin and its mechanisms is so genius and I admire it, is very useful for my daily needs, bitcoin for me is a real economy and a very effective source of accountants. Also indirectly bitcoin holders and traders for me are also effective developers even though from outside the team and make a lot of buyers, I agree that the development of bitcoin is due to the genius maker and the activities of bitcoin owners who work well all the time. Thank you bitcoin developers.",

In fact a lot of people wonder(myself included) if he's Satoshi!Thank you Hal.*Hals not even honorably mentioned it seems , but he invented PoW, PGP was likely Hal as well he and Phil got investigated by the FBI for it in 1991. Hal was working for Phil.Harold's just way to involved as a whole to not be mentioned and that bothers me.",

I'm curious with how many developers there are too, bitcoin is a decentralized project after all so that means that anyone can contribute to the development and I like that it's this way, it don't matter what your fame is, you're always welcome to do your part. I have a question, is there no confusion with a lot of developers working on the source code? Don't their works overlap or mess with other codes?",

Not everyone use GitHub. If you check non-github-bitcoin on GitHub[1], it's dummy account for contributor who don't have GitHub account.2. In wider context, anyone who write Bitcoin application could be considered as Bitcoin developer. Even to create list all Bitcoin application would be challenging.3. Some Bitcoin project intentionally avoid GitHub to host it's source code since for various reason.[1] https://github.com/non-github-bitcoin",
