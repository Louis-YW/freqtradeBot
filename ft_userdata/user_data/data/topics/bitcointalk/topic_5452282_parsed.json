You have just identified the major problem of most underdeveloped countries. Corrupt leaders are controlling the political system of these nations with their evil cronies. The only solution is to conduct free and fair elections where citizens can vote for perceived good leaders and vote out bad ones. If these politicians know that the people will vote them out if they fail to fulfill their campaign promises, they will sit up.QuoteI think it will make sense if the colonial masters or the developed countries in general come to the help of this country not by reaching on a selfish agreement with them for something in return but by putting every force on ground in achieving a good leadership for the country, Colonial masters also have problems in their homeland they want to solve. So every nation should be able to handle its problems. Most of these colonial masters benefit from the underdevelopment of their colonies so they will never want to assist them fix their economic problems. Developed nations use underdeveloped countries as markets for their finished goods and natural and human resources sources. Quotepolitical office has to be made less attractive to accommodate technocrats in the system to salvage the horrible situation of the citizens of the country at large to be propagated in line with good governance also by Brick tightening all the lope holes where public funds can be embezzled or syphoned by the office holder.My country's lawmakers are one of the highest paid in the world while we are among the poorest in the world. The people that will make laws to make laws to make these political offices unattractive are benefitting from the system. So they will never make such laws. The only solution is to elect sincere leaders that have the intention of serving selflessly.QuoteNote total scrutiny of individuals either by investigating them secretly to know more about them or even go as far as knowing much about their source of wealth as the case may be before allowing them to contest for the particular position they are interested in.A system that promotes vote-buying will always produce criminal politicians. We don't need to scrutinize the source of their wealth for voting purposes. Corrupt individuals should be arrested, tried, and sent to jail if they are guilty. That's why the judiciary should be independent.",

You may have resources in your country, but you may be unable to use them. They'll come and grab those vital parts of the resources, leaving you in shambles. The greatest way is to bring in more young countryÂ people with international experience to help investigate these resources and put them to good use for the country.",

Most Underdeveloped countries' governments are corrupted. Most of them are busy looting money from big projects. Of course, Financial organizations and other countries want to help them. But you have to show your output. China is one of the countries that wants to lend to underdevelopment countries. In return, you have to give them a commission. Let's say developed countries want to help, and they give them funds. What if their corrupted people loot most of the money? This thing is happening in Africa. You cannot imagine how corrupt the government is. It's happening in Asian countries as well. Other countries won't show interest if they have nothing to achieve from the target country. Moreover, Powerful countries like the USA and their army always killed innocent people in the name of good governance. Look at history; when they say they want to establish a good government in any country, they take over the country and kill many innocent people who have nothing to do with the government. Look at Israel and Palestine. What's happening there? Why the world is silent about this matter? Did you forget what happened with Afghanistan and Pakistan? I won't invite any country to another country to solve their issue. They won't do it without any benefits.",

Isn't it quite the phenomenon that Israel was able to take a wasteland and turn it into a country competing in the worlds economy over a period of a few generations following genocide post WW2? Turning into an non-developed country into a modernized country really is actually simple, as Israel was able to demonstrate. If you start with a culturally homogeneous group of people and allow for free and fair markets (government's only role is to preserve competition, nothing more, nothing less) then achieving developed status isn't too difficult.",

Most of the countries in Africa are underdeveloped today because of bad leadership, corruption in high places.Â The people at the top that are supposed to show thatÂ  crime has consequences are themselves the most corrupt. What about a case where the citizens have made up their minds to elect someone whom they know that has integrity, on election day, millions of people came out and voted. At the end of the day election is rigged and another known corrupt politician emerges winner. If you complain you areÂ  either arrested and put in jail or intimidated. The solution to underdeveloped countries problems should be to put qualified people who don't have corrupt records to lead. Most of the underdeveloped countries problems are man-made, therefore it will take the right man to bring about change. Although I don't see that happening anytime soon. Japanese people suffered huge economical suppression, two atomic bombs, a lost war and their country does not have as much productive land as many African nations.

But that does not mean I am wrong, if people from whatever country or culture managed to change their collective view of politics, then corruption would not be tolerated. In the end, as far as I understand, most of the African countries are democracies which means (in theory) that the people can regain the control of their destiny. Politicians work for us, they are public servants. People have forgotten that. Also, even though I am not from Africa. I live in a corrupted country as well.",

It would be great if developed countries could help out, but it's important to do it the right way. We don't want to just create a cycle of dependency.So, the best approach would be to help these countries establish better leadership and governance structures. We can do this by making political office less attractive and promoting the inclusion of experts and technocrats who can help bring about positive change. We also need to crack down on corruption and embezzlement of public funds. This means investigating people who are seeking office and making sure they're not shady characters.In addition, we need to invest in education, skills, and infrastructure in these countries. This will create opportunities for economic growth and help citizens escape poverty.It's important to remember that the people in these countries need to take responsibility for their own progress too. We can provide support and technical assistance, but they need to work towards building strong institutions and systems.All in all, we need to work together to create a world where every nation and its citizens have a chance to succeed.",
