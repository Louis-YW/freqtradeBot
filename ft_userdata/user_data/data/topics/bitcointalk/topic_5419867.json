You totally cloned AliExpress website and even all articles and sellers from that website are also available on your website.I don't see Bitcoin or crypto mentioned anywhere on website, on payment methods page it shows that you only accept card payments, and this looks very suspicious to me.Accepting Bitcoin claims are misleading, and this could be just one more phishing website.Archive:http://web.archive.org/web/20221107203247/https://www.alibitress.com/",

Just wondering how to resolve the dispute between the customer and the genuine seller. Or how to make sure that you order the product from the merchant I'm interested in from the AliExpress website, not from another merchant (bts)?",

      "body": "I have a few questions, and suggestions...What you want to do instead of using AliExpress design, is to make your own and allow users to lookup for goods from AliExpress (API?) because the current design shouts \"phishing attempt\" whether that's your intention or not.You said all the order responsibility is handled by you. Does that mean you will act as a package forwarder? Meaning the item goes from AliExpress -> your address -> to the client's address? Wouldn't that take a longer time?",
