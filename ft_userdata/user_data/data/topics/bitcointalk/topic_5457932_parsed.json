I do see others online just like you right now; you are showing online, but I believe this active online status seen by users is based on the other users settings. If we go to our account-related settings, there is a box after the email hidden settings that is actually for \"Show others your online status.\" If that's ticked yes, then others can easily notice when you are online, and if it's left blank, then you will remain offline on others views.",
