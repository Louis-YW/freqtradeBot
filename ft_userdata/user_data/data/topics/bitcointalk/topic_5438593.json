The code and the card are unique and can only be used once.

However, the winner of the card may keep it as a nice collectible itemAUCTION INTRODUCTION:As a way to directly support yahoo62278 during a difficult period of his life, I've decided to run an auction with a recent item that I've won in a forum contest hosted by 1miau and GazetaBitcoin.

The highest bidder will directly send his funds to yahoo62278 donation address[1] that's being used to support medical and other related costs that he (and his family) will occur during this difficult period of his life.DONATION ADDRESS:Quote from: yahoo62278 on February 18, 2023, 02:04:54 PM1LiwxmZC1v3d5J7XeMT4c8FKpuJwV3QjqH I may add the same address to my profile later but for now i'll just leave it blank.

Thank you for the donation and thank you so much for the offer regarding shipping fees outside EU! Just a clarification: Is it regarding customs outside EU or actually shipping fees? I also offered myself to pay for shipping fees that @GazetaBitcoin will incur, but he offered a counter deal that I couldn't agree and he ended up supporting them as well...

Of course, this is valid as long as you consider me trustworthy for acting as escrow. In any case, I can ensure you that this auction is really for a honorable cause and OP is a good man.Sorry for my late reply but meanwhile I saw that LoyceV and GazetaBitcoin both clarified the deal - I'm totally aware that I'm \"nobody\" regarding being trusthworthy to make any kind of deal in the forum considering my lack of feedback/trust, but if there's anyone in the forum that I have fully confidence without any questioning is, without a doubt, GazetaBitcoin. This is mostly due to his behavior and his actions throughout is presence on here and after several discussions that we've had in the past. But then again, this is my opinion which may differ from others (including the highest bidder). If needed, I may transfer an amount equal to the highest bid to an escrow until he/she receives the item in a worst case scenario.Quote from: tweetious on February 08, 2023, 07:55:40 PM@RickDeckard could you please confirm the auction end time? Is it \"26th February @ 21:00 PM (GMT)\" -as stated in the OP- OR21:00 PM EEST(aka GMT+2 / Romania time) -as shown in the countdown timer link-?Uhm that's odd. I've just opened the countdown and it currently shows London Time[1], could anyone else provide feedback? I'll search for other services more reliable in case this is more than an isolated issue. As for your question - The auction end time is 26th February @ 21:00 PM (GMT).Thank you for all the bids so far guys! Being my first, it's really rewarding to see such high activity in the first day  The sky is the limit![1]https://i.vgy.me/i2U7ah.png",
