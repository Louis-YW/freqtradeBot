You should understand that each and every government does hold a responsibility to provide for the people that they have been elected by. Most of the developed countries came into position because of these poor countries that they looted in the past thus for them to provide humanitarian support is no big deal. The crisis is coming and some are better prepared than the others but that does not mean that you can ignore the plight of the other side, decreasing the population inevitably is important but how we can do is by family planning, education, not natural selection.",

How important it is to maintain biodiversity and our fate being linked to the balance of global ecosystems. People have begun to believe they've evolved beyond having to think about or know basic fundamental things. That governments and politicians exist so they never have to think about or know anything. That they're better off not using the one thing that gives people an advantage over animals -- their minds.It is possible that human survival has become too easy and convenient. And that humanity has begun to negatively regress as a result. In movies and TV I see characters who are so obstinate and greedy that they cannot resolve their differences without murdering each other. This seems a foolish and childish precedent to me. But looking at the real world there appear to be many who embrace this. They can't resolve their disagreements without resorting to violence or murder like characters on TV. Is this what human progress looks like. Or is it a regression back towards the dark ages. While a food crisis may not be a pleasant experience. It may force us to rethink things. Most of us don't know human sacrifice and infanticide in ancient times may have been correlated with inadequate food production. People in ancient times may not have had enough food to feed their children and so they sacrificed them to assorted deities as a cultural norm. People in modern times have so many advantages over those who lived in past eras. And typically take advantage of and appreciate none of them.",

If you can afford the expensive food prices, then it makes no difference for you probably. For the rest of the people, it will be a nightmare. One thing is for sure, the world is way too crowded. If the expensive food prices will solve this problem, so be it. If it is going to be the vaccines, I am OK with that too. Whatever it takes to fix the world. Otherwise rich or poor, we are all going to go insane. We simply don't need any more people. There isn't enough resources.",

But one thing about food scarcity is that it opens way for improvised form of survival. My problem is not with the increase in population but rather the negligence of Agriculture. Increase in population is meant to equal increase in man power and productivity but it seems the reverse is the case. But once an outright food scarcity sets in there will be need to return to Agriculture which has been the original source of African sustenance before civilization set in",

In all, worse case scenario for the people in africa, many can easily turn to subsistence agriculture in a bid to feed themselves and immediate family, this easy adaptation may not be possible for you. Don't think your situation better because you feel you can accommodate it, if a severe food crisis results, every one will feel the effect.",

So when this kind of crisis starts people will start saving food inside their homes in some countries and this will make the food price increase even more and since they need to consume food more than anything we can see maybe some price of assets are decreasing against food because people will sell them to buy more food in that situation. so this can not be good in any situation.",

No, we're telling and we have been telling a lot of countries to not make the mistakes we have done in the past, but when we're stating facts we're seen as evil white supremacists that have some diabolical plan for Africa. Europe has been through centuries of famine, with millions of deaths and episodes of cannibalism, because we were doing the same mistake African countries are doing now, giving birth to 7 children without knowing how much food we're going to have the next year.And further down look at the math, Europe had during the middle ages 70 million people at the peak, Africa had nearly the same in 1800, the EU has grown to 500 million and had the newest technology when it comes to agriculture, Africa has 1.2 billion and has less than 15% of it mechanized.Who is going to feed all this unless they do it themselves?Where is the food going to come in countries like Niger which are on the path of doubling the population every 18 years?It's not like telling poor countries they should starve to death, it's telling them they are going to starve to death if they don't change!Quote from: ChiBitCTy on May 31, 2022, 08:13:48 PM The average person spends a lot of their income on food, so not sure where you’re getting that they don’t. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/this-map-shows-how-much-each-country-spends-on-food/QuoteThere are only eight countries in the world that spend less than 10% of their household income on food. Four of these are in Europe: the UK is third at 8.2%, followed by Switzerland at 8.7%; Ireland spends 9.6% and Austria 9.9%.The remaining four countries are spread across the globe.
