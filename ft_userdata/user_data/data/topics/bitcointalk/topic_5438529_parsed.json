But I'd still try give that key a label (through importdescriptors) so you can query the address for that label afterwards.",

      "body": "Be careful of importing private keys on an online PC before you import and do the guide above always make sure to disconnect your PC from the internet to avoid leaks. Or better generate your new address with your current wallet than expose your private key.What do you plan for this address? If you are going to deposit then it's not safe but if you plan to transfer funds from that address make sure to send it to a secured wallet/address.",

On a slower PC or one with a slower drive / other limited resources with it can take a REALLY long time. As in HOURS. Do not stop the process, it will just have be started again. There are ways to shorten it a bit but for the most part just do it and go to bed. When you wake up in the morning it will be done.If you are running a fast newer machine with a lot of RAM and an m.2 nvme it's a different story, but don't get frustiated while it's rescanning.-Dave",

Just make sure you don't make it realtime because then you could make the entire system unstable.Generally, this will not help when there Core is the only process running, and it is only expected to improve the performance to as if it was the only program running on the system.In Windows you can change the process priority with task manager, and it accomplishes the same thing.",
