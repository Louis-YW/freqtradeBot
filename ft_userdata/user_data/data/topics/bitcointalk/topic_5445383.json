  "content": "https://protos.com/bitcoin-core-developer-proposes-new-type-of-pruned-node/QuoteRather than the status quo — setting a number of blocks and compressing historical blocks prior to that milestone — O’Beirne’s assumeUTXO is an experimental way for new Bitcoin full nodes to delay their need to verify historical transactions until the user receives recent transactions.AssumeUTXO-compatible node clients would contain a hard-coded hash of the conditions necessary to spend all bitcoin (the UTXO set) as of a safe, recent point in time (O’Beirne’s variant of the popular Bitcoin Core client, Bitcoin Core #25740, supports assumeUTXO).I'm not going to post the full article here. BUT WHY, JUST WHY.There are a lot of things to be spending time and effort developing, this should be so far on the bottom of the list that we can't even see it.It is only going to make things worse for people as they try to run more and more on less capable hardware. It's a 3 step process.1) Install OS2) Install core3) Wait a couple of days for it to sync.ORUse a lite wallet. If you are running a node to secure the network, do it properly with enough hardware and time to do it. Sorry, this is just becoming an annoyance of mine. Used low hour 1TB drives are cheap / free from people getting rid of them new are just about free, 8 year old PCs that can run a full node with no issues are cheap / free.  <--Yes this is a US / EU thing I can't speak to the rest of the world but still. -Dave",

Honestly I can't see the issue, maybe you know something I don't.Apparently I know a lot that you don't.Spend some time in the support area here and in other online BTC discussions. People are continually coming around asking for help trying to run core on hardware that can't handle it. Or they are running some pruned node and wonder why they can't import some old private keys. And so on.Not saying that this should not be worked on, just that there are a lot of other things that cause people issues and this looks to be something that will cause more issues then it solves.Not saying there is never a reason to run a pruned node, just that there are very very few good ones.-Dave",

It's about making the software usable without having to wait multiple days for it to sync. It doesn't reduce the hardware requirements to run, in fact, using assumeutxo probably requires more resources than without it.Assumeutxo allows a node to start with a preset UTXO set (provided by the user, and does not necessarily correspond to a hardcoded hash in the binary, this detail has not been worked out yet). This UTXO set is the state of the chain at a particular block hash and height. The node can then begin syncing from that particular block. The idea is that the block will be recent, so the node will be caught up to tip very quickly, thus allowing the user to make and receive transactions way faster than if they had to wait for the entire blockchain to sync.The point is to make the software usable much faster. A major complaint that we've heard from users is that it takes ages to sync. Users often don't have the patience to wait and will start giving out addresses. Then they panic when they don't see incoming coins because they haven't synced yet and they come into this forum, or github, or reddit freaking out about losing money, all just because they haven't waited for the node to sync. Assumeutxo reduces that because it \"syncs\" faster.Obviously there's a trust requirement in this - users have to trust that the UTXO set that they are using is correct. Assumeutxo mitigates this by actually syncing the full blockchain in the background. While the user is using the state provided by the UTXO set and the chain state extended from it, a second chain state is built in the background from syncing and validating the blockchain. Once that background validation reaches the preset UTXO set's height, it checks that the two states are the same (same UTXOs, same blocks), and will kill the software and give the user an error if they are not.This is, in fact, not pruning, and unrelated to pruning. Of course, it should be possible to do it with pruning, but I don't know if that's been implemented yet. Furthermore, two chain states are being maintained in memory and on disk while the background validation is going. This means that the resource usage is actually higher, not lower.",

Is why do we want to have people use their nodes sooner. This is where the 3 step process I put in my post was about. Which was then supposed to comment on how people will start it with HW that can't handle it but it will work till it does not (extra memory and RAM) and will cause issues.What you can't read my mind about what I was thinking about posting. Tablet while remote accessing a PC to post here makes dave look dumb.Even now you can install and try to donload the blockchain on too small a drive, it has the pruned check box on by default but does not even mention what may happen if you un-check it.YES you can still do that now by installing on a 512 GB drive and running out of space, this just seems to encourage it. Once again IMO.If I go to an amusement park signs are posted that you must be this tall to get on some rides. Other software will not let you install on some systems that cannot support it. Core, says nah go ahead and put it on a 1st gen i3 with 2GB RAM and a 128 GB drive. This causes people grief, we have seen it here and on reddit and other places. Is it that hard to say NO don't do this?-Dave",

We need to design the software such that uneducated users still have a good experience, and part of that is making the software usable without having to wait a long time.

Once again IMO.How does assumeutxo encourage running on low spec hardware? The same system requirements checks are being run regardless.Regardless, making software that can run on low spec hardware is never a bad thing. Something that can run okay with little resources is something that can run fast on decent hardware. Optimizing is never bad.",

This isn't \"no mention of what may happen\".How about a warning that says that it will not work. That you cannot fit a 500+GB blockchain in 400GB free space and that more then likely things are going to go poorly.I run a lot of things on very marginal hardware, but I know what I am getting into.It's not your job as a developer to hold peoples hand and stop them from doing something they should not. BUT a bit more warning is also not a bad thing.And unless you do this properly it's going to be worse. Now the user can start using his wallet sooner, and then BAM no more drive space.That is the point I have been (poorly) trying to make.-Dave",
