      "body": "The question can just be that 'can Binance be hacked'? Exchanges can be hacked. But I do not know if it is going to be to the extent that Binance would fold up and stop providing crypto exchanges services. It is not good to leave your coins on exchanges, not only Binance but all exchanges. Save you coins on a good noncustodial wallet and never too much be bothered about if Binance can fold up. Crypto self custody is the best. If trading, leave just little amount on exchanges.",

FTX looks ugly like some users said but more effort can be put into the design in future, the latest on binance is the war on crypto criminals, I read this online yesterday.",

      "body": "We cannot really predict centralized exchanges because their actions were unintentional atimes since the have a legal backup that tie thir operations to the government, another thing is that they are hot wallet that have high tendencies to be hacked by an attack, the exchange itself can go off in bankruptcy, your assets with them is risky because they are the third party you ensure them to and it is believed that you understand what's at stake, anything can happen and may not, but if the worst do happens there's no remedy to it consequence, so why not just stay decentralized because the centralized exchanges have all your private details with them, then engage doing business with your asset with them thereby making more profits out of it to their pockets and sometimes hold your account on restriction, Binance has done that on several accounts, just be some miles away from centralized exchanges and be decentralized.",

      "body": "No one knows what will be the future of Binance but if your problem is holding your coins on the Binance exchange then that's not a good idea. Like the other said if you don't have full control of your wallet seed/private key you don't own the coin.Always use a non-custodial wallet to hold them or use hardware wallets like ledger to store them. Binance in the future can be one of the hacked exchanges but based on what happened before when they announced that they have been hacked only a small portion of their coins are stolen. It means they have their way to protect customers' funds which I think safe than the other exchange.",

Joke aside, no one can know what will happen with Binance till 2025, considering all the regulations, the fact that exchanges don't usually stay at the top for too long and hat no exchange or platform is too big to fall. Even though Binance may looks invincible at the moment (like many in the past)  keep in mind that they have  around for only ~5 years which is not a long time at all, and as we know by know things can go south pretty fast. So no, I wouldn't trust therm with my money (at least not for the longer period of time).",

So I hope many big authors and crypto mangers might help me or just even advise me. The problem with Bittrex is they are over confident about their past success then didn't do any much marketing campaigns nor promotions conducted that's why they had been surpassed by some exchange like Binance. If Binance will continue to create huge awareness just like what they are doing like introducing it globally and acquire some necessary licenses for legality also we can add those sponsored educational campaigns against crime on other country or even in crypto education we can say that they have huge potential to go more further at that year and became more successful.",

Other than the fact that Binance has already widely extended its reach to almost all aspects of the cryptocurrency market, CZ is not just meeting with secretaries recently. He's meeting presidents and country leaders. And although he has his fair share of removals and orders to cease operation from various jurisdictions, he is also adding new ones at the same time. But, again, centralized exchanges are secure until they fall. They're often just a single step ahead of hackers. And it's probably always a tight race.",

Internet network traffic is one of the targets of Hackers, they do not sleep day and night, their brains spin 100 degrees before they succeed in doing what they want, Binance operates over the internet, no one can guarantee that the Binance exchange and others will fail or thrive in the future, as was the case with The 10 Biggest Crypto Exchange Hacks In History, but all types of exchanges will certainly try their best and be comfortable to their customers, regardless of the risk that it can happen at any unexpected time.Not to mention that the Binance platform is not running smoothly in Florida, Texas and several other countries, which are in conflict with regulations, of course this can also be a big risk for their financial development, the country does not allow access for investors who are there, this is also the biggest challenge that could affect the development of Binance in the future, so just use and take advantage of the existing exchanges, as long as there are no problems, definitely choose an exchange that has a good reputation and is responsible in all respects.",
