Together we can weather this bearish marketThis is how other people labeled something that has anything to do with money, I think it is because of lack of knowledge with regards to cryptocurrencyOP is correct they are misinformed by other people especially those people who invest all their saving on a new or certain coin, where they don't have gain any profit, because the coin disappear or the people inside the company take the money and left, like what happen in luna where the founder take the money and leave, im not sure with FTX, but i hear some news about Axie where they take the money and transfer it to an exchange although some say its not true, where lots of people also invest in axie, and lost it all, so what are we saying here? don't just invest, research and learn, try to ask the people who have already lots of knowledge when it comes to crypto, learning all by yourself is okay, but learning with other people, there is a lot of information being share is better like here in this forum.",

Some shit coins can also be tagged ponzi schemes because some have were with the motives to run with investors funds right from onset.But if we limit the crypto currency term to bitcoin only then I can say people are just spreading stereotypes about it and most of it are done by those who are totally against it. So when any fall happens they easily attach it to bitcoin as ponzi schemes.",

Crypto is a risky investment but that's not a good reason to call it a scam during a bear market. The freedom of speech that still exists in most of the world allows everyone to express their opinion, and if someone else disagrees with that opinion, they can try to dispute it or mind their own business and pretend it didn't happen. I will even agree with those who are of the opinion that most of what is happening in the cryptocurrency world has to a good extent some elements of scams, because most of the projects have no meaning and purpose and as such are nothing but a beautifully packaged fraud.The bear market has always been and will be the most fruitful time for those who want to attack Bitcoin, and this should not surprise us - because many invested with the intention of profiting and were waiting for $100k, and then everything started to collapse. In the age of social networks, good news travels fast, and bad news even faster. Therefore, I advise you to be as little involved in them as possible, because that is one of the ways to get away from all that negativity that does not bring anything good.",

Therefore, I advise you to be as little involved in them as possible, because that is one of the ways to get away from all that negativity that does not bring anything good.This is a great explanation regarding attacks against Bitcoin. Whenever we're going through a bear market, news articles keep popping up claiming that Bitcoin is about to die and speculating on its possible failure. The exact same thing also occurs during bullish periods, but I believe that it's more prominent during bearish seasons. The reasons may vary, from being against cryptocurrencies or because they simply try to fish out clicks for their website, because it's certainly a controversial subject.Do I believe that incidents such as FTX or Mt. Gox ruin the cryptocurrency industry's reputation? They do, but this simply applies to pretty much everything. There are even banks going bankrupt; does that mean that all banks are scams and are bound to steal your money? I'm not promoting banks by any means, but I think you get my point. There's always a black sheep in the family.",

Very correct OP, many people are in a rush to darg Crypto-currency especially in this FTX saga, but that mostly for inexpensive Crypton-currency users. No one promised anyone no failures or things like this on Crypto-currency so lower your expectations guys and tighten up your security sensitivity.There are many users that hasnât experienced such exchanges issue or scams like give ways, ponzi and other trick because you guide yourself properly.",

I understand these people's disposition, In cryptocurrency there are still some projects that are scams so in a general sense those people may be right to have such opinions that are correct, but not completely. For Bitcoins, it is not a scam, so you have to point it out to them to be specific next time when making their generalization. There can be scam projects in cryptocurrency, but bitcoin itself is not a scam.",

When people talk about cryptocurrency being a scam, they are doing so because they are always looking for one weak point to criticize the entire concept. Because of what some people have told them, the majority of those people are looking for quick returns on their investments. If they don't succeed in doing so or something similar occurs, they continue to claim that the investment is a scam. The best course of action right now is to keep making investments in Bitcoin and avoid Altcoins until the market has fully recovered.",

Why? because we can buy them at cheap price, like what the price that we are seeing right now, it's 2017 price, at a discount and if there is something that we learn from bitcoin's history, is that it will go on a massive bull run after the halving in 2024.
