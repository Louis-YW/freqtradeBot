  "content": "My name is R , I used ot play stake.com thinking it provably fair but during the course of few months , came to know the website is damn rigged and only there to take your money.lets go the basics of the website , Stake.com was founded by Edward Craven whose father James Craven is notoriously famous 90s Australian stock market scam . Like father like son.The stake live casinos are merely Green screen gimmick where using the CGI , they loot money from their players. 4 Billion Dollars in profit wont come without a scam thats for sure.https://youtube.com/shorts/MoGSFjnKFdQ?feature=shareWhile the website endorses themselves as provably its nothing near provably fair , just they generating a hash using cookie and manipulating the bets and gameplay using sensors. The results are manipulated as the website uses illegal sensors which are banned in most of the countries to manipulate the bet. When i posted in thier community about exposing the tricks they use to make you loose they disbarred me 2 months on first instance warning regarding postage if links. Through my authorities i have put in a formal complaint regarding the owner of the website ED Craven , also contacted them via linkedin to give explnation. also contactd their partners and PR companies but nothing to avail.This scam has geographic demographics from Australia, UK , US and all over the world . Millions are dollars are flushed on this casino loosing scam and the companies is endorsing with celebrities like drake . f1 team alpha romeo . I request to come our each and every individual and lets stop this scam website.",

However, your video is already edited therefore this is modified and can not be seen as original. I'd be curious what Stake has to say though.But really digging it all back to his father is surely going to tell us that intention of yours. We could just be talking about that particular game.",

They've taken on board Drake as their brand ambassador and paid him a lot of money.So, I think that with that action and a combination of many users that will agree that they're trusting them, if going with the roots and whether it tallies or not. They've made their brand known and popular not just here in the forum but also in sporting events that they've been supporting athletes and those sports in itself.",

Moreover Eddies father is notrious stock market defrauder and like wise son is the same. they are australian citizen , why they cannot register in Australia, oh wait a minute coz they are running a Scam . stake.com CEO  Mladden ( Fucker) IS FROM serbia runs a company , Meebit which is a part of stake , which handles the support team . wait there is no gambling regulation authority there. All employee who are earning bread n butter through scamming people will comment here , they are legit . you LmB if they are legit . they are bloody pounding in peoples money and i have reported to bueraucatic authority who will take care of this soon.
