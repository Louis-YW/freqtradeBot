  "content": "Hi everyone.I've been a BTC holder & member of Bitcointalk since 2014, back when got my childhood best friend into it. He just passed awayw so, I'm trying to find an easy to use & non-custodial online wallet for his people, who don't know the first thing about crypto.Regardless what they want to do with theirs, I wanted to send them a little mix of my own coins ( BTC of course, ETH, XMR, and LTC ) .My first idea was, printing out Paper Wallets while creating a Blockfolio account which they could use to track the price of those crypto vs their amount, via an easy App. I found out that Blockfolio had been acquired by FTX, so I guess this is gone. And frankly, I haven't been up to date with the recent stuff. Mind you, their parents are from the Boomer generation, and even though his dad was in the tech industry and could understand (me and my friend were both building websites back at his place in 2000, aged 10) I really don't want to bug them with installing wallets & managing private keys and so on.Anyway, I figured I would ask ! Merry Christmas to everyone here !",

      "body": "Online/web wallets can be a pain in the ass. From errors they may have, to phishing and the possibility the wallet becomes malicious itself. I'd avoid them.There's another problem I see there: you have not only bitcoin, but a mix of coins. For Bitcoin it could have been easier: you generate a (paper?) wallet and you're already good; but 4 (paper?) wallets can become overly confusing.For BTC, ETH and LTC, one easy and safe way would be a hardware wallet. XMR I don't know which hardware wallet supports it correctly, I had some surprises with XMR and Ledger, but I don't know if it was my lack of knowledge or they've changed too something (luckily I've moved the coins away as advised by somebody, but at recheck after the last XMR fork, my Ledger has returned different address to me).So without XMR, Ledger + Leger Live is the easiest option. I don't know if you want to also invest in a hardware wallet, so I won't continue; if you want to invest maybe you find something more reputable than Ledger for the job.If the amounts are not big and you are tech savvy, maybe you configure a bootable USB stick with a Linux on it, with an Electrum, with Monero official wallet configured with a list of live servers, and maybe you find SPV / simple options for ETH and LTC too...It's not an advise to use it, however, all in one could be Trust wallet. Still not online/web, even more, not even open source, still, it supports multiple coins (I don't know which) and afaik it's self-custody. Keep in mind that it's owned by Binance.",

So, IMO it would be better if these assets were stored in 1 Non-custodial wallet on the smartphone.Quote from: NeuroticFish on December 20, 2022, 02:49:17 PMIt's not an advise to use it, however, all in one could be Trust wallet.

Keep in mind that it's owned by Binance.@NeuroticFish, @OmegaStarScream, I've done some research on TrustWallet, they support $BTC, $ETH and also $LTC, but not $XMR. So, if @OP wants to transfer his assets to TrustWallet, this can't be done. But for @OP, you can use Atomic Wallet, Atomic Wallet is a secure wallet which, if I'm not mistaken, was developed by the Komodo project, they support all the assets you mentioned above.

So, I'm trying to find an easy to use & non-custodial online wallet Bless you & your loved ones.Don't use any online Bitcoin wallets. Period.Over the years I save many people complaining about online wallets with accounts, and I see not good reason to use them when you have perfectly fine software open source software wallets.Electrum is most popular desktop wallet among Bitcoin community, but Sparrow wallet is seriously good alternative option.For mobile wallets you can check Unstoppable.money and most secure option is buying open source hardware wallets like Trezor, Bitbox, Passport, Keystone etc.Quote from: californiaquail on December 20, 2022, 02:22:03 PMdo no EVER try to ask anything to those pieces of shit on Reddit. They will ban you, block you and leave you on the side of the road. Especially those on r/BitcoinBeginners Some reddit communities are asking for higher activity and karma on your account before you can create topics, so it's nothing personal.I remember r/CryptoCurrency was doing this for years, and they are probably trying to fight spam this way, but it's stupid in my opinion.",

All open-source wallets are good to store bitcoin for a long period of time they are reliable for how many years since they have been found because you can verify them. It would be better if you will buy a hardware wallet for them because you want them to keep their bitcoin for a long time --there is always a vulnerable issue in having a wallet on your personal mobile phone so it is not good to recommend at all.",

I would personally focus on Bitcoin and probably the most used desktop wallet Electrum, with the fact that maybe after sending the transaction, I would recommend that instead of a hot wallet, they only have a watch-only wallet on their computer or smartphone.However it turns out in the end, it is important that they understand what you are giving away, what is the meaning of everything and what are the risks. Otherwise, it may happen that all your efforts will be in vain.",
