  "content": "Through a trustless, decentralized protocol, Elixir transforms market making, enabling everyone to participate in active market making on centralized and decentralized exchanges Elixir is a decentralized protocol offering computationally-secure, algorithmic market making across CEXs and DEXs: enabling full composability for integrations. Elixir algorithmically deploys liquidity on venues, allowing projects and exchanges to incentivize deep, transparently-deployed liquidity.REIMAGINING MARKET MAKINGMarket making is at the core of the crypto ecosystem, with liquidity across centralized exchanges  almost entirely driven by firms who run algorithms to tighten bid-ask spreads and ensure order-book depth.In legacy markets, market making is competitive and profits are derived from open market performance. Market making in crypto however consists of a handful of monopolized, centralized players, who charge exorbitant rates for minimal liquidity and basic scripts deploying liquidity on orderbooks. Today, cryptoassets have virtually no option but to work with one of the firms in order to gain anad keep centralized exchange listings.Elixir is building the first decentralized, algorithmic market maker for centralized exchange pairs. In doing so, the protocol aligns incentives for projects and brings full transparency to market making. Market making firm profits are democratized, allowing DApps to drive those returns to their communities. Through Elixir, token projects can now gain the same market making for their exchange pairs while saving 99%+ on their costs. In addition, profits traditionally captured by market making firms are paid out to the token's community. Community members can participate individually and earn returns in the form of token rewards.Elixir is a fully composable protocol, enabling it to also support DeFi implementations, actively provisioning targeted liquidity on central limit orderbooks and concentrated liquidity AMMs on-chain.Elixir unlocks retail active market making and liquidity for these exchanges, while providing retail DeFi users with a single venue to deploy active liquidity frictionlessly across DEXs and CEXs.With integrations already lined up with Perp Protocol, Injective, DYDX, and others, plus 50+ other Dapps lined up to use Elixir for market making, the protocol has found early product market fit in an industry desperate for disruption.OFFICIAL LINKSWebsite: https://elixir.financeTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirProtocolTelegram: https://t.me/elixirprotocolDiscord: https://discord.gg/GeKAZFjYT3Docs: https://docs.elixir.finance/",

      "body": "Interesting. I'm a part of a DAO and have faced a lot of the same problems dealing with the centralized market makers. What does the process look like to incentivize our community to supply liquidity via Elixir? If we want to incentivize active market making on our Uni v3 pairs, is that a different process?",

      "body": "Elixir is not a new project and has shown its relevance with several partnerships recently, including perpetual and Stella Swap, which makes me expect more partnerships from them. It would be helpful if they could show us more about their roadmap going forward. There are very few ideas in the space that get hyped up because we know it's just a money market with people who understand the market. In terms of multiple trading platforms, how many blockchains are we planning to have to help with CEX and DEX.",
