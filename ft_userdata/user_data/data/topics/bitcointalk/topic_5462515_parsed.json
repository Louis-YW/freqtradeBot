AI is only for analyzing, and bots are for automation or implementing your strategy, and what I've noticed is that your biases will be more clear if you use AI to analyze them. This is where the price goes, and if that is also confirmed by AI based on the historical data, then for sure there is a high chance that you'll win that trade. But again, we expect too much; data is always data, and markets are unpredictable, so AI would still make mistakes.",

If you do not know how to trade, you can use AI tools to learn how to trade. Example is chatGPT. For helping in trading, bots are still researched to be better than AI. But if you do know how to trade, you will not rely on any. Everything in trading including the calculations is done by me. I can even see some bots to help people DCA.

I agree with you, one can not be overly reliant on these tools, it's important to learn self-trading and complement it with these tools. Aimbot I've seen does so well in identifying rugs and honey-pots, and is available 24/7 etc. So bots like this is not just reserved for novices but the experienced traders can do with the benefits i highlighted, plus the fact that investors need do no work but share in profits for just holding the token.",

Another set of those using bots are those who want to earn from trading and don't want to learn. The emotional majority of a trader is well tasted when on a self trade, the volatility and pumps could make a trader jump in and in same minute jump out whilst the trade should have been in their favour but with Al, this is not the case.",
