  "content": "Starting to come out into the open how this war is a war between Russia and the US. There are several points in the article that should make it a good article to read.Every 3rd soldier in the Kharkiv offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is a citizen of a NATO countryQuote from: https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/world/every-3rd-soldier-in-the-kharkiv-offensive-of-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine-is-a-citizen-of-a-nato-countryThe offensive operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (and NATO) in the Kharkiv region was planned by the US military command. About 200 units of heavy military equipment and up to 9,000 soldiers were involved in last week's offensive.Reportedly, forensic examination of the dead bodies from the Offensive reveal that one in three soldiers operating under the Ukrainian chevron was a citizen of a NATO member state.These forces were 4-5 times superior to the units of the DPR, LPR and Russia that were defending their positions in the region.The main goal of the Ukrainian offensive was a flank attack, encirclement and subsequent destruction of the Russian grouping in the area of ??Balakleya, Kupyansk and Izyum.The Russian command predicted the offensive of large forces of Ukraine and NATO in this direction. It was aware that it would be extremely difficult to contain Ukraine's offensive with the forces that Russia had there. It was also virtually impossible to move sufficient reinforcements in time without weakening other areas on other front lines. Having assessed the risks, the Russian military decided to leave the weakly fortified positions and withdraw troops to new lines and straighten the lines of communication....From September 6 to September 11, Russian units retreated in an organized manner under the cover of specially organized units. Using mobile defense tactics, the Russian military destroyed the plan of Kyiv and NATO to encircle the Russian group....It is expected that, within days, the official assessment of the Russian Ministry of Defense will be publicly acknowledged that the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine has definitively escalated into a state of war between Russia and NATO, with unpredictable results for all parties to the conflict.This assessment is important because the Ukrainian/NATO side is the first, so far at an unofficial level, to engage in NATO's direct war against Russia, while Russia Â continues to operate with the term \"special military operation\", continuing to use limited forces and means....",

And why would the US waste resources and care to \"incite\" Russia?You got the chronology wrong. 2014 Crimea->2014 Donbas->2022 invasion. The US was not involved in the invasion of Crimea or Donbas.Russians are genocidal maniacs. Look at the atrocities they have committed in the occupied territories. Truly sick people.Never mind the deliberate destruction of the civilian infrastructure. They level cities, towns, and villages as they go.Nobody really cares about Russia, today, even India told Putin to end his 'war adventures' asap. He will become irrelevant as time goes on, even in Russia.Stand your simple self up next to a simple Russian man... say, a Russian farmer who works his land. The only differences lie in what he does for a living, and in his mindset regarding politics.He has friends he loves, just like you. He gets hurt at times, just like you. He doesn't like pain, just like you don't. He has justified his life in his own mind just like you have justified yours in your mind.Guess what? You are just like he is. Tweak your mind direction a tiny bit, and you would make a gooood Russian.",

From here arise all the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Ukraine and even in Venezuela and other countries too.",

A bunch of countries submitted to US-style world trade... and the wars around the world that the US does in the name of peace-keeping. But why should Russia?, and BRICS?, and a bunch of other countries?We personally are not in the trade deals the US has made with other countries, so it is difficult to tell who is right or wrong... who broke the deals first... and whose name is on the line in the deal paperwork, and whose isn't. It's like government usurpation of people's rights all around the world, by sticking us, the people, into the trade deals by assumed agreements, when we didn't agree, personally.However, it looks like many times the US broke the deal, or made a deal in the first place that was ambiguous enough that nobody knew for sure what it could mean.So, as much as it is Russia not backing down, so it's the US not backing down. Why not let bygones be bygones, and get the US out of other countries' business deals?",

The war between NATO and the countries of the eastern alliance Russia, China and several other countries.NATO cannot get involved in a military confrontation with these countries because of its vital function in ensuring the safety of their economies. He is fighting proxy wars during which he sacrifices his allies in an attempt to weaken the opposing party. Ukraine and Taiwan pay high taxes and it would be safe for them not to get involved in this war, but it seems that it is too late.As a reminder, Iran and Algeria also belong to the eastern alliance against NATO.",

In WW2, the Germans were bad. The individual soldiers were bad for following such a crazy leader. But they still were to be accorded rights as soldiers captured in war, according to international war conventions of that time.So, do a search on the 5 million+ German soldiers that our beloved US General - later President - Dwight Eisenhower did, against those same international war conventions, to the 5million+ captured German soldiers.It happens all over the place, even in the US, where there are some of the most basic, strongest, human-rights laws of any country.",

I see Taiwan doing same mistake as they are provoking China on wish of USA. Taiwan must foresee that China will teach them more horrible lesson then what Russia taught to Ukraine. This is lesson all countries should learn.",
