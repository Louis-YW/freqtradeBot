  "content": "Bitcoin is one of the most talked about topics of the 21st century and for good reason. A lot of people have heard of it, but what most don't know is that Bitcoin isn't just a digital currency. It is also a technology that is revolutionizing the way we think about money and transactions. Bitcoin is built on a decentralized, public ledger system called the blockchain, which allows for secure, transparent, and immutable transactions. This means that all Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, so no one can manipulate or alter the data. It also means that all Bitcoin transactions are instantaneous, with no third party or middleman involved. This makes it much faster and more efficient than traditional methods of payment. Bitcoin is also incredibly secure, as all Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified. This means that no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, and it is impossible to double spend it. So if you're looking for a secure, fast, and transparent way of making transactions, Bitcoin is definitely something you should be looking into.",

But with its application there are tons of thrid party joining the league and also, there are ways to hide the transaction on it using some mixer, though this has been done by others. But you are right its the most decentralized crypto out there and no one can object with that. Bitcoin is the number 1 for a reason and Im glad that you are familiar with it.",

This means that no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, and it is impossible to double spend it.You still did not understand some things completely correctly, because even though you may think that your transaction is instant and final when you click on the Send button, you will still have to wait for your transaction to be confirmed, that is, for it to receive at least 1 confirmation on the network. Furthermore, until the transaction receives at least 1 confirmation, it can be double spend in case it was sent from a wallet that has the RBF (replace by fee) option. This method is often used by scammers when they deceive naive customers who are not aware that such a thing is even possible.",

      "body": "There's still alot to learn dude..You've known the processes during trnxs in Bitcoin doesn't mean yunno it intricacies and how deep it's operated. Transaction are never instant, it has never happened that way before -- to prove the point best for your understanding -- simply transfer a little amount of BTC (if you' got any) into a separate wallet and check what happens... If the address is backed up to your email, then you'll begin to get series of mails on it DETECTION & CONFIRMATION first, before it gets credited into the former wallet. BTT was created for this purpose -- get stucked in here, look up the forum for some vital informations -- most especially on P2P etc.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

While transactions are not instantaneous as you pointed out earlier, you are right about them being faster than traditional methods.Bitcoin block confirmation takes approximately ten minutes, at which the funds would have been moved from User A to user B.But bank transactions require lots of verification before they are transferred from one bank to the other, all that happens overtly is a balance change on your account.Quote from: Gracejoy on January 10, 2023, 03:19:36 PMBitcoin is also incredibly secure, as all Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified.

If it were we would have had reached mass adoption already!QuoteThis means that all Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, so no one can manipulate or alter the data.The fact that it can't be altered isn't because bitcoin uses a public ledger, it is because of Proof of Work that costs so much money to attack that it becomes impossible to alter the ledger in practice.In comparison almost all other altcoins have public ledgers too but many of them are pretty easy to alter later on. For example ETH doesn't have an immutable blockchain since it is centralized and they can easily change the blockchain as they did once before when they lost money in DAO and reversed all the blocks.QuoteIt also means that all Bitcoin transactions are instantaneous, with no third party or middleman involved. This makes it much faster and more efficient than traditional methods of payment.Let's clarify something here, when we talk about speed of transferring money we refer to two things:1. The time it takes the money to reach its destination2. The time it takes for the transfer to become irreversible.When you say instantiations you are referring to #1 which is obviously reversible but since the time it takes for bitcoin transactions to become irreversible is the time it takes to confirm a tx and that is on average 10 minutes you are right that bitcoin is still the fastest payment method.",
