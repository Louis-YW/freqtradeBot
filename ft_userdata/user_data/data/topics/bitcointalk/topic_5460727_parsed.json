      "body": "You're only talk about your idea, but you still not really understand about proof of reserves. The concern about proof of reserves is the data isn't real time, so your idea will not work. We should also need to think about the collateral, since you're use blockchain, the collateral must be cryptocurrency or fiat since it's liquid. It's impossible if we talk about lending where you receive crypto and give your other crypto as a collateral.But not possible if you trade for goods or service.Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/proof-of-reserves-6830204Concerns About Proof of Reserves (PoR)Although proof of reserves offers assurance that a crypto company has the assets in place to cover its liabilities, it is only a single snapshot in time, not a live accounting of balances over time. It also only shows the on-chain assets of the custodian; it does not track where those assets come from (i.e., whether the assets were borrowed for the purposes of the audit). What assets can be considered reserves?Assets that are considered reserves are cryptocurrencies (or other types of assets) that offer strong liquidity. In other words, the company could sell off the assets to cover withdrawals or other liabilities, if needed. These may include cash or other fixed income assets. As for cryptocurrencies, this would include the more popular coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and stablecoins, like Tether, USDC, or BUSD.",

OP wants a marketplace where the seller will be paid immediately, but that can't work. The buyer must confirm that the product or service they purchased is legitimate. That's going to take time, especially for physical goods that need to be shipped across towns and countries. Smart-contract enabled confirmation that the goods are legitimate aren't a problem. That can be built in. The waiting time needed to receive, test, and confirm everything is in perfect working order won't be reduced with automated escrow.",

The marketplace operator would have to first allow the marketplace user seller privileges before they would be able to sell. There could be some rules set in place such as the user must have a certain amount of positive feedback before they would be able to sell. The disputes would be over seen by the marketplace operator through a feedback system and bad actors would have their marketplace account cancelled.I was one of the original international sellers on both Ebay and Amazon in the 1990s. This was before electronic internet payment systems such as Paypal even existed and buyers had to snail mail the sellers the payment for the item. I think using similar practices that Ebay had set in place when first launching their online marketplace could successfully be used again to launch community blockchain marketplaces.",

A robust feedback system would be used to filter out bad actors. Users of the marketplace are incentivized to keep excellent feedback reports for their account if they want to keep using the marketplace and deal with other highly rated users.",

Then your platform might already be filled with scammers then how will you deal it then. Because until other users will not test out other party with his/her money or digital goods. Till then they can not give reviews about them. And in my thoughts, When you are making a new platform you must try to put as much effort as you can in building trust.You have to look from all sides. As people are already very frustrated with the recent payment hack in which millions of dollars are already gone i think the name is Alphapo. Well, again best of luck",

Btw, during your profession as a seller, have you ever sent counterfeit products just to try to test the platform's security system?",
