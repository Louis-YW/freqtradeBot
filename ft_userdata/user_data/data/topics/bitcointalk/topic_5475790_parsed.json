This ended one of the longest unbeaten records in the history of world football as Brazil had never been defeated on such match on their home  land. This was made possible by a solidary goal from the head of Argentina striker Nicolas Otamendi. Brazil ended the game with ten men as one of their strikers, Joelinton was sent out on a red card for a push.In Rio De Janeiro Brazil, the kick-off was delayed for approximately thirty minutes as a result of the clashes between the police and the fans in the stadium during the national anthems.
