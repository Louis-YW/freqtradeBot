As I sabi reach, I feel say na only through P2P person fit take scam another person for bitcoin. That is if you de run di P2P transaction with a stranger or person wey no get integrity.Anoda  concern for scams inside bitcoin, na wen you de do di transaction for centralized exchanges. Scammers fit try you there because, as dem de talk for dis forum, if no be your wallet, no be your coin.I don get experience wey somebody call me say im na from my bank and dem de upgrade wan thing wey I no remember now, anyway di guy say e get SMS wey di bank send me and make I call di number for am, so im go do my own.

Na scam wey me and u no get any control over. Na scam wey government and non-governmental actors get hand inside. Unlike in bitcoin wey everything dey decentralized and na you go blame yourself if you got scammed because the whole process dey very open, straightforward and unambiguous. You fit literally explain how your transactions they move and where he move go. Wetin dey cause scam for Bitcoin na majorly our individual issue, maybe as per some of us no get knowledge on the process or if we allow people get access to our wallets through hacks and manipulation which is your own fault most of the time.",

Being careless is just like giving a scammer a very big opportunity to get access to the investment or asset you have, so if an investor can be very careful with his or her wallets or seed phrase as you already mentioned, it will help to secure their assets.If the OP can use any of those wallets you mentioned above, it will help him because those wallets are very secured.",

      "body": "The level of security in any space depends on the user's ability to securely protect their funds,  Bitcoin is decentralized that doesn't mean it can't be compromised if you as a user are careless with your Bitcoin storage,  having to store your Bitcoin in a third-party online wallet exposes you to the same risk as for who have their money in a bank. But then the truth remains that we can't do away with their services and for that reason,  we have to increase our level of security for both bitcoin wallets and bank accounts. Having an authentication device is the most secure way to protect your bank accounts from getting hacked,  once your account has an OTP device attached to it and all transactions are only authorized through the hardware device it becomes impossible for anyone including your account officer to get access to the account. Something goes with Bitcoin wallet just as you have already been advised you have to avoid online wallets and if you must use them then you have to be very active with your security,  if not with one mistake,  your Bitcoin will be wiped off.",

But even as Bitcoin dey decentralized, if you no play your cards right you go still fall mugu to scammers as dem still dey scam people wey no take the security of their money very serious. E no mata where you Bitcoin dey, if na for exchange or for personal wallet, scammers go still run you street if you no dey careless. You dey hear stories of people hardware wallets self getting compromised, everything can be hacked into if you don't protect yourself properly. Dey fit scam you in various ways and no be only when you dey do P2P transaction. You device can be compromised with malware that could steal some valuable information of your wallet or change your address so you no supposed dey store your Bitcoin for anyhow wallet.

The only time you're safe when using Bitcoin is when you take control of everything and only use those platforms that aren't centralized. Fiats are vulnerable to scams and hackers, Bitcoin is also vulnerable to those but provided you take the security of your money very seriously you'll be able to eliminate any threat to your finance.

In addition to what my boss has said, using platform that are decentralized  you might want to take note of this while using a non custodial wallet with the kind of storage that will be used by you. Try not store you wallet phrases online because it's be vulnerable to  attacks as phishing could me made to your mails exposing  your wallet phrase stored on it. Also,your phone could get hacked while using some links and performing other activities leaving it expose to get all kinds of information. Best choice is to adapt yourself with a cold storage which is way more secure.However, you should take perfect care if your storage device once lost there no recovery for your phrase ,make sure you remember that always or you could make multiple backups and ensuring to keep them safe",
