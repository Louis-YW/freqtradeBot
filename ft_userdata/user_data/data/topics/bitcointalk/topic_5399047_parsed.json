  "content": "When it comes to crypto signals, expensive Telegram groups that give buying and selling recommendations by \"experts\" and some similar applications come to mind, but the app I'm going to talk about now is completely different from these: https://coinpush.appCoin Push Crypto Signals follows crypto charts without the human factor and generates on-the-fly alerts by evaluating price movements according to certain algorithms. In fact, what day traders do is simply follow price charts throughout the day. But Coin Push is doing it 24/7 for 70 different coins. Imagine a monster that follows the charts for you without sleeping, without getting tired, without needing a rest!It’s a simple mobile app for mobile phones. After installing the application, we choose the coins we want to follow. Coin Push generates 8 different types of signals according to the price movements of the coins we follow:Graph squeeze signalsBreak-up signalsBreak-down signalsGoing up signalsGoing down signalsSudden volume signalsExtreme up signalsExtreme down signalsNow let's take a look at what these signals do.Perhaps the most promising signal type is “graph squeeze signals”, as narrowing bands, forming triangles and price squeezes on trading charts indicate that big moves are approaching.Graph Squeeze SignalsThey show that price movements are occurring within a distinctly tightening band. A triangle-like shape is forming on the chart and there will be a big price action in the near future.How we trade: We should decide according to the main trend. During the day, squeezes are often broken in the same direction as the main trend. We can consider opening a position in the same direction as the main trend or wait for the break-up or break-down signal for a safer trade.Break-up SignalsA break-up signal may pop some time after the graph squeeze signal. In this case, the previously detected jam is broken in the upward direction. Breaking squeezes usually results in a quick price action.How we trade: This signal indicates a direction: Up! When the break-up signal comes, we can open a buy or long position. If we have a previously opened position in the same direction, we can think that our profit will increase.Break-down SignalsA break-down signal may pop some time after the graph squeeze signal. It means that the pre-detected jam is breaking downwards.How we trade: This signal also indicates a direction: Down! When the break-down signal comes, we can open a sell or short position. Again, if we have a previously opened position in the same direction, we can think that our profit will increase.Going Up SignalsIf the price of a coin suddenly rises rapidly, a going up signal pops. Sometimes we can get this signal right after a break-up signal, sometimes unexpectedly.How we trade: An unexpected spike draws our attention to that coin. If we think it will continue to rise, we can open a position in the direction of buy/long. But this signal can also be used as a signal to close a previously opened position at a profitable point.Going Down SignalsIf the price suddenly drops rapidly, a going down signal pops. As you can imagine, this can happen right after a break-down signal or unexpectedly.How we trade: While rapid declines can be seen as an opportunity to open a buy/long position at a low price, it is often impossible to know how close we are to the bottom. Going down signals can be a sign to close it and realize our profit if we have a short position that has been opened before.Sudden Volume SignalsIf a coin's trading volume suddenly rises, a sudden volume signal pops. An unexpected spike in volume is a useful signal to make a trade decision as it can often be followed by rapid price action.Extreme Up/Down SignalsYou want to know when the price of a coin starts to rise wildly, right? That's what Coin Push's \"extreme\" signals provide. These signals pop when the price of a coin rises or falls by 10%+ daily. It is usually very risky to trade when the price has made such a big move. However, we can still use these signals to make a buy or sell decision within the framework of our own strategy.When deciding how to trade all signals, we should always keep in mind what the main trend of the market is. Most events that generate signals are followed by moves in the same direction as the main trend.You should definitely try Coin Push by installing from the;Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tr.com.katu.coinpushApple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/coin-push-crypto-signals/id1578453743More information & latest signals from app can be found at https://coinpush.app",
