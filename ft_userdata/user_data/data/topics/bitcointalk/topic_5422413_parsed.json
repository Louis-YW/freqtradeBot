But why did you trust anything that is centralized? Better not to trust because anything can happen as long as the money is not with you.Quote from: coin-investor on November 21, 2022, 08:31:53 AM  - As a gambler do you use gambling sites to store your coins like what traders are doing on exchanges?No, I use noncustodial wallet. I deposit only just the little amount that I want to use to bet.Quote from: coin-investor on November 21, 2022, 08:31:53 AM  - What would gamblers think if a casino does not agree to show proof of money from new and old casinosExchanges are the ones that are doing that, not gambling site, reputed gambling sites are many which have been existing since long time ago and not faced the threat, like on exchange.",

But if it's a trusted casino, the casino will not likely cheat its players and whenever a problem occurs, the casino will try to solve it properly.Quote from: coin-investor on November 21, 2022, 08:31:53 AM  - As a gambler do you use gambling sites to store your coins like what traders are doing on exchanges?Of course not. It is not recommended because it is our coins that we should keep in other wallets. After we win, it's better to immediately send it to another wallet and leave a small balance to play the next day again.Quote from: coin-investor on November 21, 2022, 08:31:53 AM  - What would gamblers think if a casino does not agree to show proof of money from new and old casinosI'm fine if the casino doesn't agree to show proof of the money in their main balance because it's the casino's privacy.

And by being interconnected to crypto it obviously means that if anything bad happens to the crypto market, this will reflect on the crypto gambling market. And the other way around is just as true. If you trust your casino then its the same as trusting your exchange. Not 100% secure but better than nothing.I think decentralized gambling and web 3.0 will be the future for us gamblers. I do not want to trust ANY third party with my money and I want a provably fair and transparent system.However, for now, at least proof of money would be a nice gesture for casinos to show their players a signal of honesty.",

Quote from: coin-investor on November 21, 2022, 08:31:53 AM - Will the industry lose the trust of gamblers if one or two casinos scammed their players by closing down and running with what     money they have that belongs to the gamblers?The industry itself won't lose it (otherwise a lot of industries would've lost a lot with how scammers work) but said casinos involved would naturally lose all reputation.

Since we haven't really had an issue with casinos I don't really see a reason why it should be forced though, especially if we consider how as I've said earlier, crashes have happened a lot of times across multiple coins that casinos use and they haven't really had any issues.",

Maybe not on a major scale, but still somewhat enough to cause something in the market. We've also seen a lot of casino \"hacks\" and exit scams throughout the years, but it only made the common crypto gambler smarter on choosing his casino. They never lost trust in the idea, they simply just became aware that such things are very possible to happen and that they just have to open their eyes and read a lot more to not be a victim of these scams. Once that's done, it's up to them if they are confident enough to leave their money in a platform that is a hot target of hackers any time of the day. As for proof of money, I think it's not really necessary, but if you are really wanting to create your name in the industry you have to honor your word and get winners paid, otherwise your platform will just collect dust but never loyal patrons.",

Plus gamblers should be different than traders; gamblers should really not keep unnecessarily money in the casino. There there's a bigger risk they gamble them away than the casino running away with those.",

I'm sure, reputable gambling sites can provide with the proof of money they are holding in reserves, if needed.

No, it will not. It's a very big industry, and if one or two big casinos scammed their players, it would make the news, and probably millions of gamblers would withdraw their money from online platforms immediately, but hundreds of millions would remain. Quote from: coin-investor on November 21, 2022, 08:31:53 AM- As a gambler do you use gambling sites to store your coins like what traders are doing on exchanges? These days, I do not, but often, in the past, I used to keep on a gambling platform much more than I could easily afford to lose. I've changed that approach only in March this year. I didn't lose any money, but, I admit, it was a reckless behaviour on my side.Quote from: coin-investor on November 21, 2022, 08:31:53 AM  - What would gamblers think if a casino does not agree to show proof of money from new and old casinos  If asked by the authorities and didn't comply, such a casino would lose its license, and will lose its clients quickly after that.",

Given the amount of resources that are being used daily by gamblers in online gambling websites, a crash thereof would result to a serious effect on the market.On the second question, the industry would definitely lose their players as soon as they are involved in a scam. Like what I previously mentioned, online gambling companies have to develop and establish a trust with its players. Once they break such trust, words will spread out and they will definitely lose their entire population with this issue. Again, it takes years to build a reputation and only a matter of minutes to destroy it.On the third question, no I do nor use any gambling websites to store my coins. Since there had been issues about storing your coins in an online wallet, they are prone to scams which can be potentially risky on my end; andOn the fourth question, I guess it does not matter as much before but it would definitely matter now. Given that there had been ongoing scams about proof of money to gambling websites, players would be more careful this time and they would choose a website that would lay all the cards possible to avoid the risk of them losing their money in the process.",

We don't see any casinos shutting down yet If there is we would have known but instead we still keep playing our coins despite the bear market. In order to prevent scam casinos and users from getting scammed, it may actually work if the gambling regulations will require casinos the proof of funds. More unlicensed casinos will come out though as the effect of the mandatory.The gambling industry is not yet regulated but to gain the trust of the gambling community, casinos acquire a license and that is the only proof that they can show the gambling community that they are legit, but if the license issuer will require to include proof of assets before they issue license, then casinos will have to provide this to get or renew their license, but the license issuer can opt not to show assets of the casinos that are applying to protect their business.You can oblige casinos on their own to show proof of money or assets.",
