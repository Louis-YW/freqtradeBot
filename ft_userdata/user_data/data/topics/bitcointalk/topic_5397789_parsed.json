Use your brain!!Two things:As I said it's a scam so don't deposit anything.In a place where no one knows you, how would you decided that you are going to get a single sat?You should be ashamed of saying you're a mathematics teacher. Come on!",

      "body": "Having to deposit that amount to be able to withdraw sounds like a scam to me. Also, that you are asking for a loan sounds even worse to me. On top of that you are supposed to be a math teacher? Sorry buddy, but there are just too many things that don't add up in your story.

If he had said  that he is a literature teacher or something, but of mathematics, come on, and on top of that he has no money or resources to get $350.Do you have all the credit cards maxed out math teacher?If I was sure I was going to get $7,000 just by depositing $350 I would get them in a short time if I had no money.If he had said he was unemployed or worked in a fast food restaurant, it might sound less like bullshit than the math teacher thing.",

I posted my occupation to add to my credibility. My mom just died leaving me with tons of expenses so once I can withdraw this money, my life is going to be so much better. If you didn't feel comfortable then you don't have to do anything. I will wait until my payday to make the required deposit so I can withdraw. Any way, I am super happy today.

Learn to be kind to others instead of being jerks. You don't know what someone is going through.In any case, I think you mean to say that I was the mean one. The others have merely told you that it is a scam, because it is a scam. If you don't want to see it is your problem.I doubt your story, but since I think there is a minuscule chance that what you are saying about being a math teacher and not having credit cards is true, I will explain a few things to you:1) According to the image you put, hurry up to collect the paycheck because the offer has an expiration of 48 hours.2) An Bitcoin giveaway makes no sense, even less in ethereum.org. If it were a newly created currency still, but not Bitcoin.3) Repeat after me: if someone gives you money for free, but wants you to pay him first to cash out he is a scammer, he is a scammer, he is a scammer.",
