Little to no advertising, preferably just one or 2 games available, very low bets, preferably some altcoins worth cents as people test it out...There's probably no upper limit to where you could take this. If you decide to spend a million, you will spend a million and get live dealers, a lot of promotion, streamers testing you out live, forum sig campaigns and all that.",

I do not know how much the cost of gambling site would be, but I definitely know that it would cost more than $50000 to $100000, even to obtain one of the cheapest gambling license, it would cost almost or more than $25000. The area you want to use to setup the casino also matters, it is online but you still need some areas that would be used for servers and where employees will be staying. The site you will use and some other things needed for the functioning of the gambling site will also cost. You have to market your casino too which will require huge amount.",

I don't really know much about project developments but $100k can't run it all.From most of the projects I do see over here they don't just come without proper planning also obtaining license  would possibly requires much money as well.",

That's my opinion.Keep in mind the competence is hard in this business, tho.",

Cause we have to promote and also do other such promotions.So what are your thoughts?100k can be okay but it is best to always budget for these sorts of projects at a figure but keep the figures flexible. The figure may be okay at the start when budgeted, but because of how quicky things can change and the prices of goods and services be affected, flexibility will give room to be able to adjust to any situation that affects the budgeted cost.

When the capital is low it is good to start with one or two games. Further based on the progress of the platform adding more games make it a success. Most of the successful gambling platforms have followed this strategy to start with few games, then increase the available games and providers. Finally comes up with the sports betting facility.",

How experience is he about the things of gambling, someone could start up a business with with 50,000 dollars and be successful and you that starts with $300000 only crash within a limited period of time. If you could pm some staff of the well-known and established casinos in this forum to help you out, you can pm maybe some ones that are not working with any company for now.

First you'll need a legislative paper work that'll suit the laws of the government you'll be running the online casino in their country and it depends on the country, some charge $3000 and some $20,000 etc Then you'll think of buying a games from developers and it's advisable to buy them in bulk as it's cheaper this way, this will cost about $200k. Consider keeping $300,000 aside if a player wins big. Think of Staffs monthly or weekly salaries for a year could cost $200,000. Building a Casino website cost about $3000. Marketing is another money eater; SEO, affiliate sites, campaign etc budget about $50,000 a month to get players as you need them to earn. Different payment processors will cost about $50,000 a month or more. However you'll have to keep about $1m - $2m to run effectively a casino website.

I think that 100k dollars initial capital would be enough to satrt a better casino. Cause we have to promote and also do other such promotions.So what are your thoughts?There is a whole spectrum of answers to your questions and a large part of it comes back to how fast you want to grow. You could basically split the costs a few ways, but there will be the initial setup costs and they are likely to be very high unless you use a pre-existing whitelabel solution or you are very confident in your programming/graphic skills to produce a secure gaming platform. Then there are other costs - like protecting your platform from blackmail because as soon as you start to get busy then people come along to DDOS you until you pay up or defeat it through other means. Then you have to split advertising costs into two buckets to get new signups - the basic advertising costs (which are continuous) and then promotions like welcome bonuses to get people over the depositing hurdle to start playing. On top of that you should have a solid support team and other staff doing various jobs too. $100k seems very low but if balanced well you might be able to pull it off with a slow buildup.",

Running a casino is quite complicated and very costly which is why you need to do it the right way because the market is very competitive, and having a budget limit will cause your casino lacks many good features, on marketing alone you need to put up thousand of dollars in a weekly or monthly basis check out this article on how to set up a casino to give yourself a general idea of the overall costHOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO START AN ONLINE CASINO OR GAMBLING BUSINESS",
