      "body": "Banks don't just accept any and all collateral; if what you present to them as collateral is below the amount you are requesting for borrowing, they won't even accept it. And if by any chance what you tender as collateral is depreciation in a valuable asset, let's say a landed property, and those areas are no longer being developed or something crisis-related happens, they will probably contact you for other collateral or ask you to pay back the debt if you can't, they will have no choice but to sell off the property as it will be part of the lending agreement between you and them. So if you need any loan from Bank you have to bring a very solid collateral, the higher the worth of your collateral the higher your chances of getting the loan approved. It's just business as usual for them.",

How is that even a security?In the vast majority of cases you wouldn't even need any collateral if you had full-time employment. Using land/house as collateral for a small loan of $2,300 is a massive overkill. The legal costs of drafting such agreement would make it too expensive.If you need that money for something constructive, that can yield you an income later on - just speak to family and friends. That's usually the best and cheapest option (and, in your case, probably the only available one).",

Banks CAN loan you money above their security measures.  It's just all about whether they want to or not, or if they don't think that someone or a business would be a good investment for them.  Let's not forget bank loans aren't just them being nice, it's all about an investment on their behalf.  So physical properties, education, bank rules and stipulations etc etc all factor in to the equation.",

Your certificate is very valuable because, without it, you can't get employed by any company. You definitely would need to tender your certificate (for hiring) before the company to which you are applying for a job would hire you. So the bank has nothing to do with your certificate; they cannot use it to get employed in any company because the certificate contains your details and only you can use it. So don't blame it on your certificate; it has value.",

So that's mean education do not have the real value but properties does. indeed, when you want to borrow money at a bank, generally all banks have conditions like that, there must be a guarantee commensurate with the money to be borrowed, the reason is because the bank is afraid that the borrower will run away and not pay. so collateral is the key to the padlock from the bank for customers who borrow money. those without collateral are unlikely to be able to borrow money.that's what I know from the experience I've been through, and I don't want to borrow money from the bank anymore, the reasons start from the interest which is quite high and the strange thing is that I used to become addicted to borrowing money from the bank.but what is certain is enough for me to borrow money at the bank.and the problem is you want to pawn your school certificate at the bank, the bank will definitely not accept it. because the bank cannot sell your school certificate when (for example) you are in arrears or you are unable to pay.",

In your case, the bank may have determined that your school certificate does not provide sufficient collateral to support your loan request of $2,300. This does not mean that education is of no value, but in the context of lending, banks prefer collateral with clearer and more measurable values, such as property.However, that doesn't mean the bank will trick you before giving a loan. As a customer, you must understand that banks must consider many factors before providing a loan, including credit risk and your ability to repay the loan.

Instead of blaming the education or banking industries, look at yourself and what got you into that predicament.

Check out the lending section of the forum. It's the same thing. Someone who is low rank won't get a loan if they don't give collateral. High rankers who participate in signature campaigns are usually given a loan because they have a repayment capacity and because if they don't repay the loan they would be red tagged and would lose their ability to participate in signature campaigns.",
