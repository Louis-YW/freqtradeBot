      "body": "my stickers are loosely framed (they are not peeled/stuck but have a small pieced of double sided tape on the back of each to hold them in place) I dont have them sorted or named in any fashion though - some are by some well known Bitcoin artists and others are just generic stickers handed out from conferences or that I received with various shipments. In with some of the stickers are also Pins (most from btcpins) and doodles done by Bitcoin Penny. At the end there are comic strips I kept from a 2021 Dilbert calendar where all the comics were about \"Bitcoin\"Some of them are even from companies I detest (Binance for example) - I have them simply to collect/preserve The final image is my biggest \"sticker\" its 2 foot by 2 foot and is more like a sign but it is quite sticky on the back so I am going to call it my largest sticker.I apologize for the pics quality/angles/lighting these are all up on my office walls",
