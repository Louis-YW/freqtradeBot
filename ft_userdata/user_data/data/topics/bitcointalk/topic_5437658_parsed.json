  "content": "After a few days of joining this forum, i finally got my first crypto transaction in the form of Litecoin from an app in Playstore. At first, i wanted to try to get Bitcoin from Bestchange and Freebitco.in faucets, but so far i have only collected 200 satoshi, not enough to make a withdrawal. Right now i'm looking to find out more about apps, platforms or anything that can generate crypto for me. Can you give any good suggestion about an app, platform that can generate crypto?Please don't suggest paid apps or platforms, i don't have money for that.",

I'm still a newbie who wants to explore everything here. But, do you know that all of this will be very useful later to build a better mindset for me? everyone starts from the bottom.
