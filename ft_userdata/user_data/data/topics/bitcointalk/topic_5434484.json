It is true that some members of the forum will reward you for your efforts and every good post you write, but in order to start writing good and quality posts, you must first learn something.My advice for the future is to mention merits as little as possible, because some may interpret it as asking for the same. Be who you are, read and study and I believe you will be rewarded",

In time youll earn your first merit but with lots of research first. Maybe avoid talking about it for the meantime and talk other topic related to bitcoin or crypto. Some newbies are focusing on that thats why some got an idea that you are after merits, so I suggest you leave this for a while and research on other things. Good luck on your journey.",

For now, I would encourage you first to just learn and gain. Focus first on accumulating knowledge and skills through crypto related articles, watching crypto videos and simply read and understand the bitcointalk forum. That way, you will have a lot of ideas regarding cryptocurrencies and you can eventually use it when you start posting in the forum. Just don’t bother thinking about getting merits this time, they will eventually come once other members find your post useful for everyone.",

So the best way to make quality posts is to CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON SEARCHING AND ADD YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE YOU GET INTO WRITING IN THIS FORUM. and believe Merit will come to you by itself. when the quality of our post becomes decent.",

You can actually post as long as its all about crypto, but make sure you are familiar with that and you know actually what you are talking about. Although gaining merits should never be our first motivation because its obviously gaining and learning knowledge in the first place, but at the end of the day, you will realize that you are doing your best in posting because you want to influence others and you want to have merits from them. And all of these will be possible if you are already a good and quality poster, regardless if you are new in the forum or not.",

This is affected by the person who merits you; I mean to say how they feel and react to the message you’ve passed on to them, how it affects and solve their inquisitiveness on a the subject matter or something related to that.

So take your time learning and be the most quality poster in time.Researching and reading have always yielded consistent results in terms of post quality. This also serves as a guide for many who want to say one or two things in the forum. Your level of participation in the forum, I believe, will give you a better understanding of what to say and what not to say about a specific topic, particularly when discussing bitcoins or cryptocurrencies. If you can easily address the issue that has been raised at that time, gaining a merit from the person to whom you have addressed his issue will be much easier.",

And the fact that you are still a newbie, so you need to gain lots of ideas and insights first so you’ll be a quality poster in time.

You also have to learn what bitcoin is and by extension cryptocurrency.
