There ease of use/security tradeoffs make using a HW wallet ideal. You can use most HW wallets with most major wallet software, although I don't think many (any?) are compatible with bitcoin core. Although you did not specify, I got the feeling after reading your post that you were considering using a \"hot\" wallet using bitcoin core as your first choice.",

      "body": "The answer depends on what you are trying to achieve. If you use bitcoin core and run your own node, you would have more privacy. With using bitcoin core, you can also help the network with validating transactions and blocks and keeping a copy of the blockchain.The downside is that you need to download a very big size of data. If you don't care about your privacy that much and you don't have any problem with connecting to servers owned by third parties, you don't need bitcoin core.You can use a hardware wallet. It's much easier than using bitcoin core. Quote from: ejd59005 on September 25, 2022, 10:13:43 PMI'm going to look into Electrum (I have to be honest, I haven't heard of it before) Electrum is surely one of the best bitcoin wallets.

As you may have noticed with my two posts in your thread, you have to consider various tradeoffs when considering how to transact, and what via which means your private keys are stored.

I'd rather keep my BTC off any exchanges for hodling. It would be a good idea to get a hardware wallet, open source, if possible. We have a complete board about hardware wallets where you can find more information:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=261.0Get one in case the amount of Bitcoin is high enough to justify the purchase, it would not make sense to buy a HW of 70$ to store 10$ in BTC, if you have over 200$ then I'd say you should go for it, otherwise stick to Bitcoin Core.Also, Hardware wallets have other advantages: they can be used to sign-verify in a more secure way, they can serve as Universal two Factor authentication to protect your accounts and even exchange accounts from unauthorized access and you can even encrypt messages and files with them. It would be good if you get one before the next bull run, when they are more likely to increase their price again. Good luck.",

May not be 100% secure, but hardware wallets are considered the most perfect solution today.No matter which wallet you use, your safety still depends on you. Your assets will still be hacked or lost if you cannot take good care of your seed phrases.

Why bother comparing apples and oranges?You can use both wallet types perfectly fine, but if you don't keep your computer turned on all the time with full node and blockchain, than you obviously won't use Bitcoin Core.Hardware wallets are easy way of keeping your seed words offline and using your funds easily in the same time, but some of them are closed source and not as good as people may think.I would never recommend anyone using ledger, safepal or any similar closed source hardware wallets that just gives false sense of security.List of Open Source Hardware Wallets:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0",

Electrum only downloads the block headers compared to bitcoin core downloading and verifying every block since the genius block. This makes it slightly less difficult to subject you to a sybil attack in order to make you believe you have received a transaction that you haven't. In practice, the risk of a sybil attack using both bitcoin core and electrum is near zero. In the past, malicious servers have been able to use mass social engineering to trick electrum users into downloading a malicious version of electrum that would be malware.
