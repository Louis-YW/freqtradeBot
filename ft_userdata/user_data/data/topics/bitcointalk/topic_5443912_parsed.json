  "content": "I recently watch video of Adin Ross about using his friends money to gamble. His friends allow him to gamble it and it’s just insane to see how this kind of things work during shit case scenario. On the video, Adin won’t allow them to cash-out unless they will agree for the all-in bonus buy on slot or they can cashout but with just a break even amount of their bank roll. They start from a 1000 grand balance and they manage to turn it to 7000$. Actually they are trying to cashout the moment they made 2000$ but Adin keeps giving them that same option to push them to play more. I know that Adin is just toying with them but their reaction is just hilarious because they are serious due to the money amount involved.I’m still not experiencing it but sounds fun at the same time to share experience of winning and losing with your friend. Do you guys do it?Watch the video here: https://youtu.be/tKqO2UaYDhA",

Do you guys do it?No, I have never bet with a friend's money, I know very well the risks when he says do a slot bet using my money and I know very well the feeling of a friend losing all the money in the bet, I watch youtube.be if it's true that Adin is playing with his friend, but his friend believes what Adin said, in my opinion it's just luck that they did in the slot bet.How from the first Adin was unlucky in his direction to his friend, of course the story is different isn't it.For that, to be honest, I don't want to do what Adin did, I'm happy if I win, losing is of course another story, I prefer my friends to risk on their own accord than me to be blamed.",

However I never bet with a friend together or even betting with his money rather I have called a friend to borrow me money to try my last chance, borrowing doesn't mean it a huge money but very little which later send back to him after I got home because I couldn't get access to my mobile app to make a transfer.",

Do you guys do it?I dont really liked to get blamed on and this is why i dont really like on handling other peoples money when it comes on dealing up with something not only on gambling but also in other things as well.As long it do get involves with money then expect that people would really be that impulsive and wouldnt really be recognizing whether you are a close friend or not because they would really be suing you up in regarding on what happened into their funds.This is why its better to make use of your own and do save up the hassle on minding about other people in case you do lost a particular bet.Your money your rules and if its lost then you are the only ones who would moved on and you wont really be that responsible on giving out some reasoning into those people on where you do makeuse of their funds.",

Do you guys do it?Never!!!Honestly, I don't know if this can be beneficial for moneylenders.I say this because the coolest thing about a casino is being able to take risks without depending on anyone, make your own bets, take the risks yourself without owing anything to anyone and have fun on your own and not give that option of fun to someone else.I understand that in this case the person who lent the money was only interested in profit, but it is a typical scenario in which the person will not gain anything if they lose everything, not even the pleasure of having placed their own bets, it is as if it were simply flush money down the toilet.",

I know some of my friends gamble but i'll never gamble their money when it could easily ruin their day and maybe more as they might have other plans with the money they've spent.Adin had a lucky run with his friend's money and if I did that to my friend's money it'd probably last only a few minutes at best since my luck isn't that good with casino games.",

When the losing starts, blaming begins. And when all the money is lost, things would get even more awkward and you might even hear cricket sounds while you're together going home. No more laughter between you. No more sharing of fun stories. Everybody wants to say something but keeps it to themselves instead because they know it would rather make everything worse. But the worse thing is that everybody is openly blaming everyone else, pointing fingers, yelling, and gets into a quarrel. Everybody goes home on their own. So yes, risk and gamble only your own money if you value your friendship.",

I like how he switches from Slots to Black Jack all the time, seems like a funny guy. If his friends are also streamers then there is nothing wrong with using their money. In the end it's all for content and trying to make them more popular, that is why they are also trying to get the highest possible returns. Nobody wants to see someone only makes very small bets and goes home with a 10% profit. The big flashy bets are what attracts the viewers. If this was just some friends playing together without an audience then the behaviour wouldn't be cool at all. Going from 1k USD to 2k USD is already a huge profit with slots and they should have cashed out at least partially their winnings already. Then going up to 7k USD was very lucky is not going to happen in most cases. If he had lost all the money of his friends they would be pretty mad.",
