If you're asking about mixer for Ethereum, you should ask in altcoins section.2. Bitcoin mixers do exist, work properly and have customers.3. I advise you think very hard whether you start or not such a service. If you had to ask this question, I think that the safer answer is \"no\", since it's not only about running a software, it's also about keeping the setup secure and maybe also hide your tracks to avoid what has happened with tornado.cash",

There has been a whole debate about the potential risks. Generally, the people who wear the signature will tell you that it is safe to use the mixer, although you should take precautions. Someone else argued that using mixers puts you in the crosshairs of the authorities.",

But still, establishing and starting it won't be an easy thing to do and I agree with NF that you should think of it very well before you do.",

More than 90% 4 gopa from it. https://twitter.com/ElBarto_Crypto/status/1558428428763815942This is probably similar with bitcoin.Look how much bitcoins as mixer every monthhttps://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/25/how-popular-are-crypto-mixers-heres-what-the-data-tells-us/",
