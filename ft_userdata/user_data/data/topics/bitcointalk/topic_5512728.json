I did not make up anything mentioned below and have no intention on spreading any false information. This post is only for documenting purposes and community thoughts... That's it I stumbled across a guy named Mike Hydes claiming to be one of the main architects for Bitcoin, Monero, the lightning network, yada yada.https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mikehydes <-- That's his LinkedIn profile. It was made in 2009 according to LinkedInHe makes a very bold statement that he worked alongside Satoshi Nakamoto and know Satoshi personally. He claims that Satoshi Nakamoto isn't a he but two women... One being Vitalik Buterin's aunt Natasha and the other being Anastasia, the sister to Elena Sinelnikova...Looking through what he's claimed about them, he claims that they were part of the Cicada 3301 group and that they were assigned the task to create a decentralized currency being Bitcoin.However, he claims to be recovering from retrograde amnesia in his profile.I was only able to find his Medium account but I'm sure he has other socials or something out there.Medium: https://medium.com/@mikehydesOne very strange thing about this Mike Hydes character, is that he mentions his brother Leslie Hydes Jr but when you search him up, his obituary pops up and that he died in 2020... But his LinkedIn profile was made in like 2021 or something. That's the most strangest thing I've found about.It all sounds very absurd, I know.However, don't go accusing me of spreading misinformation!! I swear, I make this warning every time but nobody seems to listen!I am only documenting what I found through these posts I make. I do not claim to know these information from myself but that I found someone else claiming this knowledge.By sharing this finding, I am only handing this case over to those who are willing to continue this rabbithole, whether it results in anything or not. I am also open to community comments! Thanks in advance!",

      "body": "Just 7 hours ago, this Mike Hydes character mentionsQuote from: Mike Hydes on LinkedIn... all blockchain entries are negotiable instruments and as such they are under the jurisdiction of both state and federal authorities in the USA.At the Federal level the primary authority would be the U.S. Secret Service and for those tokens that give purchasers a claim on current and future assets or liabilities, they would fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, no rocket science there.Same for those NFTs that have some relationship to real world objects.It's not necessarily related to him knowing Satoshi but I wanted to know if what he's saying is even true. I remember laws on crypto being passed and everything but I never really dug into what those laws really go over in between the lines.Can someone clarify this info? Thank you!He has a post from 4 weeks ago stating the following:Quote from: Mike Hydes on LinkedInMany of the leading figures in Crypto have a background in the USAF.I find this to be curious and I have a vague recollection of the USAF being mentioned in addition to the NSA by a team of individuals initially claimed to be from the U.S. Department of State but latter claimed to be from the Central Intelligence Agency, and said they were assigned to protect my brother Leslie Hydes Jr.They said the NSA/CSS were responsible for the suppression of the identities behind the 'Satoshi Nakamoto\" pseudonym. That term is a portmanteau of the individual pseudonyms of the two original Bitcoin developers. Satoshi is Natasha, the maternal aunt of Vitalik Buterin, founder of etehreum.org, and Nakamoto is Anastasia, the sister of Elena Sinelnikova, the founder of cryptochicks.ca.. Everyone knew and acknowledged this from 2013 - 2017.I know that USAF officers dominate the leadership of the NSA and its Central Security Service. These recollections came back to me seeing the image on this article, it's a very interesting fact of the Crypto industry.The team who claimed to be from the USD/CIA told me to get in touch with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the issue but I forgot to to that until recently. They said it was questionable as to whether the other agencies were acting constitutionally/legally.There's nothing in the article about all of this but the image was what jogged my memory. The article is about Bitcoin's price movements...This Mike Hydes seems to know just enough about the government structure and stuff to be mentioning these claims. Is there anyone on this forum who knows what he's talking about?He also mentioned a month ago:Quote from: Mike Hydes on LinkedInThank you to all my old LinkedIn connections for reconnecting!Most of you were also friends on Facebook and remember my disclosure about Bitcoin, indeed I pitched many of you on it.Now I see that many of you are actually working in the Crypto space, and I can't tell you how that makes me feel.Its been a while since i last heard from my old colleagues Natasha (\"Satoshi\") and Anastasia (\"Nakamoto'). I last saw Anastasia in Birmingham England in 2017.I last saw Natasha in 2020 in the Caymans, she was working with my brother and some British agents embedded among the local authorities there to address some injustice that happened to my brother and I over the years.If I remember correctly they are supposed to touch base with me at a certain time here in the United Kingdom. I certainly hope so as I need their support.This is actually I very trying time for me and I'm very thankful to be alive all things considering.Once again thank you all for reconnecting!Btw, I'm in the market for a job. Please have a look at my updated profile and message me if you think I can be of value to your business.Thank you and have a great day!He once again claims to work on Bitcoin and have pitched the idea of Bitcoin to these people in his 'connection'.I understand that he may be spouting nonsense but something about him doesn't seem right... Something about this Mike Hydes character is very off but I can't seem to put my finger on it. Maybe he really is crazy or there's more to it than that...?",

Even if this guy is telling the truth, that won't change anything about bitcoin or how we have known Satoshi. For me, sorry to say, but everything that are out in the internet these days about Satoshi I believe they're just made up lies just to ride with the hype. No one can still beat the original Satoshi, regardless of whatever his gender, he will always gain the spotlight for bitcoin. No need to find actually who really he is.",

If you check you will notice that pretty much every so-called news about Satoshi often ends up as trash.Take a look at the HBO drama recently, wasn't surprised to see them trying to convince someone to stage Satoshi.

But for sure we will debunked it, as we already know that Satoshi indeed has disappeared and won't surface anytime of the day to protect himself and his creation. And I thought that the documentary has no effect at all, but thanks to it, the market is now on the rally and so with it, comes another round of Who is Satoshi round again. But as just what we have seen, positive or negative news, we will still consider it to be good for Bitcoin and the whole crypto. So most likely there someone who will come forward with another potential name of the creator.",
