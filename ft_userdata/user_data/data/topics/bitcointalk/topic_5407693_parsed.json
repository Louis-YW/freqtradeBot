  "content": "Looks like Trump hasn't been sitting around doing nothing for this time since the last election was stolen from him. Rather, we are going to be a bit surprised by what he has been doing. The Dem-controlled media is going to be revealed for what they are, simply by doing what they do... hiding the truth and presenting lies. That's why a lot of this stuff is news, because the media isn't reporting it. They would rather paint Trump as a nothing than paint him at all. Excitement is coming.Trump and his operatives planning new, smarter assault on “the swamp” if he wins presidency in 2024Quote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-25-trump-planning-new-smarter-assault-on-swamp.html#When Donald Trump first got into office, it became apparent that his political instincts were good.He certainly proved that by beating 16 other seasoned Republican politicians by knowing exactly how to appeal to ordinary Americans who had long been ignored by the Washington elite in both parties.But what Trump could never overcome was the massive Deep State “swamp” — careerist federal bureaucrats who are little more than left-wing Democratic operatives and who worked in the shadows to either slow-walk his policies or ignore them altogether. The same was true for ranking senior managers and staffers burrowed into the massive federal bureaucracy.Well, Trump is very probably going to run again for president in 2024, and if he does, he will win the GOP nomination easily. And if he does that, he very well could win the presidency again after four disastrous years of Joe Biden.Should Trump get his well-deserved second term, he will arrive in Washington, D.C. with a new battle plan for taking on — and actually draining — the swamp. And there is virtually nothing the Washington careerists can do about it.Trump and his allies have spent the last several months meticulously planning not only his return to the White House but also a massive overhaul of the federal bureaucracy down to the mid-staff level that could lead to tens of thousands of firings.According to Axios, whose correspondents spent three months interviewing some two dozen Trump insiders and others familiar with the planning, Trump will reimplement “Schedule F,” an executive order he issued just days before the 2020 election and which was quickly rescinded by President Joe Biden that calls for completely reshaping hundreds of federal agencies....",

And the Dem leaders are right behind Biden, pushing him into worse and worse stupidity.Trump knows how to straighten things up. If you don't like the way things are for the average person, get behind Trump, and help him push the Dem criminals out of office.",
