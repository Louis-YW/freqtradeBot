What are you mining?My usual advicehttps://hashrate.no/gpus/4070tiI would avoid picking hot coins with high power consumption and would start with karlsencoin(KLS) because this coin has the lowest power consumption or choose a coin that is not yet on the exchange like pyrin. But these are the risks of the miner.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5475916.0",

But I'll wait a little longer, nowadays it's not worth it.",

You can remove the side panel from the case to better cool the video card and mine karlsencoin (KLS) if the profit suits you.",
