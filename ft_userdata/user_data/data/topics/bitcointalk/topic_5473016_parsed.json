  "content": "Here it goes‚Ä¶i bought s19 90th machine via amazon and had it shipped here‚Ä¶for my first try it was working quite fine but when i wanted to use it the day after‚Ä¶.it started to initialize and when it got to pulling in about 2.54 AMPs from the pdu (@220v)‚Ä¶a little electric boom happened at the pdu and there was a spark too (@the pdu (mind u only one miner is plugged at that pdu) and one of the power cables stopped working (i measured with a multimeter and one power cable shows 220v and the other 0volt ) all the outlets of the pdu works fine i tried a s9 1800 watt psu on the pdu and it works completely fine)‚Ä¶.and now i am scared to turn the miner on could this be a control board issue( i have a spare control board but not a PSU) so should i change the control board and turn it on or should i wait until i get a new PSU WHAT DO U GUYS THINK PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!",

      "body": "a. you brought pre-used on amazon. first mistakeb. contact the sellerits only a day old. get a refund, not fit for purposeusually not best to be unscrewing the chassis of something you just bought, just return itif returning it is not an option.. wellsometimes due to shipping a sender would put packing foam inside a device to reduce moving/shaking in transport. (foolish but they do it)so open it up and see if u can see or smell anything that burned outbe warned opening it up voids most returns policy so only mess around if returning is not an option",

      "body": "You said it was fine on the first try and then the only thing that gives you a problem is the PDU that suddenly pops with sparks.I guess that the PDU you were using can't able to handle s19 because this unit can draw around 15 amps if the PDU feeds only 15 amps or below then it will melt all electrical circuits on the PDU you should have a PDU that can feed 20A or more than that to handle s19 unit.How about plug the unit directly to the wall outlet?",

Does any one know what this is thank you for the helpüôèIt's weird if the miner type is different, according to Bitmain if it shows a miner type like yours the unit still using factory firmware according to them you need to upgrade or flash the unit with the correct and most recent firmware from Bitmain to fix it.So I think you need to try to flash the control board first you can follow the guide from the link below on how to fix it.- https://support.bitmain.com/hc/en-us/articles/21427190625945-Factory-firmware-problem-handling-The-miner-of-the-mining-pool-is-TEST-and-cannot-be-modified-",

That model has not been active from Bitmain for a while now.Yes it could have been new old stock, but things like miners tend to drop in value so much that they just don't sit around for a year.Could be new, but I would put it as more likely used / refurbished.-Dave",

Does any one know what this is thank you for the helpüôèWhat PSU did you try with? Quote1. APW121215a / b / c versions are universal with each other (no voltage feedback).2. APW121215d / e / f versions are universal with each other (with voltage feedback).3. APW121215d / e / f version can replace part of a / b / c by upgrading firmware, but a / b / c version cannot be used with d / e / f replacement.https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=306I believe your miner model would only work fine with APW121215 version A , APW121215 version B or APW121215 version C.",
