At that time, someone may be over 90 years or more than that age, but if someone is able to get to that age.",

To me, there shouldn't be a specific age for gamblers to retire from gambling when it's one of the few activities they enjoy and look forward to. Instead of age, time might be the better way to answer the question because change can happen at any time and gambling can become less entertaining than it used to be if you suddenly find other hobbies more entertaining than gambling.",

But I think that even old people can enjoy gambling. There should be any age to retire from gambling at all. One can do this activity and leisure time and thus it does not affect retirement related activities also. For me gambling should not be played till old age because even someone that is having fun while gambling, like even if you lose or you win you still move on, there are still sometimes that one feels very bad after losing a bet possibly a bet that you would have won a huge amount of money so no matter how you try to get it off your mind it will still keep on resurfacing in your memory that sometimes you might be going through emotions, so because you are young and your organs are still functioning well you can be able to endure your emotions. But someone who is old might not be able to hold on to such emotions because they might run into serious depression and possibly health challenges as a result of trying to get the emotions off their memories.It is important for us to understand that as one gets old, some part of our body that can endure pressure often starts becoming weak as well so continuously pressuring those part of our body might cause physical, psychological and emotional damages to our body.",

      "body": "Gambling knows no age. The basis for somebody to gamble isn't about age. For me, it is about whether you have the extra money to spend on something as unnecessary as gambling. If you are young, but you only have enough money to support yourself or your young family, you have no right to gamble. If you are old but you can only earn enough to support your basic needs and possibly some meds, you have no right to gamble also. Gambling is for both young and old who have extra money and time to spend on gambling. But of course you can't anymore gamble if you're too old and frail to even rise up in the morning.",

One can do this activity and leisure time and thus it does not affect retirement related activities also. Unfortunately, gambling addiction also affects the elderly. Obviously the numbers are much less relevant than among young people, but they are still quite significant.I was reading once that seniors are one of the main audiences in the physical gambling industry, and every year more and more seniors are getting a \"taste\" for gambling. A survey of more than 6,500 older people in the Omaha, Nebraska area found that going to casinos was seniors' second favorite activity, second only to bingo.Fortunately, the tendency of addiction among the elderly is much lower compared to other ages, it is estimated that only 3% to 5% of all elderly gamblers become compulsive.Of course, gambling does not have a retirement age, you just need to play consciously.",

One can do this activity and leisure time and thus it does not affect retirement related activities also. I don't think it matters? It's not a strenuous activity though it can be a roller coaster of emotions so maybe heart attacks or something similar can happen. But if you're clear of that I reckon you're able to play it for as long as you want really. Naturally, it's best if you avoid anything that can push your emotions to an extreme, gambling is one of them so if asked, but there are some people regardless of age who can keep their calm and at the same time, there can also be younger people who can't handle their emotions so I guess it depends on that. Understanding what you can and can't do should be easily understandable by people of older age (at least, the majority of them I hope) anw so I reckon they can recognize whether they can play or not.",

Regarding a person's activities, in my opinion, it is relative, millennials and those who are older can still gamble as long as they are healthy and have money to gamble with. When someone is sick, they will lose their mood for normal activities, such as visiting a casino or gambling online. Health really determines a person's activities, not age.",

They will continue gambling maybe, until the money runs out.I once saw a group of people over 60 years old in one place playing cards. I saw money hidden under the ashtray but pretended not to see it. It could be an activity they do in their spare time. And as long as they can control themselves, that's fine too.A person can stop gambling anytime he wants and it is not related to age. If he wants to stop while still young, that's good. But if he wants to stop when he is 50, that's fine too. The important thing is that he knows that gambling requires self-control and limits.",

Gambling is a hobby and not a profession, therefore I don't think that there is a need to retire except if one finds it not exciting anymore or is unable to gamble due to certain conditions like sickness or old age. Retiring from your job will lead to a lot of loneliness and gambling could be an activity to keep one busy and active. Retirement activities could just include reading, visiting family and friends, and other leisure activities, which means there will be enough time to gamble. I know many old gamblers in my area and I don't think they are thinking of retiring but many of them prefer in-house gambling where they can sit down, chat with friends, and enjoy some music and drinks.",

You can gamble for as long as you mind is working and you have money. Once you become older, like 80+ your mind does not respond as it used to do previously and at old age, we do not earn any income, so this means that it becomes difficult to gamble at that age. However, some may have passive income, with which they may gamble for lifetime.Quote from: Hirose UK on October 30, 2023, 02:49:37 AMBut if we do research thoroughly we will find that all gamblers in online gambling are loved by all groups from young people to adults and old people so the assumption that online gambling is only for young people is an incorrect idea.With the popularity of online gambling, it is even easier for the old people to continue to gamble in the comfort of their homes. If those people need to go out to the physical casino, maybe they would think to quit it but since gambling is available in their home, on their mobile or computer, so its becomes easy for them to gamble and pass their free time.",

I don’t believe that one need to have a specific retirement age from gambling, it’s not a job that you get to retire from after you have been using it for a long time.You can be old and still gambling once in a while. As one gets old not many things will be fun to them again, that that they were thrilled to take part in becomes uninteresting to them and that’s what will also happen they might not even want to gamble again except with friends and if they find their self in an online casino they won’t spend much time like they used to do when they were younger. But for me, I don’t plan on continuing my gambling activities once I get to a certain age there are so many things I want to stop at that age and gambling is included.",
