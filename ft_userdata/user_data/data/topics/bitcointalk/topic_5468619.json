True, the post itself looks very dubious; it is unclear in what condition the user applied for participation.No shohag is not alt of Dessy88. Actually he want to copy someone report but mistakenly copied whole thread page which can easily judge by his post as he posted many users weekly report data in own post.Both user mentioned by Little Mouse applied for Pepemo bounty manage by Julerz which is very strict to alts . I don't why Ninjastic space not showing any results for this address where as Its available in Bitcointalk yet.",

If you/someone have more proofs, feel free to post them here.Now you have some more evidence that both accounts are handled by the same person. They used the same address, and they have a blockchain connection too. They cheated on some campaigns too. I saw the signature campaign spreadsheet where you asked the user to improve his post quality. I guess now it's time to change your mind and promote himÂ   Blockchain transaction alone cannot prove that account is handled by same person. But when they applied with the same BTC address, it cannot be just a transaction anymore.",

They managed to last quite a while before being found out.Old owner:Quote from: Jocuserious on December 22, 2015, 08:29:49 PMYeah. Â Cryptsy is the problem, not SILK. There is an interesting theory on reddit that suggests that Vern lost a lot of BTC and is trying to get it back by creating arb situations with alts (that's why the prices are a bit different/higher over there). Â Pretty much, I would avoid trading there unless you want difficulty withdrawing. Â Limiting withdrawals allows them to retain the illusion of liquidity while they try to make it back. Â New owner:Quote from: Jocuserious on April 06, 2018, 07:01:05 PMDefinitely right now, Bitcoin will never scam.bitcoin is a real still king of currency.This theory is supported by BPIP:I'm not going hunting for more alts but am tagging this account and the previously connected alts.",

Nevertheless, from few post I have came across here said having Alt is not prohibited but using them to cheat in a particular campaign is highly prohibited or if one account is ban then the rest are not permitted to operate.",
