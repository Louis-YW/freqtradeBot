The email confirmation message link is indeed redirecting to the login page. There is no way to login without the password. Even the password reset option isn't working. Perhaps, OP hasn't completed the development of the website yet.I think it doesn't require a password to enter just like some casinos use a system without a password, but it's true it looks like the OP hasn't finished their website perfectly, even though they wrote the first 500 registrants will get 100 free AFC tokens while the people who see this thread certainly will rush to register so finally have to report this that it looks like the website hasn't worked perfectly the link sent by the email doesn't lead to confirmation of registration.I also tried registering with email I thought I only got a link in the email, a kind of confirmation to enter the account, it turned out to be redirected to enter using the email and password, that's really strange, I didn't even see the password when registering, only the email field and referral code, BTW site it's a bit heavy to access via a cellphone browser it seems this site is not very cellphone friendly so I have to access it using my laptop. I'd like to take a deeper look at your site, waiting for the next update for the registration issue hope the OP resolves it quickly.",
