  "content": "Hi everyone, this year I wanna start my project: \"get rich or die trying\". So I just get registered onto https://free-doge.com/free .I am already having 0.02 DOGECOINS!I make a short calc on this faucet (all of them are same). They reward 0,00293830 hourly, so let's say you gonna be active 24 hours x day so you have 24 rolls.Then if u stay each minute to check they're posts u can have up to 50 extra rolls x day. Okay so let's say 100 I am just positive.Total: 124 rolls x 0,00293830 = 0,3643492 DOGE x day.What if I stay 365 days?: 132,987458 DOGESo in a year that u lose lot of time you receive + 13.2$ (132 DOGE).-_-Okay but if I would use 100 faucets (it literally mean, doing just faucets 24/24h), then in one year that u do nothing else than clicking faucets you earn 1.320$. Is crazy how people still use those faucets  but hey , I will have a chance to the jackpot of 300$   .",

      "body": "Good luck on your plan but I agree with him ^. It's better to just get a job rather than relying on that. Whether you'll be working as a freelancer or a regular employee, both of them are more lucrative than spending your time with that.I mean it's okay to do that but if that's where you're going to rely your main source of income, it's not going to be enough. You can do that whenever you've got free time.",

The sites that make these faucets earn thousands of dollars from ads, deposits, etc., and you earn a dollar a year by clicking on the faucets every hour. I think that if you invest your money in cryptocurrencies or create your own business or you work in one of the jobs or work as a bounty hunter, you will earn more than that, so you have to take advantage of your time, and faucets only give crumbs, and never made rich people before, and the jackpot depends on luck and I don't think you might be the winner among the thousands of people unless you are very lucky.",

The time, the internet service fee, the power once's computer would consume would mean that one is just making loses in the long run, though they wouldn't realize it since their focus is on the Doge coins they receiveIt's better getting a decent job and then DCA Doge with some of the earnings.",
