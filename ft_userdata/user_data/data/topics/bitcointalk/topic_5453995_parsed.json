You provided very little info about the requirements for eligibility but no information about job is given. Please be more elaborative and give as much possible details. Also provide information about remuneration. You can definitely find many prospects here if your work is legal and you provide all the details. As other members have rightly pointed out, there are many scams in the name of crypto and anyone applying for this offer should proceed with caution.",
