Rather, it is the RAM usage of all these transactions deserialized.If you look at mempool.space as you have, you'll notice the size of the mempool graph is only around 4 MvB, while the memory usage is 19 MB. A better site for visualizing this difference is here: https://statoshi.info/d/000000020/memory-pool?orgId=1. The green line in the top graph is the total transaction size, while the white line in the bottom graph is the dynamic memory usage of these transactions.",

If you look at some block explores you will see transactions size and vsize, which are different depending on the input format. For example,  this transactions Size is 341 B and Virtual size is 179 vBhttps://blockstream.info/tx/7569112a7a2ae5f0d2fef2668cbe8ff7f8d6cf87ac667fb92938acf854e9c2e2You can read more about it here:QuoteWeight units are a measurement used to compare the size of different Bitcoin transactions to each other in proportion to the consensus-enforced maximum block size limit. Weight units are also used to measure the size of other block chain data, such as block headers. As of Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 (released August 2016)[1], each weight unit represents 1/4,000,000th of the maximum size of a block.Virtual size (vsize), also called virtual bytes (vbytes), are an alternative measurement, with one vbyte being equal to four weight units. That means the maximum block size measured in vsize is 1 million vbytes. Edit: add referencehttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units",

And the actual block size in raw bytes could be variable depending on how many transactions had how much witness and could be 1.1 MB, 1.5 MB, 2 MB, or almost 4 MB.AFAIK, the block size may reach 4MB, but only 1vMB, according to bitcoin wiki.Virtual bytes is just Weight Units/4. A block has 4000000 wu, but only 1000000vB QuoteVirtual size (vsize), also called virtual bytes (vbytes), are an alternative measurement, with one vbyte being equal to four weight units. That means the maximum block size measured in vsize is 1 million vbytes. ....The maximum size of a block in bytes is nearly equal in number to the maximum amount of block weight units, so 4M weight units allows a block of almost 4M bytes (4MB). This is not a somehow \"made-up\" size; the maximum block size is really almost 4MB on-disk and over-the-wire. However, this maximum can only be reached if the block is full of very weirdly-formatted transactions, so it should not usually be seen. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units",
