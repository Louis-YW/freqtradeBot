  "content": "I'm an Aussie who only got interested in politics when Trump ran for office.I was in my mid 20's when Trump announced his presidential campaign and nearly everyone I knew who was my age or younger became fixated with American politics.Trump blended Hollywood and pop culture with politics which caught the interest of a new demographic.I have noticed that mainstream conservative media and political figures are all in on Ron DeSantis. I remember reading a quote about a prominent GOP donor stating \"DeSantis is Trump without all the baggage\". Rupert Murdoch reportedly called Trump and told him he was going to support DeSantis too.Oddsmakers have DeSantis as the current favourite but I wouldn't rule out Trump winning. Don't forget he got close to 75 million votes in 2020 and MAGA will turn out in huge numbers for him.I'm curious to here what chance you guys give Trump to win in 2024.",

      "body": "De Santis has indeed a chance if Trump continues to lose acceptance and make a fool of himself by selling NFTs.He has also proven not to be failure-proof, because how his endorsements went in the midterms. The problem with De Santis is he would not know how to defend himself from Trump's personal attacks and does not seem to be the kind of person who know how to attack Trump back in the own game.He stands a chance, but not a huge one.",

      "body": "After the announcement of De Santis stating his plans to run for the presidential seat. Trump statement was “I will handle that the way I handle things.” What does he mean by that? We know Trump is good at his games but this statement get me confused. This is Politics and anything can happen the best will win the race so let's just watch and see, currently I can't predict who can win. De Santis is really out for business and is forwarding all his arrows in attacking Trump indirectly Quote Hypocrisy, you say? I don’t bother to call out hypocrisy among Republicans anymore, since their voters don’t care about it. Christian evangelicals supporting the twice-divorced philandering charlatan He was indirectly referring to Trump in all of his statements during his open speachs and in difference cases Trump is also talking back at him..But what's really the point of Trump coming back to run for presidential seat again when he have seat on it and, contested for re-election and lost to his opponent. Why don't he just seat and become a political Godfather and also manage his business.",
