A moderator should help you move it there soon.As per your need, I'm more of the entire financial market inclined which could be encapsulated into Forex as people would say than crypto, so what you see might be more Forex-related but I've tried my best to make them limited rather than voluminous. However, you will have to do more research as trading is not what you learn from one source, it takes years and multiple authors/mentors to guide you.Use the links below for different purposes, and good luck!1. For all guide from the beginning to the end2. For all needed enquiries3. For scheduled news that could affect the crypto market",

      "body": "Focus on Bitcoin because it has a significant market value and moves away from the influence of altcoin, which, on the contrary, are greatly affected by the price of Bitcoin and their price changes according to the change in the price of Bitcoin.In Bitcoin, you need to study the basics of technical analysis, reading price charts, and how economic decisions affect the price of Bitcoin, as raising interest rates relates to curbing the rise in the price of Bitcoin, and the relationship between them and inflation. If your foundation in economics is good, studying these things does not require a lot of time. Start now and you will complete them before The end of the year, and if you have knowledge of these basics, all you have to do is try to develop a strategy through which you know the price effect.",

So please if you know the direction I can go to get this, I'll appreciate that and I believe others too would learn from this topic If you want to carry out research in accordance with scientific studies, there are many stages you need to go through. But whatever research you want to do, the first thing you need to look for is the root of the problem and the reasons behind you wanting to research macro and microeconomics. Because a lot of research ends with a degree of manipulation. Determine a specific target sample, create a kind of questionnaire to narrow down the target problem, and then formulate it by offering a solution that you think can solve the problem.",

Maybe it's good for advanced classes, but for beginner classes it's very risky. However, if we are mentally ready and really intend to learn, this can be done with little money. But I'm not interested in that anymore, because I spent quite a lot of money there, it's scarier than buying bitcoin and then the price goes down.",

To use the micro and macro economic indices may confuse you more. I think you will get more volatility in cryptocurrency if a major news happen in the market. Everyone who trades now aims to make a profit, whether it is a quick profit or a temporary profit, but the strategy differs according to the level of risk, the assets, the nature of the investment and the ultimate goal. Whoever wants to diversify his investment portfolio differs from whoever wants to take risks in high-risk investments such as the derivatives market.The exposure of cryptocurrencies to macroeconomic indicators is not clear, and Bitcoin is almost the only one affected by this, given that it has uses outside of trading within platforms, but since the price of cryptocurrencies is linked to Bitcoin, it appears as if it is affected by the macroeconomics.Quoteexample the XRP court case caused some hype in the market last few months ago, the news on whales dumping their coins may also get investors reaction but to research on micro and macro economic indices may confuse you.The court ruling on XRP has nothing to do with affecting the price. the court ruling restored the possibility of trading in it again, and thus speculators bet on an increase in the price, since everyone knows XRP and there is a possibility of increasing demand for it, and the court has no influence on the price here.",

If the capital is small, the results will not be muchA person who can really bear all these hardships can really gain something decent, but really depends on how dedicated a person is and how he follows his principles and discipline on the journey. Because trading is all about decision making and if a person can be patient, and emotionally strong he can really beat the people smarter than him. If you really think it suits you better go with it.In the field, I used to say your competitor is smarter than you, more experienced than you and you need to realize that your loss is his profit and his loss is your gain. You really cant have such luck that you'll start making money in trading after a few months in the market without losing in the trends of the market. What matters is your capital, be on field save the wicket and wait for a good moemmnt and play.",

But then again, futures trading and trading in general isn't really recommended for most people to do due to how people oftenly underestimate how complicated it is.This is something I agree with. When I first started trading, I believed it was simple. That's because my mentor taught me in that manner. I lost money since I didn't employ risk management in my trades because I underestimated the risk. So, if you wish to trade, don't be overly confident in your trade and always practice risk management because it will not always be profitable. You must understand that you will suffer losses. You will be successful in trading if you are disciplined.",

When doing fundamental analysis, indeed that it's always better to have a wider view about the news so that you will have a better success rate in your predictions. News about regulations plays a big part on how can an asset or a currency performs so we also need to take not of them.For micro analysis, I think it's better to check the legitimacy of the project before other things like you said there because anyone can easily fake those, and our efforts are only going to waste.",
