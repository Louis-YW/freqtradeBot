Twitter is approving these ads without any kind of verification, which is very surprising.

How about Google and many other tech giants that are advertising scam. I remember when I started to learn about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and when I joined this forum, what I first researched on that time and which people on this forum were referring to as a way to hack someones device and wallet are ads. It would be good for people to try as much as possible to abstain from ads generally.About the airdrops, people should see it as a waste of time unless they have made enough research that proof the airdrop is not fake. But ignorance make some people to go for airdrops which have numerous ways that scammers and hackers can use to against their victim like paying before receiving, submitting KYC which can be used against the victim through phishing attack, and victims connecting wallet to scammer's website which will make the scammers to compromise the victim's wallets and all coins on it would be stolen.",

While these types of scams were common prior to Musk's takeover, now they can purchase a blue checkmark for a few dollars and significantly boost the amount of people they are able to reach.",

Once they used Google ads to promote all kinds of scams including wallet hacks, phishing websites, and now they are using Twitter.Many crypto users are eager to participate in airdrops, and they are the easiest targets for scammers. Due to some recent big airdrops, this trend of fake airdrops has started and as the attackers are already succeeding in their moves, they are spending money to create more new websites. If crypto users are not alerted, these scammers will continue to create such phishing websites, so increasing awareness among crypto users is of the utmost importance.",

The changes made to the X increased freedom of expression and increased activity of scammers.10,000,000 TWT is not a small, it's almost 84 million dollars, and no one will give it away in free distribution, these scammers are stupid and not everyone will believe it. I am convinced that more people will start to think that cryptocurrencies are money and money does not grow on trees.",

Previously, blue badged accounts were considered trusted because they were verified accounts, which prevented scammers from scamming using unlimited verified accounts.But now it's easier for scammers because of paid services, and most crypto users don't even have the awareness that these are fake accounts.",

      "body": "This is what we get when they sell trust for as little as $8 monthly. Before, it was considered that any verified account has passed some kind of required verification and can be trusted to some point, and those who are able to get their account verified can't risk running some scam or spam activities with it as it can put the account at risk. But right now, since those trusts are now being sold for just $8, which any scammer can afford, and using some bot to fill in their followers numbers, this is really not surprising at all.Aside from the time that Binance distributed this TWT token to their customers as either a new year's bonus or a December bonus (I can't remember correctly), I don't think there has ever been any legitimate airdrop conducted by TrustWallet. I pity those who are always active on the internet in search of free money, as they are usually the ones who fall victim to this kind of scam out of ignorance.",

So this is not new my friend, as I have seen many on both Facebook & Google. So it's left for us to keep on updating the newbies just as you have done, and for people to always try to do their own research on any online offer before claiming or investing in it, as many are likely to be a scam, which I'm sure many will likely fall for this since \"Trustwallet\" is one of the most newbie-friendly and popular crypto wallets.",

And not to overconfidently say that just because I know all about this, the rest of the crypto users must know all about it too. This warning is for users to be aware of how X (twitter) is working after the new update. Many crypto users lost their funds due to Google, Facebook ads, now it's time for X (twitter) to be the most used medium by scammers, isn't it better to be warned before falling victim to scams? Or should we post a warning after falling victim to a scam! Warning posts like this are just an attempt to warn newbies, if they can learn something from here to keep themselves safe.",

However, it's been a nice idea, that you brought this to our notice here on the forum, and I will keep on saying that until all crypto newbies inculcate the habit of verifying & confirming whatever advert or airdrop found on social media (i.e test of authenticity by doing their own research), it will greatly reduce the rate at which people will fall victim to this.",

Blue ticks can be bought by scammers, but they buy them for a month or two, and it is rare to find long-term scam. It is true that they buy a thousand accounts, but for a month or two, and healthy growth is by buying 500 accounts for several months. I expect that with more time, the impact of this fraud will diminish and become economically ineffective. We will have yellow, gray ticks.",
