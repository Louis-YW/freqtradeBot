  "content": "The Justin Sun-linked crypto exchange HTX had $258 million in outflows after a $30 million exploit in November.Crypto investors have been moving their assets away from crypto exchange HTX (formerly Huobi) following a Nov. 22 exploit that saw the exchange pause its services and lose a total of $30 million. Between Nov. 25 — the day that HTX resumed its services — and Dec. 10, the exchange had some $258 million in net outflows,Over the past two months, HTX and other Sun-linked entities, such as crypto exchange Poloniex and the HTX Eco Chain (HECO) bridge, have been hacked a total of four times.The first HTX hack occurred less than two weeks after the exchange rebranded itself to HTX, with an unknown attacker stealing nearly $8 million in crypto on Sept. 24, 2023.HTX’s HECO Chain bridge — a tool designed for moving digital assets between HTX and other blockchain networks — also suffered a massive breach on Nov. 22. Hackers compromised HECO and sent at least $86.6 million to suspicious addresses.Meanwhile, November was the worst month for crypto theft in 2023, with hackers and other malicious actors making off with $363 million of ill-gotten digital assets.Crypto exchange HTX sees outflows top $258M following exploitHTX formerly Huobi have been under a series of hack attacks in the last couple of months, it used to be one of the top reputed exchange on the crypto community but since the rebranding, security seems to be flawed and keep losing its balance, so I urge any users to drain their exchange wallet before a hacker does from HTX.",

This current year, one of the longest-standing exchanges in the crypto industry was also hacked. Even our local wallet had a similar experience, and it seemed like it was just shrugged off by them, everything became quiet. It seems that almost any exchange can be infiltrated by hackers, so sometimes you don't even know where to place your coins or tokens when you want to trade. That's why there's always a reminder not to treat exchanges as storage or hiding places for assets because you won't know when thieves will strike.",

And people should be never store their cryptos in exchanges in the first place but the exchange claims to have the best possible custody that the user which somehow convinces most of the newbies then ends up filled with hot and cold wallets.",

In a decentralized exchange, there is no single point of failure, and the traders trade directly with their trading partners, and when the exchange does not hodl customers money or data, what is there to hack.",

It's not that right until they realize that their funds become frozen and they can no longer do their thing on it. If they are still not aware of many things happening from exchanges about hacking incidents, they're no longer free to reason out that they don't know.

Except for newbies who are not knowledgeable about the crypto market can make this mistake and it'll be understandable. The way exchanges are being hacked and are going down is now alarming, how can people regain full trust in there services again, these are very sad developments for the crypto industry. How can crypto adoption increase with these hacks and exchanges going downI guess that the technology of exchanges are been compromised, and these might be the reasons for this ugly trend. An exchange in Nigeria, called Patricia, started it's services and within a short time it gained the trust of many customers, and before you know it was hacked, scammers made away with invested funds. Best thing is to do your transactions in exchanges and then move your coins into your none custodial wallet, where you have the full custody of your coins.",

Justin Suns Poloniex Exchange also got hacked for a hundred million dollars. And what does Sun do? He freezes withdrawals except his own TRON shitcoin. This forces Poloniex users to trade their coin for TRON if they want to withdraw. He does not put up liquidity, making all altcoins on his exchange almost impossible to buy except at extremely unfair high prices. How is this not considered illegal market manipulation?As common as hacks in crypto are, it still looks extremely suspicious. To me it seems like Sun is the \"hacker\".",
