Yes, lack of merits is a big issue to keep this small crowd of active members motivated. You can check the stats of the local board posted by Bitcoin Smith every month. November has been very bad for the board and I am expecting the Quote from: Bitcoin Smith on December 28, 2023, 03:58:18 PM[UPDATE] November 2023 Insights1 Number of posts : Decreased from 369 to 236.2. Active users (atleast 1 post) : Decreased from 86 to 31.3 Merits shared : Decreased from 318 to 61.4. Merit per post ratio : Decreased from 0.86 to 0.26Credits: RikafipNovember has been very bad for the board and I am expecting the same outcome for December, which will be out by the end of this month. What we need is an active merit source who can spare some time and spread the merits on posts or topics that are up to the standards of Bitcointalk. If not them I can be someone who can send you through DM the list of posts/topics that are suited for merits. When @Heisenberg_Hunter was active we did see a rise in activity here and we were very happy as a community. I am aware of the reason why he is inactive now and in the meantime, you can look into the situation of merits on this board. I have tried my level best to get the child boards also active apart from the main board.",

This topic is for identifying useful posts and rewarding the author with BTC and not merits (as mentioned in OP).In my opinion, what Mr amishmanish did there is not a bad one. Since the op is the host of this contest, giving some merits to either have smerits to share isn't a bad idea. Besides the op deserves even more for stretching out a generous hand of giving from his own pocket, just to increase or help the activities of our local board to grow. However adding merit to the contest would even make it more fun.Op thanks for this generous act.",
