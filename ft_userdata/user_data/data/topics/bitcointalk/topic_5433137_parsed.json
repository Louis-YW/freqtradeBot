If you leave yourself such amounts, you can expect trouble. In my opinion, it was a fair decision.",

To me, there's no any amount I would prefer to lose just like that unless in some circumstances like trading and investing in crypto. But do you mean coming across such is purely a stealing? And you would just let those coins wasted despite knowing that locating the real owner would be so difficult? Like you said, since we are all assuming, I'll stop assuming and rest my brain.",

But would someone be that careless with a wallet of thousands of bitcoins or other amounts. Or because of some phrase incident, the seed was lost and found by someone else.If I find it, the first thing I will do is check the transactions that were made. checking whether someone legitimate has the address or they are looking for it. i will actually tell the owner if i find it. Not wanting to be hypocritical, maybe I can get a few percent of the assets I find.Feel sorry when someone loses their keys accidentally with quite a lot of assets. Just imagine if it happened to ourselves, of course we would be very frustrated and try to find out whether other people held the seed or not. But the worst thing would be losing the seed and never finding it, it would be immovable asset.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on January 05, 2023, 03:01:10 PMQuote from: lovesmayfamilis on January 05, 2023, 02:25:18 PMI would send this amount to some charitable foundation for sick children or children without parents.

It may be better to wait or make a transaction sending a small fund to inform the owner that the wallet is compromised. good suggestion so that the owner of the wallet will know if someone is trying to tell that a seed was found and a transaction was made. The actions taken by @lovemayfamilis are indeed good actions, but it's better to wait for the owner to respond first.",

I would like to quote myself here. No one is going to say they are going to send the fund back or the private key. Everyone here will pretend they are honest but the real test is when they will get the keys or coins. Try that with someone random lol.Quote from: Little Mouse on December 11, 2022, 11:25:18 AMLol. I didn't expect such a thread here.You can ask people whether they will be honest, they will surely say a big yes. But whether they will be honest or not will depend when you actually test them. Send 10 bitcoins to 100 random people from the forum who here pretend as scam buster or who here pretend as honest. I'm sure only a few of them will return the money.In my local, one of my friends always say that everyone will be corrupted at some point. Some may sell their moral for $100 bucks while some for a grand and some for a million.If I say I will send you back, that won't guarantee that I will really be honest. However, I never count someone else's money as mine even if that's a single penny or a million (though no one so far trusted for a million lol).",

You can say you should be honest and all but let's face it practically most of us are going to do this, it's human nature, but yes If i was rich enough to not care about the amount in the wallet I would let it go.
