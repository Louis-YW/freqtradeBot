Come with your evidence of scam or stolen your money before you could post them here for scamming, otherwise I will tell you not to involved yourself with such activities in accusing a casino whereby you weren't a victim of their scam. Yes, let it be that we are all away of them but do not accused them if you weren't a victim.. hence I believe sharing these links will as well keep people around here alert about this site in other to avoid them.Anyway thanks for sharing.",
