      "body": "The difference between the bank and the crypto whale is that, banks are centralized and operate on shared interest and banks controlled the entire banking decisions of how much they pay to depositors, but a crypto whale is an investor who holds a big bag of coins without control on the amount other shareholders received since the price of the coin determines the amount in interest to coin holders. So bank centralization vs whale decentralized investment: While banks controlled the total cash flow. the whale is an individual investor with control over the cash flow since crypto is decentralised.",

But whale in bitcoin is a sole Investor who invest in bitcoin with his own money and have the profit by himself without sharing it with anyone. The profit whales make is not comparable to the banking officials. The Banking profile is shared among the shareolders which probably 60% private and 40% government. But whale acquire all alone.",

What dou you think? The differences are totally clear, just as other members have outlined them to you. I don't even see any form of similarity between those two.Banks, as we know them, all their funds belong to their customers, which means that banks are gambling with their customers money, putting other people's money at risk just to make a few bucks from them.Whales are gambling with their hard-earned money, putting their own assets on the risky side, which is for the greater good; if they lose, it's their money and not others funds.Banks sometimes fall into bigger problems when almost all their customers want to withdraw their funds all at once, and they won't have enough funds to cover all depositors.Whales always have a mapped-out plan on how they want to use their funds since it's their personal money that's invested; they already know where those funds are, and as such, they won't want to make any rash decisions about withdrawing in a bad market condition. I just mentioned a few differences between banks and whales; their methods of profit are different. Whales take all their profits to themselves, but banks keep a huge part and share the rest with depositors.",

What dou you think?  Quite the contrary. Banks could sell all their massive holdings and leave, all because they know that they are the very reason why money is made. Whales in crypto are held by the neck by the economy and the people that is involved. The moment that they sell their holdings, they will carry with market crashes of magnanimous amounts which could kill the very asset that they kept alive for so long. Plus, these whales (at least I hope) didn't come from cheating and stealing and lying their way to the top of the market share. They became the way they are because they believed in the coin and held on for dear life even though it takes years for fruit to fall down the tree. I don't need to say how greedy and manipulating these banks are, which are the cause for their rise in power. So as you can see, they are not the same in any way whatsoever.",

What dou you think? Banks are traditional financial institutions that are duly regulated by the governments and they provide a wide range of financial services like savings, checking account, loans and credit card. While the so called Big Whales in the crypto industry are the individuals or entities that hold large amounts of crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, ETH and other crypto currencies. Bank are subjected to government regulations while big whales can operate decentralized and unregulated market or anonymous. Banks earn profits by charging higher interest rates on loans compared to the interest they pay on deposits. Big whales buy crypto currencies when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high, earning profits from the price difference. Banks and big whales in crypto operate in different market and the are subject to different regulations.",

They're eager to just win their trades and take over those weak hands money as they really are the targets of them. And for a whale, I am sure that they won't boast that they're a whale even those known crypto personalities that have been known to be holding a lot. They don't boast themselves that they're a whale or they can be a par with the assets or be considered wealthy as a banking institution.There's really a huge difference on them but comparisons are way far from each other.",

What dou you think? They are different. Whales are whales and banks are banks, they are two different entities, the only thing they have in common is that they are related to the economy. When the whales move, the crypto economy can be affected, and so can banks, when they go bankrupt or when the central bank raises interest rates it will affect a country's economy and it can also affect the crypto economy. Moreover, whales usually influence the crypto market significantly more than banks which do not, but if the bank becomes a crypto whale it will be a different story. And many other differences and therefore the two entities are different.",

But every final decision is always up to each person to believe or not, because banks that offer deposits based on the services they have for customers to use will always promote this to everyone so those who are interested in this promotion will definitely become the bank's customers.As for the whales in the crypto space, they are simply taking advantage of the moment of price dips to buy on holders who are already panicking and no longer willing to hold on for long. And in this case it can be concluded that the whales were not wrong because they only made offers and carried out their strategy, the rest returned to the holders who panicked when they saw a decline in market prices. Because those who sell it are also based on their own decisions, not on the basis of other people's decisions.",
