      "body": "My answer has nothing to do with what you are talking about, but as you said, obviously, we need government. Because if there is no leader and manager, the evils and crimes you are talking about will continue and be bigger than what we are seeing. I find it difficult to understand when many people complain that they are too controlled by the government and are not free but they cannot imagine that without laws or regulations, our world would be dominated by evil then we would be worse off than being controlled.",

      "body": "Crime and war go in pari passu, a society that has high crime rate is fanning the amber of war looming. I also believe if you have a low crime rate, it also have an effect on how positive the growth of that society will be. Although War in modern times doesn't just come easily, a lot factors must instigate it, ranging from crime, politics, interest groups and all what not, while crime can be related to, poverty, unemployment, alcohol, drug abuse etc.",

      "body": "In my opinion, war is much scarier than crime, crime can cause injury to you or danger to your family, but you can also prevent it in many different ways, and it is not too difficult to handle in the face of crime. But with war, when it happens not only you but all your loved ones are at risk of losing their lives at any time and you will not be able to resist or find a safe place if your country is at war. Both are scary things and we shouldn't expect to see or face them.",
