Having little amount of bitcoin on Electrum on the laptop and still expecting malware, although not likely. It depends on how you use your device, be it phone or computer. But you should know that you should not have the coins that you can not afford to lose on an online wallet, there are cold wallet options that you can go for.

I myself experienced something similar a few weeks ago when my BNB was instantly transformed into another wallet upon receiving it. I understand the shock and bad feeling that you are going through right now, so I’m very sorry for that.I don't think the issue lies with the Electrum wallet itself, If hackers had found a security loophole in Electrum without having to access your pc first they would target wallets of whales with large amounts of Bitcoin logically. I am sure that your device has been hacked using a malicious program or file you downloaded and your antimalware defense isn’t enough. If you could recall the latest files that you downloaded before the last time you used your Electrum wallet on your PC and run a test on VirusTotal for example and you may find something. Since I’m not sure tracing the hacker’s wallet will lead into something.And as other users have suggested using a wallet on an online PC is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. The solution to prevent such painful experiences is to use another device only for a Bitcoin wallet or a better option which is to get a cold wallet.",

Did you check your logs from Electrum to see if your funds have been stolen through Electrum on your computer?

There could be a multitude of reasons why someone's cryptocurrency is compromised - an unsecured wallet or device (where the thief had physical access to the computer), malware or spyware on the system, falling prey to a phishing attack (where the user knowingly or unknowingly exposed the private key or seed to third parties), an outdated or insecure operating system (many people are hesitant to admit using a cracked version of software, which could introduce numerous threats), or even a remote hack on the system. The list of potential culprits is virtually endless. What we can be sure of is that these cases are isolated and do not reflect the overall security of the Electrum wallet. Electrum is a reputable and widely used cryptocurrency wallet that has undergone numerous security audits and has proven to be highly secure.By the way, OP, I'm sorry for your loss.
