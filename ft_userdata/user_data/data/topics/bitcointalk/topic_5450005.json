  "content": "User Uniqueness White paperNext-generation user unique decentralized application platformA user-unique decentralized blockchain technology where each user can only register one account for computing data to verify the validity and integrity of the blockchain data. A blockchain with a fully fledged Turing-complete programming language built in would require only a few lines of code to write the desired logic.Bitcoin's workload proves that the PoW mechanism is a breakthrough because it solves two problems at once. First, it provides a simple and relatively efficient consensus algorithm, allowing nodes in the network to all agree on a set of canonical updates to the Bitcoin ledger's state. Second, it provides a mechanism for allowing free access to the consensus process, solving the political problem of determining who influences consensus while preventing witch attacks. In Ethereum's proof-of-interest PoS, the election of verification nodes is based on the number of pledged assets held. A node with more Ether has a higher chance of being selected as a verifier, so it doesn't consume power but PoS is an equity mechanism which defeats the purpose of de-centring. Therefore, we will not use the PoW and PoS consensus mechanism, and use the advantage of user uniqueness to a new Proof of Randomness (PoR) consensus mechanism, which selects the bookkeeper by random number, so as to realize random bookkeeping. Unlike other consensus mechanisms, PoR's bookkeepers do not need to solve any mathematical problems or pledge any tokens, making PoR more efficient and centralised. We can even record and verify transactions across the network on mobile devices such as mobile phones to get rewards.One important scalable feature of Bitcoin is that its blocks are stored in a multi-level data structure. The hash of a block is really just the hash of the block header, which is a piece of data of about 200 bytes containing a timestamp, random numbers, and the hash of the previous block.A full node in the Bitcoin network -- the node that stores and processes all the data in all blocks -- took up 15GB of disk space in April 2014, and is growing by more than 1GB every month. At the moment, this is acceptable for desktop computers, but mobile phones can no longer carry such huge amounts of data, and in the future only businesses and hobbyists will act as full nodes. The Simplified Payment Confirmation Protocol (SPV) allows another type of node, called a \"light node,\" to download the block header, use the block header to confirm proof of work, and then download only the Merkle tree branches associated with its transaction. This allows light nodes to securely determine the status of any one bitcoin transaction and the current balance of an account by downloading a small portion of the entire blockchain.User uniquenessThe purpose of user uniqueness is to create a decentralized application of web3.0 unique identity. We believe that only user uniqueness can solve financial crimes brought by the current blockchain anonymity and various crimes brought by the future web3.0 anonymity. PoR consensus mechanism can solve the waste of power resources and computing power resources caused by the current proof of work. And the blockchain, with its Turing complete programming language, allows anyone to write smart contracts and decentralised applications in which they can freely define ownership rules, transactions and state-transition functions. This is far more powerful than the smart contracts that Ethereum and Bitcoin can offer.User unique accountIn user uniqueness, each user generates a unique code through face recognition, which binds the public key and keeps the private key by himself, so that he has his own unique account. Although the user's account is unique but does not mean that the user's personal information is public, because a string of code on the network and can not know the user's identity, unless the account has criminal behavior, the country is able to obtain the code through the face recognition company portrait. Here we should note that we are introducing the face recognition company interface and face company is centralized, can add more family face recognition company interface, at the same time through the generation of unique code to solve the problem of face recognition company centralization.Blockchain and computingThe user-unique blockchain is completely different from the Ethereum bitcoin blockchain,Bitcoin is extremely inefficient because it needs to store the entire state of each block. The reason is that the state is stored in the tree structure and only a small portion of the tree needs to be changed after each block is added. So in general, most of the tree should be the same between two adjacent blocks, so data can be stored once and referenced twice with Pointers (that is, hashes of subtrees). A special type of tree called a \"Patricia tree\" is used for this purpose, which includes modifications to the Merkle tree concept, allowing efficient insertion and removal of nodes rather than just changes. In addition, since all state information exists within the last block, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history, and calculations using this strategy can save 5-20 times the space if applied to bitcoin. However, at the beginning of the program operation, I hope all nodes will be heavy nodes to record the history of the whole blockchain, because the data at the beginning is not large, and each node can easily record the data of the whole network.applicationIn general, there are three types of applications based on user uniqueness. The first type is the identity application of web3.0, and the second type is the application of data conversion between users. Finally, there are applications such as online voting and decentralized governance.Identity and reputation systemBased on the premise of user uniqueness, users will be responsible for their own web3.0 identity, behavior, reputation, web3.0 era will come sooner or later, before the arrival of web3.0, we can no longer use the anonymous wallet address like Bitcoin to bring a variety of money laundering crimes. If Bitcoin had been designed to be unique to its users, no one would be using it to break the law.Go to the center for client updatesWhether it's Bitcoin or Ethereum, they're just de-centralizing the transaction data, and the updates on the client side are still dictated by the development team, which is not really de-centralizing. We're going to hand over the right to update the content of the client, not the right to develop, but the final decision to implement the update to the client requires a majority vote of the user. The development team still has the right to initiate version updates, but whether the version can be updated depends on the votes of all users. For example, when Ethereum updates pos, it does not need the consent of ordinary miners. It can change from pow to pos today and update tomorrow in a favorable direction for the development team.Decentralized file storageOver the past few years, a number of popular online file-storage startups have sprung up, most notably Dropbox. Dropbox wants to allow users to upload hard drive backups, provide backup storage and allow users to access backups for a monthly fee. At this point, however, the file storage market is sometimes relatively inefficient. A cursory look at the various available solutions reveals that the monthly price of mainstream file storage is higher than the cost of an entire hard drive, especially in the 20-200 GB category known as the \"Uncanny Valley,\" where there are neither free credits nor enterprise discounts. User-only contracts have enabled the development of a decentralized file storage ecosystem, where individual users can rent out their hard drives for a small profit, while unused space can be used to further reduce the cost of file storage.Decentralized autonomous organizationGenerally speaking, a \"decentralized autonomous organization\" is a virtual entity with a certain number of members or shareholders, who own a majority stake of approximately 67%. This essentially replicates the legal means of a traditional corporation or non-profit organization, but is only enhanced by crypto blockchain technology. So far, much of the discussion about decentralized autonomous organizations has revolved around the \"capitalist\" model of decentralized autonomous corporations, with dividend shareholders and tradable shares; As an alternative, what might be called a \"decentralized autonomous community\" would give all members equal power in decision-making and require a majority of 67 percent of existing members to approve any increase or decrease in membership. Since each person can only have one membership, groups are needed to perform collectively.Another model is a decentralized company, where any account can own zero or more shares and decisions require a two-thirds majority. The complete framework would include asset management capabilities, the ability to bid to buy or sell shares and the ability to accept offers (preferably with order matching in the contract). Entrustment also provides a democratic form of appointment system and popularizes the concept of \"board of directors\".More applicationsCloud computingUser-unique virtual machine technology can also be used to create a verifiable computing environment, because each computer only records and verifies the data of the entire network without taking up computing power. This allows the entire network to call on a user's computing power, allowing the user to ask others to perform a calculation, and then selectively ask for proof that the calculation was done correctly at some randomly selected checkpoint. This could create a cloud computing marketplace where any user can participate from their desktop, laptop, or dedicated server, and call on the power of the entire network when they need it.Centralization of miningThe Bitcoin mining algorithm works by having miners perform millions of SHA256 calculations on a slightly modified version of the block header, again and again, until eventually a node produces a version with a hash smaller than the target value (currently about 2192). However, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of centralized attack. First, the mining ecosystem is already dominated by ASics (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed specifically for specific Bitcoin mining tasks and thus thousands of times more efficient. This means that bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian enterprise that requires huge amounts of capital to participate effectively. Second, most bitcoin miners don't actually do block verification locally; Instead, they rely on centralized pools to provide block heads. The problem is arguably worse: as of this writing, the top three mining pools indirectly control about 50% of the processing power in the Bitcoin network, although the problem is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other pools when a mining pool or alliance attempts a 51% attack.Ethereum is now intended to use a mining algorithm that requires miners to take random data from the state, calculate some randomly selected transactions from the last N blocks of the blockchain, and return a hash of the result. This has two important benefits. First, Ethereum contracts can include any type of computing, so Ethereum ASics are essentially ASics for general computing, i.e., better cpus. Second, mining requires access to the entire blockchain, which forces miners to store the entire blockchain and at least be able to verify every transaction. This eliminates the need for a centralized pool; While a pool can still legitimately balance the randomness of reward distribution, a peer-to-peer pool without centralized control works just as well.Whether Bitcoin or Ethereum huge capital can have more computing power, when the computing power reaches 51% can launch attacks. Ethereum does not have all nodes that record the whole network but only the heavy nodes that record the whole network which makes Ethereum not decentralized enough. On the other hand, with the user-unique PoR consensus mechanism, everyone who wants to get the block billing reward needs to keep the computer or mobile phone on to record the data of the whole network before they can get the billing reward. Under such a premise, it is almost impossible to control the computing power of the whole network, which can only control more than 51% users.scalabilityLike Bitcoin, Ethereum has the drawback that every node in the network needs to process every transaction. With Bitcoin, the current size of the blockchain is about 15 GB, growing by about 1 MB per hour. If the Bitcoin network were to process 2,000 transactions per second like Visa, it would grow by 1 MB every three seconds (1 GB per hour, 8 terabytes per year). This is helped by the fact that user-unique integrity nodes only need to store state rather than a complete blockchain history.The problem with large blockchains is the centralization risk. If blockchain size is increased to 100 terabytes, it is likely that only a few large enterprises will be able to run full nodes, while all ordinary users will use light SPV nodes. In this case, there may be concerns that full node partners are fraudulently profiting (such as changing block rewards, giving themselves bitcoins, etc.). The light node cannot detect this immediately. Of course, there may be at least one honest full node, and a few hours later information about the scam will leak through a channel like Reddit, but by then it's too late: The massive, and probably impractical, collaboration of ordinary users to blacklist designated blocks is on the scale of a successful 51% attack.conclusionUser uniqueness protocol is an upgraded version of blockchain technology, which makes users responsible for their own behaviors through user uniqueness and solves the energy consumption problem of proof of work through PoR consensus mechanism. Highly general-purpose programming languages offer advanced capabilities, and the existence of a Turing complete programming language means that, in theory, arbitrary contracts can be created. Around decentralized file storage, decentralized computing, and many other such concepts, the computing industry has the potential to become much more efficient. Finally, there are plenty of apps that have nothing to do with money at all.Whether it is the current Bitcoin or Ethereum, they only decentralize the recorded data, while the content of version update is still decided by the development team, which is not the true sense of decentralization. User uniqueness is open in design, which not only decenters the data, but also enables the version update of the client to achieve decentralization. We believe it will be a good fit as a foundation layer for Web 3.0 for years to come.",

You could have at least summarized it a bit and bring out the most important points.I did a little summary and I think it will be better if you still try to summarize your content a little bit.the op, is try to say is that there's is this new decentralized Blockchain technology that is user unique. And this allows users to register Only one account and not multiple. this new technology aims at providing a new proof of randomness(POR) mechanism which is able to select the book keeper using random numbers and doesn't consume much power but is more effective and centralized than a pow(proof of work) or a proof of stake mechanism (pos).This new technology, has a inbuilt, fully fledged turing complete programming language allowing users to write smart contracts and decentralized applications.Some importance of this user uniqueness includes it's ability to solve financial crimes brought by Blockchain anonymity and various crimes brought by future web3.0. it states the idea of using a facial recognition technology to generate a unique codes helping each users to create a unique account. And also, with the help of this new technology, more unique applications can be designed which includes, identity recognition systems, decentralized governance and a data conversion applications.compared to the Bitcoin network, in which a full node stores and processes all data, taking up 15gb of space and currently growing more than 1gb every month. And this whole process has made it impossible for mobile phone users to act as full nodes. Another importance of this technology, is that it provides a simplified payment confirmation protocol(spv) which allows light nodes to securely determine the current status of any Bitcoin transaction and account balance by downloading only a small portion of the entire Blockchain specifically the block header and the Merkel tree branches.",

      "body": "OP, I read right up until you said face recognition. Get ready for massive hacks and most people getting their money stolen if you rely on face recognition.Face recognition works for personal devices because you have to have the device and the face. With just an internet application like blockchain, you don't need the device, just the face, so there is no doubt hackers would find it very easy to take pictures of people off the internet, and generate an image that could be used for getting the private key of that person, and boom, money gone.Also at one point you mention PoW wasting power. PoW does not waste power. It uses power in an incredibly beneficial way for both Bitcoin and society. Meanwhile your PoR is built on the concept of a complete lack of anonymity, and therefore a lack of privacy.And yes mobile phones can't store the entire bitcoin blockchain, but pretty much any computer can, and it will only get easier over time because the cost of disk space drops much faster than the size of bitcoin's blockchain grows. Heck, if anything it is likely that you will eventually be able to store the bitcoin blockchain on mobile devices quite easily.Also, because face recognition would definitely not be secure and would be easily hacked, and your PoR relies on it, that means the 'mining' in this blockchain concept would end up being centralized and controlled by the best hackers who have taken over the accounts of the most people.",
