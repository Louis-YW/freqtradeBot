However given how small the dips have been I am starting to think this will rally into the $25K at least before it pulls back.One indicator of a Bitcoin bull market is when you want to buy the dip but can’t. That usually means it’s a very strong bull market. And the best way to play it is get in early and keep holding without selling too early. Hence if you got a long going keep holding and don’t sell yet.",

      "body": "What I know is that indicators can fail, but long term sentiment has not been failing yet, the price of bitcoin is still low, for anyone that has money he is not using for long time, he can buy bitcoin, the price may reduce but we are still going above $50000. Going above $50000 may not be this time, it can be in this year or next year.I use weekly BB and RSI indicator, what I predicted before is that bitcoin would increase above $23000 which would be a resistant price, but getting to $25000 is possible because there can be more overbought market, the upper band has been attained now but the market can be bullish a bit more. But because of the weekly BB overbought market, bitcoin price may drag around this price, finding it difficult to go higher for now. But I am still expecting above $30000 this year though.",

The price looks good, however, I'd wait for a correction (or at least plateau) and then the next pump; then I'd also be convinced we're good (I tend to be \"slow\" in this, but don't worry about me).On the other hand, I was expecting the bear market end in Q4 2022 and, based on these new charts, it has basically ended in 2 of January 2023. So, based on my original math, you indeed may be right on this.PS. Thanks for the new charts, I've been awaiting for them",

I think it's just a recovery that is still on shaky legs, until we get back to pre-crash levels caused by that South Korean scammer. This would mean that the price should reach at least $30k, and somehow it doesn't seem to me that this can happen soon.",

On the other hand, me waking up seeing the price moving over $20k makes me nervous, Lol, because I'm thinking that the waking up next day, the price might be different.But it seems that the bulls has taken control of the market, and again, waking early in my timezone to witnessed again $23k++ still baffles me as to what is the real reason for this increase at the start of the year.",

Markets keep showing that they do have upward momentum to break the trend line,but after this happens a pullback is certainly on the cards!",

Now we are currently in the 13 month of Bitcoin down trend, seems history is trying to repeat itself.",

It's all good if am to have that kind of assumption with you but will that possible to come by cos a few months back we were having a bitcoin price at $22k above before the luna and the FXT exchange crashed. In a year the bitcoin halving would kick off. Before then and now, we are going to encounter so numerous price movements (up and down) of bitcoin. Let's keep our tempo cool for now and trust the movement of bitcoin(whether it declines or increases)",

I have seen a number of polls and discussions showing that the sentiment remains generally bearish, probably because the halving is still happening in 2024. Nobody would probably have expected that the price would leap from $16,000 when the year started to $23,000 just around 3 weeks later. Bitcoin is indeed unpredictable and while we could say that the bearish days is probably over now, we could again be wrong.",
