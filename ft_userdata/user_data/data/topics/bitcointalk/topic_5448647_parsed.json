I dey new here. mark my surprise when I found out Nigeria had their own forum feeling lost while navigating the forum I jux fall in believing say I fit easily get info from una here based on fellow country people and also because I nor really get idea on the do's and don't on bitcointalk like that.well I stumble upon a coin called goal3 some days ago which promises to decentralize betting and help improve trust and transparency. if you have had of wink(WIN) token you will understand this coin potential since betting nor b sth wey start today and this coin has given a way to cover up some of bettings flaws.this is my personal opinion since the coin currently dey on presale and don start their airdrop with lockdrop program to prevent sell pressure wey affect coin like Arbitrum(ARB). I chose to  post it here to inform those that are unaware and to get insight on those that have come across the coin.Thank youP.S. don't mind my subject title. I nearly off my head on thinking on I suppose put ahnLet me still introduce myself hereAm from Lagos, donning the gender maleI never participate on the goal3 yetNa make me be dey find where I fit talk about ahn and know others thoughts on the tokenThanks cryptomile for showing me  naija forum Like I said before e hard me pick subject so no vex say my Subject be like advertisement.

Probably he should have came up here with those links maybe we can track the project information through those details, actually shitcoin are now beginning to come out since they have noticed the little change in the market they often come suck some hell from investors after which they disappear keeping you and I with an empty tokens, so we have to be very careful with the form and kind of token we make investment.I don't argue with you @Igebotz, all correct sir!",

When I came across the project I was bought by their goal of decentralization as well as ensuring transparency and trust. I see say dem dey run airdrop I find ahn too stressful and I nor really get better information on ahn na make me post ahn here. To see if person go get idea on the token. About the title I nor really understand how dem dey run subject title na make me write in the form of a question bcus na share and confirmation I b wantOkay even me self notice am after you post about am, me go online google am to know how e be but the place wey for dey better pass na altcoin sections so that more people go see am to know how far than here because we 9ja no go too put am eyes to know how the project be.

      "body": "Op, welcome to bitcointalk.I'm not a fan of casino-based tokens but I'm curious to see how this project will work out, my main concern now is the 'transparency' and 'decentralization' of their casino. Because lately there have been a lot of complaints from different forum users about how they have noticed some suspicious activities of casino and if this project that you posted in Op truly has the goal of becoming a transparent casino and not a rug pull project I'm sure a lot of users will be more than ready to embrace it(although, it's going to take some time to fully gain the trust of the forum since it's a new project and so many people are very skeptical when it comes to a new project that's promising a system that's different from what they have been using because most times it just ends up as a means/way to attract people into their project).But, if I'm wrong and the project turns out to have good intentions then it will be something that everyone should key in and make profit while can. Once again Op welcome to the forum and don't forget to go through the forum's rules.",

AI tokens are taking over the next altcoin season, they have been doing pretty well.Probably, but as some altcoins did not get to all-time-high, most of the with good marketcap still increased more than 10x, while some are really shit coins. Some new projects during the bull run were fake projects, some were pumped and dumped, some continued to fall even as bull run continued. There would be some AI projects like that this time. We should always consider altcoins as gambling. Just bitcoin is better. Or other coins like ether and bnb, but they are somehow centralized, most especially bnb. I will recommend bitcoin.Quote from: Cantsay on April 13, 2023, 10:35:23 PMBut, if I'm wrong and the project turns out to have good intentions then it will be something that everyone should key in and make profit while can. Once again Op welcome to the forum and don't forget to go through the forum's rules.It is just a gambling token, it should be used for gambling, just for gambling in my opinion to qualify for more benefits on the gambling sites that created the token. Even for gambling, I will prefer bitcoin or stable coin like USDT or USDC.",

I will recommend bitcoin.Yes, you are correct, but altcoins and shitcoins are money-making schemes, at least in my opinion. While bitcoin is an asset to own for the long run, shitcoin will always be a gambling token and high risk investment to me; it's either you gain money or you are drained in a short run, there are no other options.
