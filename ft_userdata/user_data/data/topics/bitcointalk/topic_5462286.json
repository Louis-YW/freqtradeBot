From what I understand, you're trying to collect money so you can buy cheap pre-sale tokens? If that's what that is then I don't think you will find anyone that will be interested in your project here because you're taking the money without the guarantee that those pre-sale tokens will increase in value.",

You're making money without losing anything while those on your subscription are going to lose, and what's your credibility that you are good at picking the right coin to distribute, I've seen outrageous ideas here in Bitcointalk but so far this is the worse of all, I'll bookmark this thread and maybe in the future I can include this as one the most outrageous offer if there's a discussion on this.",

Thank you! I think you don't understand the market condition to offer something like this, not all new coins or coins that we see in presale have potential in the market, and you did not even show your expertise in choosing what coins to buy to distribute what is your authority for people to trust you and send you their money to pick coins for them when they can do it all by themselves.I don't know where you get this idea but there should be a level of authority for you to convince people of your idea, something that you failed to show.",

Thank you! the project model that you offer is like a ponzi scheme, where people make deposits and then they will get tempting rewards. no matter what argument you give, be 100% sure that this is a ponzi scheme and will definitely be a scam.especially to convince people to believe in you, first you need to build a reputation in this forum. how is it possible that people will believe in a newbie who just joined 1 day? do you think that there are people who will believe you here?",

There is none unless you're looking for scam projects. A decent presale requires a large sum of money most of the time with strict criteria, which is why only VC or whales can enter the first stage. There is no way OP will be able to make a deal from the monthly subscription fees he collected. Even if he can, there is no incentive for him to keep his promise since he can easily pick worthless coins to distribute to his users. Don't fall for his scam.",

Also the profit margin from crypto is not very high where your conversation is 10x-1000x worthless.",
