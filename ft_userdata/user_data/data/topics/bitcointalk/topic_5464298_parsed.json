Since I was born up till now, there is always panic whenever Naira to Dollar rate dey increase(with the exception being the Satoshi boys wey dey here).  Is having N1 = $1 a meaningful economic goal?Please read this analysis by David1 and share your thoughts at the end. Lets discuss it.Quote1 USD buys about 950 naira. 1 USD buys 1,300 Korean won. 1 USD buys 145 Japanese yen. 1 USD buys 144 Kenyan shillings. None of these numbers tells you anything about the strength of those economies. On paper, the naira is worth more than the won. Does that mean Nigeria has a better currency or a stronger economy than Korea? Does parity of the JPY and KES in terms of their dollar value mean that Kenya and Japan are economic equals?No. That would be a silly and illiterate conclusion to draw from looking at an exchange rate. A thousand and one things can affect an exchange rate, and it can mean a thousand and one different things. A cheaper naira to lazy Nigerian politicians might be bad news because it means spending more to get their imported Patek Philippe watches and 12-year reserve whisky. A cheaper won to productive South Korean industrialists, on the other hand, means more export sales since international buyers can now get more KRW and buy more Korean goods for the same dollar amount.Trying to build fiscal and economic policy around \"revaluing\" the naira is a mistake and a fool's errand. The only part of the exchange rate that should be a government's concern is its long-term relative stability. In other words, the exchange rate should be left to market forces and allowed to find its bottom - even if that bottom is N2000 = $1. As long as plans to significantly increase production and exports are being implemented correctly, any pain from a high exchange rate will be brief and temporary.1 https://twitter.com/DavidHundeyin/status/1693553641251082422",

Since I was born up till now, there is always panic whenever Naira to Dollar rate dey increase(with the exception being the Satoshi boys wey dey here).  Is having N1 = $1 a meaningful economic goal?I no no about others so me I go only fit speak for my self, doz countries way their local currency low well well like that, u don try check their minimum wages if them convert am to dollar how much of their million way dem they earn. and how much dem them spend too to cover up their own cost of living. Most of this people entirely they dependent on watin them their self they produce and them no need import too much of foreign things way go warrant them reason the difference.But for this our country, most of our daily survive stuffs nah import them they import am, and as them they import am them they use the dollar as excuse to carry high the price of things up, and even when the dollar drop small we no go still see the price of things they drop with the dollar value.Since the government no wan increase minimum wages so that eh fit they fit in the value and things way man need to survive for the contri eh for better say them try make the local currency way them dy greedy to released equal to the dollar, so that person go know say any small amount way dem pay u, one nah one and eh go serve you. No be when dem they pay you 80,000 as salary when dollar been they 450 and u they manage they survive, now dollar don climb reach 800+-900 them still they pay u the same amount (80,000) that amount no go even fit buy half of watin in they buy before, if u complain for market them go tell u say dollar value high. So eh for no better day them try normalize or equalize this dollar to our local currency since everything way we wan they do for this country their price they sabi they controlled on watin our currency they exchange with dollar.",

Ordinary, na di country economy nai go develop a country so if di economy strong then development go take place and if u look at all those countries u mentioned, they are all well developed. Every country has their exchange rate so dat amount you see in South Korean im still big pass naija own. And all Nigerians dream is to have #1=$1 one day. Even we can't realize it now.",

      "body": "Yes, I see am as meaningful economic goal because e go mean say we don dey add value to the naira and wetin go bring about this nah when we focus more on exporting our local goods rather than importing, when we decide to utilose the many resources we dey blessed with. Like Op point out, the only peeps e go worry nah \"those Satoshi earners\"  and while e go look like say we dey concerned for the growth of the naira, secretly we dey pray make e go up so we fit gain am well.Any Govt wey achieve that feat go be really government wey understand the need for growth and wey no dey selfish. Although areas dey wey dem need to fix, but I feel say adding more value to the naira dey more important before d mata go worse like the Zimbabwean dollar or the Argentine peso.",

And di Oyibo people dey deceive dem sae if dem devalue am we go get plenty development but all na lies Shebi una sabi say the reason why things dey increase for the country nor be because of the say N1=$900 now? Make I give una some example1. Most of the food wey we dey chop are produced mainly in the northern part of Nigeria. And as e be now since the last decade or more wetin wey dey experience for that region na rising insecurity. Farmers nor fit dey go their farms again go cultivate these crops because if them go there, terrorist fit kill or kidnap them. Now, dem still dey farm but na closer to their house and na for small farmland wey nor dey enough. Therefore when the small one dem harvest reach other parts of the country, the price don triple. Law of economy -high demand, low supply equal high price.2. Cost of operations. Naija nor get competition for the petroleum industry. If you look am well na like only FG dey import fuel. E nor suppose be like so. If government fit open fuel importation up to other companies like dem do with telecommunications, you go see say the competition go drive the price of fuel go down. And then even the prices of things for market go come down because truly wetin make things cost na the transport nor be really the commoditiy.",

All these their talk na confuse talk because what ever them do na only for the short term. If them win really make dollar and naira no get big difference, make them start to produce more products than them dey import. This go create avenue for new jobs and go help sustain the citizens for the country. Them need to also work on the refinery and need to dey export products to other countries. If US see say them get important product wey na Naija dey supply them i.e without Naija them go lack such commodity,you go see say na from their negotiations on the dollar to naira price go come up.",

Shae una know say, no he only politicians dey do export and import trade. If you spend plenty money buy goods from another country, if fit sell am cheap and run to loss?. If 1naira equal 1 doss, e mean say, the product wey dey enter naija go cheap and that one go also make internal product dey very less, and the pressure to sell products out because if exchange rate go reduce. When dollar no rise like this life no too dey difficult.Insecurity don dey for ground since Jonathan time, and things no hard like this.",
