  "content": "Inflation has increased rapidly over the last year at the world has emerged from the pandemic. At the moment in the world where inflation rate keep increasing, borrowers benefit the most. Especially in a long time loan, borrowers pay back money with a less purchasing power compare to the time the loan is borrowed. A typical example can be seen below between two men in Nigeria.Man A: He bought a tricycle in November,2021 on hire purchase at #1,400,000 when the real price was around #900,000. He his to pay back within 16 monthsMan B: He bought a tricycle in July,2022 on hire purchase at #1,900,000 when the real price was now #1,300,000. He his to pay back within 16 months.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Observation: Comparing the two men with the lenders profit when loan was given, if in just 9 months the purchasing price of man B is close to the total amount payed back (purchasing price + interest) by man A, what happens at the end of the 16 months if inflation keep increasing. If the lender decide to buy a tricycle after man A had finish paying his money. He will end up adding to the money before he can purchase one. When lending money to man A, the lender believes heâ€™s making a profit of #500,000 but this doesnâ€™t worth it anymore within that 16 months as inflation keeps increasing.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Conclusion: People with good and profitable businessesÂ can borrow money to boost their business during inflation. They will always be at the gaining side if the money is utilized well.",

We have to remember that assets generally depreciate in value because they get dings, scratches or just degrade with time. So, selling a second hand asset is usually more difficult than selling a new. Obviously, this sort of ignores collectors items, but cars for example are generally considered to have already lost a few k on their price as soon as you drive them off the forecourt. However, as long as your loanee pays back the amounts required, lenders will always gain. That's sort of the broken system we live in, where normal people require to lend off the rich, and as a result the average person loses in the long run, while the rich get richer. That's basically how the system is designed, and as worked for as long as we've all been alive. Inflation isn't really a bad thing for the rich, they'll profit enormously on it.",

      "body": "In this case, the problem is not only in terms of inflation. I put inflation aside and let's look at the time span between man A and man B. 2021, of course, where the pandemic conditions are severe enough that prices, apart from rising prices, are also increasingly difficult to pay. Then man B did in July 2022, automatically if the statistical calculation of the time span and the economic cycle would certainly make the price of goods increase more drastically, plus the cost of goods after the recovery. Why do I lead my opinion to real conditions where the economic cycle changes every year and inflation after the pandemic is much deeper. Back to the topic, it's not entirely the lending and borrowing system that benefits one party because man A and man B have an actual price difference of #400,000 (with the same amount).",

      "body": "Borrower does take huge risk with the loans. I mean if they are borrowing in the high times then they should make sure that they are having good profitable business too. They are borrowing but they should plan and execute their business thoughtfully otherwise how they gonna repay the loan? It's not about how much difference are they getting benefited for the \"value\" of something but its about how the borrowed money will be returned along with the principal + interest in the high time. I am stressing on this because, in such inflationary times, business also slows down based on the nature of business. For example, if it bicycle business and we are in inflationary times then why would anyone spend money on it and not on the food reserves or may be healthcare needs etc? This could indirectly affect that kinda business. While on the other hand healthcare, food industries may get benefited as it is the daily need to survive. You can walk if you dont have biycyle but you cant live if you dont have food!So its not just about borrowing and lending calculations, its also about where the money being invested? Do they have that much returns in the current period? Is it going to stay stable for the tenure of loan and much more!",

So these figures are normal loan interests in Nigeria? In my country, banks' interests are around 2% monthly. But I also heard that in very rich countries, personal loan interests are very low.Quote from: Welsh on August 18, 2022, 12:26:06 PMSomewhat. Although, there's no guarantee of it.

Obviously, this sort of ignores collectors items, but cars for example are generally considered to have already lost a few k on their price as soon as you drive them off the forecourt. Well, I assume OP's tricycle example is utilized for transportation services. Tricycles are common means of transportation in some countries, especially in rural areas and outskirts of cities. So it will be income generating. If I am right, then Man A benefits well since he is already earning income for a year.Quote from: Poker Player on August 18, 2022, 12:58:15 PMI do not agree with the idea that borrowers are the ones who gain from this, only a few borrowers who know very well what they are doing and who have a great capacity for self-control do so.In other financial threads I commented it: it is the debate of which system is better to improve your financial situation, Robert Kiyosaki's or Dave Ramsey's system.The former advocates going into debt to acquire financial assets, mainly RE and the latter advocates getting rid of all debt and avoiding debt like the plague. Mathematically for a robot or an AI, it would be Robert Kiyosaki's but in real life for most people it's Dave Ramsey's.Perfectly said. And personally, I also prefer Dave Ramsey's system. Financial assets are accompanied by risks though just like what happened before in the US when its real-estate market collapsed. But I am also a huge believer in real estate and raw lands, only because my country is small with over 100 hundred million population.",

That is why, when inflation rises, the interest rate charged by lenders also rises.e.g. If I borrow 3% money to buy a house for $50,000, and inflation rises to 6%, over time I have paid back significantly less than the purchasing power equivalent of my original loan.",

It might appear to be profitable to the borrower based on your description but it's not. Inflation affect the cost of living of the general populace.To use the same example you used, both Man A and Man B won't agree with you that they have gained over their lenders at the end of their repayment time. Why? Because the money they realized from using the tricycle is spent on more expensive things. The fuel price, maintenance fee, and road-use tariffs would have increased from the time they purchased the tricycle.In conclusion, inflation is never a win-lose or win-win situation. It's always a lose-lose situation.",

It's just not that easy for some of us to get a grip on these.

So I assume that by inflation here, you specifically refer to the times when the inflation rate goes beyond the target. If you borrow money when the inflation is high, there are two tendencies. One, it could mean you will pay back with a cheaper money or money with lower value. This means you're indeed taking advantage of the rising inflation. But this is only possible if inflation continues rising or if things worsen over time, especially if this translates into increasing wages since goods and services are also getting more expensive.However, borrowing money in the middle of a rising inflation could also mean you will be paying money with more value. And instead of taking advantage of the rising inflation, you are actually putting yourself at a disadvantageous position. An inflation rate going far beyond the regular rate would definitely be addressed. Various measures would certainly be implemented to counter it or tame it down. In which case, you might end up paying during the time when money has already recovered much of its value. I think the best time to borrow is before inflation, that time when money is still in high value. And the payback time will be in the middle of rising inflation.",
