  "content": "QuoteIndia has always had a not-so-friendly approach toward cryptocurrencies. Even when the rest of the world was embracing the idea of cryptocurrency adoption, India was taking the opposite stance.Even though blockchain technology has received a warm welcome in India, the central bank has tried to suppress cryptocurrency in the nation. With a 30% tax and 1% TDS, the Indian government had pushed almost $3.8 billion worth of cryptocurrencies to foreign exchanges.As days pass, the dream of India steering towards a positive cryptocurrency stance is diminishing. Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das recently spoke about cryptocurrencies at a Business Today event. Das restated his stance on cryptocurrencies, stating the necessity to outright ban them.Reserve Bank of India’s Das said crypto is “nothing but gambling”The RBI recently launched its CBDC in an effort to minimize the monopoly of cryptocurrency in the country. Das stressed that cryptocurrencies are, “nothing but gambling” and that their “value is nothing but make-believe.”Das stated the necessity to impose an outright ban on cryptocurrencies and stated that there is no underlying value in it, not even a tulip.“Every asset, every financial product has to have some underlying (value) but in the case of crypto, there is no underlying… not even a tulip…and the increase in the market price of cryptos, is based on make-believe. So anything without any underlying, whose value is dependent entirely on make-believe, is nothing but 100 percent speculation or to put it very bluntly, it is gambling,” the governor said.Das also believes that legalizing cryptocurrencies will increase the dollarization of the economy, citing the loss of central bank control. He also cited the recent downfall of the FTX exchange as an alarming event. Das also stated that CBDC is the future of money.source: https://watcher.guru/news/reserve-bank-of-indias-governor-calls-for-an-outright-crypto-ban?utm_source=TelegramNews&utm_medium=TelegramNews&utm_campaign=TelegramNewsI hope this one man's understanding about cryptocurrency will not affect the government of India  turning 100% hostile against cryptocurrency.  It is clear that this person does not know what he is talking about.  Blaming the FTX fall to cryptocurrency  and doesn't even understand the difference between a TULIP BUBBLE and CRYPTOCURRENCY adoption and the technology behind it.Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das surely have a personal motive of pushing CBDC force feeding it to their citizen.  \"CBDC future of money\",  funny how he state that when the technology behind CBDC is just a copy of what is in Cryptocurrency technology.",

The citizens will surely find ways on how to access crypto, even if it means going outside India to make  crypto transactions. Well, I guess you’re right, the governor is just selfish and greedy, he will do everything in his power to ban crypto but we know for sure that crypto is here to conquer the world inevitably, but it won’t mean eliminating fiat as crypto and fiat should still work hand in hand.",

India is a big market for gambling industries. More number of gambling platforms have got into existence over the last few years. The pandemic have made way for the development and even after losing of so many lives, the government isn't concerned about making any changes to the gambling platforms.Everywhere the government want to control the money. In India the government wants tax and they tried all possible ways, but looks like nothing worked as they expected. Maybe that's the reason for such a statement. Even now India's legality on cryptocurrency usage isn't announced. People keep on using just because it is taxed, considering it legal.",

Das may realize soon that the CBDC will also be questioned whether it also has some underlying value. Because at least in crypto it's the market that will decide whether it has value or not. It's the demand of the people, the buy orders in the market identify BTC or crypto to have a value.Banks are stealing the value of our money and so will this CBDC. But not for long because money will now be reliant on the crowd using it.",

If the Indian government mistakenly outrightly ban cryptocurrencies, it would lead to an increase in illegal and unregistered crypto platforms. Indians would also seek alternative means of invading the ban. This would make the government lose the huge income they get from the sector through high taxes. But this central bank chief should have known that CBDCs cannot replace cryptocurrencies because they have different features and people are aware that CBDCs are just online fiat solely controlled by the government. Most government officials keep using the same strategies of talking down on the crypto industry using examples of some failed ventures because they want to promote their CBDCs. This strategy would only attract those that are not well-informed about Bitcoin.",

The key thing that connects them all is the very low level of transparency of the political system, which also shows that they want as much control as possible over their citizens, especially in the financial aspect.I honestly thought that the tax they imposed was something that would end the story, because the state is in profit, but when the governor of the central bank says \"crypto is \"nothing but gambling\" then everything is clear. However, even with the ban, anyone can still use Bitcoin through DEX, although it will certainly not be easy for anyone in the event that this happens, given that the penalties that were discussed were very high.",

It's similar to how we saw Russia banning cryptocurrency (before they became desperate for ways to transfer money during the war they created against Ukraine). India is afraid that people are transferring money around without them being able to tax remuneration from overseas family members and try to tax it as much as possible. They're afraid that they will lose power as banks become more irrelevant, instead of adapting and embracing a new future.",
