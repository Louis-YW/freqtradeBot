  "content": "I can understand the hesitation that BRICS might have about allowing France into BRICS. After all, France is in favor of the US sanctions against Russia... Russia, the main member of BRICS along with China. Wisdom would suggest that any country in favor of sanctions against a BRICS member nation, should not have voting authority in BRICS if they are allowed to enter.A point in favor of France's membership in BRICS... every nation wants to make money and engage in trade wherever they can. France-into-BRICS might be a major way for BRICS nations to get around US sanctions. It might, also, bring into the open the fact that NATO isn't as united as some people like to think.Macron asks for invite to August BRICS summit in South Africa – but adding France could create FRICTION within the grouphttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-06-20-france-macron-asks-invite-brics-summit.htmlFrench President Emmanuel Macron is asking for an invitation to BRICS’s upcoming summit in South Africa, causing speculation about whether or not France wants to join the economic bloc. While some member nations are happy with this development, one member is clearly not.The BRICS economic bloc of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa is slated to hold a summit in Johannesburg, South Africa this August. This upcoming summit is quickly becoming one of the key events in the global economy this year, reflected not only in the widening coverage of the event in the mainstream media but also in the possibility of some Western leaders like Macron joining the event.Macron reportedly asked South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to invite him to the BRICS summit. This is according to a phone conversation he had with his South African counterpart on June 3 that was recently made public. (Related: BRICS members discuss possible expansion and creation of common currency to challenge US dollar’s supremacy.)The French government has not officially confirmed whether Macron’s request to be invited to the BRICS summit is legitimate. But Palki Sharma on Firstpost described the request as “a surprising knock on BRICS door” and said that Macron “wants a slice of the action” that is definitely expected to happen during the summit.Firstpost further speculated that Macron may want France to join BRICS because it is entering the “big leagues.” Alternatively, Yaroslav Lissovolik, writing for Modern Diplomacy, suggested that Macron may want BRICS to open up a new platform specifically designed to promote cooperation between the developed and developing world economies.Other media outlets have made their own speculations. Russia Today suggested that the French leader may want to discuss his plans to “overhaul the global financial and geopolitical order,” a topic he raised more than once in past statements.China ecstatic, Russia confused about Macron’s show of interest to join BRICS summit...",

Make no mistake, it has been a while since France has shown some approach to China and that should be a matter of concern to Washington. In the worse case scenario, France could turn to a non-aggressive position in favor or Russia, in the Ukranian conflict.",

Does anything in the world make sense anymore?France did not apply to join the BRICS, Macron simply called the President of South Africa and asked for permission to attend the BRICS summit, which will be held in August this year. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia today spoke out strongly against it, so I think that Macron will not receive an invitation to the summit.The President of France is a political corpse for a number of reasons, but I can name two of them. He is a political corpse in the domestic political arena because he approved a law to raise the retirement age bypassing Parliament, which caused mass protests and riots in France. And he is also a political corpse in the foreign policy arena because he leaked to the press a private telephone conversation with the President of Russia. It is interesting that there was nothing reprehensible in the content of that conversation, but the very fact of the leak put an end to Macron as a trustworthy person.",

But this makes for an interesting country, government-wise.India has a government that is based in two things, common law (from the years of British rule) and religious law that is based in the peoples' religions and customs.Any of the people of India could use a jury in a court trial, like Britain and the US. But they might be ousted from family and local community by their customary/religious law for doing it. More than likely this kind of government doesn't fit in with the other countries of BRICS. It would more closely fit with American law.So, whatever BRICS is doing, it seems to be uniting all kinds of people of all kinds of nations. Yet it represents freedom in this unity. It seems that free-America and free-Britain are against financial freedom among nations that they can't 'formally' control. They show it by the sanctions against Russia, and simply by never thinking of joining BRICS.What a strange world. The most freedom-talking countries (US and UK) don't want to allow other countries of the world to have freedom.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_the_Legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png",

Would not been counter productive to China, by the way, since they are trying to further increase the use of their centralized CBDC? They would not dish their own digital currency so easily for a new standard. In my opinion. The long road started to be paved way back when the US disregarded its part in the Minsk Agreement of 1991, and started increasing NATO States in Europe. This, along with all the 'police actions' the US and Nato have done around the world since, have only served to strengthen the solidity of and on that road.BRICS actually started way back in the 1990s, but the name was only added starting in 2001. So, the long road has been being paved for a long time, and is being extended in many ways. It isn't BRICS or the nations thereof that have declared war on the EURO and the USD. Rather, it is the US and Nato that have declared war through the sanctions, and indirectly, through their Nato expansion around Russia.In BRICS as I understand it, the various nations in the Agreement use whatever currency best suits the situation. They all want to be Top Dog, but they have willingly set their differences aside to expand past the controls the US is trying to maintain with the USD. It's just a bunch of nations trying to get ahead in the world.All the international airlines of the world, and the airports, speak English as their language for flying. All personnel need to learn English to fly planes or work in airports no matter the country. In fact, most of the flying inside of all the major nations is done in English even if it isn't international. Perhaps the US can pull some strings in this arena that will keep financial freedom in the world from happening.Bitcoin became a THING in just 10 years. It might not take BRICS very long to agree on a currency when their hand is forced. In fact, they might have it settled already, even if they haven't brought it into the public. If the US allowed them freedom in their usage of the USD, etc., they might never consider anything other than USD.Consider, again, the airline point. It would be very difficult for the international airline system to convert to a different language or process, and still do international flying between all the BRICS nations and those who are about to join them. So, this might be the area the US should focus on to maintain their 'slave nations' as slave nations.",

France in BRICS would be a trigger for profound changes in the geopolitical landscape. We bet that Turkey can also join soon, which, like the case of France, will weaken the importance of the UN as a purely Anglo-Saxon project and that of NATO. Indeed, the BRICS countries are against the UN's attempts to link the issues of climate with the issues of security, and France in BRICS can return to the de Gaullean concepts of foreign policy outside NATO. A challenge to cohesion in BRICS is the large disparity in countries' capacities (in favor of China) and the members' focus on cooperation with the PRC, which results in a smaller number of relationships among the other partners. However, the main factor that has weakened the BRICS in recent years is the deterioration of relations between the largest member states, China and India, since 2017. Border and trade disputes culminated in the clashes on the Ladakh border in June 2020, which almost led to the cancellation of the BRICS summit in the same year and prompted India to deepen cooperation with the United States and the EU.Now, the West's involvement in the war in Ukraine is reviving anti-Western sentiments, not only in the BRICS countries....EDIT: The West's involvement in the war in Ukraine is starting to cause anti-Western-government sentiments in the West.",
