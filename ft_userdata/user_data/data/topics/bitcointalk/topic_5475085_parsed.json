  "content": "Since joining this forum, I've always been keen on learning new things from the more experienced members. This approach has taken me a long way. learning from them the right way on how to navigate the forum. Along the way, I've noticed that some members might not be learning the correct way to do various activities on the forum, particularly when it comes to quoting. Some members struggle to understand the proper way to quote, often making the mistake of quoting the wrong person. The forum's quote button is designed to mention the specific member you've added to your quote. I've come across many discussions on how to quote properly to avoid mistakes like this.However, some members keep making the same mistake repeatedly and have chosen not to learn. For those using the Telegram bot, this can be annoying when you're mentioned unnecessarily, and keep getting notifications even if you're not involved in the current discussion. I personally urge all members, not just the newbies but also those who are guilty of this, to stop and learn the proper way to quote a post. This will not only remove you from the list of annoying members for others but also improve the quality of your posts. There are many ways to quote a lengthy thread without repeating everything in your reply. Simply edit your post and remove the users you aren't referring to. you can as well read in these few thread that have been created to teach members, on how to quote properly. let's all learn the right thing today and act in an organized manner.[Tips] Posting technique[TIPS] to avoid pyramid quotes (for Newbies)",

I don't see anything big here because if it's the former, although Forum discourage it but it's not completely against Forum rules and if it is the later, I would advise you to simply ignore the notification if you are not interested in the discussion. Normally, you don't respond to every post you are quoted. Besides, this act is mostly common in gambling section and if you notice, most of these quotes are some how connected.Sometimes, it's not about laziness to qoute differently but instead of quoting differently and respond to each with either one line or just a single word, they qoute altogether and summarize their comments under. One important thing to note here is that, newbies are not too fond of doing this but well established members and you can not say they don't know how to qoute properly.",

Many people are too lazy and ignorant to remove irrevelant parts of quote. There is also part about SMF being old - I saw some other forums where it's physically impossible to make such huge quotes - you only can make quote of one post, not 5, 10 or 20.And yeah, there is good point about Telegram bot notifications - it's really annoying when your name is getting mentione in discussion where you don't participate.BTW, such pyramid quotes is a thing just on Bitcointalk.

I don't see this much in the global section. But you'll find it widely on local sections. If you wanna reply cleanly to multiple person you should follow a basic rule. For example, I'll show below.According to the OP post, he already knew it was a pyramid post, which is prohibited in the forum, and you are posting like he doesn't know what a pyramid quote is and we should avoid it. And we really don't have to see this in global sections because the rules are strictly obeyed there, and consistently making pyramid quotations can cause trouble.Quote from: Hamza2424 on November 22, 2023, 07:12:50 PMStill, I'm sure it's not frequent in nature, rarely in a week or month you'll face it. It does not matter if this case is rare or not; the forum has prohibited the use of PayPal quotes, so it is better for everyone to avoid unnecessary quotations. I also used to do this, but from the time I learned about it, I tried not to do it. If I have to, I prefer to write names, but in most cases, I don't have to, and that's where I agree with you because if I have to use it rarely, then you are 100 percent sure that it's not frequent, and it's been proven.Other than Pyramid quoting, unnecessary calling is also annoying. For example,Â  if a person makes a post and calls your name in it, and another person tries to reply to that post, including your username, it will give you a notification of a quotation while the person replying to that quote is not talking to you.",

However, newcomers misuse the system excessively because they constantly neglect stuff. They are always told to read before posting, but they ignore this advice and post without fully understanding the forum, which leads to wrong actions. The funniest part of it all is seeing a very short post carrying a long pyramid on itâs head which they couldâve just quote the sentence that is to be replied. OP you did a good thing sharing these tips with us so newbies and those who donât properly understand how to quote will learn from them. Pyramid quotes should be avoided where not necessary. Quote from: Findingnemo on November 22, 2023, 05:23:40 PMMost likely they are mobile users who are too lazy to edit the part they want to bring into the discussion, just go on and quote the whole unnecessary discussions and it is a sign of spam too in my opinionI don't even bother reading these articles because it's obvious from the first glance that they are spam, especially when they are from beginners. I disagree that mobile users make up the majority of pyramid posts because, as someone who uses a phone for posting, I too am aware that pyramid posting is not ideal and I don't quote every single thread that someone posts. Mobile users who know how to quote properly are not lazy to trim their quotes. If you are not knowledgeable about how to properly make quotes you will definitely end up making pyramid post regardless of the device you use so laziness does not come with a particular device and even PC users can become lazy and make pyramid posts. Quote from: Amphenomenon on November 22, 2023, 05:52:36 PMt's still actually annoying, currently I mainly log in on my phone but that doesn't withhold me for trying to do something properly. It may be that they don't really know how annoying it is or they are just doing it just to complete their weekly post for their campaign. I choose to ignore such postings because I am more interested in well-posted content, and pyramid posts tend to be crowded with information that makes it challenging to understand what is being said and whose quote I am currently reading. I appreciate the OP's effort in creating this thread to discourage it, but it is really bothersome. All I'm hoping for is that newbies would start reading before they post so they may find this and other related posts and gain knowledge from them. People should quit publishing in this manner since, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not the only one who ignores most pyramid posts that are actually useless.",

Like you said, it's not the first time a complaint like this has been made but let's hope your little shout can make a huge difference. I think it's not the newbies alone that are guilty of such practices, sadly it something that's done by all the ranking members on the forum. I see a lot of it on mega threads, especially on the gambling board and I find it really messy. IMO, single or double quote is enough and there's no need to pyramid quote just because you want to make a post or buttress a point.",

I would also say the same as what Findingnemo explained as some are too lazy to edit or trim the post because they are using mobile. I find it hard too to edit the post especially when you use mobile to post since it is not the same as laptop and desktop. I sometimes quote some post and not edit it since it is not against the forum rules and it is considered as spam too even though you may have posted on topic but it is because of not trimming the previous post.",
