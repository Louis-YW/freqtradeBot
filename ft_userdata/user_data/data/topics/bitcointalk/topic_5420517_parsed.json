Is it a good buy or heading in the same direction as LUNAIt has a great community but looking at its security matters, makes me not want to invest in it. The next Luna is we know and that's the FTT, they're bankrupt but SOL I think is far from being that. Although there have been hacks and security issues from it it seems that the community it has is solid. So, you choose what you think is with them. You're going to worry with its securities or not or you're going to buy because it has a community support.",

And if you are asking that because of the latest update that sol is doing or has done for their community holders, for me if the value of sol falls in the market a lot and if I have something to buy I will do it if I invest in it I'm sure there.But of course, it's still good to see and monitor what happens in that matter, since I also can't deny that SOL also has the potential to be held long-term in the future.",

But you need to make cautious as Solana is tie up or related somehow with Sam and anything connected with that usually tends to go down as a result of their bankruptcy. Anyway, Luna was a really grave mistake, but maybe Solana can still be save if they improved a lot of things around their platform.",

Is it a good buy or heading in the same direction as LUNAI do not advise you at all about the Solana coin, I thought for months that it is a good coin for the long term, but it turned out to be the opposite. The biggest reason is that Solana is supported by the Alameda Research platform by Sam Bankman, CEO of the FTX platform, who declared bankruptcy a few days ago, in addition to that the Solana blockchain was hit by a lot of the major failures that constituted a crisis, and I believe that Solana coin in the future will collapse like Luna and FTT coin, so do not risk your money in Solana coin, there are many other promising currencies on the market.",

But the only problem is knowing when to enter, but for now, SOL will be more doubted by many people as a long term asset; much better if you'd go for main tokens of this industry. However, if Op is into short term investments, there are indeed better options as EGLD, GRT and such or basically altcoins which has somehow of a good reputation especially at this moment wherein what happened is still fresh and people still are buying it. Initiate an anjustment with your plans on this one. But if you are really that eager and you trust Solana that much, you're free to do so. SOL was indeed a good token.",

SOL is a pumped token, so many NFTs created on SOL making the demand for SOL's utility but because of its affiliation to FTX, we may not see it goes back up. this you can related to SOL being on steroid. it may have a high value for now ($13.80) but it could dive still.a lot of speculators bought SOL at $30 because they taught its the gonna go up already. so while nothing yet is happening like updates from teams roadmap or BTC bullrun. better just hold your stablecoins.",

SOL looks a very bad choice for now as it's strongly affiliate with SBF as CEO from FTX which has been collapse a few days ago. Buying sol just like you were giving your money to the him. So many ventures capital will be securing their positions through dumping their SOL. You must be careful with it. I personally will always try to avoid to buy this garbage coin. The blockchain of solana is also a garbage centralized blockchain. Quote from: Famous Grouse on November 11, 2022, 12:18:01 PMIs it a good buy or heading in the same direction as LUNAIt's heading to the same directyion as LUNA.

We can advise you whether to buy or not, but you should also do further research on the Solana project. And if you find something that can convince you that the Solana project is a good one, you can start buying it and holding onto it. Otherwise, you can leave it and find another even better project. But remember to invest in bitcoin because we already know how bitcoin is capable so far. Investing in bitcoin is the main investment we must have in addition to investing in altcoins.",

For the different reasons then LUNA but still. Sam was one of the main backers for it and god knows how much there's still to be dumped by FTX or did they already dump everything. And the fact that solana network has been stopped several times doesn't really rise the overall confidence as a unstoppable permissionless platform.And what it comes to reputation, i think that FTX managed stain it and for a while i won't touch most of the altcoins that were endorsed by Sam.

Yeah FTX was not the only investors of solana but FTX gave so many impact to the solana. it can be said that solana was having a very high risk to be considered as investment. People who aiming to buy solana at the bottom must also think again about that, solana itself was having so much bugs and it can go offline anytime. SBF was facing a horrible situation and that would be so hard for solana as well. Think before you wanna buy it",

We have been reading reports that there are very frequent errors in the Solana network. If you do a little google search, you can read a lot of news on the subject. Also a major problem is that FTX has huge amounts of SOL. They may be selling SOL to meet withdrawal requests. It won't suffer the same fate as FTT because we're talking about a big blockchain with products on it, but I think investing in this coin involves too much risk. If I wanted to invest in this coin, I would choose to risk with only a small portion of my money. I wish you good luck...",

But, we will not know the future, like what happen to Luna, it seems that Luna was really a big and strong project, but it could be collapsed very soon. So, every decision will give each risk, this will depend on how high the risks are. But here, you can manage your money much better in certain projects.
