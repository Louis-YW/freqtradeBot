The launch of a hybrid network accompanied by an Explorer capable of reading two simultaneous data sources, namely the EVM compatible and the Native network, at a remarkable speed of 50,000 TPS with a 2-second block-time, is a highly intricate task. It is worth noting that many well-known projects have attempted such a feat, but we are proud to be at the forefront of this pioneering effort. Our Explorer represents a new generation of Explorers, serving as the foundation for the Universal Block Explorer.As we progress on our journey, we anticipate the unique features of the Catena Blockchain to continue expanding the network's applications, unlocking new possibilities and opportunities.ðŸ’ TOGETHER WE GROWðŸ’ CATENA Explore:https://catenascan.com/Twitter:https://twitter.com/Catena_NetworkTelegram:https://t.me/CatenaOfficial",
