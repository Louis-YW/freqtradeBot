  "content": "Hi Bitcointalkers,Ive got a question, and this is based on a recent article/news I read online.. Bitcoinist.com to be precised.Here is a quote from the news article on the site...QuoteAround $70,000 was stolen using Beeple’s hacked Twitter account with a phishing link posted on his Twitter.For those of you who might not know who Beeple is... He is a popular NFT artist with over six hundred and seventy thousand followers on Twitter.Some weeks back, he's Twitter account was hacked and the hackers posted phishing links making it look like it's a legit tweet from Beeple himself. See quote below...QuoteThe link posted on Beeple’s hacked Twitter account directs users to a shady website and steals their funds. The link goes to a fake website that showcases collaboration with Louis Vuitton, an elite fashion brand.The tweet was staged, making people believe it’s Beeple: “Been working on this with LV for a long time behind the scenes. 1000 unique pieces… official raffle below”. The phishing link is also inserted into the tweet. QuoteSadly, many NFT collectors and fans of Beeple had no clue that the digital artist’s Twitter account was breached, and they were lured to the trap and ended up losing their funds. According to reports, the victims lost 35 ETH or roughly $70,000.Thank God the amount of money lost isn't much but In this kind of situation, who do we really blame? Is it the the celebrity who allowed his account to be hacked, thereby leading to his/her followers loosing their hard earned money  or do we blame the fans/followers(for their own loss) for trusting the celebrity too much and believing in every single thing he/she posted? This is a legitimate question, I actually pondered over this for about a week now before deciding to bring it here to know what you guys think.Below is a link to the full news -https://bitcoinist.com/phishing-hacks-beeples-twitter-account/",

When I saw about the scam in a week ago, I brought it up hereTargeted phishing scam nets $438K in crypto and NFTs from hacked Beeple accountI brought it up because for people to learn. This type of scam is very common, both celebrity and the followers are to be blamed. Anyone that knows about this kind of scam would have known it is a scam. But to be sincere, the celebrity got more to be blamed but will not suffer the loss which is the reason the followers needs to know how to avoid this kind of scam.",

Did the celebrity really want the account get hacked? I don't think so. Why not Twitter for allowing easy passwords, or for allowing the hackers try more than 1 password before locking the account?I find the followers already greedy unknowing sheeple, so I expect it was very easy to squeeze out their money.I think that the actual real blame would go on the lack of a good and effective education system, that would help people get smarter and think, that would allow people rise above the \"sheeple\" status.How about this? PS. Good luck on suing all the past and actual politicians in the world for this.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on May 31, 2022, 07:04:29 PMThis is a legitimate question, I actually pondered over this for about a week now before deciding to bring it here to know what you guys think.I don't find it such a good question.

If they blame themselves, they will save their money from the same mistake next time. It depends on how they think, they need to learn more or need to blame others.I personally don't think anyone did anything wrong, just entertainment in the middle of a bear market.",

All of them should get the blame but the hackers should have 50% of the blame, investing in Cryptocurrency is so risky that it's hard to know by just looking alone if the project is legit and true, you'll have to verify it from a trusted source and do an investigation it will not take you long to drop a like from forum like Bitcointalk to know if the offer is legit, people are so greedy to ask if the offer is good and legit, they are in a hurry to make a profit and trust the offer easily.",

That happens every single time when something is hot--it doesn't matter what it is.  All sorts of idiots get big, cartoon-style dollar signs in their eyes and hop on whatever bandwagon they think is going to lead them to their dreams of financial freedom and infinite free time for masturbation.  It happened all the times when bitcoin was on fire, when ICOs and DeFi were hot, and the flavor of the month now is NFTs.  Remember I said \"idiots\".  They're the ones who usually get scammed because they have no clue what they're doing.  Of course, anyone who's in the NFT space doesn't realize that the bandwagon is headed off a cliff, but that's another story.  They've all got blinders on, and it's all retarded to the max.",

But, When the question is Who is more responsible for the damage, It's The Fans. I understand that fans always trust their Idols. But, When it comes to money and life-changing decision. It would help if you didn't rely on their opinion. I follow Elon musk a lot. He loves Bitcoin and me too. But, He loves Doge as well, and I don't love it. You don't have to be like your Idol. Most successful people wake up in the early morning doesn't mean I have to follow them to be successful. I work remotely on my computer at night, and I sleep late, so I wake up late. People think I am Jobless stupid who always sleeps in the daytime. So, Don't follow Idols when it comes to money and life-changing decision. Don't trust, Verify.",
