Your DCA strategy will depend on the amount of money you are earning and the period of time you are given. If you earn weekly, you should DCA weekly. If you earn money, you should DCA monthly.The transaction fee is high right now, you can use lightning network.  Many exchanges are having lightning network and you can use it with a lightning network wallet.If the amount has grown, then send it to a noncustodial wallet.But you can use side chain instead. They are altcoins but they have low fee. Just until the time the network is not having high fee like this.",

What kind of mindset should I have to stay in Bitcoin? And I think Bitcoin is about to hit the highest price ever, so how should I plan my dca strategy?There's a reason Bitcoin is the safest asset to invest in, the crypto market is highly volatile, It's very difficult to predict the trend of these Altcoins and that's why the safety of your investment isn't guaranteed when you choose to invest in Altcoins. But investing in Bitcoin gives you more assurance because you know that even in the next 10, 20, 40 years to come, Bitcoin will still be there and reaching new heights, but Altcoins can't guarantee you such assurance.And regards to planning your DCA. You don't need to have any specific amount in mind to DCA, just put in a particular amount from your weekly, or monthly income, don't know how much your income is so I can't tell you how much to DCA. But just like saving in a piggy bank you can make your evaluation and then come up with a reasonable amount, but what's important is being consistent in whatever amount or percentage you choose.",

What kind of mindset should I have to stay in Bitcoin? What better mindset do you need than the current one? Since you are already aware that bitcoin is superior to other coins then maintain that idea and also keep in mind that 99% of altcoins out there are scams and if their price should fall they have a lesser chance of ever recovering back to their ATH and some might just disappear into oblivion but with bitcoin it’s not like that…",

Therefore, it is better to stick to Bitcoin, especially since you are not just betting on profit, but rather you are betting that the loss will be less than the loss in altcoins, and the profit will be reasonable.",

Having a mindset of investing only on Bitcoin is very hard to pull off if you are regularly checking altcoin price too which typically have more gains than Bitcoin on bull season.Just like being loyal to your partner or wife. Don’t look to other girl if you want to stay focus your main girl. Same with Bitcoin, stop looking on altcoins.",

Just like with bitcoin, it has it's own time to rise and drop at some point. But knowing bitcoin is the king of crypto, that fact guarantees that bitcoin is the most secured and profitable coin in the crypto market. Bitcoin gains the trust of the majority, so you should prove it to yourself as well.However, I would not advise you to stick with bitcoin but do your own diligence to research. That way, at least you will decide on your own based on what you have learned about bitcoin.",

While altcoins are just recommended for short term as most of them are for quick profits, wherein majority do not realize those quick profits. If you can analyze it smartly, then you will know that bitcoin makes a wise investment.If you decide to leave bitcoin, probably you saw some lapses that some of us are not aware. But frankly speaking, leaving bitcoin could make you regret your decision, as altcoins are not actually even worth keeping.",
