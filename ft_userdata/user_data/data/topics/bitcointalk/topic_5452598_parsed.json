  "content": "I wrote on this subject before in another post, but thought i would come back to this as i have an afternoon free and update the app.I just need to verify my figures here so could someone else comment on this.So the app has been updated and its now guessing keys much quicker and i will explain why.The app generates a private key, and associated public key, wif key and the address key. The address key is the key which is then compared to the file which contains address keys and balances.So here's the update, with a new bubblesort routine installed, and now with 5 million balance adddresses loaded in, the app can guess and compare approx 12 Billion comparisons a second.It achieves this by generating 1 private address and comparing against the 5 million addresses each time, so therefore, 10000 private addresses compared against 5 million addresses = 50 billion comparisons, it does this in just over 4000 ms, thats 4 seconds.Am i right, thats 50 billion in 4 seconds, so thats approx 12 billion or so in 1 sec?If thats correct, i wonder what the figure in comparisons is in 24 hrs?? Its too big to calculate?Also am i right in saying this number 9500000000000 is almost a trillion?Comments please?",

Why do you always think of the worst.Yeah it's better to think of the worth than just wasting previous time that could give you something tangible.There's are lots of things to learn about bitcoin or even use that time to keep reading interesting news here would as well fetch you good than wasting energy and time.All less you wanna intentionally stealing people's funds. Now my question is ; what if you tried and you succeeded would you leave you those funds or you empty that wallet? You see, with the effort you have put to make this coding will emanate you to steal another person's funds which isn't encouraging because stealing someone funds is bad and ill activities. If your heart earned money is being stolen from you by a random user will you be happy and worth would be your reaction and actions after finding your fellow stole your money or bitcoin? Don't do to person what you know if happened to you you won't be happy at all cost.",

It was once thought that crypto is not hackable, but unfortunately that is no longer the case. Its just like WPA on wifi networks 20 years ago, thought to be unbreakable, well it was, now we have WPA instead.",
