So it is only worth it if you have access to cheaper energy and if you have efficient ASIC miners.",

The next question is do you know how much money you need when mining and how those costs can be adjusted for beginners because using regular tools will not provide efficiency in the results obtained. Bitcoin is indeed a good asset and it is not only for miners because anyone can have bitcoin by buying it. So without mining we can still get bitcoin in a much easier way even though it also takes money to buy it.Mining is not easy to do and may not sound as simple as we see because it requires sufficient tools, be it mining machines, electricity or other needs and the cost of maintaining the machine is also not cheap so we need to make adjustments to these needs so that mining can run perfectly.",

There may be coins out there that are Proof-of-Work based and whose miners earn a greater revenue by mining those than by mining bitcoin. Their interest lies in your lack of knowledge.It's the one that all serious miners end up mining, because it never fades away, in contrast with the Proof-of-Work altcoins.",
