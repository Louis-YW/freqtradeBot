The altcoin market has been very active for over 7 years now, and yet no coin defeated Bitcoin, no matter what kind of features it offered that Bitcoin did not. So I fully agree with the op that at this point, it seems highly unlikely that an altcoin will beat Bitcoin. The crypto market seems clearly different from the dot com bubble, as some of the oldest coins still stand strong today, and Bitcoin is much further from being beaten by altcoins in 2024 than it was in 2017, if we look at market dominance percentage.",

Because the birth of Altcoin today was certainly inspired by the existence of bitcoin. So it is certain that imitations will not be able to beat the original originator or founder. Therefore, I believe bitcoin will always be number one in the crypto realm, because as we know bitcoin has a decentralized system, which of course cannot be imitated by any cryptocurrency. Because it is certain that the Altcoin that exists today was created by its creator for business purposes or to seek profit. However, unlike bitcoin, Satoshi as its creator until now no one knows where he is. In addition, Satoshi also does not seem to take any advantage from the creation of this bitcoin. That is why bitcoin is truly a truly decentralized crypto asset. This is what makes bitcoin difficult to imitate by other altcoins. Because in essence altcoins have creators who always take advantage. That is where the difference in security between bitcoin and Altcoin lies. Because bitcoin is impossible to take its liquidity by anyone, but Altcoin can be taken by its creator at any time and its price changes to zero. So the conclusion is like that, Altcoin will never be able to beat bitcoin.",

So it can be said that all these comparisons are coming from investors, especially bitcoin maximalists. This is fact, these project developers are just only thinking of making money, they don't actually bother about their coin or token usability. It's all about the money and that's why they continue to build blockchain where meme tokens can be built on, since the meme market is where they make the money.None like Bitcoin, they need  investors to push their coins and after all that then they'll have to provide returns for them, that means their main goal is always for profit and nothing much.Quote from: fuguebtc on October 30, 2024, 12:51:51 PMCorrect me if I'm wrong because it's been a long time since I've heard any altcoins dare to claim that they will replace or surpass bitcoin, and you're right, that's not the goal of altcoins.They know this is impossible and so have moved from saying the Bitcoin killer, to some altcoins or other meme coins killers like saying the Shiba Inu killers and the likes but all these are just overhype marketing strategies that do fail in the end.",

Do you know what it means and how long it will take for another coin to get to the current Bitcoin price? There's none that has ever come close to Bitcoin in terms of it value, the trust people have on it, the level of adoption it has witnessed And whatever simple index you can consider from a first look. None can outperform it in the future.If it's created by a known personality or an already existing institution, it's going to witness resistance by a lot of people that will stand against it. That Bitcoin has stayed this long and still remains relevant is a miracle earlier adopters never imagined would happen.A question you've got to ask is, should Bitcoin be created now after another coin has gained all the advantages Bitcoin has above all the coin that's currently in existence and that's coming up in the Future, would Bitcoin overcome those existing coin even if it has better technology that backs it up?If bitcoin fails or another coin comes up to take the place of Bitcoin, people will start looking at crypto as a ponzi scheme just like what they take meme coin as.",
