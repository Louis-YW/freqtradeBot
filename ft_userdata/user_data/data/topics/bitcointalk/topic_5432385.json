Good for you if you want to DCA, its pretty obvious thats not what i'm talking about.",

Combining many exchanges doing the same thing usually gives me strong confluence. The only thing i've found that counteracts my orderbook bias is either strong stock market moves and/or strong market buying/sellingObviously some are spoofing, but that doesnt mean they dont work. Human nature is easy to manipulate, so the same patterns happen again and again including effective spoofing or other whale strategies. Like i said, combining all the exchanges usually provides a clearer possibility. Right now more are bearish than bullish",

I also remember well that whenever we had a crossing between years and Bitcoin was in bear market , it always dropped in price at 12:00 and the next day as well so this might be just another situation like that. Meanwhile , take a break from Bitcoin and cryptos at least for 2 days and enjoy your time with your loved ones.",

We've already had record breaking increases in inflation, and obviously what comes with that is higher prices for everything, thus lower investment potential. People are struggling to clothe, and feed themselves let alone invest in Bitcoin which has shown the potential to swing from one extreme to another. That's the real reason; I don't think its whales looking to push the price down. It's simply because there's less buying power due to the fact that everyone is skint right now, and have higher priorities.",

I think this is confusing. When you said everything then you don't have anything left to spend later on but it's fine as long as you can HODL and don't sell at a loss. Your decision of doing a DCA by the time the price falls to 30k dollar is a good move because there are more dips that are being recorded after that. Imagine if you don't do a DCA but you just buy the normal way then maybe you are regretting now because you found out that the price didn't stop from falling yet.It's no surprise on why BTC is still bearish during these times, because BTC have been on this state even before. If whales dumped it even more then that's great.",

In December, we got chances to test $18k levels but from that we came back and keep trading around $16500 levels till today. At the end of year, bitcoin market trading 'stable' must be a good sign for rising; usually failing to break resistance levels and coming back to range bound alone will lead to further fall but keep trading stable definitely will lead to bounce back.All signs are leading us to have a stronger bulls in the first quarter of 2023. Probably, 2nd quarter could be another round of bearish to sideways market but we may not see below $20k at those times.",
