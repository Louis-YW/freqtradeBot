But I believe the impact will be more if crypto focused courses can be provided here instead of just focusing to bitcoin related courses. Blockchain could be an attractive addition to their curriculum as well where budding programmers will get education. Good education can have great impact on anything and education about cryptocurrencies is the need of the hour. Not only for the programmers but also for those people who are skeptical about the cryptocurrency, can also be benefitted here.",

But I must be honest with you, the topic seems exergerated. I have some concerns about the said academy;What will they teach in the academy? Will they teach the original purpose and concept of bitcoin. Or they will rather use it to promote their personal brand and in the end it will become an investment scheme. We have seen similar academies that didn't live upto expectations.  Who are the teachers or resource persons. It is better to allow someone learn something naturally than teaching the person wrong thing. It is easier to learn than to unlearn before learning. I said so because I learnt some nonsense from high profile people that claimed to be bitcoiners and when I discovered here, it took me time to unlearn those nonsense",

One such try is the educational academy in Brooklyn by Dorsey and Jay-Z. People who are new to the market will surely think of having a course. Maybe such people can get attention towards these academy. Satoshi found a way to eliminate the intermediary involved in the financial system, and now the same is being introduced in the form of providing education at a cost.",

It's not like there's a lot of people who want to learn about Bitcoin but can't - all the information is available on the Internet for free. thats why i imagine the only way a academy can even try to be successful is if the classes were about actual skills and knowledge that can be used to gain employment whereby passing the class had either atleast a guaranteed job interview with a sponsoring employer, or the certificate of completing the course had some meaning to it because it actually means people know enough to do a job in the sector. then people might be willing to take the class.a 'participation' medal is not as meaningful as a 'top of the class' in a skilled activity medal",

We have seen similar academies that didn't live upto expectations. Now, that's a bit advance claim, let them do it first before saying anything. Those who founded the academe knows a lot why their doing it, and they know how hype and negative things can affect someone business in crypto.Quote from: KingsDen on June 10, 2022, 10:50:19 PM Who are the teachers or resource persons.Check their website, they already have some list who have already names in the community. Like any other academy you cant just hire someone who doesnt have any firm knowledge on what the academe stand for and what are subjects need to teach. This is not just a blog written by an amateur writer who was paid to write words about how-tos and whatnot.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on June 10, 2022, 11:43:24 PMIn the grand scheme of things, it won't change much.

Com'on they just have their first step, why always get bitter for new things? Of course it needs lots of schools/academy to make it work, but when and how you will start? You cant just make lots of schools on your first attempt, you always need at least one to make it work.",

It may not even fill a one-year course for it, except maybe if you added lessons not only about Bitcoin but also about the basics of economics, finance, and stuff like that. Though in that case, it'd be more of a finance-centered course and Bitcoin would be like a subcourse included in it. It feels more like a series of seminars and talks rather than a class though. Might just be me. I'm hopeful they add about the coding and development of the backend part though.",
