I believe that there are many experienced people here who can maybe give me advice on what to do.So this is my story: Back in August when FIBA basketball world championship was about to start I wanted to place bets on it and I asked my partner to recommend me crypto betting platform since I trusted his choice (he's been in crypto world much more than me). He recommended Rollbit to me so I created my first account ever on the given platform (using my own device on which no rollbit accounts were created). For these 2-3 months, I've been grinding like crazy, placing hundreds of bets, reaching platinum rank while wagering around $1.2 million with just around $20-$30k money capital. In total, I lost more than I withdrew, so no suspicion of me abusing any bets. I only did sports betting (no casinos, slots, futures, etc.). Also, I very often deposited funds and then withdrew them after winning. I personally don't feel safe holding funds anywhere but my wallet. Additionally, testing the withdrawal system seems reasonable to me. Everything went smoothly and I felt 100% comfortable with the platform until yesterday when I tried to withdraw funds I got an error saying that my account had been restricted. I contacted support and they told me that they want me to do KYC as they have the right to request so. As that was completely fine, I immediately completed KYC process within 5 minutes tops (provided passport and took multiple pictures of my face from different angles). I tried to withdraw funds once again but I still got the same error message that my account is restricted. I contacted support once again and then they asked me to schedule a Google Meet video session with them as an additional KYC process. I was also fine with that and immediately scheduled the first available session they provided.Upon initiating the video call I was asked to say my name, log out, and log in to Rollbit account. Seems fair so far. Then they asked me to log in and show them my Metamask wallet. I started feeling uncomfortable sharing all the personal details not mentioned in ToS but without saying anything I showed them my wallet and the history of my transactions being sent to my Rollbit account. Additionally, the person on the call, who by the way didn't have a camera turned on nor real name displayed, started asking me questions about how do I get money transferred to Metamask. I have provided my boyfriend with my deposit addresses, as he was the one purchasing cryptocurrencies for me. I have ample proof of funds, with which I purchased those cryptocurrencies by making bank withdrawals in cash, and afterwards handing cash to my boyfriend, for which he bought me cryptocurrencies. I am able to provide a bank statement, as well as notarized documentation proving that my boyfriend and I have been sharing the household for 2 years already.The guy on the call seemed to be suspicious for some reason and asked me if my boyfriend has Rollbit account. I answered that I am not sure 100% but probably he does. Later on, I checked with my partner if he still has Rollbit account and he told me that he does but that account has been inactive for around two years and no deposits have been made since. He basically hasn't used it for 2 years apx and the account was bronze rank (500e deposited total).At the end of the Google Meet session when I asked about what other things are required in order to unlock my funds, the guy told me that they will probably need to KYC my boyfriend and that I would be informed in the next few hours by his colleagues. A few hours later I got the message that my account was permanently deleted and my funds erased because I ''circumvented their sportsbook limits by creating new accounts''. They didn't even allow me to withdraw $7k from the account before deleting it. I definitely did not breach the terms and conditions on my side. I never created another account on rollbit. This is the only account I ever created on my device and the only account I ever used. Regarding activities on my account, all the bets were made strictly by me.Before banning me, they provided 0 evidence of me creating a new account to increase bet limits. I didn't even have any limits on my account that I reached. I really was in no need of such a thing. All the bets I placed were on popular events (basketball, football, eSport majors, etc.).They are probably assuming that my boyfriend created another account which is obviously not the case and I can prove it too. He used his own device back then. His account was not suspended in the first place and he can still place bets there if he wishes to. Secondly, our accounts were never active at the same time in the past 2-3 months since I created the account. How did I ''circumvent their sportsbook limits by creating new accounts''?There were no head-ups, no warnings about anything. Honestly, until they permanently banned me I didn't even know what was the reason for suspicion. When I found out and tried explaining the situation to them they stopped responding to me. I have a friend who managed to unlock multiple accounts on various platforms and he told me that if I am able to send them a demand letter I win the case 100%. But the issue is, they are registered in Curacao and I am not able to sue them. Sorry for the long post but I wanted to explain the whole situation and I really appreciate it if anyone could give me advice on what to do. $7k is not a small amount of money.",

We share the household which I can prove in notarized documentation. My issue here is Rollbit not wanting to have a conversation with me here. They just banned the account saying I abused Sportsbook by creating a new account. They are unwilling to respond. My boyfriend's account wagered $1k max in comparison to my $1.2mm.

Of course, after Curacao as a national licensing authority lost it's reputation due to overselling of sub-licenses to irresponsible parties, it's not so common to see a casino interested in a master license. If a casino has a proper legal standing they will apply for a localized license on countries they want to operate under their own frameworks. Curacao is kind of known of being a. Easy solution to aquire a trick license that does close to nothing for player security and oversight due to how they handle sub-licensing.",

There might also be a delay in the process of reviewing your documentation and information. Don't lose hope, and continue communicating with them professionally and proactively. I also understand your preference to keep your funds in your own wallet; it's a common practice for many to maintain control and security over their assets",

Do you happen to know if they are indeed under CEG jurisdiction? When I try to search register and put rollbit.com URL it says ''Unlicensed'' (see screenshot).https://talkimg.com/image/Rq1HNYes, they are. LicenseGLH-OCCHKTW0702112020Bull Gaming N.VNo, they are not. Rollbit is under Gaming-Curacao, GC, https://talkimg.com/images/2023/10/20/T2CJ5.png not Curacao-eGaming, CEG, https://talkimg.com/images/2023/10/20/T2Qpz.png, as OP has nicely educate herself, it's made clear by the seal of validation below their page.Quote from: alani123 on October 19, 2023, 10:46:22 PMHonestly don't expect much from Curacao. It's a country that will issue licenses to anyone, end even then some casinos don't opt for the full license and instead sub-license under entities that sell their license multiple times. From the looks of it Rollbit looks to be doing the latter.In my opinion would be to start a flag against their profile and link to this thread. Then post the link to your flag here and anyone who reviews the evidence can choose to support it or not. Read more on how to create a flag here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5160255.0Can you please help us by pointing out on how to get a full license? Because as far as I know, there are only two type of licenses by Curacao gambling authority, Master License and Sub-License. Master License holder has the power to issue Sub-License, and far as I know, Curacao gambling authority only issued four of Master License since... decades ago.OP, I'll try calling Razer here. Hopefully he can give more insight to this case by sharing the piece from his side. Meanwhile, do you mind holding the flag until everything become more clear?Sure, I don't mind of course. I am trying to reach Razer via email and rollbit chat but ever since he announced to me that my account has been deleted I am getting no response (https://talkimg.com/image/T2BoH).He has seen the messages, he was online multiple times but I don't see a willingness from them (Rollbit) to communicate with me. And that part hurts me the most. They haven't provided any evidence of ME abusing their sportsbook and I am willing to prove to them that I am the only one using my account - proof of funds (bank statement of withdrawing them from the bank, proof of my income, and where I get funds) as well as notarized document of me and partner living together and willing to make him do KYC too if necessary.",

OP opened new accounts to circumvent previously limited accounts.OP thought using another individual for the KYC would be acceptable, but it's ultimately still them controlling the account.However, I can see that the account was locked with balance and in this scenario I don't think the abuse warrants removal of funds (there's no losses to recoup).Your account should be unlocked and we request that you withdraw the remaining balance as soon as possible. Once done we'll lock the account again.Thanks,Razer",
