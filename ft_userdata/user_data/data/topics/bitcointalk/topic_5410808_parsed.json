I doubt that this kind of website can attract potential customer to sign up with there offer while there‚Äôs a lot of decent review casino such as gamblingbro and btcgosu that provides useful insights in the casino to come up with there ratings. I don‚Äôt understand too the main purpose of this website if whether just a directory or a review site because the star rating seems like just put there for aesthetics purposes only and not by review score by the OP because there‚Äôs some casino in there list that doesn‚Äôt deserve 5 star. I just don‚Äôt want to mention the name.",

Probably another affiliate site to promote here which I think is not good.Our lovely Binance Coin on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is getting used to invest into BSC meme tokens, also called shitcoins. The idea was to have a directory of casinos that accepts BNB on the Binance Smart Chain to make it easier for investors to play without exchanging their tokens back to more used Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin etc.. There aren't that many casinos that accept BNB on BSC but we will keep our site updated",

It probably won't be much revenue if you focus on one network.

But OP didn't do the basics, there're more crypto casinos that accept BNB and BSC chain, and I am not as professional as they should be! I am not sure is this is just a \"bad try\" or OP did his best to spam around for some quick referrals, but I doubt he will find many players here! As always, one of the cons when choosing to start from reputable casinos from this forum is that most of us are already registered in these casinos, with some VIP levels, why would we change that? For more attention OP needs to get serious! There're new players on this forum for sure, but they will not follow anything if reputable members find too many flaws from the start!",
