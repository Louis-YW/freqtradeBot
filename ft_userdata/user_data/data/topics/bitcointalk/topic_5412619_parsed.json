What new people don't seem to get is that most of the top coins were considered as low caps even when they were top 10 back in time. Although markets could jump very high from here, people who don't have lots of money wouldn't benefit from them too much. As you said they won't be rising a lot.If i had under $1000 budget, i would definitely hunt microcaps. Because all you need is one of them to succeed to make more money in month then years with high caps. Then again change to get rugged is way higher.",

But when it comes to investing in order to quickly increase your deposit, you should definitely look at young projects, which have not yet grown as much as projects that have already established themselves. A beginner and an investor with a small deposit will choose to invest in new projects, a large investor will look towards old and already grown projects, because different asset classes have different risks.",

People who invested in these projects at an early stage or during presale were the ones who benefited from the project's pump. If you truly want such a large profit, you must be willing to take a high risk by investing at the earliest stage of the project, but do your own research before investing.",

The problem is that no investor that wants to venture into lost, that's why many investors always be careful of any investment they are about to embark on. Solona is a good project starting from when it's was launched and the investors who notice that have also invested on it.",

I’d rather hold more of those old stuffs than to risk on a new projects that can’t even last a year in this market. Finding the next 100x is not easy, there’s no assurance for this especially on a new project. I suggest to stay active in the market go to other platforms to see good projects but don’t go all in, there’s still a risk on that so be careful because you might looking to a project that didn’t exist at all. Focus on what’s on the market for now, it’s more worth it.",

I agree that in the past most of the top old projects will be replaced over time as better projects will be created. This will become more obvious as each bear season passes, many projects have not been able to return to their original prices and new projects will take their place.But finding and investing in new projects during the bear season is also very risky, older projects that already have a community and history of development are also very difficult to survive during bear season, which will be even more difficult for new projects. It is challenging to raise capital to develop projects during the bear season, so investing in new projects is also a risk.",

These top 3 coins I am sure no new project can replace. This has been proven in the past",

I am also finding out this kind of coins or tokens in the previous bullrn. Well, only very few coins on the top market cap that can really be back to the previous ATH, but mostly they ar enot be able to. Like what we are seeing on some good projects at that time like NEO,LTC, ADA, XRP and others. This may be what happened. ANd the question is what projects the next? I am curious about this.However, as long as I bought those coins or tokens underrate, I ma still wilng to hold them in my wallet for the next bullrun, although this will not rise up vey high again. AT least,enough to get the price up and take some profits.",

And the answer is no, if you were to give 100 dollars to 100 people and tell them to invest in a good small cap coin most of them will invest in scams or shitcoins, so when that is the case I think there is a good argument to be made that the majority of people should instead stick to the coins with high market caps.",
