In contrast, inflation erodes the value of traditional fiat currencies over time, reducing their purchasing power. However, the correlation between Bitcoin and inflation is intricate and can be influenced by market volatility, and the effectiveness of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is a topic of discussion among specialists.",

Definitely not because of \"soft landing\"1970-1980 was very similar. Thats how asset prices (SPX) reacted to inflation back then.in 1970 we had first inflation peak (market hit bottom 2 months later)in 1972 we had inflation short term bottom (market reach new ATH 3 months later)in 1974 we had new CPI peak above 12% (market created new low eacly in the month of CPI peak)Than, >1975 market just stop gamble inflation data and ignored next inflation peak but pumped like crazy as it was going back down.Exactly the same we have now. Inflation is going up, assets are going down, people predict the worst-case scenarios. Inflation goes down, assets pump people wait for FED pivot not buying the bottom. Inflation reach short term bottom, FED do pivot, retail buy the local top. Inflation goes up, assets goes down, retails are broke.",

That is, the growth from 15k to 25k that we are now seeing can be called institutional, as in the second half of 2020.That's by far not expected unexpected. Institutions have more likely (and bigger amounts too) liquidity saved to buying at bottom whatever they can (usually competitors, but Bitcoin is also very appealing at this price).Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on February 17, 2023, 07:50:24 AMInflation is slowing down because we are in recession and due to bull whip effect. Definitely not because of \"soft landing\"My economics background is not strong enough to check this. Whether the recession is avoided (again: for now) or we're in deep sh#t and they're covering it, I don't know and I guess that there are (oh, so) many in this situation (of not knowing the difference).Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on February 17, 2023, 07:50:24 AMExactly the same we have now.

And what you think Bitcoin price will do in this equation? Will it follow the other assets and will go down again big time?Edit: fixed typo",

Between 2010 and 2020 there was hardly any CPI growth in Europe while the banks were printing. Where did much of that money go: into assets, especially real estate, bitcoin and others. Now the working classes are feeling the effects of the printing, and of other causes, such as the increase in the cost of energy, but before this period they were like the frog that is being slowly cooked and does not realise it, because whoever wanted to buy a house in 2019 cost them much more economic effort, counting in terms of net annual salaries than their parents' generation, and that is when interest rates were much lower in 2019 than in the 80s and 90s.",

Will it follow the other assets and will go down again big time?Not every asset acted the same. So far everyone is looking at inflation, interest rates and sp500/nasdaq as next bitcoin move indicator so I used SP500 in above post. But interesting thing happened to gold during \"The Great Inflation\" 1965–1982. In 1971 Richard Nixon depeg USD from gold and gold had the biggest pump ever. From 35$ to 900$ in a decade (while stocks were going sideways). If the same would happened again and bitcoin would fallow gold we could see a pump to 1 mln $ (x30 from now). But to be honest i don't think its the most likely scenario. More likely one is that we will be stuck for a decade in 20-60k consolidation. Something in between seams to be the most likely one.In short term I expect everything to be bullish until inflation hit short term bottom (next few months). Somewhere around CPI=2-4%. Is 2-4% possible? In my opinion it is. And inflation bottom (before new wave to new inflation ATH) should be around JUN and market high in APR/JUN. \"sell in May and go away\" should be a good strategy this year.https://www.statista.com/statistics/216037/monthly-percentage-of-change-in-the-cpi-u-in-the-us/Annual inflation is close to sum of all candles. So we can see that each next month big candle goes away and new small one comes in. So to see official CPI increase in next months we need to have >.6% M/M change in FEB. >.8% in next month etc. So its likely to see an official CPI going down for at least next 3 months. 1 month flat and 2 more months down (if we will not see covid 2.0, nuclear war etc.).",

Before they launch something, they try to test market reactions with fud and they will vaguely talk about their probable plans for near future. They did it before increasing interest rate and they're testing market reactions again before they decrease interest rate.
