This is bad, considering the amount of money in my country is enough to build a house.History:- His friends share the winnings from slot to him- He is interested an trying to play- He's being addicted- Lose and owe to his friends and bank to play more but so sad he is loss again till his owe hitting $9000- Hard to pay his owe, he finally ran away and now his family need to pay all of his debts.- AFAIK, his family wants to sells their land to pay off the gambler's debt.So, careful with your slot activity. make sure you are staying away from any loan just for slots. Actually, this case not from gambling sites just playing android games named \"Higgs Domino\"",

I was one addicted to slot, losing big money every night, but there were times that I will also win big. But in the end, the numbers is not going to lie.Extreme control is really needed because once you are hook up to your favorite game, there is no looking back until you lost everything and in debt.",

Honestly once the \"ask for loans\" phase started, the victims' family or friends should've honestly persuaded the said person from continuing the gambling, especially in this case where the debt went up to $9000. Pretty sure $9k is a pretty big amount in any country, I'm kinda dumbfounded how it never actually hit the person in question about his loan going up to $9k. Even going to idk, $1k or $2k is enough to wake me up and stop gambling even if temporary just to pay the debt. Not to mention it's an android app it seems? Read a few reviews and it doesn't seem to be anything good. Idk why this was even recommended as a place to play slots even.",

It is so sad his family will have to pay with their house making which might push to them to the streets if the have no where else to turn to after clearing the debt",

      "body": "Actually this case is often heard around me and in general there are many cases like this.There was once a friend who borrowed money from me with the aim of gambling but I firmly would not give a loan to gamble, but this would become a problem later and it would be difficult to return it, and in the end my friend borrowed the money from someone else and spent it that $2000 loan is more or less and it's still not repaid, so it's ironic to hear this story is almost the same as those around me.After all, this is the most fatal thing to borrow just to gamble, of course this will all lose and become an uncontrollable emotion.That's why I often control myself to avoid the things that happened with this story.",

Yes luck plays a vital role in gambling but I wonder why gamblers are not always having that luck whenever they engage in the game that means luck is not for gamblers.I think his friends made no mistake in sharing their winnings with him or even asking him to try he would have declined the offer not to try because he was not forced to try but greed made him to play and he has ended up being an afficted gambler.",

The problem here is your friend being greedy and not the slot game because he can avoid losing if he properly manage his bankroll and also the other guy that encouraged him to play slot should be part of the blame too because he start all this things. He manipulate your friend to copy him by using his personal experience to seduce your friend.Rehab is what your friend needs.

That's very tricky. Still his neighbor is hooked and eventually sends money to the app. Some internet users are really this naive to purchase things within the app. You can actually skip these since they act like an adverts while you play the slot. His neighbor however is just too hooked to it. My kid was once hooked to games that I have to put my paypal account in iPad for purchasing addition features to the games.",

Sure, they would win big money, but most times they would come out of the casinos empty-handed. This went on for a couple of years until they got into debt.Such stories remind us that you should never gamble with borrowed money because it is likely to end badly.",
