  "content": "QuoteIn true Valentine’s Day fashion, we’re diving into the theme of love…and crypto?According to a new study by Binance, the world’s largest blockchain by trading volume, crypto could have a positive impact on one’s attractiveness. Yes, really.Approximately 83% of participants said liking crypto was an “attractive feature in a relationship,” while 70% said they would be more inclined to go on a date with someone if they found out they were interested in crypto.But only about 38% of those surveyed said their partner was equally as interested and passionate about crypto as they were, while 27% patted themselves on the back for introducing their significant other to the wild, wild world of web3.This growing positive sentiment is in stark contrast to the overall gloomy market outlook; many cryptocurrencies are still down significantly year over year. But as some major cryptocurrencies have had a recent small bull run, like Bitcoin and Ether, up about 30% and 23% year to date, respectively, there is some newfound hope from market players across the industry.And that confidence might be translating into Valentine’s Day gifts, too, according to the report. About 83% of respondents said they would prefer a “crypto gift card” over flowers or chocolate for the holiday.In the U.S., Americans are planning to spend $25.9 billion on Valentine’s Day this year, up about 8% from $23.9 billion last year, according to a survey from the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics.“Valentine’s Day is a special occasion to shop for the people we care most about,” Matthew Shay, NRF president and CEO, said in a statement. “This year, as consumers embrace spending on friends and loved ones, retailers are ready to help customers celebrate Valentine’s Day with memorable gifts at affordable prices.”Based on the Binance report, those memorable gifts include buying crypto, too.Of course, take these results with a big scoop of salt. The global survey, which was conducted earlier this month on Binance’s survey platform, had 2,600 respondents (both Binance users and non-users) ranging from 18 to 46 years old.While that number doesn’t fully encompass the billions of people worldwide, it might be pointing toward an attitude shift for those looking to find love — or love those involved — in the crypto space.https://www.yahoo.com/news/crypto-makes-more-attractive-according-090016955.html....Accurate statistic?QuoteAnd that confidence might be translating into Valentine’s Day gifts, too, according to the report. About 83% of respondents said they would prefer a “crypto gift card” over flowers or chocolate for the holiday.Could being involved with crypto boost a person's sex appeal on the dating scene by lets say 5%? Maybe even 10%? Possibly more than 10%? It would all depend on how many DOGE they had stashed?While I was disappointed when I realized the best relationship advice many women received from their parents was to \"marry a rich man\". I can recognize the motives behind it and not fault the logic.When I worked in a grocery store there was this old elderly couple who would regularly shop. One day out of nowhere the old woman blurted out: \"never marry a handsome man, marry a rich man instead\" while she paid her bill at the checkout line. Her husband stood right next to her, seemingly powerless to do or say anything. I felt so embarrassed for him. But I guess that is real life.",

There are also times when they prefer groceries or things that they can use or food rather than flowers. Though it still depends, there are still women who prefer the sign of love, like flowers, as it shows love. But yes, it was different than before since I noticed people are getting practical as flowers are very expensive to buy, so they should be bought for something else.",

People that are into crypto are seen more like gamblers than a hotshot Wall Street brokers (that they might think they are) so I don't think that it would help you much attracting quality man/woman.

Somehow I doubt that anything close to 83% of the women would think that crypto was “attractive feature in a relationship,”.

Crypto doesn't make one attractive in my own country, rather i'd say individuals who do 9-5 jobs are seen as being more attractive, they might not be making adequate funds, but people view that group as being more financially responsible than someone who is into cryptocurrencies.",

Many people say that money can't buy happiness, it can be said that was only true in the past, and it is no longer true compared to now, without money no girl will accept you. Like the survey, cryptocurrency makes us more attractive simply because people know the returns it brings to those who invest in it. Girls or boys are looking in your pocket to choose a lover.",

As for involvement in cryptocurrency boosting sexual appeal and attractiveness, I will say it depends on what the person who is picking up the appeal or attraction is attracted to, If the person is drawn an attracted to people with knowledge and seen as intelligent, then they will be attracted to you, but if the person's attraction is strictly based on looks and you are not blessed with that, just forget about your cryptocurrency knowledge.",
