  "content": "Rare satoshis are not NFT’s or ORDINALS.  Ordinal software is used to identify and group them into a UTXO that can be collected and traded.  Here are some links where you can learn more about the history and get started. (all legit sites, you can do your own due diligence to verify them):https://ordinals-1.gitbook.io/ordinals-guide          (has all the old school info from the beginning.  Has great info about SPARROW software where you can find and create UTXO of rare sats you own without using a service)https://www.raresatsociety.com/         (the original sat hunter and inscription service.  Pretty much a dead site, but rare sat society was the beginning of collectors and has some good info to research)https://www.ord.io/                 (here you can search sat names, numbers, and even find wallets that are holding rare sats. You can find sats that haven’t even been mined yet  )https://magisat.io/             (great place to buy and sell rare sats, you can also separate rare sats into UTXO yourself for a fee)https://sating.io/                (search your wallets to see if you are holding any)https://ordiscan.com/https://magiceden.us/ordinals/discover-raresats       (magiceden you can trade and buy, search your wallets, but their site needs work, magisat is more functional)XVERSE wallet is nice too.  They have a section just to see if you have rare sats.  If you trust Xverse wallet then you do not have to enter your public wallet address anywhere, but don’t be paranoid about your public wallet.Oh and Block 9 450x are the BEST!!!",

Although after reading the website (including PDF on mentioned Google Drive) shows you still need to copy the output manually to ordinals.com/output/YOUR_OUTPUT.",
