Our chain has a lower gas fee and TPS higher than Ethereum POW, we are also faster, and the block time is 10 seconds or less. We just finished NFT marketplace, also we soon will finish encrypted smart contracts. The idea is to verified sellers can sell their own intellectual properties through smart contracts, and buyers can be safe from fraud. Soon we will offer that system to big companies, like YouTube, Netflix, etc. The chained project with AVES is a banking system which we developing now with a speed 10k, and we plan to offer that to banks. The system is bulletproof, and cannot be hacked and we think that's is the real deal. Community support is very important to us. All money collected from ICO goes to the market listing. Our paycheck and all expensive finance my company payments. We have from this nothing (I know seems crazy, but it's true).",

So many newer coins are coming out in the pennies but for some reason you think this coin will be $2 to $3.  There are so many ETH blockchains with the prices in the pennies.Quote3.

Ico is planned for 2 months because we need a significant amount of money to get quality market exchanges, also there is no quick money anywhere, it will be suspicious if is ICO very short time(I did not want some shady exchange for a few k dollars and the risk of project failure)Pre-mining is fine to have reserves so you can pay for things in the future when the price of the coin goes up. Having an ICO where you charge $2 a coin is very suspicious. To many new coins run a ICO and run after a week or so.Quote6.

It was created on 2022-10-31T12:22:04Z according to https://www.whois.com/whois/avescoin.io. Why are you telling people it's 11 years old?I did some digging into marant.hr. There was a so so website back in 2017 and the current site was done in 2020. I looked through marant.hr and no mention of avescoin. Why is that?

You hype up the coins, sell during ICO, open to miners after ICO and dump the coins.I really I not know what is not clear, sir.  My company web page seems you are not looking at all because there you have the link blockchain and under that is the main page of AVES.The domain for my company is registered first time 11 years ago (before that it was another name) https://whois.domaintools.com/marant.hrWe are in the EU and there are laws for crypto already regulated, so I'm a little tired of anonymous people who want to take us down.So tell me what kind of logic is that when you report your company for the project to the government and after that ruin our own project?If a may speak freely, mate seems you are the same person who try to bring down our testing pool and chain, and also the same person who came on discord to spread lies.Honestly, I think you have some kind of problem. So if you have a lot of free time for writing on social media I will gladly take you in our crew, you can see all for self also you can do something good instead of spitting on our hard work. If you did not want to volunteer with us I asked politely to not write nonsense because I will not answer you anymoreRegardsP.S. price is calculated on market needs and quality of the project, if you really read our pages then you see, that we developing a banking system project Warden, developing a web3 email system, also we are first in encrypted NFTs, for selling intellectual rights. Also, this is not some shitcoin for a price of 0.00000001 dollars or less. Satoshi had pre-mined coins, no one talking about that, Ethereum had pre-mined coins, no one talking about that. We are here building something for the community, to make a better life for all and you come to spit and troll? Shame on you sir . Our conversation is over. I wish you much luck in life",
