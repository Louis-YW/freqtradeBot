      "body": "Here is what I usually suggest:1. Make a list of things you spend money and your earning last month from all possible sources. This should give you an idea of monthlies and then you can decide which ones you can cut down on. 2. Spending a thousand bucks on food order-in more than 10times per month is a waste as compared to a humble 2times per month with family cooking the rest of the month. 3. Taking the commute in public transport than a Uber surely saves 10x of your money per day.4. Keeping a single sim card for all sorts of stuff can half your mobile topup spending then double sim card that people commonly use.5. Cutting down on entertainment costs can lead to a dull life but as a student you might get that to your advantage - this includes paid TV services and all that. You can always use torrents for any show that you might want to watch when trying to wind down.Remember that spending of money is always by channeling the seven sins of humans. Control them and you can save a lot. Try this yourself and see how much you can work it out.",

Iphone is not necessary a similar device can be bought for $200 Android too so that $800 can be saved.Make a monthly budget according to your income and only allocate 70% of it for spending no matter what, the remaining 30% should be going for your savings and once there is enough amount in that then it should be invested, and that investment will give you passive income and that is how you can increase your standard of life step by step.",

Sometimes, our environment contributes to our level of saving and spending, so if we feel that our environment is not conducive to saving, then we can change the environment.Furthermore, inflation contributes to our limit savings since we can only save a percentage of our earnings after removing our money for daily expenses and needs, but due to inflation, the cost of leaving is now high and mostly our earnings are still the same. If that is possible, then we cannot save because the money might not even be enough to take care of our basic needs.But saving in Bitcoin has now become easier since if you want to save in Bitcoin with some percentage of your salary or earnings, you can use the DCA method to keep saving.",

For example, now you get $100. Well, I'm sure there will be urgent needs that will arise in the next day or two. However, with $100 dollars this can be covered, although not all of it and if you remember you can use at least 10% as a precaution.That is life. So, just relax and enjoy and be grateful and regarding these tips for management, I think @TheUltraElite is very close to being implemented.",

There are so many things that tempt us to spend, unexpected bills that pop up, and it can be hard to make ends meet. The bills in life will not appear by themselves to anyone (including yourself), unless you yourself make the bills appear in your life. Examples include TV, electricity, water and trash bills, if you don't use TV, electricity, water and there is no trash in your house. Then the bills for all those things will not appear in your life or in the life of anyone who doesn't use them, so all the bills that appear are due to ourselves, not other people.QuoteHow do you manage to save in a world that encourages spending?

Actually, the very simple tip for saving is quite simple, you or anyone else just try to use less money than the amount of money you can earn each month or each week. Because the rest is for your own savings and you can try to do this through your level of consumption of money which is usually only used for daily needs, not lavishly on unimportant things.",

Of course you can't buy a Lamborghini and try it. I'm talking about food mostly. I'm talking about the things you can afford to buy. Thus most things will stop being tempting for you. They are tempting now because you've never tried them before. That's how I manage this problem. Most things don't look attractive to me, I don't want to buy them. If you follow my advice, it will not solve all your problems, but at least you'll feel better in the food department.",

It's true, it's not easy to save money when our source of income is small and if the expenses required are large then in that condition there is no way to make a savings portion.Quote from: bitnote on October 15, 2023, 07:11:18 AMHow do you manage to save in a world that encourages spending? Let's talk about it. Share your ideas, tips, and stories about saving money, and together, we can figure out how to get better at it. (We will also draw valuable lessons from the mistakes and experiences of others.) Different cases must be handled differently. I mean the condition you are talking about is more about the level of waste where you are not able to spend money according to your needs. The solution depends on how someone can be responsible with their finances and if they don't have good management in managing them, it will be difficult for anyone to get away with wasting money when they spend something they don't need. Usually I will give a portion so that I can determine the amount of savings for the child's future and give my wife full rights to monthly money to solve the kitchen problem for food. I will use the remaining 25% for investments and the remaining 25% for unexpected cash preparations if something is needed.It is difficult for men to manage finances so it is a good idea for the wife to be involved in this situation, even though we do not give her full access as the holder of financial mandates. Learning to live frugally must definitely involve women and if we do it ourselves I'm sure it won't work. The level of financial waste of men and women is very different and women are much more frugal while being able to maintain a level of stability in dealing with financial problems, that's why I think their involvement is quite important in the household.",

However, don't rely solely on saving, because it won't be enough to secure your retirement, especially as inflation can erode the value of your savings. My suggestion is to learn how to make your money grow. So, if you're currently working, consider finding ways to earn extra income, especially through business ventures. Yes, business is the key to financial freedom in the future, allowing your money to work for you.I know it's not an easy process; we're only human, and temptation is always around the corner. It takes a lot of discipline and sacrifice to save, but as you learn that, you're also preparing yourself to become more mature and capable of taking calculated risks when starting a business.Just ponder on this: who are the richest people in the world? Aren't they involved in business or entrepreneurs themselves? If your answer is 'yes,' then you should follow in their footsteps. It's not about copying their exact business but pursuing what you're passionate about, where you can channel your energy and enthusiasm.",

If I planned to buy one thing with a fixed salary then it is not a problem for me, but still, expenses don't go exactly as we have thought to spend them. And that's the universal rule that we cannot break. But we can reduce the spending on unnecessary things and can save money on them. Like the following tips will help you to reduce your expenses and increase your savings.Try to buy groceries of the house in bulk, instead of buying daily in small amounts because by buying in bulk, we can also get discountsIf you have a space to grow some vegetables, then grow them, it will save you some amountIf you have 10$ in your pockets and you are not hungry but you are passing by a shop and start to get a thought of buying something, then suppress that thought, because you are not hungry.Buy clothes on sale, not only clothes instead all of the basic wearables. Don't buy things that you need to show off like the iPhone 15, because those who don't need it, are also buying it. You can save a huge amount if you would be able to follow this. I don't know the Electricity cost in your place, but I try to save a lot here, and it saves me some money too.",
