  "content": "Hey guys,What do you think, if you are versed in the field, is/are the best jurisdictions for incorporating and/or hosting a new full-fledged crypto exchange (CEX) today?There will be no service to the USA and the exchange plans on being as legit and compliant with AML/KYC and other relevant regulations as possible. Privacy of the shareholders is a major topic.The countries of incorporation and hosting do not need to be the same. Seychelles and Cayman Islands immediately pop up into my mind but I hear good things about UAE as well. What about Singapore? Is it still a good option?Does the hosting jurisdiction actually matter? If yes, how important of a factor is the network latency, if the chosen hosting location is relatively remote, such as the UAE or Asia?Thank you for your input.",
