I wanna be part of a crypto company and use my experience in the past in terms of a CS position. If none, good luck in finding people to fill that position.",

What you have done shows that you too do not have confidence in your organisation otherwise you could have mentioned the name of your organisation and possibly drop the be website for review as the case maybe. Only then you can get the attention and possible recommendations you deserve but as for this you have done, I think you have tried your best and let the other processes takes it course.",
