  "content": "Yes, those were the days when we all wanted to attempt mining just for the joy of it, with no idea that these currencies would ever be able to be sold.Fast forward a few years, and we have Proof-of-work rush in all different sorts of algorithms, all claiming to be the best of the best in security and mining.Joy.. were those days.. gone truly.. just one survived, and that is why it all began..bitcoinWe are all now stuck with Idiots on twitter who dictate crypto decisions for us, constantly supporting proof-of-stake and stingy pow coins with mining rewards paid in nickels.Decentralized, Proof-Of-Work, High paying in mining rewards.I ask for time to help me build in return for one final taste of the good old days.The name is Berylbit.info - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5423044.0",

Being an open-source platform for launching Decentralized apps, providing developers with scalable development opportunities, and providing a setting for business blockchain deployments. Berylbit aspires to be the top development ecosystem for all sorts of developers by providing simple tools and build environments. Not only are we creating using solidity, but we also hope to pave the way for other sorts of developers and builders in other programming languages. BRB is the native gas coin of Berylbit. It is inflationary, having an annual growth rate of 5.23%. The supply is continually burned on every transaction to reduce circulation; it is used to pay fees, defend the network by paying miners' gas expenses and in mining block rewards, and provides a primitive demand mechanism across the berylbit ecosystem.Total supply: 300million circulation supply: 300million + {6 coins Reward X block heights} - Uncle blocks = That number That number + {total uncle blocks mined X 1.75 rewards} - Burns per Txn = circulation supplyRough estimate right now circulation is  at 302,418,080 coinsSoon i will have API calls from the explore to auto calac this and give us live dataThe Berylbit Consensus Protocol is (ETHASH) (Ethash does allow CPU, GPU, ASIC Mining. Although, it is smart to use ASIC for mining, but GPU offers better memory for ethash as it requires alot of memory, you may not be able to use your btc ASIC mining tools since bitcoin hash algo allows basic computing and ethash has some complex to it but.. I do not know what they use nowadays might just work )The Ethash mining algorithm is the algorithm that runs the mining on Berylbit. A high-quality algorithm that employs highly sophisticated computer techniques to provide maximum security. At the moment, Ethash outperforms alternative proof-of-work algorithms such as Scrypt, Dragger-Hashimoto, and SHA-256. I believe Ethash is undervalued..  Reward per block, Berylbit pays the most to miners than any other cryptocurrency.6 coins in rewards each mined block, plus gas fees paid on every transaction!uncle blocks mined get paid 1.75 coin rewards. How is mining for $ETHW $RVN $ETC $LTC treating you?Do you still benefit from the nickel?What about Centralized mining pools? A typical argument by the POS community which i will ignore. its EVM compatible, later on working on implementing some way to let different code languages be able to write smart contracts on the block. No I will not replace the EVM as that task alone is undertaking and costly.Wanna make berylbit the most rewarding PoW asset in crypto, having such huge numbers of miners the network will be decentralized, have developers use the network to build, and find people to help me develop ways for other languages to build on the network with or without replacing the EVMLINKS:Mining pool: https://ekapool.com/#berylbit/connectHow to mine: https://berylbit-labs.gitbook.io/product-docs/product-guides-1/node-and-mining-setupBlock explorer: https://explorer.berylbit.io/overviewChainlist mainnet info:  https://chainlist.org/chain/9012Twitter: https://twitter.com/brbberylbitTelegram: https://t.me/BerylBitDiscord: https://discord.gg/f8CNaWgp4Tsource code - https://github.com/berylbit-labs/go-ethereumdocs - https://berylbit-labs.gitbook.io/product-docs/Website: https://www.beryl-bit.com/Building on mainnet: https://app.gitbook.com/o/dZxFBOtdSx4Cig35WcMx/s/oza0V0OsCgHQ2CKZ1LEM/product-guides-1/buildingAPI data GETH Calls: https://berylbit-labs.gitbook.io/product-docs/product-guides-1/apiAdding berylbit on metamask Name: BerylBitRpc: https://mainnet.berylbit.ioChain ID: 9012Symbol: BRB block explorer: https://explorer.berylbit.io",
