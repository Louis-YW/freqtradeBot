In the US there are a lot of 'mailbox' stores or 'virtual office' places that will accept packages for you for a fee.Can't speak to other parts of the world.Also, depending on where you are and what services are available some shipping companies will allow you to ship to their local depo and pick it up from there, there is usually a cost associated with that too but it never leaves their control which is a plus. No matter what as far as I know those places will require you to have ID and show it. BUT the sender never knows your address.-Dave",

Like, the seller ships the items to the address provided by the parcel forwarding service and then the service ships the items to you. The seller won't know your actual address, but the service might charge you so extra fee for this.Alternatively, you can use a burner account to trade. The seller will not know that Crypto Library comes from Finland after dealing through your alt account.",

Or, as others have already suggested, you might also want a freight forwarder. Or you can also hire somebody who reships. Minerjones here might be able to do that. It might also be possible to have the goods shipped to a PO box. Or if all of the above is not possible, you might just want to ask permission from a friend or a workmate to have something shipped to their address.",

AFAIK, you need to provide your real name to the seller isn't? because you need to show your ID when you want to claim your package, so if the name on the package is different with the ID name, you might not allowed to claim it.Quote from: Darker45 on January 11, 2023, 02:12:49 AMyou might just want to ask permission from a friend or a workmate to have something shipped to their address.

If you have a friend that has a little bit high position on at least certain post company office, you can ask him to receive packet for you in that location without revealing your address or real name to the sender. You can also use package lockers, freight forwarder companies. There are some options, everything depends on your connections, post company and where your live.I want to highlight that doesn't matter whether it's crypto world or eBay or Amazon world, 99.9999% times you can feel safe with revealing your address. One thing to do here is to register a new account (it's not against the rules AFAIK) and make some deal with people. This way, no one will know that in reality the deal was done with Crypto Library.",

And I believe OP is not talking about any contraband. He/she is simply trying to hide his/her address from the shipping company.Anyway, I'm afraid there is really no way OP could completely avoid having his/her address known by any third party. If he/she uses a forwarding service, he/she still needs to provide his/her address to the forwarding service. The same is true if he/she uses an individual re-shipper. If he/she uses a PO box, he/she still needs to provide his/her personal information before being allowed to rent one. If he/she opts for the pick-up option instead of door-to-door delivery, he/she'd still be asked for a valid ID at the very least.",

Do you think there's a country where you're the only one who live in there? no, there's a lot citizens lived in various city and street.Even you're having high privacy concern, I don't think you're already perfect to hide your identity in this world, at least your government are know who you're since you need to create ID and other legal citizens stuff.",

For example, if he lives in Germany and does that kind of thing, there is a high chance that the postman he meets will be the one who delivers packages in that area for years and knows neighbors, who lives where and who is at home or at work at a certain moment. This situation would look very suspicious for the experienced postman and you know, if the parcel gets lost in Germany, it becomes the problem of postmen. Also, when another person receives the package, in most cases they either send email or leave yellow paper in the mailbox. This is another red light.But if he lives in the USA or in another country, he may probably succeed with that method. That's why he has to at least share a little information with us to get a better personalized answer.",
