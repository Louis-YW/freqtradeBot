      "body": "The last time I have read about this fake video app, it's just the same way as explained on the X post, in which they use the app to call their victim and present themselves to be who they want to be and communicate with the person's voice and face, which will appear so real and convincing, but the latest of the apps I have seen is that they will always be the ones to call the victim before the app can work properly.  This part about stealing crypto through their app, which contains conference videos, is not new, which is why we are always advised to keep in mind the kind of application we install and grant access to our gadgets, as we never can tell what risk they carry or what kind of harm they can do to our data.",

For installations targeting crypto space or bitcoin users, it's now a person race a be aware of how dangerous it is to install unknown applications even the well known should be done directly from the official websites.",

Guaranteed they get the guy or gal talking all excited about crypto which leads to a whole bag of worms probably discussing holdings and all this stuff, the threat actor is getting all the information that they are looking for and using all this information against them and once they have built enough trust they probably try to get them to show them their holdings or find out what exchange its on etc etc. Those little shits.",

      "body": "Ouch, that's concerning. To be honest, I haven't thought of the risk to cryptos from joining online meetings. I believe that it's much safer when companies use third-party highly reputable software for online meetings, so that nobody has to worry about it containing malware. I'm talking about Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet. Aside from being reputable, they all allow joining the meeting without downloading software, which is helpful if one is concerned about potential malware.",

      "body": "The scammers/hackers always find new ways to scam/hack.There's one problem here. The scammers are targeting job seekers. A person, who is seeking for a job probably doesn't have that much money/crypto. The second problem is the trojan virus. We live in the age of anti-virus programs. A trojan virus should be tracked and blocked by almost all anti-virus programs. The third problem is the lack of trust. Most people would use only the big and well known video conferencing software. I personally would never use a video conferencing software. I hate even using the camera on my laptop for video calls.I guess that I'm safe from becoming a victim of such scams.",
