I could go by myself but that's less fun, the flight is just 2 hours to Okinawa though. Whatever, I will watch it on TV. I think Japanese TV should broadcast some games here, at least the Japanese ones. And since my German team is in the same group I got lucky.Speaking of which, I think the German team has a hard group. Australia we can't beat, their roster is too deep with plenty of NBA power.We also have some NBA players such as Dennis Schröder, the Wagner brothers and ageing Daniel Theiss. Also some good Euroleague players that got 3rd place in last years Eurobasket. Unfortunately Maxi Kleber doesn't play because of his recent beef with Dennis Schröder and Isaiah Hartenstein also won't play, don't know why, maybe because he just married.Beating Japan (without Hachimura) should be possible but Finland will be another hard game. People expect the German team to win it but I am not so sure about that, with Lauri they have a big name and the rest of the team also has some solid talent.Getting out of the group would already be a success, everything else is extra for our German squad.",

About France, ok they have Gobert for defence and rebounds but who else? Batum is old, Fournier can shoot, but thats it's it, Ntilikina has no impact in the NBA yet. The rest are Euroleague players.I saw France yesterday against in their first test match against Montenegro and they didn't look impressive. Of course they just gathered and it's the first match but I am not impressed of what I saw.I would like to mention Slovenia, even though they lot their first test yesterday against a Giannis less Greece yesterday.Luka can make the difference against any team, so they can be a dark horse as well.",

Some countries are still unsure about their roster because players are not yet responding if they will play or not.

Players like Luka and the current number 1 pick, Victor Wembanyama, even said that the NBA is less physical compared to their leagues before. So, Brooks should not focus on his trash talk; instead, he should play hard and physical to live up to the expectations of the fans.The current lineup of Canada has some players who are superstars in the NBA. However, I'm looking at the team chemistry more than the individual players on the team. With that said, I stick with the more consistent teams, particularly Spain (despite less Gasol).",

We can read this interesting article below from their website. https://www.nba.com/news/usa-basketball-roster-2023-fiba-world-cupQuoteThe 2019 team had Harrison Barnes (2016 Olympics) and Mason Plumlee (2014 World Cup). And every other U.S. team comprised of NBA players also had at least two guys with Senior-Team experience. Even the first team of NBA players (1992 Dream Team) had five – Patrick Ewing (1984 Olympics), Michael Jordan (’84), Christian Laettner (1990 World Championship), Chris Mullin (’84) and David Robinson (1986 World Championship and 1988 Olympics) – who had played on the Senior level previously.Every member of the 2023 team will be playing in his first Senior-level international tournament. It’s different than anything else they’ve ever experienced, especially when it comes to the single-elimination, knockout round.However, despite that, they are still the number 1 favorite to win. I'm thinking, aren't the bookies just making them overvalued as they know the bettors will bite on the odds? When we talk about \"Team USA,\" it's a popular team and they have more gold compared to other teams. This popularity might influence the odds and make them seem more favorable than they actually are.",
