One option would be to, as the previous user said, brute force 140 bits, which is a waste of time unless you get extremely lucky.But if you have the corresponding public key, it should take a lot less than that, about 2 ^ 70 operations on average.This would be the software you'd use, or a similar one with some modifications:https://github.com/JeanLucPons/KangarooThat should be doable with a pretty big investment in renting GPUs and a small modification of existing programs to add stride. But if the address is an ancient one with hundreds or thousands of BTC, it would be worth it.With all that said, in case you bought this from some guy, it's most probably a scam.",

Calculate it from what exactly?You either have the WIF already but have lost part of it (like a damaged paper wallet) or you have the private key in a different format like Hexadecimal and that is damaged in which case there is no reason to convert the part you already have to another format like WIF to recover that, you should use what you already have.Even if it is something crazy like what @PrimeNumber7 with what you think is a flawed RNG and you think you have part of the key, there still is no reason to convert it to a base58 WIF since recovering this format is actually harder than recovering normal bits you may already have.",

To convert from a raw private key to WIF, you first take your 64 character hexadecimal private key, add the 0x80 network byte at the start, at an 0x01 at the end if it is going to be a compressed key, add the first 4 bytes of the double SHA256 of this string at the end as a checksum, then convert all of this from Base16 to Base58.

You will need the full private key to be able to convert that to an integer, then compute the public key of that private key and finally compute its hash to get the address.When you don't have part of the private key, you simply can't compute the public key and the rest either.",

When you generate a private key, you generate a random number (the scope of potential numbers is much larger than in my above example). Once you have the private key, in order to get the address, you have to perform a number of  one-way hash functions (along with other calculations) on the private key. To ask how to calculate the first x characters of the input of a hash function based on the output is effectively asking how to break the hash function.",

Given that each base58 character less, increases your chances to find the private key by 58, you still have to search to approximately 58^34 numbers (35-1, because all WIF start with \"5\"). You can't do that. Brute forcing allows you recover WIF with few characters missing, not 2/3 of the private key.",

You're saying you don't know anyting, but if you find a way to get 70%, you'll also be able to get the remaining 30%. That makes no sense at all, because there's no way to get the first 70% of the private key. If that would be possible, Bitcoin wouldn't exist.There are far richer addresses out there than the one you showed (holding 500BTC), and some of them have exposed their public key.Some say what you're looking for is possible with quantum computing, but that's not going to happen any time soon.",
