I was definitely supposed to be dead by now! I've also lost count of how many vaccines I've had since then! I think I'm up to 5 or even 6 COVID shots by now. And flu shots, of course.

The Harvard School of Medicine did a long study... about 12 years long. It was a recent one. It showed that less than 1% of vaccine adverse effects were reported to VAERS (the CDC). The reports to VAERS of covid vaxx deaths is ... well, let's look it up where it can easily be found... https://openvaers.com/covid-data.Not only are there a lot of covid vaxx deaths, but there are so many illnesses and injuries from them that the count is staggering. And all of that is less than 1%. The interesting thing is that we don't know how much less than 1%, but it might be only 0.1%. Check it at https://openvaers.com/faq/what-is-underreporting-and-why-it-matters.So, the fact of the matter is that you either received from batches that weren't as strong as some others, or you are still a walking time-bomb. Get a few more shots, and laugh about it until you keel over.Remember one thing... placebo effect. You can look up the records of such, that suggest that as much as 32% of people are cured by placebo effect. So, stay strong in your belief. It might be the only thing keeping you alive.",

Taking or not taking the vaccine does not result in a death sentence as some claim.I agree with your statement that taking the vaccine doesn’t mean you will or will not die from covid (or the vax). All taking the vaccine means is that you were slightly better than average protected from covid for a couple weeks and then your immune system is forever compromised to defend against covid naturally as well as those who haven’t been vaccinated. As for the long term effects of mRNA being injected into your body, we’ll have to wait and see with the next generation. All I know is that the vaccine didn’t do what it was supposed to do and plenty of people knew this, but were censored from sharing concerns with the sheep.",

Now it's going to be the next generation?Certain of us considered it a potential issue for the designer genetics to transcribe into the native DNA of the victim's cells.  Only later was that demonstrated to occur, and via a rather clever mechanism.  To my knowledge only the long-in-development biowarfare agent that Pfizer slapped their label on was studied and only in vitro with HEC cell lines.  I'm sure that many parties have evaluated what the behavior in germ cells might be, but nobody is going to make that kind of work public if they want to continue to work in the field (or probably even stay alive.)Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 08, 2023, 04:58:06 AMOh, and whatever happened to the 5G mind control nanobots in the vaccine?

All I know is that the vaccine didn’t do what it was supposed to do and plenty of people knew this, but were censored from sharing concerns with the sheep. But are you aware that not all vaccines against COVID are based in Messenger ARN, aren't you?Most of countries around the world do no have technology or means to keep those vaccines under the temperatures required for them not to exploit. So many have opted for developing deactivated virus vaccines, which are the classical method used to develop the first inmmunitations against illnesses like rabies. Mostly, the mARN vaccines were widely available in developed countries like USA.Quote from: franky1 on September 08, 2023, 12:57:52 PMbadecker is simply using this topic to reveal why he has stayed a relationshipless virgin.
