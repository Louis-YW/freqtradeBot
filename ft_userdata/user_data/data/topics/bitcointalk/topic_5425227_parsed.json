I've never used their help center, but it should show when you submit a ticket, if it's not there, check your email inbox.They have a contact us page. You can write them your problem along with your email address associated with the account. I contacted their support a few years ago and I was able to get in touch after almost 48+ hours if I can remember correctly. I had exchanged 2/3 messages within 4/5 days lol. And luckily, my problem was solved.",

If you can't find the email, try searching the keyword 'coinbase' in your account or check your spam folder otherwise you may have to do some fiddling like adding coinbase domain in your contact list as sometimes the spam filters block their emails.",

Because I remember few members complained similar to what you are saying and it seems they never able to access their funds.But that may not be the case always so reach out then and yes you have to be patient until their support team contacts you.",

I haven't encountered this situation before, it seems like coinbase just changed their policy to be more strict to protect their users. The tip when using coinbase is only to use 1 fixed IP, do not change too many IP, otherwise, they may continue to lock your account to ensure your safety.",

Because modem assigning dynamic range of IP address are designed to used like that unless you configure to have it as static assigning which probably coinbase knows a lot about it. Unless a VPN, new device or new browser is used and it will trigger their system. Though disabling the account looks like not normal to me for every suspicious login, except when changing email or password.",

Though disabling the account looks like not normal to me for every suspicious login, except when changing email or password.I mean using a fixed IP of a certain country, not a static IP. We are using their service, so you need to follow their policy, if you don't like their rule way then you should not use their service. I also find it quite inconvenient if every time I open the app without turning on the VPN, I may be temporarily blocked from sending money. But for security reasons for my account, I'll accept, as long as I don't forget to enable VPN, it will never happen. Logging in with a strange IP address is also considered a security change.",
