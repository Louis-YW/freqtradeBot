  "content": "Quote : \"Starting blockchain height -----> will be the same as Litecoin Cash when LightningCash will be launched and LCC holders will get LTNCs\"^^^ At first, LightningCash was supposed to be a Litecoin Cash fork. I was just starting to play with the bitcoin source code back then. I asked Tanner from LitecoinCash's team to help me ( Lead Dev ) , and he did.The original and official ANN, on March 6th 2019 ( LightningCash - CPU only - Fastest bitcoin based cryptocurrency ) : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5117428I decided to create a new genesis block, so no LCC, or LTC holders could claim...That's when things went weird.I \"lost\" access to my bitcointalk.org account. I could not update the ANN for a long time. I used new duplicate ANNs and this was bad.The coin got listed on probitex.com, and I had to change the coin's name so it would not fuck their database since the old 2018 lightningcash had got listed there too.So the coin's name changed to LightningCash-Gold just a few days after launch on March 6th 2019.On June 29th 2019, I forked the coin from Scrypt algo to Yespower ( cpu-only algorithm ; Asic resistent and FPGA neutral )I pushed a wrong commit on github circa August - September 2019, and the blockchain got splitt in two, and there was a chain race ( November 2019 ) In November 2019, when the chain was split, shadow42 tried to repair, then he \"took control\" of everything related to the coin. I \"lost\" access to the original ANN and my LighningCashDev bitcointalk account, the github( github.com/LightningCash-Dev ), the twitter ( twitter.com/LTNCG ), the discord, etc.  I was left alone. I was called a scammer. I was defamed. I was silenced. I was called a liar. It took me more than a year to get back my bitcointalk.org account and fix all those duplicates ANN and the original ANN.But LightningCash already had suffered a value loss, and a considerable popularity / use loss. shadow42 wanted to sell the idea of forking to a proof of stake ( POS ) algorithm ( which I personaly REALLY don't like ) to the over-taken official LightningCash discord server users, in which I was muted and deafed for weeks.Eventually, I could take back the ownership of the official discord and  have push access to shadow42's \"copied repo\" on github ( github.com/lightningcashgold/ltncg, which is now deleted. It had been forked from github.com/shadow42/ltncg, which had been forked from github.com/LightningCash-Dev/ltncg, which belonged to me until I \"lost\" access to this github account, which was my main github account at that time.It is also during November - December 2019 that I tried to implement a multi-thread hive miner in LitecoinCash's source code.( https://github.com/MerlinMagic2018/lightningcash-gold-obsolete/commits/master ) I was always one step behind shadow42 at this time... But I am the first who implemented Tanner's Hive multi-thread miner. Read me well here. It was Tanner's code. Not mine.Not shadow42's.After a few days of experimentation and high profits, I decided to tell LitecoinCash's team in private on discord about this.I published my code on github, and then created a pull request for Litecoin Cash on november 15th 2019.( https://github.com/litecoincash-project/litecoincash/pull/21 )I could have said nothing for a long time, but I decided to reveal it... Why did Litecoin Cash Core Developers not implement the Hive multi-thread miner before, I asked them... They gave me the following answer : It \"should\" be in LCC's next release...Many called me a scammer and thought I was keeping it for myself, solely for my own profit... But telling LCC's team about it and coordinate a public ANN about this was difficult ! Especially since LCC's team was not so happy about me ( with reason ! )and LightningCash being a new blockchain instead of a fork of LCC. When I got back access to my LighningCashDev bitcointalk account, I tried to fix things up, changed back the coin's name from LightningCash-Gold to LightningCash again, etc.Today ( September 23rd 2022 ) , LightningCash is becoming more popular every hour. The network is stable, there has not been any fork or upgrade since 2020, and we will be on atomicDEX next official release ( a decentralised exchange where your private keys are kept locally ). They also very recently made a deal with binance, and made a public live stream on September 19th 2019 :https://www.binance.com/en/live/video?roomId=2109424https://atomicdex.ioLightningCashWhat doesn't kill us makes us stronger.merlinSeptember 24th 2022, 7:27 AM",
