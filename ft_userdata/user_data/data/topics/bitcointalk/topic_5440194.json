Assuming I understand the cost of time factor and value as you said I would stick to it since my wallet was intact and the figures value was intact Also by now I would launched great mansion and empire of my own world but is all good, as time progress we keep learning.

So in your case, you did something stupid i.e invested more that you couldn't afford to lose ignorantly and that led to your loss but the fact that you didn't let that change the way you view Bitcoin that I must commend.",

But I don't know why I have this doubt that thou O.P might have been among the earlier hearers of Bitcoin, I don't think it was the real Bitcoin he/she invested in, because He claimed that he lost everything, and in Bitcoin nothing is totally lost completely, but only just that due to the volatile nature of the market, it's value can fall drastically, which will later rise with time. But I'm sure that back then in 2014 to 2018,  a lot of scam investment platforms came up bearing the name Bitcoin, which many people invested their funds and never got it back again due to excuse of websites upgrade and internet scam e.t.c",

Well, I guess that’s part of the journey missing some good opportunities at first but eventually, you will still end up with bitcoin. The good thing about bitcoin is that there will be no early or late in investing, just as you decide to start investing because you are now aware on how potential it is and you really understand how that investment works, which I think is much better than to just end up quitting without giving it a chance to recover some of your losses and maybe this time it may start to work. Remember that when you invest, you will not really be profitable at first without dealing those hardships at first and letting you struggle at first.",

Bitcoin is a promising investment, but if you're a beginner or new member looking to get started, you shouldn't put all of your money into it, If you do, you might not know what will happen if the price drops or you find yourself in a tight financial situation, Instead, I advise you to put a little some money and think wisely rather than investing all of your funds",

Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin look very un-friendly for newbies. If you don't know about them, then you get the impression that you need to be a programmer or a marketer to figure it out. But in fact, all use boils down to the fact that there is a wallet with 2 buttons - Receive and Send. The rest is already nuances: blockchains, airdrops... Don't stop trying to figure it out, because we all once knew nothing about cryptocurrencies. And we are here with such ranks only because we did not give up.",
