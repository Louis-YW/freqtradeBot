Yes mate Doan9269, I get your point but the real fact is that we must make use of all this things in one way or the other, we must go to work and we need vehicle, tricycle or a motorcycle then we must go to church on Sunday's, if you are not a Christian or any religion you must go to work so we must use one of those thing I mentioned earlier on this comment, buying it will be a very good idea because you don't have to buy an fuel or whatsoever just to charge it and then use, some people can be having double thoughts about the battery aspect but my suggestion is that as long as it shows a battery percentage on the dashboard you can program the distance it will go before it runs down.",

So whoever fit afford such money now, I bet you such person go fit survive this high price of fuel wahala.Moreover, this can only be used as an alternative to normal bike, and not for car, as there are certain distance this bike can't cover.",

Well, you been understand my point but you no kuku reason am well before you replied. You mentioned something wey dey interesting. If petrol finish for person bike, e dey push am go filling station. This means that the filling station fit dey like 1 pole away, so there is a destination for fuel.If person tyre less, dem go push the bike go vulcaniser. There is still a destination where air will be refilled.But if your battery die, there is no destination apart from your house which might be several kilometres away from home.I am not saying that the technology is not fine, what I meant is that the early adopters will suffer it before them begin build electric charging points for streets. I hope you get my point now.",

You also have to know that not everybody can ride a bike, or see bike as something safe to ride on, and also charging of this electric bike with electricity from our homes will increase the cost of Electricity unit consumed for those of us that use PPM, and increase the amount we spend on payment for electricity unit. This way out to reduce expenses will be beneficial for people who have electricity with a fixed bill.Instead of looking for ways to reduce your daily expense, look for ways to make more money and become more financially disciplined and stable because expenses never stop or reduce, they keep increasing especially as the economy worsen.",
