  "content": "On going though the the forum recently i noticed that most newbies are not well informed on how to choose a good  wallet and exchange.#What is a good wallet I can use to store Bitcoin?# Kyc for accounts or wallets#Which will be best non-KYC exchanger after Ku-coin? For this reasons, i have decided to compile a list of useful information they should acquire before using or selecting a reliable crypto exchanges or wallet. also  I have listed some working exchanges ***note, I will do well to explain in  simplified terms)***First,what is a wallet?     A wallet as the name implies refers to a safe house for all your assets. Now on the aspect of crypto currency, a wallet is a digital container which helps to manage your digital wealth with ease and more securly.cryptocurrencies are not physically stored inside your wallet but are recorded on the blockchain and so the wallet acts as an interface that displays the total amount of cryptocurrencies associated with yourpublic key.     Bitcoin wallets comes in various categories, ranging from quality and the services they offer their users. I won't go further into the types of wallet, because there is already a general thread made onBitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why? so please do well to check it out. not to waste a lot of time, let's go into exchanges.CRYPTOEXCHANGES Most people often mistakes exchanges for wallet because it offers its users a wallet where they can store their crypto, but exchanges are not wallets. Exchanges are third party organizations, which manages the funds of its users [more or less like a custodial wallet] providing a place where they can trade different crypto currencies for another or even to a desired fiat currency [vice-versa]. since most crypto exchanges are prone to scam or malicious activities, it is adviced not to leave your funds in their wallets and remember this, [not your key,not your coin]. crypto exchanges comes invarious types but the most commonly used ones are centralized.CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES[CEX]centralized exchanges, refers to exchanges that acts as a middle man to help conduct transaction. they offer advantages such as liquidity, user friendly interfaces and a variety of trade pairs. many centralized exchanges have tiered account verification system that impose transaction limits on users until they complete additional security measures.These exchanges,follows the compliance of government bodies, therefore implementing measures to ensure that its users follows or comply to some necessary requirements such as  the KYC[know your customer] or the AML[anti money laundry policies to help control fraudulent activities.here are some most trusted or commonly used centralized exchanges.BinancekrakenBitstampOKXKU coinBybitHuobiclick to see more centralized exchangesDECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES[DEXs]  Decentralized exchanges operates on a blockchain network that facilitate peer to peer[p2p] cryptocurrency trading, therefore utilizing smart contracts to carry out trade.in the decentralized exchanges,there is no middle-man so every user has control over their assets and is responsible for any activity that may lead to loss of their funds. it also provide privacy benefits as they don't require users to disclose personal information during trading. some popular decentralized exchanges includeUNISWAPPANCAKESWAPSUCHISWAPAPEXPROclick to see more decentralized exchangesPEER TO PEER EXCHANGES [p2p]   Although, the peer to peer exchange falls under the categories of decentralized exchanges, it is still treated separately. it is simply a crypto market, where buyers and sellers are connected directly without any involvement of a third party.The buyers and sellers,gets to negotiate and agree to a particular price before the transaction takes place.These exchanges uses the decentralized enscrow system to ensure a secure and successful transaction.This means that they hold the traded cryptocurrency temporarily until both participants confirms the completion of the transaction. for now, a lot of well known p2p exchanges like paxful, local bitcoin were said to have shut down after so many years of service but there are still few working p2p exchanges BISQHodl HodlAgora deskRobosatslocalcoinswapt#Tips on how to select a wallet or exchange#As someone new into the the world of cryptocurrency, you might be wandering what kind of wallet will best suite you. choosing a wallet depends on your specific need or purpose, which may include;1.Business2.Hodl3.Trading/Investmentthere might be some other reasons you may want to choose a good wallet and it's essential to choose one that aligns with your priorities and requirements.

I think you might have mistaken Centralized exchanges for decentralized ones. Exactly, decentralized exchange does not require any KYC at anytime. It is only centralized exchange ask KYC and changes T/C as they want. As for the decentralized exchange as you sign up with username, email and password that is all. There is no terms and conditions again. But the issue I have with decentralized exchange platforms is that, I have not seen sell link or button to click but there always sell link. And also I have not seen mobile version on them, they are mostly use in desktop. Centralized exchange platforms are more easier to use than decentralized exchange platforms from my experience of trying them.",

You connect and grant access to your wallet address in order to initiate a trade. There are no buy or sell orders, they make use of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) from liquidity pools. Trades are executed based on the current market price of the token.",

It is more common with gambling platforms and less common with centralized exchanges.With centralized exchanges, you can send coins to other users on a same exchange without fees. You must know it is not on chain transaction but only an internal credit to that account balance. Centralized exchange does not spend any fee generously to support you.",

The two best decentralized exchanges are the BISQ and AGORA DESK. you can check kycnot.me for more of them. Once a rating there is below 8 then you trade with caution.

And again you still need the customer to have the same exchange, which is another obstacle. The best thing would be introducing lightning network just in case the mempool becomes congested you can have another alternative",
