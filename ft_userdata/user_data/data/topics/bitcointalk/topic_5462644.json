He can also sell on Binance by using p2p. I think this information has some mistake. Because there are huge Exchanger available and there he can easily sell bitcoin there without any hassle. I am thinking about another risk, like scam risk. Please be more careful about this kinds of transaction. And my strong advice please use exchanger which will more secure to buy and sell this kinds of big transaction.",
