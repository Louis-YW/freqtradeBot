There’s no way a regular trader will be interested on someone account because they can easily create one for them and also same as you mentioned, It’s a complete of contract with the exchange ToS.I saw some user here that buying this kind of account. Money laundering or someone that doesn’t want to provide KYC on exchange but they want to use CEX are the only user that will purchased this scammish offer.This is the danger of using CEX. Imagine criminal using your account on illegal activities and interpol will make a lead against you for the crime.",

Anyone using the darknet is already considered a criminal intent person because 90% of the activities that go on in the darknet are all criminal and contraband goods digitally, so I am discouraged from using the darknet, so I never try visiting the site, I am sure anyone who does not have any criminal intention will be ok with building any account in their identity and will not mind going through the ranking processes of any platform and anyone looking to cut corners are that buying account in any forms.",

I've accessed the darknet markets in the past and have seen credit card and account sales; however, I'm not quite sure how legit these sales are; it's the darknet after all.Binance has second-factor authentication, either through a mobile phone or email; Kraken does too. I've used both and always had to go through 2FA. How would someone take advantage of such accounts when they're going to ask for further verification for every single process you do, especially if it's regarding a withdrawal or changing your withdrawal address and personal details?

Hm, I don't know about you but its been a long time since Binance asked for any sort of additional verification when I wanted to withdraw the crypto. The only time when they regularly ask for 2FA is when I want to pay something online with their card but I don't think that people buy accounts for that purpose. My guess is that traders are simply using it untill they get asked for 2FA verification and after that they simply ditch the account.",

It is a possibility that some of the hacked accounts are using the same password as the connected email. That will surely ease the burden of the hackers or the account buyers, with that said, it is necessary for us to utilize basic recommended digital security practices, as has been said in the original source of the referred article(https://www.privacyaffairs.com/dark-web-price-index-2023/).",
