Even if you get some money you should be careful when depositing it on their site because they can run away with your money. I don't think that any promo code would make someone .32 BTC without any effort, and that's why I recommend you to be careful.I also doubt that you can be among those scammers who come with such posts only to test the empathy of the forum members, and if you're one of those scammers then you should also keep in mind that members of this forum aren't naive enough to send money to someone they don't know personally. Many people have came with similar stories many times on this forum and because of those people we got a lesson that trusting new members is very risky and I'm sure no one is going to take those risks.",
