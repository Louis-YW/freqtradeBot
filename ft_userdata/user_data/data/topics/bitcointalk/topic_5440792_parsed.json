I'm getting a whole bunch of syntax errors when I pasted that into a perl file.Me either, even after following the guide[1]. It's likely the problem lies within version of perl/dc.[1] http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/rsa/rsa-details.html[2] http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/rsa/story2.html, under big text \"The commented version\".I'm not sure why an RSA encryption script would even need to use dc, because that is just a reverse polish calculator, and I know that Perl has its own set of arithmetic operators (not to mention that this doesn't even look like valid Perl).",

I didn't know RSA algo was banned or under export restrictions in the 1990ies in the US.  Lots of things like that in terms of encryption were and still are banned for export. From what I have seen it's really not something they go after you for, but if you are being charged with a bunch of other crimes that goes with it too. When they started to craft the law things looked a lot different from the internet / tech world standpoint then when it passed, and the way the world is today it's totally pointless.-Dave",
