Sorry!But about the trustsystem and this \"DT list\" how does it works when admin or whoever chooses who that gonna be on the list?For example: If I trust member A & B and they already are on the DT list their feedback will be shown to me, so then its no reason for me to add them to my specific trust list. Right?..OR should I add them to my trust list anyway because two people that I think have good judgment will get more likely to be in the DT list? (Since I seen you can get removed or added on the DT list all the time)EDIT: Got enough answers to understand how it works, thanks for all replies (locking the thread to avoid spam)",

(Since I seen you can get removed or added on the DT list all the time)Users eligible to be chosen in DT1 are those ones who meet some criteria, among which being included in other users' trust list is mandatory. So if you include someone to your trust list it makes position of that member in DT1 candidate list more stable.Among all eligible theymos periodically randomly choses a 100 of DT1.You can read more about DefaultTrust system as theymos wrote.And there is an easy to read LoyceV's Beginners guide to learn this system as well.",

Right?This is correct if you didn't remove DefaultTrust on your trustlist since you automatically trust all DT by default on your trustlist unless you distrust someone on DT then their feedback will not be visible to you by default as trusted feedback.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on July 10, 2023, 06:24:42 PM..OR should I add them to my trust list anyway because two people that I think have good judgment will get more likely to be in the DT list? (Since I seen you can get removed or added on the DT list all the time)Adding them is more approriate if you really trust someone judgement. If you only trust that two people alone then you should just only list them on your trustlist and remove the defaultTrust.Answering the title, Yes we are the one who's gonna decide to become a DT since it's decentralized. Theymos can't moderate DT system.",

He just don't use his option of changing anything done in DT except if it's really making a problem to a system. So it is decentralized, but can be fixed in very exceptional cases.",
