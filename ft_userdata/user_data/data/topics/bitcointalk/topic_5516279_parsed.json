Indeed, the bulk sale of Bitcoin by large companies could drive down the price, especially if it happens at the same time as other market events.There are reports that they are buying OTC so that it will not affect that much because no one is going to see or known about the sell-off, not the traders on exchanges who might see the sell orders and then panic, pushing the sell button. This institutions knows how the play the market and to not affect or send shockwaves with their huge sell.Quote from: Jojos on October 31, 2024, 01:33:37 PM It is also possible that these companies are adopting a long-term strategy, seeking to hold on to their assets to extract maximum value from them over the long term.Of course, they know the game, it's going to be a long term hold to make huge profits and to maximized it. We have seen or heard Saylor about that strategy. And even for us retail or average joe investors, this is our strategy, DCA, hard and grind accumulation and then sell during the height of the bull run.",

However, there are still some things we can do - for example, we can promote independent Bitcoin storage, cold wallets, etc. We can tell people about the principles of decentralization and financial freedom, that Bitcoin is essentially an alternative to the modern financial system. At the same time, it is necessary to understand that BlackRock is not friendly to the first cryptocurrency. Companies like BlackRock are huge financial and political corporations that play their own global strategic game. At the same time, in my opinion, Bitcoin is an even more powerful entity than a large international corporation. Trying to manipulate Bitcoin, BlackRock may in the future get completely different results than they are currently striving for. Bitcoin is too global to fall under the influence of one corporation, even one as large as BlackRock.",

Further more, price increases slowly when bullish but drops significantly in a bearish trend.So if we see the same amount of sell off then the price drop will be huge when compared to it's price pump.In a way it is better that institutional investors stay away from bitcoin because if a single entity holds a large amount of bitcoins it will give them the power of market manipulation as you said.",

They are not buying a lot of Bitcoin but rather scooping up what is currently considered a lot of Bitcoin. If you buy 100000 Bitcoin for 1 cent each coin, you would have much more power over the Bitcoin price than if you bought 100000 Bitcoin at the price of 70k each coin. Why? Because it does not matter at what price you dump the 1 cent coins, you will make an immense profit. But dumping so many Bitcoin at the price of 70k AND making a profit? That is hard to do without incurring a huge loss. Since they made the investment at around 70k (I assume), selling the vast amounts AND making a profit at the same time is hard, time-intensive work.In other words, nobody is going to buy mass amounts of Bitcoin only to employ the \"pump and dump\" strategy. It just is not feasible anymore.",

From what I managed to find, it's $872 million going to iShares Bitcoin Trust, but I suppose it could be $1.5 billion over a few days. Still, it's only the latest addition to their portfolio, while their total is in dozens of billions of dollars worth of BTC.I think it's easier and safer to invest in Bitcoin directly instead of through ETFs, but I can understand that it depends on an investor, and perhaps ETFs are way more attractive for traditional investors, working with various assets.",

That is what most people don't understand yet, i prefer different individuals buying bitcoins that will sum up that huge amount than an institution because we also know that as they impact the market positively when they buy, same it causes severe DIP when they sell. However, since these institutional investors plays major roles in determining the activities of bitcoin price, we should just endeavor to have a long term hodling mentality and also make sure we have reserved funds to buy back whenever they decides to sell.Inasmuch as they rebuy again after they sell, i think the market will continue to be balanced because most of the reasons why they sell is to take profits and buys at more cheaper price so anyone who doesn't have a long term target will definitely fall to their manipulation when they panic and sell along with the bigger investors.",

There will already be a huge demand among ETF investors and that's why they are buying these BTC.Even if they sell the market will dump that's future and we should not ruin our present for the event that is yet to happen in future and there is fifty fifty chance of it to happen so it is a big bullish news along with election's result the market have the potential to pump to $80k.",

In 2017, we've seen lots of market manipulation because at that time, the total market cap of cryptocurrency is much lower than that of it is today. Now it's harder to manipulate the crypto market, and I don't see these companies having the power to manipulate the market. For me, I don't see any reason for Blackrock to buy Bitcoin aside from the fact that they see it as a money-making machine. Let's not forget that Larry Fink is one of the famous businessmen who criticized Bitcoin back a few years ago. Now they're integrating it into their own company, and continuously buying Bitcoin. They can sell whatever they want and since they have the power, they can do it, but as long as there will be buyers then everything is good... or is it?",
