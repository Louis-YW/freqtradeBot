Noncustododial wallet are seed phrase or private key wallets. Freewallet has been a scam wallet many years ago and people are to avoid the wallet but some people that are ignorant about it are still using it. Even people that are ignorant and not able to differentiate between custododial and noncustododial wallet are the ones using custodial wallet which people's account can be blocked.You have no option than to keep on contacting Freewallet customer care.",

I suggest sending him a PM to let him know about this topic.Good luck!",

It's non custodial so you have full control over your coins.But since we are talking about a lot of money here (~10 eth), you may want to consider buying a hardware wallet.BTW, I know this won't change anything but just out of curiosity, why did you choose to store your coins on freewallet!?",

I would be happy that this service exists at all and that you can hope that one day you will get back what belongs to you.Far be it from me to defend this service, but irresponsible behavior leads to situations like this - do not use custodial service for long-term storage + not your private keys, not your coins. It may take 1 month, maybe a year, but it is even stupider to give up and leave that money to them.",

Back then, eth highest price was around $17, so the 17 eth he sent to freewallet were worth less than $290 (and probably even way less than that). Besides, the name of the service itself is a bit deceitful especially for newbies (just like blockchain.com). OP, be cautious and do not trust random people especially newbies who will contact you telling you they can help or they know someone who can help!",
