Ask the local authority of New Zealand to trace him for you if he really has huge money borrowed from you. I understand the frustration but you should do this the right way or else he will keep hiding from you since he is far away from you. Ask someone to file the complaints on their local police department and give the proof of all your transaction and conversation to make this job offer realistic. Honestly, no one in the right mind will do this task for just 1500$ and use escrow for the payment since you have a negative reputation.",

      "body": "Based on the negative trust received by the OP, probably a lot of people wouldn't trust him to do that. And maybe a lot of people will say that maybe it's karma from what the OP did if you look at history in his negative beliefs.Quote from: Beparanf on May 26, 2022, 03:34:16 AMAsk the local authority of New Zealand to trace him for you if he really has huge money borrowed from you. Exactly what Beparanf said, report it to the local police to take care of it if the OP loses a lot of money. This is more legal and quicker to process because the local police know what they are going to do with the procedures they have in place.",

      "body": "There are few questions to be asked;1. Was the business transacted on this forum or was out of the platform?2. Was there any written agreements or any means to pay back or collateral that possesses his name's, location and states?3. What was your terms and conditions before giving out or borrowing your money to him/she?4. Were you a registered money lender?If all these could be clearly answered then I will say nothing can be done from this forum, maybe any one can find it interesting to work with you but I must say your chances are very slime so report him to the police maybe they could help and track him before leaving the state or country, this could be how huge is the money before they would pick interest and seriously work with you.",

You do not take into account that everything about that person may be false, but also that the threats are taken very seriously even if they come over the phone. Is $1500 worthwhile if someone ends up in jail for threatening someone?My advice is: if you already have the money to share it with some strangers, then get a passport, buy a ticket to NZ and when you get there hire a lawyer and report everything to the police.",

There is no point threatening him over the calls when you can physically visit him and talk with him. If he still does not listen to you and you are on the right side, you can call the police or law enforcement agencies to give you justice.",

People will not help you for just like this because people will just think that you are a scammer and try to do manipulative tactics for those people who want to bite your offer.",

So only tell me if you're seriousMy telegram is : @sloppybtcIf you truly got scammed, then go to the police.  Asking others to harass and threaten someone is the same as harassing and threatening them yourself, which is illegal.  Besides which, what evidence do you have that supports your claim?  Assessing your previous posts on this forum, a more reasonable conclusion would be that you tired to scam someone and got exposed yourself.",

Seeing what tantrum he threw for just  20$ this guy might be somebody who just beat him on some online gameFortunately, even if somebody ignores all those red flags,  I doubt there would be any moron who would take a job that could land him in jail for years for two weeks of minimum wage!",
