  "content": "A new version of Electrum has been released on April 18th.Release notes:Code:   - New onchain transaction creation flow, with configurable preview   - Various options have been moved to toolbars, where their effect     can be more directly observed.Code:- lightning: support for option scid_alias.    - Qt GUI: UTXO privacy analysis: this dialog displays all the      wallet transactions that are either parent of a UTXO, or can be      related to it through address reuse (Note that in the case of      address reuse, it does not display children transactions.)    - Coins tab: New menu that lets users easily spend a selection      of UTXOs into a new channel, or into a submarine swap (Qt GUI).Code:  - Lightning invoices are regenerated everytime routing hints are      deprecated due to liquidity changes.    - Script descriptors are used internally to sign transactions.And for the corresponding Android application:Code:- Using Qt 5.15.7, PyQt 5.15.9   - This release still on python3.8   - Feature parity with Kivy   - Android Back button used throughout, for cancel/close/back   - Note: two topbar menus; tap wallet name for wallet menu, tap     network orb for application menu   - Note: long-press Receive/Send for list of payment requests/invoicesSource: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTESOne and only download page: https://electrum.org/#download",

There is no option to enter the address manually. You need to have the address already copied on the clipboard then you can paste it. Besides, there is no option to edit the address after pasting it.Also, on the Send tab, when tapping the Max button, the amount field will not display the max amount to send. You need to click on Pay to see it on the next screen. At first, I thought it doesn't work until I clicked Pay.",
