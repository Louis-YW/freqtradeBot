I purchased LUNA before when the price dumps from 100$ to 0.2$, I thought that it was already the bottom since its too much low so I bought tokens without doing thorough research on the real situation since the CEO is still giving some reassuring update for recovery. Then I realized that the token is fucked up because it keeps minting new token to add on supply just to dump it on the market and buy back UST to peg on USD. This bullshit code makes the Luna token supply inflate into trillion which result to the price to decrease to the rock bottom.It's funny that I knew the risk but still I continue buying it because Iâ€™m too greedy that the price might recover overnight.",

We miners were all scared to buy GPUs anytime in the past 6 years because we knew there is a POS risk. However it was delayed for years and we just kept buying GPUs.",

Market does not have bull if it does not have bear.Bull market is where you can learn how crazy crypto market is in bullish phase. In addition, you will be given chances to learn about scam projects that easily to raise fund from investors.Bear market is where you can learn that how scam projects or incapable projects will be abandoned or die gradually with time. It is hard to find projects that are born in bull market and are still be able to exist and lively developed in bear market. Very few of projects can have active developments in bear market.",

If you believe and believe, you will continue to hold BTC even more strongly because you want to see the price of BTC rise to the next high.What is clear, in the last bull run, I made a very large profit, especially in BTC because the price of BTC could rise very high beyond my previous expectations. And I still believe that the last ATH is not the end of everything but BTC can still make new ATH in the future.",

It's a fast game if you're into meme coins. You don't know how long the hype will last and how quick those investors that have early invested on it. Don't buy those hyping videos because you'll just end up with what you've experienced, losing and the laugh at the end is on them.2. Don't just rely on your friends and DYOR whether it's on mining, staking or investing and buying coins that you want to do. Mining altcoins doesn't look good at these moments. You can wait until some discoveries happen on which coin is profitable to mine before you sell your equipment.3. I also believed it and will always believe that it will come someday. It can't happen on a glance but it has to go through process, maybe on the next bull run it will.",

But thatâ€™s fine, I learned, and I am growing now, and I am going to be rich in the future.We all make mistakes and we all learn from them and the important part is to be better after the mistake.

You are not the only one in this but in your case you might regret more because you have already lost from your investment. At the time of the last bull and btc soar to $64k, many speculation were on air that is now a free rise for btc even to $150k to $200k and many bought in at the time now they are regretting. I usually follow the high and low pricing when investing. In buying of coins you need to invest when price is low and sell when it is high but buying at the high price is risky because you don't really know if you are buying the ATH for the season.",

You know, meme coins can come and go easily, especially if they are popular. There is no need to wait for more people to invest on it because the devs already got their desired profit and they are now ready to exit.2) Your mistake is that you are late again. You think eth won't transfer to POS because that is what your friend told you but later on it did came true but I think your machine can still be use for mining other coins.3) Everyone believes on that actually. It may have failed last bull but I am sure that btc will resume its failed mission on the next bull.",

It also gives bigger returns since the coin basically turns from shit to premium to shit, so if you manage to get that time frame of when it's premium then you're good to go.#3 is a natural reaction whenever the bull market comes, I'd honestly avoid any form of investment during that time period (or just DCA if you really want to invest).
