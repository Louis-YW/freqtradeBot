His name is abbreviated as SBF with his first initials in many thread here writing about him. At first I can't follow up to the reading because SBF was used and I thought one of the crypto abbreviated words like FUD, FOMO.  In the curiosity I have I decided to search SBF in my browser and I saw different meaning and not Samuel Banksman-Fried. I went back to the thread to do but a careful reading and now understood the full name/meaning as Samuel Bankman-Fried.

      "body": "Every news about crypto currency fall or hack is always hyped or more so stereotyped. The FTX saga has nothing to do with bitcoin but was about ill informed people that stored there coins on exchanges. And once it turned against them it was hyped by people against bitcoin.SBF is getting popular but in the wrong way, just like Adolf Hitler his name isn't praised but is raised to be a warning to current investors to stay away from such kinda of people.Personal I feel this hype around is helping In advocating to people easily the repercussions of storing funds on centralised exchanges.So no need to panic SBF is getting his recognition the wrong way.",

Imagine, the money of the people that have trusted him and his management.And then, he's not able to keep it properly and did something else with it. If that's questionable hate for you made by the people, just keep on digging more news.",

Here you can see the connection and influence of SBF. I think that he planned this from the beginning, and it cannot be denied that he did it well, although it was not right that he made this scandal in the world of cryptocurrency.Now he is using the money to clean up his character by participating in various interviews on well-known platforms such as the deal summit New York Times, and even with other YouTube influencers, SBF is interviewing, which is about it obvious that he's enhancing his image that he's not at fault when it comes to the thickness of his face in reality.",

I feel like it is inevitable for him to get more and more famous, it is going to be something that will just naturally happen. What could happen if you just lost 6 billion dollars worth of money of your customers?In any industry of the world that will become a huge deal, and we are just not going to see it change too much, it will just keep being a big deal and it will have a lot of articles and news about it coming out every single day. That's just the normal way of things, when you lose that much money, it is interesting. All the people who lost money will read it, and even the ones who didn't will read up on it a bit to see what's going on as well.",
