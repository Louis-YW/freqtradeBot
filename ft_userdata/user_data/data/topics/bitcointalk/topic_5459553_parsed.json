  "content": "The double spending thing is not new to me, I have a certain idea but one thing I read has made me think and look for information about it:Quote from: JeromeTash on July 07, 2023, 09:18:52 PMIs there anyone who has ever lost Bitcoins to a double spend attack after 1 confirmation? Â Personally, I have never come across such a case.With this thread I would like to raise doubts as well as expose what I think I understand because explaining also helps to learn.The first type of double spending I believe has little to do with what the quote raises, as it does not involve any miners. It is simply someone who sends a transaction with RBF enabled as payment for a product or service but receives such product or service before the transaction is confirmed and what they do is send that amount of Bitcoin to another address with a higher fee. Now let's move on to the hypothetical double spending that already involves some miner, in my opinion. I have searched a bit to see if there have been any cases of double spending after a confirmation and I haven't found anything either.I don't quite understand how this could happen. In theory a miner should somehow mine an invalid block in which there would be a transaction or transactions that we could not consider valid as such?It is clear to me that as more blocks are mined and in turn the previous blocks are reconfirmed, the probability of invalidation of the previous blocks increases, up to 6 confirmations, which are considered safe, leaving only the hypothetical case of the 51% attack as a threat, quite unlikely with Bitcoin.Can you help me understand what a double spend transaction that has already been confirmed once would look like?",

The so-called one confirmation double spending that you might encounter would be when a longer chain supersedes another, where a transaction would belong to a stale chain and thereby abandoned. Take the following two scenario:Propagation of blocks across the network is not instantaneous. Take for example, a miner mines a block (Block A) and propagates it throughout the network. When the block is being propagated, another miner mines a block (Block B) at the same height and relays his. If another miner sees block A first, the miner would build their block ontop of Block A and the same goes for block B. If a miner happens to mine another block (Block A*) ontop of Block A, the block is relayed and chain containing Block A and A* would be the longest chain and thereby accepted by the network. In this case, if your transaction is included in Block B but not included in Block A, your transaction would become unconfirmed and returned to the mempool. However, if there is another competing transaction that is spending the same input as that transaction which is included in Block A or A*, your transaction would become invalid and thereby abandoned. The latter is commonly considered double spending.",

How could I do it? Does it make sense what I am saying?Sorry, edited my post a bit to reflect what I am talking about.My scenario describes a process where it can happen naturally (ie. occurs in a non-malicious intent). It has happened at least once: https://medium.com/deribitofficial/was-there-a-bitcoin-double-spend-on-jan-20-2021-45bdbd178c58. Note that your number confirmation is in the perspective of which chain you're looking at. Hence, with the malicious intent, this is what an adversary would do given that he owns a significant portion of the hashrate.1) You send a transaction to Person A, and the transaction is included in block 883, hence both of you see 1 confirmation.2) As a miner, you can build an alternate chain ontop of Block 882 which does not include that transaction BUT includes another transaction which sends the coins back to yourself. In that alternate chain, you try to find a valid hash of block 883 and a block 884, while including the malicious transaction in your block 883 and mining another block on top of that. If you can do so, you can propagate that chain and the network accepts your alternate chain because it is the longest chain. 3) Because your new longest chain does not contain the transaction that you've sent originally but it contains the new transaction for which you spent the same inputs back to yourself, the original transaction becomes invalid and the rest of the network mines on your new chain and you've successfully reversed a 1 conf transaction.Note that anything below 6 confirmations doesn't require 51% of the network, in theory. You are always trying to outpace the honest miners by mining blocks and building a longer chain than them. Luck becomes a less significant factor at 6 conf. Hence, the probability of you outpacing the honest miners increases with a higher hashrate and at 51% of the hashrate, you will always win.",

Nice read. I have taken the opportunity to read the thread as well, from twelve years ago. In the end, the conclusion I reach with this thread is the same as the one reached by a forum member in that thread. Basically that making such scam attempts could only cross the mind of a miner with large amounts:Quote from: indio007 on August 15, 2011, 05:08:19 AMI think it's more profitable to stay honest and rake in all those fees than try to spoof the block chain. Especially if it works and they get caught.Bitcoin will be declared worthless by the world.And the one who answered him I think he was wrong:Quote from: cunicula on August 15, 2011, 06:35:44 AMFor now. In future years, generation rates will become low and fees will remain meager. Alternative revenue models will become more attractive.Apart from that: Quote from: ranochigo on July 13, 2023, 08:05:05 AMThe caveat being that the amount that you're depositing has to be more than your block reward at least for the attack to the worthwhile. Given how well the mining pools are connected to each other, it's unlikely that your block would be able to propagate faster than them so the scenario whereby your block gets stale is much more likely. The minimum cost for this attack would likely be more than the block reward, if you were to factor everything in.It would also fail if the person receiving the funds sees the other block first with how the topology of Bitcoin network is designed. A more worthwhile attack would be the selfish mining, where an attacker tries to withhold and generate blocks faster than the rest.I think that for a miner to think seriously about that nowadays it should be quite a bit more than block reward, I believe you here think in mathematics only. If a miner can earn $170K or more by mining a block honestly, why would he try to scam someone for only $180K? That someone might later try to track him down to get revenge for the scam or be reported and wanted by the police.With these considerations I conclude that this type of attempts, although possible, are quite improbable nowadays. In the thread cited by o_e_l_e_o perhaps the case that the OP tells is a case of this style, but the price at that time was like $1, and the block reward of 50 Bitcoins. It would be worth a dishonest miner's while to try for a few thousand dollars. Plus there were more individual miners, mining from a laptop from home, it wasn't as concentrated as it is now. This is the reading I make, although obviously I am aware that I know much less about the subject than you do and I am open to your clarifications and corrections.",

That someone might later try to track him down to get revenge for the scam or be reported and wanted by the police.I think the larger consideration is what if the scam doesn't work? Given how interconnected the network is today, and how quickly blocks spread, it is difficult to pull off. It is also trivial for the target to learn about chain split, and there are plenty of blockchain explorers and other entities out there which operate multiple nodes and can easily send alerts about chain split within a second or two of it happening. Given this, is it worth sacrificing a guaranteed $170k for a very small chance at $180k? Obviously not. You would need to be dealing with values which were multiple times higher than the current block reward, and as soon as you start talking about depositing 20+ BTC then no service in their right mind is going to accept only one confirmation.Quote from: philipma1957 on July 13, 2023, 02:20:56 PMIts only 7 million dollars and unless it was done back door and full remote the person would likely be caught.The pool would effectively be committing suicide.

Bitcoin uses blockchain which by design doesn't allow that because a single chain can't have the inputs being spent twice. If you were to go by that definition, double spending doesn't exist in Bitcoin. If you were to consider Bitcoin as something with multiple states (which rightfully it can be) and taking it as a system with multiple possible chains, then you can spend the coins multiple times, just not on the same chain.Now, the definition has evolved into those that we have discussed which can involve multiple chains, but if you were to consider only a single chain and state, then it doesn't make sense. Only one transaction that spends a specific input can exist in that chain (and thus having a confirmation) , not two different transactions with confirmations.",

Even with, say, 30% of the hashrate, you still have a 4.2% chance of reversing 10 confirmations and a 0.2% chance of reversing 20 confirmations.I tried, but got different numbers. How did you calculate this?Either way, it's very costly. You'd risk losing 6 blocks (of 6.25 Bitcoin block reward plus transaction fees each) for a 4% chance of reversing a transaction. That means it costs tens of millions of dollars on average to pull this off.Quote from: ranochigo on July 13, 2023, 08:05:05 AMQuote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 13, 2023, 07:52:28 AMYou might also be interested to read this post, which describes how a miner can double spend a transaction with one confirmation: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=36788.msg463391#msg463391.The caveat being that the amount that you're depositing has to be more than your block reward at least for the attack to the worthwhile.It's nice to read how simple things in 2011 were: I assume the guy was talking about a very large deposit (in Bitcoin), followed by a very quick withdrawal (after 1 confirmation). Nowadays, nobody in their right mind accepts such a deposit right after 1 confirmation.Quote from: vector76 on August 17, 2011, 05:37:56 PMEventually, I succeed in creating a valid block. Â I do not broadcast it immediately, but instead I wait until someone else mines a blockVector76 didn't even mention the loss of a block (back then worth about $500) if his plan failed and his block become orphaned.Nowadays this means you're gambling with a $200,000 block reward.",
