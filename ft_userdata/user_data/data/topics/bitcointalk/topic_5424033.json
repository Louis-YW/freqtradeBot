If they're panic, then it's good since we can buy their coins, if they're not panic, we can't buy the dip lol. So I'd thanks for those newbie who panic and then sold their coins for cheap price.",

      "body": "Panic, in my opinion, is the result of ignorance of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which also results in a lack of confidence in these technologies in general. It is impossible for newcomers who are only interested in Bitcoin to remain calm in the face of such a situation. What do you think a beginner who purchased Bitcoin for $30k and it is now only worth $16k per Bitcoin will be feeling? He will undoubtedly be uncertain whether to sell or not.And a lot of individuals are  panicking because they have invested what they thought they had not invested, particularly those who are timing Bitcoin market prices in the hopes that if they invested hug sum of money they can profit big in due time if Bitcoin pumps, which puts them at undue danger.I believe a lot of advice have been given in the forum many times, to only invest what you can afford to lose, so to avoid worry over the bear market.",

Look Bitcoin history have a cycle if you are here for very long time or if you know the history of Bitcoin then you shouldn't be panic. However, since there are some potential to make profit selling it is the best choice and buy later for cheaper price. That's a normal cycle of trading.",

However, I would still leave speculations about the absolute bottom in the speculation zone, because it is difficult to say what awaits us in the coming months, and some persistently call for another big crash. Considering that many CEX these days announce how much BTC their companies have in their wallets, all these millions are hanging over our necks - because they are not there just because their owners are convinced that it is a safe place, but they are ready to sell them if the opportunity arises. In the long term, we all expect a new ATH to happen, but we will have to be patient for that - Santa Claus brings some less valuable gifts this year",

This is how big financial funds and big traders are averaging their buyThe way it is said, it's entirely right. This is traditional and well known strategy in the real world, where its formerly known as \"DCA\" or Dollar Cost Averaging. The way it is stated here, you have to keep buying the crypto at various entry points and the entry points are nothing but at what price you are buying. This has to be versatile and should take your investment to such cost that your BEP always keeps dropping and thus it becomes very easy for you to break the profitability window once market revives from lets say bearish trend such as current one. This is most logical explanation to this strategy. I might have used too much layman language while explaining it but this is just to make us understand in the simplest way. In fact for those who might have bought very high prices, now is the good time to buy and bring down the BEP.",

For me it's a game of discipline and if you do, it will totally give you the best of things in return. We may never know if 70% is the bottom this time around, historically, Bitcoin can go lower to 80% which may pull down around 30-40 percent of the current value.",

But indeed at this time, the media is manipulating people to be inconsistent on the path that Bitcoin should be. We are easily moved by bad issues that force beginners to give up what they haven't been above and sell it in the era of panic. Almost everyone feels it including me personally. Especially when the issue is proven by the recent crash that has shocked the crypto market. The FTX case this year has made both investors and traders panic uncontrollably because they put too much trust in centralized exchanges. Buying and withdrawing assets from a centralized exchange is the right choice for now.",

The $10,000 price before is considered a moon price but now, let's say the Bitcoin price dip on that level, it's a big crash to consider already. Remember that the current price today is a price that everyone treated as a dream price before.What I'm saying here is, just trust the process as bitcoin will just continue to move forward no matter what. Patience is the key. Instead of being panicked, why not just take advantage of the current situation as you might not see this kind of floor price again when the bitcoin price rallies again?",

So I'd thanks for those newbie who panic and then sold their coins for cheap price.Like what I reply to similar posts like these, you have to understand it from a perspective of a person who owns hundreds to thousands of cryptocurrencies at his disposal. This implies that the slightest movement of its price could mean a gain/loss of thousands of $$$ on his end. That is why, some people do fear the loss and somehow panic whenever there is a significant drop on the price of BTC.Bearing this in mind, what could be a good strategy to prevent your cryptocurrencies from dropping its price further? Again, always have a contingency plan. Trade only up to a maximum percentage of a certain value and cash them out as quickly as possible if you see a profit. A 3-5% profit is always better than a 3-10% loss.",
