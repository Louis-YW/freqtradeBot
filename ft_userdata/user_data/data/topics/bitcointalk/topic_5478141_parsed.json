  "content": "Hello,I post a message today cause I tried multiple ways to manage with my issue but I didn't find any solution. Maybe you can help me ?First my version and OS : Bitcoin Core version v24.0.1 (release build)MacOS 14.0Shell : zsh My Bitcoin full node is running with txindex=1. I'm running `./bitcoind`. Everything what I'm talking is under `./bitcoin-cli` command. I selected a wallet, and listed unspent. I want to merge multiple inputs into one single output. I selected transactions that I want to merge 3 for the test and one address to give the change. I try to build my tx from `rawtransaction` but maybe I should use another. Here I tried also `walletcreatefundedpsbt` but I got the error : Insufficient funds.So, I selected my utxos and build rawtransaction as follow : ./bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=MY_WALLET createrawtransaction \"[{\\\"txid\\\":\\\"tx_id_1\\\",\\\"vout\\\": 0, \\\"scriptPubKey\\\":\\\"Script_1\\\"}, {\\\"txid\\\":\\\"tx_id_2\\\",\\\"vout\\\": 1, \\\"scriptPubKey\\\":\\\"Script_2\\\"}, {\\\"txid\\\":\\\"tx_id_3\\\",\\\"vout\\\": 1, \\\"scriptPubKey\\\":\\\"Script_3\\\"}]\" \"[{\\\"recipient\\\" : amt}]\"Here I take the output to sign it (with `signrawtransactionwithwallet`), I got the error : {      \"txid\": \"tx_id_1\",      \"vout\": 0,      \"witness\": [      ],      \"scriptSig\": \"\",      \"sequence\": 4294967293,      \"error\": \"Witness program was passed an empty witness\" }This for all utxos.So, I tried to sign manually each ScriptPubKey as message with signmessage but I need the pvkey. When I try dumpvkey I have the error : Only legacy wallets are supported by this commandThe wallet is a taproot wallet (bc1p...). I don't know what step to follow in order to add the witness and be able to sign this raw transaction and send to the network. I think sending on the network is not the hardest part but I didn't find how to handle signatures for this... It's not a multisig wallet and I have the control of it. Do you have any ideas or suggestions ?Thanks for your reading I hope that we can solve this together",

      "body": "Ok thanks for your answer but I well double checked and info are correct. It's really during the 'signrawtransactionwithwallet' step where the problem cames out caused by Witness program was passed an empty witness.But I don't find how to manage with witness. I followed your previous step to build my first transactioon and it was good. But for this one it doesn't work.",
