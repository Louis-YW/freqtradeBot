I don't think it's the strategy of OPYes, it is highlighted as a scam here on the forum but since it's a backlink there is a possibility that the website can rank up on the SERP not here on the forum this won't rank up but it helps the website to index fast on the SERP and rank up. That's a strategy of almost all scam exchanges and other sites so that it won't look spam. Quote from: xsenselab on February 08, 2023, 11:22:56 PMTIKTOK PAID ADVERTISINGWell, tiktok is easy to manipulate there are lots of tiktok account sellers out there with followers so I guess you are attracted to the short videos they post.I'm sorry but the only way you can do is to make a scam accusation against this website on this section https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0And thanks for editing your thread and removing the link of this website.",

In any case, if you are willing to send your money to a random website after a Tik Tok ad, you would have lost your money anyway at some point. Would you buy a car without getting a driver's license?Why would you want to buy cyptos or BTC if you don't understand anything about it? If you had done at least 3 Google searches, you would have heard of Coinbase, Binance, Mexc, Coinex, Bisq, Localbitcoin...There are literally dozens of legits CEX and DEX that can be found in one google search.So if it ever helps you to accept your losses, know that with so little time invested in your research, there is a 99.99% chance that at one time or another, you will lose your money (address error, network error during a withdrawal, scam of all kinds etc...)A lesson at 300 usd is expensive but it's still better than a lesson at 3000, I don't mean to sound dismissive but this is just an uninformed beginner's mistake. Now, at least you know. Good luck for your crypto / BTC journey ! Hope that you won't be disappointed next time",

What they showed you that you believe and trust them in just a short video/text ads? That's really insane.Yes they are like Fiverr now, in fact, the Tiktok campaign is now included in many bounty campaigns, that is the worse place to find a trading platform, it's more like shilling those who promote ads on Tiktok are not real users, OP should have research first or ask the community and we will help you check if the new trading platform is legit or not, there's big risk trading on a new platform it's unheard of and they are not a good option to choose when we already have stable trading platform existing.",

They can use your ID for their other scams to make themselves appear legit and/or sell it. Although anything like taking a loan probably won't be possible with just that, I still think it's better to keep an official report of what happened to relevant authorities in your country for the sake of keeping a record. Just in case, also pay attention to some points where they can try to approach you and/or harvest more info e.g. social media.",

These Platforms are using smart way to trick people and one trick that i have seen is viral videos on TikTok for easy Arbitrage and they share this same Platform design just with a different Domain name and they explain how to buy bitcoin with a cheaper price and sell it in another legit Platform. But once you buy from that scam Platform your account get banned or you won’t be able to withdraw it",

Sad for your loss, but again, do not believe any advertisements on TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, or even here in the forum. There are many scam exchange and trading platforms whose owners are paying some money to promote it and target victims. Doing research will cost you only some time and If you do not have time to do research, do not try or register on any platform that you do not know.I was really happy because after you contacted support and told you that their automatic system needs to verify you by making deposit more, you did not deposit, and you did not lose more of your funds. You should consider this a harsh lesson for you so that you do not repeat your mistake again.And thank you for warning members of this scam trading platform",
