I am right or notIt's a tad bit difficult to follow your question... But if i interpreted it correctly then: yes, you only need the seed phrase to restore your wallet or you can move the wallet file. When it comes to being able to spend your unspent outputs, both methods yield the same result.The wallet file potentially contains meta-data (like labels), if you move the wallet file from computer 1 to computer 2, you also get to keep the meta-data on computer 2, if you use the seed phrase to restore your wallet on computer 2, you lose information like labels (unless you use a plugin to synchronise the meta-data)",

I happened to fine myself in situations where I installed a window wallet (not a popular wallet). It was a wallet that was meant for a particular altcoin, which I lost where I saved the seed phrase to the wallet, but I happened to save the wallet data after I used it to perform a few transactions. When I needed to move the left funds in there, I just pulled the hard disc from the old device. Since the system was already bad, I moved the data into the new device, and I was able to access it. But what I didn't try out was, with the backup data on my old device moved to the new device, would I have been able to retrieve the seed phrase that belongs to that wallet from the wallet security option?",

I am right or notI believe English isn't your native language so it is difficult for me to understand your question, but to restore your wallet, you need either the seed phrase or your private key. If you have the wallet file and the password, you'll also have access to your wallet and you can move it from one device to another. Take note that you should always have a backup of your seed phrase even if you have your wallet file, in the event that you forget your wallet password or you lose the file, you will be able to recover your wallet easily.Quote from: Orpichukwu on October 03, 2023, 11:47:13 AMBut what I didn't try out was, with the backup data on my old device moved to the new device, would I have been able to retrieve the seed phrase that belongs to that wallet from the wallet security option?If you have your wallet file and you also know the password, then you can always view your seed phrase and other wallet secrets in your wallet file. Your question is hard to understand, but i think this is your query right?",

I think having both backups can be good because one can be the last resort. So far the file backup is encrypted.",

Of course, the wallet file would contain the master private key and that can be used for deriving all the private keys.",

I am right or not Just forget about the wallet 1 or wallet 2. On a new build, you follow what the link given by @OmegaStarScream and what is written there. You just need your seed phrase and that is enough to build the wallet on your new computer.I have been through the same, hence I can confirm it from my side. Its easy but make sure your script type and derivation paths are correct.Follow up with any other questions if you have. Otherwise query seems to be solved.",

I am right or notIt's just simple way to do, ( you don't need to already the seed phrase) just copy wallet file (default wallet 1) to a flash disk and open computer 2.open Electrum wallet on computer 2 and create a new wallet, select choose then, choose default Wallet 1 on your flash disk. In this way, you don't need to set data like contact, address, or anything again. You just move that file to another PC. So if you want to try this, do it offline!",
