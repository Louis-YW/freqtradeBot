Last I checked they do stuff with cryptocurrency and operate in the UK and  might be worth looking into if the banks near you wont get with the times.",

From the above mentioned, I think Revolut is more crypto-friendly.",

I am from the United kingdom and would like to know the safest way to withdraw my crypto and put it in a bank thank you for your comments If you go to a bank and ask about crypto, it seems like most of the answers will be the same. Not all employees at banks understand crypto and maybe they only know that crypto is dangerous and so on. So they of course give advice about not investing in crypto. it could even be that they will actually offer their products to invest in them. ha ha haIn this case, the basic question is, how is crypto in your country? Is it legal or illegal? In my country's experience, crypto is legal as a commodity asset but not legal as a means of payment or currency. However, my country has several local exchanges which are already under government regulation. So, we can choose several bank accounts provided automatically by local exchanges so that we can make deposits or withdrawals very easily, with low costs and very fast time. And so far I've had no problem doing that. There's no need to go to the bank here, so go straight to the local exchange platform and make a fiat withdrawal to our bank account. However, maybe it is different in your country, so first understand what is happening in your country and whether there is a local exchange that provides direct withdrawals to your personal bank account, so you don't need to come directly to ask the destination bank first.",

Because exchange would have partnerships only with a few banks, not with all the banks in your country. You have to find available options on your exchange to withdraw. You have to comply with government rules and taxation. Otherwise, you have to sell P2P and make cash deposits to your banks.

There is no hassle and no need to go to any bank agent. Bank authorities will never take cognizance of issues related to cryptocurrencies. Especially if Bitcoin is not legal in the country. I think it's better for the OP to transfer money directly from his exchange to his bank using p2p instead of going to different banks and asking for help from bank agents. Op If you want to use p2p, you have to complete the KYC verification from the exchange and then add the payment method bank account in p2p.Picture number 1Picture number 2Picture number 3",

I am from the United kingdom and would like to know the safest way to withdraw my crypto and put it in a bank thank you for your comments My first question would be: Did you ask about withdrawing money or withdrawing crypto? Because i don't know any banks that would allow crypto deposits, just money profits from it.And what banks were you trying? and have you tried Revolut? That should be very crypto friendly, if you consider them as a \"real\" bank. I just had to do quick check and according to google UK has several other crypto friendly banks, so that makes me wonder what exactly they said? Because with large crypto exchange fiat money withdraws you still would need to prove the origin of the money. Like where you did get the crypto for it and proof for that. Maybe they meant that they will freeze your account if you don't provide all the details for the money you are depositing.But if you really can't open crypto friendly bank account in UK, then have you considered to have an account in bank of another crypto friendly country and using their visa or something? Just don't try to withdraw money from there to hostile banks as they most likely will freeze your money if they suspect it has crypto origins.",

The big problem is when your fiat money lands in a bank, the bank will take it upon themselves to freeze your account and this is what i was told. I went to move a 6 figure sum to the bank which only permits you to spend 5k a month on crypto. I hope people read this and are aware of the risk and be careful.",

So if your bank service provider is not crypto friendly then close all your bank accounts and only keep one that is the way of telling who is working for who. Still you can convert your crypto to fiat with no issue at all via p2p exchanges and they can't flag those transactions as crypto because its coming from other individual bank account.",

I am from the United kingdom and would like to know the safest way to withdraw my crypto and put it in a bank thank you for your comments The central bank in my country has banned banks from facilitating crypto transactions, but the ban has not affected our cryptocurrency transactions. We rely on p2p and exchanges for our crypto to fiat transactions, we can do direct p2p were you send coins into are a recipient's wallet and he sends fiat as agreed into your bank account. We also do p2p transactions on exchanges like Binance, where we transact with exchange Marchants, pay him coins through the exchange and the Marchant pays agreed amount of fiat into your bank account.Bitcoin is decentralized and if works in Nigeria, then definitely it'll work in the UK. So if the banks are frustrating your crypto transactions then you can try the method that I mentioned above.",

So in cases like this what I do is, I send my crypto from my wallet to an exchange account, and from there I use the P2P trade to locate a buyer that would send me fiat to my bank account, the process is as simple as ABC you just need to have basic knowledge on how the exchange works and you'll be good. I would like to recommend binance exchange for you because, that is what I use most og the time, though it's not safe to keep you crypto in any exchange for long except you are willing to loose them, so it better to use an exchange only when you want to trade to your bank or buy crypto.",
