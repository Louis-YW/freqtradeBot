Look at the SEC targeting Binance in the USA.... and trying to take it down.  The only reason why they are doing this, is the potential threat that it is posing to their control. Third world countries wants to break free from the hold that are being put on their economies by first world countries with their strong reserve currencies. (Let's rather say... manipulated Fiat currencies)",

Whatever their reasons, cryptocurrencies won't wait for anybody,  whoever sees the need to own some cryptocoins needs to do the needful!",

      "body": "Getting officially licensed is, on the one hand, always a good step - it means there is some clarity in regards of legislation for crypto. On the other hand I wish there was a way to make more people aware of DEX alternatives. Right now I think there is a lack of knowledge regarding the fact that there are independent solutions that don't need another centralized middleman.That said, this license will provide at least some sort of security for customers having funds on mercado exchange. I'd still strongly advice against keeping any assets on any kind of exchange for longer than what's needed to make a trade.",
