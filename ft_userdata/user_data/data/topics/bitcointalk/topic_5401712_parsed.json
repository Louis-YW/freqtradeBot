  "content": "Hi, I installed Electrum-4.2.2 on Linux Lite 6.0, but when I try to launch the app, it won't start and the console shows the following errors:Code:[...]  File \"/home/jack/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/electrum/paymentrequest_pb2.py\", line 36, in <module>    _descriptor.FieldDescriptor(  File \"/home/jack/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/google/protobuf/descriptor.py\", line 560, in __new__    _message.Message._CheckCalledFromGeneratedFile()TypeError: Descriptors cannot not be created directly.If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are: 1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower. 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).Am I missing any library?",

You can downgrade the library using:Code:pip install protobuf==3.20.1Since this is a runtime error, you should probably create a virtualenv before/after doing this so that subsequent installs of completely unrelated packages don't alter the protobuf version that you installed manually. It can happen e.g. if you install a lot of python-based programs e.g. youtube-dl or you have a Python environment such as Anaconda.Something like this, since you're installing & running Electrum from the command-line:Code:python3 -m venv electrumsource electrum/bin/activate<install electrum & protobuf, and run electrum here>deactivate # To get out of the virtualenv - just `deactivate` works.",
