  "content": "You can report anything that is related to boosting the confidence of the Indian community. You should not share fake news! It is important that you share news from trusted media outlets globally. I mean any news that has some significance & that is relatable to the development of the community can be posted here. This will be a self-moderated thread, which means that you do need to read the basic rules before posting anything here. What makes a piece of news significant?If it is being reposted by multiple media outlets. As an example, you can check this news - Crypto Ban May Not Be Best Approach to Balance Risk, Demand: IMFCan we submit Youtube videos that are relevant?Yes, you are allowed to share those videos on this thread. Please ensure that the news/info is coming from an influencer that has credibility and has got an accepted following. My understanding of the following is 50k and above. There are some with small following still, they provide incredible depth and reasoning on a particular topic then do post it. I will view it and if I feel the video is suitable to be added to this thread, I will allow it.  Any rank requirement for posting?Yes, only Jr. members and above.  Sharing an example on how to post on this threadI am sharing another example of positive news only focused on the Indian community, that I found on a Youtube channel. I won't be going into the background of this channel. The reason being you all would know this guy, if not then it is your problem! I am talking about Ranveer Allahbadia. I follow his channel and recently he has been interviewing cabinet ministers of the Indian government. Some of you might see it as propaganda or lies as this about a particular political party.Without wasting any time let's start with what happened today. To my surprise youtube algorithm promoted a video which was an interview with Rajeev Chandrashekar. I confess I have been following a lot of crypto influencers & influencers who are blatant about the negative attitude of the government. The topic of importance starts at 13:55 where Rajeev Chandrashekar talks about Web3, cryptocurrency regulation for India, and how India will lead this industry. Here is the link!",
