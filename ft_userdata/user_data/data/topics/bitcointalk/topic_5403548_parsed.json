There are far fewer transgender athletes in the classic male and female categories. So I wouldn't mind betting on transgender sports, but I doubt there are enough of them in some sports to make them competitive. Take football, for example. There aren't enough trans people to set up a football league in any country, let alone a top level one, let alone one that can compete in terms of interest with the UEFA Champions League. Or the major national leagues.In individual sports there may be a little more scope for interest, though.",

It will surely get a buzz for the first week of any transgender event and then slowly get to the popularity it deserves. To be honest, the percentage of transgender male/female in the world is less that 0.4% of the world population. In that 0.4% you are trying to hire the most athletic person interested in having a career in sports. The odds that a competitive and worth watching league is created is kinda low. That's just my opinion though, lets see how it pans out.",

However, I don't think that there will be a huge market for these events as the only main difference is their gender but still, there's a chance that at least one sports event will have a good market for transgender people.",

Hard to pick a side for this topic since discrimination will also be raised just like the transgender who joined the beauty pageant.

Transgender women playing against actual women doesn't seem fair to me and this will deviate the odds.Sports bookies would definitely stay away from sports, where the competition isn't fair and it's possible for the result to be predicted.I think that there will be separate sports events and contests for transgender people only.

Transgender was changed from a male or female to an opposite sex by doctors in hospital in support to the person's willingness to transform into an opposite sex, this should even nullifies them to compete in sport competitions, those that supposed to be recognized should be males and females that are physically fit and also people that are physically challenged. You are not wrong that transgender people are not many but even if they are many, they should be best be excluded from participation or maybe the world wants to be in support of it. But there are still sport that is meant for not many people that they can participate like in running, jumping, table, lawn tennis and many others.",

Regardless of their philosophical bullshits, or any other science-based research, I am certain that there will still be issues and will just result in neverending debate.Is this a solution? Of course not! Even if you say that they are all trans, governing bodies should still impose rules in terms of their body measurements or even perhaps genetics?",

If there was a nationwide if trans sport people should be included in female sport or not, I am sure there wouldn't be a 50% majority. Another thing is also, why are there no woman who want to be men and compete in men sports? Because they would have no chance, so why allow it the other way round?Now if there will be trans leagues coming up and showing their sport events, I don't expect many viewers for it. Just by looking at the difference between male and female sports we see that most people are just not interested in female sports. Why would they now start watching trans sports. Also are there even enough trans athletes to compete against each other? If there are no real tournaments or competition that there will also be no betting market for it.
