  "content": "This is a discussion topic, not an accusation to Dabs.I was reading the thread by nullius  and checked the profile of Dabs. It shows 5 DT positive feedback according to my trust list but later on when I tried with ;dt, I found it 40 positive feedback. That's why I was checking who were they. No personal issue but I found some DT feedback which was left by people who were only trusted by Dabs.Here is the detail of some DT members who left feedback to Dabs.1. Voxterra- 1 feedback leftVoxterra's judgement is Trusted by:1. Dabs (Trust:  +9 / =0 / -0) (DT1! (3) 888 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)2. BitBot.V2- 1 feedback leftBitBot.V2's judgement is Trusted by:1. Dabs (Trust:  +9 / =0 / -0) (DT1! (3) 888 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)3. ma7555- 2 feedback leftma7555's judgement is Trusted by:1. Dabs (Trust:  +9 / =0 / -0) (DT1! (3) 888 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)4. Frank Lefty Rosenthal- 5 feedback leftFrank Lefty Rosenthal's judgement is Trusted by:1. Dabs (Trust:  +9 / =0 / -0) (DT1!

(3) 888 Merit earned) (Trust list) (BPIP)And continues.Please keep in mind that according to the feedback sent/received, all of them have traded with Dabs as we know Dabs has/had escrow service on the forum.Also, note that Dabs have this list from long ago. It's not something like he has recently added them. I can see most of them from 25th January 2019 from Loyce.club- https://loyce.club/trust/2019-01-25_Fri_22.33h/54791.htmlMost of these people are old members of the forum. Dabs has included most of the members in their trust list who left him positive feedback.Do you think this is an abuse to increase the trust score?",

I don't think that's the best way to use the Trust system.Last time I fell off of DT1 I used the opportunity to clean up my inclusion/exclusion list and for one reason or another I decided to remove Dabs from my exclusions.  Maybe he hadn't been included in DT1 in a while because the number of exclusions?  I don't remember, but I just excluded him again.I did remove at least one exclusion of a member who was guilty of self-scratching in the past, but he had recently obliterated his trust list so there was no point in keeping him on the list.Personally, I do see it as an abuse of the trust system, and when I notice a DT member who engages in self-scratching I usually exclude him.   Not because I don't want to see their reviews, but because it strikes me as a lack of critical judgement, or a lack of understanding of how the trust system works.",

Not these users. Assuming Debs knowingly added this users in his trust setting after seeing their feedback for him. If his intention was higher up his green ratings then this is an abuse. If he thought these users should be in DT because they can provide good contribution to the system then it's not abuse.

      "body": "From recollection, I haven't had anything to do with Dabs in the past.  I saw a previous thread raising this issue of supposed mutual trust back scratching - call it what you like...  This time with the issue again being raised, I thought I'll have a look both at Dabs (via their own signature and the threads they have created in the past) and those who have benefited from mutual trust feedback.Early threads created by Dabs have a combination of topics - e.g. group buys, loan requests and attempts to start (multiple) casinos are prominent.Is Dabs still an Escrow?  Their Escrow thread fizzles out in 2018 along with positive trust feedback reviews around the same time.  How active in the forum are these givers of positive trust feedback?  If they are not every active they *may* be unaware their positives are being tut-tutted...  (which in turn lends itself to the premise that Dabs is bosting them to in turn boost himself)Interesting that SolarisDev announce Dabs as their Escrow for an airdrop, however, on the website for the Solaris Coin Dabs is listed as an \"Ambassador\" and I can't find a clarification of the roll Dabs has within Solaris Coin's thread/website.Also interesting that cabalsim13 came to Dabs on the 19th of March 2019 with a proposal to re-invigorate Dab's Charity food program by neco-bumping Dab's already three year stale charity thread.Six days later the thread Bitcointalk Charity Program - Give Hope To Everyone! was created (and the rest as they say is history   ).Less than six months after that Dabs is now the one asking for food to feed their family in their own charity food program thread.Of those who have been inactive for more than 999 days, there are two subsets:These users are bumped to DT2 solely by Dabs - most of these users only trust feedback is to Dabs.Dropkickdragout      Registration Date:6/9/2011 3:15:27 AM (Active 2951 days ago) iguru42         Registration Date:6/17/2011 2:18:02 AM (Active 2370 days ago) yolo2222      Registration Date:12/15/2012 5:53:06 PM (Active 3243 days ago) shawshankinmate37927   Registration Date:2/23/2013 12:04:02 AM (Active 2328 days ago)FullLife      Registration Date:3/4/2013 3:28:46 AM (Active 2315 days ago) mavrick951      Registration Date:4/15/2013 3:46:40 PM (Active 2330 days ago) chanberg      Registration Date:4/21/2013 4:44:42 AM (Active 1465 days ago) Micky25         Registration Date:4/28/2013 9:10:59 AM (Active 1125 days ago) Bakal          Registration Date:5/17/2013 1:19:14 PM (Active 1504 days ago) shade13         Registration Date:7/3/2013 2:06:50 AM (Active 2999 days ago) DyslexicZombei      Registration Date:7/25/2013 8:04:18 PM (Active 1636 days ago)nagysifa      Registration Date:4/30/2014 6:22:18 PM (Active 1481 days ago) ZypheronBits      Registration Date:10/31/2014 6:51:42 PM (Active 2385 days ago) bittrojan      Registration Date:9/4/2015 2:42:49 AM (Active 1570 days ago) Frank Lefty Rosenthal   Registration Date:12/17/2016 12:03:52 PM (Active 1227 days ago) These users are either bumped to DT2 by Dabs but they do not give Dabs trust feedback (of any kind)gudmunsn      Registration Date:4/22/2013 9:33:25 PM (Active 2508 days ago) gloryninja      Registration Date:9/3/2013 11:19:01 PM (Active 1587 days ago) bitclever      Registration Date:3/26/2015 6:20:16 AM (Active 2161 days ago) eldrin         Registration Date:7/15/2017 12:21:16 PM (Active 1142 days ago) funnychain      Registration Date:9/2/2018 12:52:46 PM (Active 1098 days ago)(note red denotes banned)note also - at no point do I consider any of the above to be alts.",
