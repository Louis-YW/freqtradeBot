If they offer huge prizes to their lottery bettor then provably will take a chance to participate since many would try to test their luck if they can win a huge price on lottery.Quote from: Team_MegaPari on April 11, 2023, 10:07:11 AM-Do you track the progress and results of such campaigns?

I know that's not the exact numbers I'm just giving an example. I have not kept up with any lottery type promotion you have done but if they require a user to deposit and that users deposit has a playthrough before they can wd, I'd feel like i'm wasting time depositing when I can play elsewhere and just get rakeback or a daily surprise based on my play the day before.",

I think having a KYC free promotion will make the user here more engaged since most user preferred to play anonymously which other casino offered for a normal gambler that playing using a small bankroll.",

All in all, any discussion on the topic is welcome c: I'd say it depends on what it means to \"engage\" with your audience, if it was actively communicating with them through tourney-esque events, then yea lotteries can be one, but you shouldn't limit your engagements with only something like lotteries. To answer the questions, yes I do sometimes whenever my sessions coincide with it or whenever I actually notice they're doing one. I usually just enjoy whatever they give me at the moment, I don't really actively chase it around or something so it's really whatever for me, I play if I can if I don't then that's that.

Freespins for example?  I guess those are a few samples of consolations you can add, but I'd suppose a lot would prefer withdrawable money instead since most bonuses and/or rewards are pretty much locked to us needing to spend it to the casino itself. Other than those maybe some kind of custom tourney tickets maybe? Might be a bit too complicated by then though.",

      "body": "Well, we could say that lottery is more accessible to players both casual and actual gamblers. One reason is the fact that most of the lotteries are registered under government sector simply because it is taxed, therefore it is allowed to operate to some countries inspite of prohibition with gambling activities. I'd say the drive that a player would feel in lotteries could be a bdrige for them to be more thrilled with other gambling games. It won't be an instant addiction because that would depend solely to the player whether he/she would be too dragged with the idea of earning money easily and in an instant.Quote from: ufaiz50 on April 11, 2023, 11:22:38 AMI am not actually sure, maybe you should open a poll to know how many people are interested with the lotteries but personally I think the good way to engage with gamblers is through good promotions, actually a lot of promotions to be given to the users as that would keep them playing in the website if they know there's a lot of perks they can receive through promotion and seasonal promotion like Halloween, Christmas or if there's a major league you can have seasonal promotions to those and I think that's what players wanted rather than lottery. In terms of making a player stay on a certain gambling platform, it won't depend alone with bonuses and promotions. Other factors would also be considered by players to continue playing and not to stop in an instant. To name a few is overall gambling experience which could be in form of games being offered. Ofcourse anyone would bore out playing one gambling game only.",
