It is very simple, do not interact with the topic or don't create a topic that you do not know, be a genuine poster here in the forum so that you can avoid copy-pasting offense. As a newbie --it is good if you will read a lot more than posting a topic like this that already existed.No offense but plagiarism is everywhere on the platform's rules and is strictly prohibited, we all know this.",

It's great to have shitposters banned, the decent posters usually figure out the rules on their own.And to the most important you just need to participate in the discussion and be orginal in your posting.But the shitposters needs to be kick out on the forum who desperately share those posts or ideas of other to be portrayed as their own.Speaking about decent posters they follow up the all the rules and regulations on the forum and even not they are original in their ideas and have zeal to learn on the forum.But those who are into earning some amounts on the forum and are introduced to it as some income source want to rank up on the forum as soon they can so choose this shortcut but are caught and banned on the forum.",

It will be a shame to have built a solid account and good reputation only to have plagiarized articles being discovered on your account. The price for plagiarism is a big one to pay, though I read the mods judge based on case by case basis, you can find some ban appeal threads of banned users on Meta.",

Back in the college the word plagiarism was explained and it was also frowned upon so anyone who is found committing the offense did not start it today the idea of stealing and cheating has been with such person.",

Once again thanks for the amazing lessons so far, I really do appreciate. Thank you I understand that you want to prove yourself as a newbie but having a similar post all over within a short interval is where you get it wrong. It's okay to ask questions or give suggestions on what newbies should avoid doing before proving your points to newbies that are in the forumYou don't need to create a new post now and then before your message gets to newbies. This forum is not circled advising only newbies.",
