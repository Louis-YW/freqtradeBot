  "content": "Over the week, a friend and I had a conversation about loans and loan apps and she shared a bitter experience of how she was unable to write a very important exam because the money meant for payment of fees to qualify for that exam was deducted by a certain loan app that she collected money from a while ago.  Who will you really blame? My friend for not paying up as at when due or the loan app for not notifying her before the deduction. In all, I advice that we should try to avoid any business with loan apps as they seem to be very numerous these days and are easily accessible. Most importantly, You should know that you are at the danger of developing a habit of borrowing from them if you patronise loan apps even for the smallest amount.",

Therefore, it is better to limit yourself to something than to cause yourself a bunch of problems afterward.In my country, it is very easy to get a loan. No documents with the provision of a person's employment are needed to provide a guarantor of return. Microcredits are especially developed. But when it comes time to repay, there is a completely different amount that the borrower does not expect to see, since some obligations are written in small print, and people most often do not pay attention to them.Credit life is like a bird in a cage.",

Watch Dirty money on Netflix, it's a very informative docu-series.Awesome, I hadn't noticed that in the god-awful Netflix display page of their movies and TV series, and I appreciate you taking the time to mention it.  I just found it and am going to watch it, probably after this post.I'm not familiar with loan apps, but based on what I know about hard money lenders, payday lenders, and the like I'm sure OP's friend got ripped off somehow.  Those services are basically the worst form of usury, and they really should be illegal in the US.  I'm not even sure how they're regulated, but even if they are they're profiting from desperate people and that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  They're worse than drug dealers.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on July 17, 2022, 03:01:03 AMI was always brought up by the rule of \"live within your means.\" Everyone should do that, but you and I both know what the reality is.  I don't know about other countries, but in the states everyone has a credit card, and a lot of them are maxed out.  People buy homes that they're slaves to based on their mortgage rates and cars they have to finance, etc., etc.  The rule that I've stuck to for the last 20 years is if I can't buy it with cash, I don't buy it.  Saves me a lot of headaches.",

Most importantly, You should know that you are at the danger of developing a habit of borrowing from them if you patronise loan apps even for the smallest amount.I remember seeing somewhere some time ago that the biggest business in the world is not drugs, nor arms, nor prostitution. It is debt, considered globally: mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and all kinds of credit. The problem today is the ease with which impulsive people, of which there are many, can get a loan in a short time from their cell phones. This has made, for example, that people who lose everything they have in the casino can ask for a loan from their mobile, have the money in their account instantly or in a short time and continue betting, to lose everything most of the time. But then comes the hangover, you have to pay back what you lost, sometimes during years. It is best to try to avoid debt, with some exceptions, such as a mortgage to buy a house.",

Young subjects used to broker with people who needed money. And perhaps not much to say when it is all bad money, taking advantage of ignorance to foreclose on borrowers with exponential costs. So, be more cautious when borrowing money anywhere, but it is best to avoid material constraints related to money, don't make things difficult for yourself and become poorer.",

This is nothing but taking the loan from then and paying back the money with stipulated timeline. If you do not payback the amount then obviously as default you will be charged interest on the amount. These services are high risk and can affect your CIBIL score directly.

Many loan applications are from companies that are not registered with the government so that they determine independent regulatory decisions with the highest loan interest rates, billing regulations are not in accordance with procedures because they forcibly confiscate goods from borrowers and threaten the safety of borrowers if they are not repaid.

Modern day loan sharks moved into the digital world. That was pretty much expected.I don't know who is to blame for your friend's situation. Maybe she's guilty for using such \"loan app\". When you are really desperate for money and someone gives you a loan without collateral there will be hidden fees and terms for sure. Those loan sharks are searching for poor people with no financial discipline. It's really easy to fall into a trap, if you don't know what you are doing. The people, who are desperate enough to borrow money from such companies have to read the fine print on the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.Blaming the loan company for not sending a notification isn't serious. If you have to pay for a bank loan/mortgage would you miss the payment only because the bank didn't sent you a notification?",
