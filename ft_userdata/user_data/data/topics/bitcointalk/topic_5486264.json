Also, a long time has passed now since the emails were sent.The archive is incomplete and contains only emails from my address @cc.hut.fi. My university email addresses changed to @aalto.fi in early 2011, and I don't have backups of those emails.There are some passwords and a street address mentioned in the emails, but those are no longer valid or relevant.",

I agree that these ongoing lawsuits bring up new information that can help us better understand the history and the people involved - it's a silver lining, as you mentioned, in an otherwise contentious situation.",

Satoshi actually continued to respond to emails even in 2011. The last email coming from Satoshi in this compilation alone was already in February of 2011. And there must probably be more. God knows who else Satoshi corresponded with away from the public.It's no secret that Satoshi continued to communicate privately with some people long after he left the forum, and the alleged last communication happened on April 26, 2011, at least according to Andresen. Perhaps the time has finally come for all private e-mails that do not threaten Satoshi's privacy to be finally published - and for those who collaborated with him to once again contribute to the truth about Bitcoin.Quote from: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-happened-when-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-disappearedThe alleged final break between Satoshi and his collaborators would come on April 26, 2011.According to records from Andresen, Satoshi sent him an email that day in which he asked him to downplay the idea he was a “mysterious shadowy figure,” at the time adopting a short and reproachful tone to the project’s new “technical lead.”**\"The press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your contributors; it helps motivate them,” Satoshi wrote.This was followed by a separate message that contained only a copy of the cryptographic key to Bitcoin’s alert system, one that effectively gave Andresen sole control over security notifications.In response, Andresen would acknowledge the advice, but he quickly moved to more pressing matters, informing Satoshi about his intentions to attend an “annual conference on emerging technologies for US intelligence.”**@theymos, you once mentioned the possibility that private forum messages belonging to Satoshi will one day be published, is there any chance of that happening now or in the near future?",

I'm convinced that nobody will ever identify Satoshi no matter what info comes out, so I'm not worried about that, but I am concerned about the privacy of those who communicated with him. For example, kiba once said that he tried to send a gift to Satoshi, but Satoshi declined (reportedly saying something like \"I already have plenty of BTC\"). If the PMs for this exchange exist in the database and hypothetically look like this:Quotekiba: Hey, I know it's worth peanuts, but do you want a gift of 10k BTC?satoshi: lol, no thanks scrubThen it would put a big target on kiba's back. (This is only a hypothetical example: in reality, kiba never published the amount he offered Satoshi, if any amount was even specified.) Even if I screened the PMs in advance for obvious stuff like this, it's impossible to find everything. Eg. maybe someone who talked to Satoshi was trying to be anonymous, but people are able to find him just based on his writing style or knowledge.I do think that there could be historically-relevant info in there, so maybe if Bitcoin has taken over the world in like 50 years and historians are clamoring to know more about its history, I or my successors could be convinced to revisit the issue. Or maybe not; don't get your hopes up. (I still haven't read the PMs, BTW; maybe they're all really boring.)",

I wonder how Roger Ver ended up buying the domain, or if Satoshi was referring to him here.- It appears very clear that he was doing this work by himself, and then started to contact other people, one by one through email, and by groups through email lists. Based on the emails, Bitcoin really doesn't seem to have been created by a group as some people speculate.- Satoshi mainly used Windows and was not great with Linux, but used MinGW as the main compiler (MinGW provides GCC to Windows, which is a Linux compiler), and only the Microsoft compiler (mentioned as VC) for debugging.- The use of the word \"goofball\" makes me think of at least some American heritage.Amazing read, thanks for this.",
