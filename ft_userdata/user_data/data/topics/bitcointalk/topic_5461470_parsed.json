The best help to offer family is to put yourself in a better financial position,  don't struggle to help family,  struggle to put yourself in a better financial position then take away your from dependency. How do you take them away from dependency?

The second reason why you can never become rich is not knowing how to use money. There are several ways money can be use :  spending,  savings,  and investing.  Many of us already know about spending and even when we spend we spend on things that are not really needed but just to impress people who don't care about you.Buying liabilities,  things that doesn't have value five years from now.  Many save but even when money is saved,  it is done to spend and not to invest and the only way to become rich is to invest and not by savings.  So , invest in assets and not liabilities.",

I don't know what family relationship you're talking about, if it's between your siblings, your spouse, your parents, and your loved ones. I would object to your first reason. Because we work hard, finding ways to be financially free is also taking care of them, not just ourselves. Furthermore, without those people, I bet you wouldn't be where you are today, so it's not right to consider them a burden. It's a responsibility that everyone has to shoulder, you can't selfishly deny them. Many people can still become rich but still be with their loved ones, so I disagree with your reasoning.",

Its easy to say all of that but its hard to be done so the best way to have progress is to find more ways on how you can get another source of income, you will never get rich if you only have one job and it will be worst if you rely on 9-5 since your life will be miserable with that set up.",

Children when they turn on legal age to work usually working just to sustain the parents and never have spare money to start on his own family. This poverty cycle start when this working son/daughter decided to start his own family while still sustaining his/her parents. This cycle will continue to the new child and so on just because people keep building family even if they are still not financially established.",

The question is, have you done it?The problem is not that we don't dare to pressure our families to work harder and as if we don't care. Within the family, there are bonds that cannot be separated, such as our responsibility to the family that has brought us to this point thanks to the sweat they have spent in the form of wealth, energy, and thoughts. As people who know reciprocity, we have an obligation to be able to give it to those who have struggled. Nothing wrong right? Life is not always about being rich, because it's useless to be rich but don't know how to pay for it. There is such a thing as empathy, a sense of responsibility, and care for the family where we remember the services of others. Everything that is achieved is not necessarily your own ability, there are external and internal drives involved in it. Shaping us to be more responsible people.",

I think they would also do the same if I had their needs and helpTalking about wealth and financial freedom, the way to get it is by doing business and entrepreneurship. If we are always employees, then financial independence will be difficult to obtain, although it may be realized. However, if you look at the list of the 100 richest people, most of them are businessmen and investors. So, to become a rich person is not by letting go of the family burden but starting a business and investing",

If someone want to become rich, a person must be able to make savings from expenses every month so that he still has money to save. But once again, with the current economic situation, it's not easy for someone who works in an office or company to save money.We may have tried to save money and not buy things we don't need. But sudden needs must always be met immediately and other sudden demands. But we could still work on it if getting rich was our goal.And by having an investment, we can prepare for the future to be better than now. And, with this investment, we hope to get benefits in the future so that our lives can change for the better. But if it's about family, I think almost everyone would want to help their family, especially if it involves their parents.",

In Asian culture, when you're the eldest, it's quite common to be cursed with this \"responsibility\". I know you're speaking for the general like having a family as father/mother, but this is another reason why it is not common for people here in my country to be a rich individual. Once you hit the genetic lottery of being the eldest one in the family, depending on what type of family you grew, you might be screwed since every burdens of your family and that includes your parents debt will be passed into you.Unless you have the balls to separate from your family at the legal age which I believe is a common culture in 1st world countries, then you're almost never going to be rich. You might not be poor, but you'll just be average and thank fucking God, I am not a spoiled one.Quote from: Y3shot on July 30, 2023, 11:42:58 AMThe second reason why you can never become rich is not knowing how to use money.

If you have a middle class family with kids less than 3, it is not impossible to get rich. You just need to play your cards right. If you get high grades and go to a fairly good college, start a business or have a good paying job (like being a doctor), you can become rich in less than 20 years. If you are lucky, you will have enough money to get retired in your 40's, if not you will work till your 50's. As you see age is an important aspect too. Being rich in your 20's and 30's is a lot more attractive than getting it in your 50's. You just have to start thinking about all that while you are very, very young.",

Money management is important but it's just too basic so just rule out it.3. Everyone knows that we need to buy assets, not liabilities but what they are ignorant is can't differentiate assets from liabilities for example a house can be both an asset and a liability too so one who is intelligent enough to identify will has a better chance of becoming rich.",

Now, you may or may not help your family, that is your choice because I don't think that it is our responsibility either as we are not born in this world to help them but as a human, it's just hard to neglect that and that is why it seems like it is our responsibility even if there is no written rule for that. Remember that is much better if you have a family to depend on, not financially, but someone to run on.My advise would be, help yourself first because you cannot help others if you yourself is not yet on the position. Just like building a house and stacking bricks to build a wall, you cannot finish your house if you will always give those bricks for them. But that's just situational because we all have our own different choice to make.",
