Due to this decentralised nature, no government is able to impose tax on Bitcoins and to be honest people really loving it when they are not forced to pay additional money.",

If we look at the good side of Bitcoin, there are many things that can be done and currently, some people are controlling the entire market. Whenever the market is out of their hands, everything will be better and the price of Bitcoin will increase. Also, its usage will increase you will see currently many online shops and offline usage of Bitcoin is increasing on the other hand if you look at banks there are also many frauds it is actually an open secret.",

I am not sure you are correct about this. The buyer might not agree to bear the transaction fee and likewise the seller. Since coffee price is not expensive, people resort to using Lightning network for such payment. The last time I checked LN network rate of adoption, it is not progressing that very fast.Quote from: Silent Sam on September 03, 2022, 07:19:28 AMBitcoin was created by software people who wanted to hack the financial world and produce a better system after the request collapse in 2008. How did you come about the above information? Was Satoshi the head of the group that wanted to hack the financial world or is Satoshi the name of the group?You can say that the 2008 financial collapse necessitated the creation of bitcoin by Satoshi and not otherwise.  Bitcoin was created by Satoshi not group of hackers or software people.",

This is one of the many tests for people who really acknowledge or are really into Bitcoin or really know how Bitcoin works.Because there are a lot of people that only got into Bitcoin just for the money or investment and when the price of Bitcoin is suffering or due to high volatility, then intended to ignore Bitcoin too, and some of them don't really know how Bitcoin works.",

Bitcoin doesn't want to hack the global financial system rather Bitcoin only provides a better alternative to the traditional financial system.",

For this reason it got stamped as the currency developed for the illegal needs. So, it have crossed several good, bad and now it has gained importance as payment asset and investment.
