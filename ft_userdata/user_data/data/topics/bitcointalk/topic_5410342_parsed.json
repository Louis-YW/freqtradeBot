And i don’t think there much things to do about this except warning others from using this casino if you could prove their scam first.",

In addition to all the respectable casinos, you should really refrain from those that have a bad reputation - do your research first, and only then make a deposit and play.https://www.trustpilot.com/review/betchain.com",

That way it will be easy for us to understand what is happening.NOTE: I also recommend that if 7 days go by without them solving your case and ignoring you then you can raise a flag against themQuote from: fortunecrypto on August 18, 2022, 12:40:00 PMChecking this section there are already 7 scam accusations against Betchain but on this particular thread  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5257873.0, Askgamblers was a third party to resolve the complaint although the dispute was in favor of Betchain, you can try to file a complaint against Betchain on Askgamblers if you have a good case the finding could be in your favor, the representative is not active here anymore but since the site is still up this thread will still have an impact on Betchain.It's strange that the casino rep's account doesn't even have neutral feedback alerting these accusations, it seems that either they are very busy and that's why they take a long time to solve people's problems or they are very lucky to the point that no one leaves any feedback on their account",

Why respond positively to my request and then refuse to withdraw the winnings again? Has anyone encountered this before? Has there been some misunderstanding or is BetChain just scammers? They have a good rating and I read reviews about them before playing there.

Anyone can write countless reviews that are only positive and publish them anywhere on the Internet, and this does not mean that a company has a good reputation. Did you read the reviews from the Trustpilot link in my previous post? 100% negative, although only nine entries.Regardless of everything, you should know that you can always expect problems with any online casino when it comes to payouts - although 4+ LTC seems a really ridiculous amount and it's unbelievable that they give you so many problems about it.",

I saw their respond every time you try to withdraw. They are just manipulating you and trying to make you get bored and hopefully you want continue asking for you money. The casino is obviously a sacm and there's alot of complaints against it I'm not sure there's anything that can help you to withdraw your money especially after the nice profit you made from a small amount. The casino claims that they are licensed under the laws of the island of Curacao but nothing is confirmed.",
