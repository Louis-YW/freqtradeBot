I wonder who's the guest is?Â  Well, obviously we have an idea who's that guest that made a transaction from that year and it was also them trying to give a good rating on themselves. OP can still improve and do better with this if they want to make this business of theirs genuine and attract people to trade on their exchange. You have many things to consider OP to make your website better and by being honest and transparent with every details you put.",
