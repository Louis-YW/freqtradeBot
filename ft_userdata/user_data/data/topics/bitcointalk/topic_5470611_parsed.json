Some are government-owned, while others are run by non-governmental organisations that help individuals devastated by natural disasters.  Natural disasters affect millions of people each year, causing loss of life and property as well as damage and illness to those who are affected. Every country's government is responsible for controlling and protecting its inhabitants from natural catastrophes by offering help, information on the causes, and advice on how to avoid them to the greatest extent possible. Although natural disasters cannot be prevented, they can be mitigated to some extent if appropriate measures are taken.",

They're getting support from various organizations and funded by some companies that are all out to support their advocacy. Although it seems late for people who see these natural calamities like flash floods to solve it, they're doing what they can and have their initiatives to do to help nature and preserve what they can still preserve. On our own, we can do in our tiniest help to contribute to avoiding these floods which are caused by our wrongdoings like cutting down trees, blockage of water passage due to random throwing of garbages.",

We cutting trees and jungles and making homes which change the environment. These disasters will be there and all we can do is be ready to face it. Help others when they need help. A single or a couple of hundred organizations won't be able to help everyone. Moreover, I believe most of the organizations are corrupted. If they get $10 Million from the donation, they spend $1 Million for the people and $9 million to run the organization. They have many expenses including giving salary to their staff.",

For the past 3 years flood has been one of the major topic in my country, but have we thought of what we can do to prevent this flood.I can still remember last year when my country experienced flooding, and it was very embarrassing, but governments maked sure the citizens are safe. People who properties were were destroyed, government provided a house, foams, free food stuffs at that time, but still yet people where not happy due to the destroying of properties.Knowing the fact that flood is natural but it can be limited.How can flooding be limited, constructing of rivers, drainage, canals, will limit the flood, by so doing the flood can flow to the drainage and canals.",

Before a flood occurs, people are typically warned of its impending arrival, and its effects are never pleasant because of the property damage it causes and the number of lives it sometimes claims. The farmer will feel hurt because of the harm done and the money she spent putting in the farm because it sweeps a lot of the fruit. If you interview someone who has been impacted, you will understand that it was a terrible experience. Due to climate change a lot of places will experience heavy rainfall.",

Millions of people are living in extreme poverty every year due to these natural disasters, especially in South Asian countries Every year the damage is huge. According to various climate organizations, by the year 2050 the temperature of the world will increase due to the rise in the sea level and there is a possibility that most of the oceans will be submerged underwater.Various environmental organizations have repeatedly demanded that states that are neglected by floods every year should be given large sums of aid to build flood defenses and deal with post-flood challenges are urging to pay for but the countries of the developed world are not paying attention to them, only saying they will give but not giving We must all come together to protect ourselves from this natural calamity.It is our responsibility to protect the natural environment so all the citizens should regularly plant trees to prevent environmental damage, and it should be the responsibility of the state to get out of this flood as much as possible If possible, many lives or damages will be avoided, and many people will be saved from danger Finally I want to say that flood is a natural calamity but at present life is not seen in different times or in different states because of which man gives.",

Like in my country, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) is in charge of managing all disasters. I have worked with NEMA once, and at the time I thought they did nothing, but later I realized that they were doing something, even though the work was extremely risky because they had to respond to the disaster in order to save lives and property. They give the sufferer clothing, food, and other necessities. The only thing that humans can do is control natural disasters; they cannot be stopped.",

In nations like Nigeria, where there are agencies tasked with maintaining these green spaces, corruption prevents them from collecting bribes and caring about the consequences of their actions, leaving them with no choice but to mitigate if they don't follow the law when the time comes.",

We also have raining season that do pour down water to the earth. Flood is a natural disaster and like what Franky1 said people build their houses close to the sea shores and forgetting to have a sea defence from flood.It is very hard to control water when it has start flowing and there is nothing anyone can do about it than to create a way that they can stay safe from the disaster by evacuating such place and move to a place that is safe from flood. Dams that are also built to cage this excessive water are not well built or too small to contain large volume of water over a long period of time. This makes the government to open the dam for the water to flow into the sea, when the dam is filled to the brim or has started splitting out water. The water from the opened damn will definitely ravage communities that it will pass through to the sea. I believe that provisions are made for flood victim but that wouldn't change the frustration caused by the flood on her victim, neither will it bring back the properties and lives that it has destroyed.",

However, the only solution to this type of devastation is for the government to increase its efforts to plant more trees. I believe it is a superior concept. If it weren't for the manner my folks are whining about the flooding, which, to be honest, is not proper, especially the fadamas, are whining about this flooding—which is, to be honest, inappropriate—the water would come and pack everything away as a result of double work once they've finished with the fadamas.",
