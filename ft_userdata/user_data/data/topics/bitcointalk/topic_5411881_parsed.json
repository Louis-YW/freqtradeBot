Just be careful on exchange or website you are using, There are better and proven exchange out there that is ready to use. Don't risk your money on an unknown or low reputation exchange because things like these are likely to happen.

Im sorry for your loss but tokpie doesn't have good reputation. This exchange site is having very high probability as a scam site. I think that will better if you create a new thread in the scam accusation section. This will help you to raise more awareness. Oh so this what happened to Tokpie? after all the hype and then given offer to bounty hunters to be able to exchange their tokens right away. At least that's how I remember them back then.And this is the only time I heard their name again, unfortunately, they turn out to be a scam site. Not sure how the OP got the exchange though, unfortunately it's too late for him and I would say that most likely his money is going to be trap, sorry to burst the bubble.",

I bought the native token of the exchange (TKP) but i can't trade it back to Eth, BNB, USDC or WBTC.Why are you brave to deposit your funds there? Have you taken some research first about Tokpie before you deposited your funds? This part should be done first every time you choose an exchange to deposit funds/money.Honestly, I have used this exchange several times but I am also a bit unsatisfied with this exchange. Most coins have lower prices than other exchanges and their volumes are too low there. I don't know whether they manipulated the price or not, but if we analyze the daily volumes of each coin there, it is clear that the demand is too small. It indicates only a few people or even no people trade on the Tokpie exchange.By the way, can you tell me in detail how you can't trade it back?As far as I know, TKP can be traded with ETH only. While for other pairs (BNB, USDC, WBTC), there is no any transaction lately. Which means no people trade on these pairs.Please check:https://tokpie.com/view_exchange/tkp-eth/https://tokpie.com/view_exchange/tkp-bnb/https://tokpie.com/view_exchange/tkp-usdc/https://tokpie.com/view_exchange/tkp-wbtc/* I think this topic/thread is more appropriate to put on \"Scam Accusations\" board.Move it here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0",

So everyone is elated to see an exchange that you can used for bounties and get your reward right away in form of money, not crypto. Unfortunately, even if the idea is unique, maybe that where the people behind see as a advantage to run this scam up to this day. And now we hear another one fall victim for it.",

Why buy TKP in the first place?exchanges can manipulate their trading price. and maybe, not many people are interested with their token so they can easily set the selling price of their token. this is why it is not advisable to trade in a small exchange. they can basically hold your funds as you have no other choice but trade what you got so you can place your withdrawal. i hope traders will use this as a warning before they send significant funds to this exchange.",
