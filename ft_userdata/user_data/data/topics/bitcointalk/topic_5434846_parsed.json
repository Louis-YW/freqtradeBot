If you really believe in this asset class, then dollar cost averaging on a regular schedule and HODLing for the long term is the best you can do.The best time to do this is when we are in the bear market. I have been DCAing since bitcoin dropped to 40k and below. Luckily most of my buys are when price is 20k's and sub-20k's.I won't be selling if price goes to 14k or even 10k. I will just buy more.",

The guys at wall observer are very good at this stuff, you will get a positive feedback there. 8/10 they predict bitcoin is going up. In my opinion, those callers you are listening to arenâ€™t professionals even if they are, one thing Iâ€™m sure of is that nobody can predict the market 100%. Bitcoin trading isnâ€™t like stocks where a few people have insider information they can leverage on.",

      "body": "Short answer: We don't knowAs it stands today, bitcoin may have recovered a fair bit of its valuation from last year's collapse, sitting at a snug 20-21k just around yesterday. Although this may change in the coming days for the better or for worse. All in all, we can't really tell if bitcoin is going to drop to one lint a piece or if it's going to reach its ATH. We can only predict. 20k may seem reasonable now but without proper reason for it to be valuated, it's going to drop real soon anyway. As of now no good news has come around for bitcoin's value to soar up so best we stay put and updated.",

What I've seen lately is a price increase in Bitcoin and not a dump, so it could very well be that $15.4k was the lowest price in Bitcoin in the last year and it's also very possible for Bitcoin to move upwards on a gradual increase, so there is no need to believe the caller because maybe they just want to create panic in some people so he can buy Bitcoin at a lower price.Quotethis should be a mini pumpbecause Btc is resting at a critical supply zone. If it breaks and close above it, we may not see 12k. If not 12k here we comeI also don't think about $12K coming, because yesterday I already saw $21K in Bitcoin though not for a long time. This means that Bitcoin has the potential to get a bigger fix this year than a drop in price although it is still very much a possibility.",
