  "content": "Earlier during the beginning of Bitcoin when it was worth cents or a dollar. This forum was there for Bitcoin and almost every information or terms used today about bitcoin started here such as hodl, pizza day, etc. Why did I open this thread? 1. Because I see this forum as the real Bitcoin: If anything happens to bitcoin, many influencers would deny that they ever said bitcoin would hit 100k like bitboy is attacked on many of his social media handles. But, the forum stands firm and strong on their words, (giving suitable price prediction) yet providing relevant information on previous market trends that shows that Bitcoin can get there ! moreover a time wasted here is an investment on Bitcoin network. 2. Strong marketing strategy Imagine a forum where the marketing of bitcoin began! From 0 to ATH of 60k in space of 12 years of it's existence. And the project which they started promoting here like a joke is now a national treasure. The forum operates in a casual way, but, it's impact is strong on the market, network and price even. 3. Human development: I was watching a tiktok video and it pointed at cryptocurrency community as the best means of helping investors not YouTubers or influencers. Definitely, it's the truth especially this forum, most of the users who began the promotion of Bitcoin since the beginning are all successful men today. However, many users that began here are successful traders, investors, influencers etc in the cryptocurrency market. In summary, the world will acknowledge this forum soon and by then bitcoin must have done wonders positively. But, if reverse is the case, then the forum that did it before can as well restore back the diginity of bitcoin. The respect the newly joined member will have for top members here would look like a million followers on social media. Therefore it's not too late to invest on Bitcoin, bitcoin and Bitcointalk. Get started. Thanks.",

Quote from: Accardo on May 16, 2022, 09:22:00 AMÂ If anything happens to bitcoin, many influencers would deny that they ever said bitcoin would hit 100k like bitboy is attacked on many of his social media handles. But, the forum stands firm and strong on their words, (giving suitable price prediction)I think we need to make it clear here, no member of this forum will give a guaranteed rise or fall in bitcoin price, this is just a forum to discuss and share respective information and ideas about bitcoin, the only thing you can confide with the forum here is its consistency in trust and reliable information about bitcoin, but we can't vouch your trading or investment made to certainly make profit, instead it instruct, direct and guide through the right path to a successful experience in cryptocurrency.",

In other words I would have said while away time contributing to the forum. As a means of investing on the Bitcoin network. Contents is what people need to understand a given notion on the internet and wasting your time (not getting paid) on building contents on the Bitcoin network is an investment. 2. If you observe my post, you'll see that it's about the beginning and how the forum helped to market Bitcoin when it was birthed. 3. Well the scam aspect is not what I meant in the first place. Successful people are not considered scammers. These are people that worked hard to get there.",

People or users here are the one discuss the potential of bitcoin usage and not on investment purposes alone. Having it as marketing place isnt gonna be a healthy in the form of discussion. They could use social media but not in here.",

But there seems to be what looks like a typographical error, it would be fine if you clarify this Quote moreover a time wasted here is an investment on Bitcoin network.You should consider to replace the word \"wasted\", unless you meant what is in Op.Again, about marketing bitcoin. This forum is not focused on marketing bitcoin. To the best of my knowledge, Satoshi used here to discuss with early developers and here was seen as an interactive group to keep the project going. But it has evolved to something huge, yet this forum hasn't invested much in publicity. If you talk about marketing, social media like twitter does it better. Then you could say promotion of new projects with bounty campaigns it would make much sense.About this forum making or establishing its early adopters. That is true, I have seen many early adopters who are grateful to this forum and could confidently say that they made it from here.",
