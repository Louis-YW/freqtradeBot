  "content": "UK and USA why ? Becouse those banks have most reckless and careless financial and moneytary policies.Also when you operate business you get less responsebility If you doing something wrong Also you have more legal ways to Avoid paying debt.UK can nicely just transfer all the debt to public treasury.Also biggest bail out-s Are in UK and USA.Also UK Has the biggest bank money transactions limits for personal and business accounts it shows that UK Are about money.Also UK Banks i can walk in to bank give the account number take my bag of money no questions asked i can just add it on account.all this show's that UK Are about moving money big money and business.Off course those unsure factors will create volatile market for real estate stocs forex and everthing so best will be to use those countries as places to making money but not holding much wealth there better to invest gold or crypto.My friends went in UK they told me it was like paradize so Easy years Ago was to taking loans and credit and Even to create company in UK not Even to go physically in UK.Alot mlm business Are registered in UK and other referal payed business projects it shows that UK Are smart they want companies to be registered in UK to show that UK welcoming the ceo-s from all around the world.USA Are Also good becouse Fed been doing great Job to producing big money. Off course now we need to wait when UK and USA will go little down and crash then we wait when boe and fed Will start printing again and then everybody will go again in UK and USA to take that money with all the options what those countries have.If you dont have nothing you have Zero you dont succeed in Europe or any other countries you have to go to UK USA or maybe canada Au ...becouse If you want to get money you have to go to get it from countries where is money more then other places.UK and USA been biggest money printers they have biggest debts it means there was a lot money.So If you want to get rich you should go in to UK or USA those countries Will make rich If you Are Active in there Even If you dont have skills education or money to make money those countries Will give you money Even If you have Zero money.Off course the USA and UK doing little brake time pause about printing money but we wait little and once they start again it Will be Like paradize.I Spoke with my very smart friend he told me UK was best money making place so far and no responsebility all most at all USA can be little more difficult but once you get in financial sector you Are in the honey in USA there is Also a lot money heavy money once they turn on again money printers.And i congrats UK and USA leaders they run best ways their countries they never shy about printing money UK was not Even reserve currency country like USA but oo boy UK Banks can produce money If the world economy will turn on again and UK start printing again then you definately want to be in UK they know how to produce heavy heavy money.I hope the other countries will learn from UK and can produce Even more money with Same lax laws so that the money hunters can Fly directly and start Taking moneyCanada and Au Are great too but UK have done much better Job as UK debt is highest it shows they been serious about printing money and they have cared about making people wealthy in UK.Congrats to BOE they know their thing",

No offense, what I mean is that considering the cost of living in the UK or in the US is quite high if we have $500 in our pocket it might not be enough for one month. Whereas in the country where I live $500 is still enough for one month and of course the needs are very well met. It's a simple fact to think about.Not a few refugees who come to the UK or the US with the aim of becoming rich even become homeless sleeping on the streets because they cannot afford the high cost of living. What is the cheapest average rental house there? in my place 2 rooms, 1 living room, a kitchen and a bathroom it only takes $50 per month including clean water and electricity.Not to mention talking about policies, banks, and prices of goods. It's really hard to compare, including taxes, and rising fuel because UK and US still have disputes with oil-producing countries, and their oil stocks can be stopped at any time because the superpowers have more business competitors than alliances.",

I find that there are many countries worth living than the United States. No country has many riots, violence and hundreds of shooting every year as in the United States.  That is bad, the country is considered the most security in the world. My country is living without a high life like in the US, but at least it is much safer.",

But on the other hand, these countries have created a financial, tax and legislative system that allows you to start and run your own business. The main advantage is comfortable conditions for the majority. And I won’t say anything about big business, there the state “grooms and cherishes” big business!",

Interesting, my economics teacher must be teaching me lessons from the wrong book. Funny. The rules and the benefits which you talking about are the reason today US and Britain is facing worst economical crisis. Printing money does not mean you have money, it means you are welcoming to the inflation and which they already did. Britain had to change their Prine Minister to overcome the economic burden, it’s not a joke. It’s tension to the common peoples tax!",

It is not easy anywhere and this is what you have to knowYes the UK, US, and Canada have super economies that can make a diligent worker comfortable. But they also have some disadvantages. In my country, I have the freedom to express myself without fear of racism or intimidation, but it might not be so in these countries.  In my country, you hardly pay taxes if you are not in public service or a registered firm. You can live comfortably with less than $300 in a month. But these countries have high taxes and a high cost of living. Although you might not compare the standard of living in these countries with mine because they have a better standard of living. But for now, I am very comfortable with my country until I have a better offer from somewhere else. I can only migrate to these countries if I have a better opportunity",

Some of my friends who were working a white collar jobs here in Asia are doing a butlers or waiter job in the USA and UK - they are earning in dollar doesn't mean they are rich there - they are rich there .. they are just living an english life there and trying to show that they are modern now. Opportunities can be great there but other countries can offer more. Asia is the next big thing, so taking the opportunity to do business in Asia might help you become more rich but then again doing this will require a lot of capital and need a good business partners. If you are going to think and introduce cryptocurrency, I can say that in Africa and Asia, opportunities there are very bright as they started to see good developments.",

There may be some fragments of truth in parts of what you say, but the real reason these countries are successful is they have some of the strongest institutions and legal frameworks that have been produced over decades. They have clear structures and rules in place which draw in business because they know that there is less likely to be corruption or it might be slightly easier to expose. They have very independent media which allows for wrong doing to be exposed more easily and keeping people honest. That's not to say that people don't abuse all these things or get away with illegal activity, just that it is more likely to be prosecuted with consequences than some other countries.",

No one says that having arrived in the USA or Britain, you are guaranteed to either become rich, or guaranteed to live at a fairly high level. No, that would be very stupid. Nobody gives guarantees. The thing is different - opportunities for self-realization and support (including comfortable tax, credit systems, social programs, etc.) provide an opportunity for a person who has at least a desire to live well and do something for this, to realize their desires through their skills, in a convenient market .Regarding the fact that many people come, or even Native Americans are homeless, there is a very simple explanation for this. Among them, of course, there are unfortunate losers, there are outcasts who have chosen between achieving a good standard of living - drugs, alcohol. And there are those who are quite satisfied with the social program that the state pays, and support in the form of both the state food supply system, and a bunch of churches and organizations working in the field of charity. Go to the USA, chat with the local population, learn a lot of amazing things about this topic",
