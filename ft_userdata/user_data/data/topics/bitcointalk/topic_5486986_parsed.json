  "content": "Bitcoin was created as a response to the financial crises of 2008.  The idea was to create a decentralized electronic cash system that had a limited supply.  The current fiat currencies used worldwide are both centrally controlled and have no limit on how much the issuer can create.  The US dollar, as an example, has lost 98% of it's purchasing power since 1913 when the Federal Reserve was granted the power to print US dollars.The Bitcoin solution was to create a currency that had a limited supply and transactions that were peer-to-peer so that no financial institutions would have financial power over the individual.Fast forward 16 years and almost all Bitcoin transactions are run through third parties.  To buy Bitcoin most people use exchanges which you must KYC on. To store Bitcoin most people use wallets that require the use of 3rd party nodes for transactions. This includes Hardware wallets.  Most people use Bitcoin like an investment not an electronic cash system. Banks are buying up large quantities of Bitcoin to hold for customers buying their ETFs. Arguably developers are adding things like ordinals to the code which have slowed transactions and increased fees above what would be reasonable for small financial transactions.I see the potential for Bitcoin and am working on projects to help with the original mission - financial freedom for individuals world wide.I am not going to give up on the dream!  Are you?",

      "body": "Though I might be wrong on this but I think the main or the core reason of creating bitcoin was to use it to trade p2p which is to buy goods and services online but that part or function of bitcoin creation is not working perfectly yet and I don't know if it will work in the nearest future. Because everyone one is going into the investment aspect of it and not the goods and services function. As for me the most interesting part of bitcoin is the part you can use it to buy something like Laszlo Hanyecz who used bitcoin to buy Pizza. I like to do that but no store in my area is accepting bitcoin in fact they don't even know the name. And those who use exchange to buy bitcoin because it is the fastest way to acquire bitcoin.",

      "body": "Nothing wrong with using Bitcoin as an investment, ETFs, entities besides individuals owning Bitcoin. That's all natural because Bitcoin is money.But for sure it would be good if we could development a much larger ecosystem of decentralized exchanges. The ones I know of have almost no volume compared to crypto exchanges and so you don't get good prices on them. Also they are naturally harder to use.I think getting a DEX movement going and getting people on LN is the way to go.LN allows payment to be cheap and instant, which is the only way payments are going to get popular. Even if at first its just used how Venmo is used to pass money between friends, rather than pay at merchants which requires merchant adoption. Though taxes are of course a problem if you're passing bitcoin between friends that's all taxable. Though it'd be a a pretty small use of bitcoin (not like selling lots of bitcoin) and the IRS wouldn't even be able to track it so maybe that's the sort of thing that could slide under the table without any real issues, sorta like when workers get paid in cash.And then if DEXes could get popular enough to get real volume their prices wouldn't be so far away from the spot price and they'd become more useful. And then you can keep your bitcoin privacy. But its hard to get to that point because crypto exchanges are just so much easier to use.Realistically I think building p2p connections happens at the local level. There are small communities in various places in the world who regularly use Bitcoin because they have a weak currency or don't have easy access to digital banking services and stuff like that, so it benefits everyone in the community to use Bitcoin. I think p2p usage gradually spreads out from those places to encompass a wider and wider net. The average person in a first world country and lots of non-first world countries don't have a huge need for p2p payments. For those populations growing one's wealth and wealth sovereignty I think are currently the main use cases. Though of course eventually being able to easily spend the wealth, including in p2p ways rather than just customer-merchant ways, would be ideal.",

Satoshi felt that there was inequality or no fairness in the public's trust in the banking system which often lends money in the form of credit bubbles with very little reserves. Abuse of trust from banks is considered to be detrimental to society in terms of being vulnerable to identity theft and account draining.Satoshi criticized the system built by the government by launching Bitcoin to the public. With Bitcoin he hopes to provide justice to society. The presence of Bitcoin can bridge society back to using rare assets that are considered valuable because of their scarcity. The hope is that Bitcoin can be used as a better alternative to fiat currencies which are vulnerable to devaluation and abuse of trust. Bitcoin which is very limited in quantity and cannot be regulated by any authority, makes most of its value come from people's trust in its supply and demand. Bitcoin has provided financial freedom for people who have always been in the grip of a government that always abuses trust.",

This is a better form of electronic cash than the existing fiat systems we currently use. The US dollar is 98% digital now.When a person works and that value is converted into a store of value (currency), the worker should custody and control this money without a 3rd party taking control.  In our current fiat system the value is immediately transferred to a bank who controls your access to it.Money is power and the banks now control all of it. This power is used to elect politicians, create laws and influence the masses through propaganda.If Bitcoin is adopted as a currency every system we have will be impacted in a way that gives individuals back their sovereignty.",

But there are good reasons why KYC rules have been enforced. It's the reason why those rules exist in the first place.It shouldn't surprise anyone that exchanges run by companies have to comply with financial laws. Only reason that didn't used to be the case for crypto exchanges is because the industry was new enough and small enough that govt wasn't even paying attention.But for sure as a community we need to get more/better options of keeping privacy through decentralized exchanges and stuff. Though then you get into the quandry that if Bitcoin DEXes actually grew large enough to be very useful for people, that means they'd have enough volume to be useful to criminals and terrorists and the like who want to sell large amounts of money. So then, any moral creator of a decentralized exchange has to be like ok how do I stop bad people from using what I made to be used by regular law abiding people who just want to take advantage of bitcoin's privacy. But it's literally KYC/AML laws that do that, which are what take away privacy haha.I don't know what the win-win answer for that quandry is. It's the age old privacy vs security question. People want both, but kind of like blockchain's decentralization vs capacity issue, increasing one tends to weaken the other. Only thing I can think of would be local bitcoin networks spread all over the world so you can exchange fiat-to-bitcoin and vice versa locally instead of having global large volume DEXes that are beacons to criminals. I guess that's basically what LocalBitcoins was back in the day but I'm pretty sure they closed up shop years ago.",
