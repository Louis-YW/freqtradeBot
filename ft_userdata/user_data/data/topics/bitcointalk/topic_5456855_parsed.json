Thanks Some casino have stocks but not all them since casino usually composed of rich people financing the casino bankroll. On the other hand, You can invest on asset like this on crypto by purchasing casino utility token such as BFG, RLB, FUN and OWL. All of this token is from a casino which use it as a reward and shares some casino profit through buy back and token burn to boost the price. Online casino is already gaining trend pver Physical casino.",

I will advice you to stay with cryptic because stock investment is a longer longer term investment, it's not like crypto that every four years you get the best smile with your bag, with stock you have to pray that the company stock performs better and even if they do, the return of investment is not comparable to that of crypto, you will always make the best ROI from crypto vs stock.",

Thanks I think it depends on the gambling company but they have the power to issue stocks, as far as I know. If they indeed release some shares of stocks, then stockholders may purchase and expect regular dividends. But again, it is a risk and a gamble (no pun intended) in itself since investing is already risky- more alone if you invested stocks in a gambling company which is also risky.I do believe that they have the power to register their corporate name and business in the SEC of each country for them to release stocks. But I do expect that only large gambling companies would do this who have different connections with other business conglomerates.",

Bustardice is one of the casinos that have bankroll investment,  and we have several others who offers such service with their virging percentages,  all you need to do is to find the one that fits you best and apply it to your situation.",

Some that are not registered especially those that are closely-tied with the cryptocurrency world puts value on their utility tokens as a form of stock investment, much like Betfury which is the prime example of a gambling site which uses their own token for funding and for valuation.Quote from: piebeyb on June 19, 2023, 01:26:59 PMWhy do you have to invest in gambling stocks, while in my opinion it is not more profitable than investing in crypto, I, if asked to choose, it is better to be a gambler than investing in a gambling platform because it is clear that it is more certain to be a gambler than to be a gambling stock investor, but it all comes back to you if you want to know more maybe there will be recommendations from friends from this forum to share it with you.I'm only giving advice not to invest in something you don't understand, if you are familiar with stocks it might not be a problem but if you are not used to investing, it is better to do deeper research so that you don't make investing mistakes and ultimately lose your money. it's better to lose gambling than losing money on gambling stock investments or choosing to invest in crypto alone is enough.  I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing and he's very piqued to invest in gambling sites for the apparent success that they earned. I don't think it is wrong just cause you won't invest in it lmao. Let the man have his fun. Pretty sure he'd do his homework too if he feels like he needs to and it's not something that you have to reiterate to him cause there's no way a guy who knows nothing about stocks and investing in them will ask people in this forum about investing in casino stocks.
