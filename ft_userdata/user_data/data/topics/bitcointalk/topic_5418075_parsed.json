As things weren't working fine within the country, he used to convert his salary in Euro to bitcoin using the popular exchange Bit4You.The country have got good number of cryptocurrency users and the survey shows how interested are the people in receiving their regular salary in bitcoin. Few companies around the world pay in Bitcoin and this helps the employees in transferring to home country without depending on third party services.",

I couldn't fully understand whether the survey was only among employees of one specific company or not, but it seemed this way, and in that case, it's likely not representative. Then again, PawGo says the survey was of a thousand people with a 3% margin of error, which does sound like a representative poll.Also, the article says those who are interested in being paid in cryptos would invest long-term or just use as savings (at least from how I understood google translated version of it). That's not a typical usage of a salary, IMO, as people usually work because they need money for their expenses, not investments. Or perhaps the question was (or was interpreted in such a way) about getting a part of the salary in cryptos, then it would make more sense why people see it as something to save or invest.",

The market is very big enough to get us what we want only if we are very patient to see ahead if us. It will be a big opportunity if they finally start earning in Bitcoin especially for those that had been longing to earn their wages or salaries in Bitcoin.",

Your monthly salary is supposed to cover your expenses, settling for something that is volatile doesn't sound like a good idea.

But if he does, he might, depending on the situation be forced to pay double. Because, as you said, cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender. But I am no lawyer so I have no idea how to set that up in a way that works for everyone. Personally, I would prefer to be paid in Bitcoin. That way you can avoid your money coming anywhere near a bank. And if you were planning on investing in Bitcoin anyway (like me),  then whats the problem?Everyone should be free to decide if they want fiat or crypto. The government should have no say in whether I get paid in silver coins or Euros or Dollars or strawberries.That decision is up to me and my contractual partner (Boss).Although the boss should not be allowed to decide for you, I should add.",

This age group is most positive about a salary in cryptocurrency.The rate of acceptance and adoption of bitcoin by the young generation is proof that it would be the currency of the future. The research showed that those in favor of this idea are employees between the ages of 35 and below, which is a clear indication that when the older generation of political office holders are replaced in the future by the younger ones, bitcoin would be generally adopted. This is because the younger generation tends to understand the operations of bitcoin and others more than the skeptical older generation.

People should be given the freedom to choose what they want to do with their earnings. Investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might be ideal but it should be done voluntarily.",

It is therefore not unusual for them to agree to hypothetically be paid part of their salary in cryptocurrencies. This part of the salary is important, because it is most likely that the part they would be paid in cryptocurrencies would be used as an investment, doing HODL, at least for a while, but they will need the rest of the salary in fiat for their monthly expenses.",

If these numbers were at least approximately correct, today 1 Bitcoin would be worth more than $100k. Thus the accumulated population does not fully represent the people there, it only involves some people who are members of the company or outside it.Companies should encourage bitcoin to be more specific in paying employees salaries, so that their financial strength can increase in the next five years, thus this company revolution will greatly develop sensitivity and guarantee of economic growth within the company's scope.It will look good and more and more companies will adopt these ways for economic development",
