  "content": "Error or mistake is something that is almost fixed along side with the human character and everyone at some point tend to make some vital mistake in which he or she is regretful about and also uses this same mistake as point of reference or lesson so as to avoid same error twice. But for some reason some folks actually like making these mistake intentionally even after being warned or given heads up about what is ahead or involved. Some actually believe that experience is the best teacher of which I do agree but I would to think that learning from other people mistake is actually the best especially when it comes to mistake that has to do with financial affairs.The crypto (Bitcoin) space is filled with lots of opportunity and aslo scammers who are willing to pry on every error that any newbie or curious veteran can make and that's why it's important for newbie and amateurs to actually learn from some of the vital mistakes that other members have already done to avoid making such.The bull season is closed by and alot of things will be happening so everyone should stay on the alert and also imply some of the skills and also take correction from the many mistakes that other have already committed to avoid making same mistakes of our own. it would be nice for the community to drops tips and also past errors that he or she did that others can learn from to advance themselves or do you feel making the mistake ourselves is alot more experience than this?",

On the other hand, I quite agree with mk4's advice, the only thing I would add is: keep it simple. The best way to get rich for the average person is slow and boring.",

I don't know that time that btc and Ethereum both has different address. As I remembered I sent usdt to Coinbase BTC address (Eth network) and the address of both was changed. I lost 40$ that time and learned that I should get deposit address of same token which I want to withdraw (Noob scene)2: Second time I sent more than 1200$ to exchange and my mistake was that I didn't checked network on the the exchange. The token was on multiple chain and exchange listed ERC20 network while I sent Token in BSC network. Later exchange returned my token after 15 days and fortunately token price surges to 1700$ but I learned lesson that I have to check Network also when I send token.3: once I send less than minimum token to exchange where I lost tokens as per rule of the exchanges and Lesson is obvious that we have to check minimum deposit token whenever we send payment.4: I lost 600$ when I send token mistakenly to contract address of the token. I was in too hurry that I didn't even checked the address before sending. I learned that I have to double check before sending big amount.5: I lost more than 1k$ when I send wrong contract token to Binance and unfortunately such token was not listed. I learned that I have to send first low amount (1 or two token) before sending all. I learned a lot but unfortunately lost big",

Some people do think there is some sort of error, and they experience some mistakes, but they don't take them seriously until they encounter them over and over again. Then they can start adjusting themselves and not making such mistakes again. We can't change people's way of thinking; the best we can do is educate them on how to avoid falling into some sort of dangerous situation that can ruin their lives and how to avoid making some mistakes. That's the length at which we can go. It's now left for the person to decide what they want to do and what they should not do.",

Mostly the traders learns from their past mistakes which is a good step towards the success but sometimes repeating the same mistake many times just puts a person in danger which is quite bad even for the trader and in the sense of money he has lost. Money may be come from some other ways but they way the trader create to earn money should changed because in that way he also suffers from loss previously. Now he have to do it in a right way that no one would blame him for his mistakes.Even though there are also some mistakes in the trading which can't be forget sometimes. Because some people invested all of their money in the trade and when they make a small mistake they loss all of them, we should be careful about that.",

I don't wish anyone to experience the real meaning to it but if you do, you will learn the hard way and it will be to late to take correction and that's why it's advisable to disengage from centralized platforms because you will never have access to the private keys where coins are stored, if anything should happen, consider everything gone.In addition, learn to appreciate the little you have in profits, don't chase clout like the way influencers does all around calling unimaginable price like bitcoin to 1 million, 500k and many more, you will only regret following them because those guys are there to exite the market and the general public to come into the market while they dump immediately and sell their bags.",

Even if you're highly cautious you won't be able to predict new scams and new technical hacks. So if you don't want to make a risky investment or to use a risky asset/currency you shouldn't invest or use cryptocurrencies, that's it. Some regulators think they can clean up and make the area safer but I think they're just wrong.",

Another time, I got spooked when prices suddenly jumped up a lot and  i panicked and sold most of my coins, only to end up buying them back later at an even higher price.  Doh! I laugh about those early missteps now but at the time I felt like such a newbie.  It's a complex world to dive into, that's for sure.  But making small mistakes is part of the learning curve with any new technology.  Over time, through trial and error, we get better at navigating things. The only thing is that with crypto, we have to be extra careful because we can lose a lot, and there's no way back.",

Let's make sure we continue to gain knowledge from our previous errors. We typically do this since the wallet addresses are similar, especially when it comes to sending money to friends or other people. In order to avoid making the same mistakes twice, it is wise for us to view the mistakes we make from the outset as learning experiences. Since it is not like a bank, that we can say we will go directly to the manager and complain to them, and then in a few months they will reverse the money back to us so we have to be very carefully.",

All have experienced their own share of mistakes and some have learned their lessons well while others are still repeating the same mistakes again, seems like they aren't learning at all. But here's my piece of advice:1. Always invest on the amount you can afford to lose. Bigger amount of capital does not guarantee success and profits, but everything lies on the performance of a trader or a long term hodler.2. Focus on bitcoin. If you wish to diversify your investments, it does not mean that you'll go with altcoins as you have no choice, but take part in other physical investments like real estate or gold.3. Never trust other people in the market more than yourself. You only get scammed because you are too trusting.4. Stay away from meme coins or shitcoins. While others may be lucky that they have made exceptional profits just like dogecoin, but the rate of chance to make it happen again is very rare or it could not be happening again.5. Do the DCA method. Maximize your investment profits not by doing leverage, but stick to DCA.",

So focusing about selling, make sure that you are satisfied when you have sold already because that's going to be a mistake that you cannot re-do and even if you can re-do that, you can easily forget that moment as you can't feel that you're not satisfied.
