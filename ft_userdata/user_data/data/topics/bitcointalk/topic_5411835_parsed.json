  "content": "There is a wide gap between the rich and the poor. They both have different mindset. 🗝️🗝️ The rich believe that money makes money. They see money as an opportunity but the poor people see it as something to be earned. 🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️ Rich people make money work for them. Instead of just working and relying on income, a rich person would take a proportion of their income and invest it but the poor people are said to work for money. A poor person sees $1000 as just $1000. A poor person works paycheque to paycheque for the rest of their life. They neither save nor invest any part of their income. 🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️ Rich people spend on necessities and what is needed not what is desired. A rich person with a perfectly functioning phone would not need to spend money on a new one. A truly rich person does not care about trends, they care about net worth. Poor people spend on both necessities and desires. A poor person spends beyond their means. They care about the latest trends, not about net worth. 🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️ Rich people think of a long-term goals but poor people set at best short-term goals or none. They do not see the necessity of long-term goals such as money for future living. 🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️ Rich people tend to be risk takers but poor person is more likely to be risk averse. For example, when given an opportunity to invest in a startup, poor people are more likely to immediately turn this down. They do not see this as a chance to increase wealth. They see this as a reduction of their disposable income. 🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️ Rich people are eager to learn but the poor people are not eager to learn. Most millionaires in the United States were not born millionaires, they learnt how to build wealth. The more they learn, the more they understand the world. 🗝️🗝️Reference: https://novamoney.com/blog/5-key-differences-between-a-rich-mindset-and-a-poor-mindsetConclusion👉👉Recognize where you stand and how you would like to move forward. Having a poor mindset may made your poor forever. The mindset you have will determine the level of your achievement. 👉👉Never get confused about your recent status. Confusion brings distracted and lack of focus. It never to late for a change in mindset. Work on yourself, think positively, be focus, have a dream and work towards your dream to achieve great success.",

They see this as a reduction of their disposable income. 🗝️🗝️i agree with all statements apart from this one aboverich people have more opportunities without it messing up their life so they take more opportunities with less riskpoor people have more risks but dont have opportunities. but poor do take more risksEG poor people are more likely to be gamblers/not pay rent so they can be consumers and buy things they shouldnt be buying, risking eviction ..poor people are not \"given\" opportunities. EG startups dont door not poor neighbourhoods, they go to rich investors and ask for a large seed amount a poor person cant even afford, thus dont even get a chance to invest in startups..poor people dont plan on saving/investing. they prefer the \"get rick quick\" where,the hope to double their money in a year as a 1 time in, one time out ASAP action.where as rich people take small percentage profits daily multiple times, which add up to the \"get rich\" same multiplier poor people want, over the same year. ..poor people are told to buy the hype/pumprich people are trained to buy the dip/crash..a poor person would buy a car, and pay it off.. not owning it, but having it in their name. where its not theirs until paid in full, risking losing the car and the income that went into it if a debt collector came to the door.a rich person hires a car, for lower monthly amount. and debt collectors cant seize a car thats not in the rich guys name.",

I don't think that you have to conclude that they may turn down it immediately just because they have a poor mindset. They're not capable of investing due to their situation and most of them are fulfilling their obligations so, investing isn't their priority.Quote from: odunybiz on August 31, 2022, 06:47:22 AM🗝️🗝️ Rich people are eager to learn but the poor people are not eager to learn.

If the minimum wage worker can actually keep something for himself after paying for the essentials, they'd surely save first before they invest. This is what a lot of people don't get: the poor are scared to invest the money that they don't have because they have to feed themselves with what little money they have, whereas the rich doesn't need to think about each day as they already have something to use while also having something to spare (invest). If the poor also has this freedom for themselves, they'd surely want to make more money in a heartbeat, too.",

Work on yourself, think positively, be focus, have a dream and work towards your dream to achieve great success.Some of the phrasing and wording in your points is a bit unfair towards \"poor\" people. If we're truly ignoring the people in the middle and talking about the lowest earners versus the highest earners then it is a case of necessity. It can be impossible for people on the lowest wages to spare any, or at least a practically useful, amount of money each month because their expenditures is almost identical to their income. It's pointless thinking $1000 is anything except $1000 when it comes in and has to be paid straight out again in bills just for food and a roof over your family's head. Also, your first point mentions belief, it's not belief but actual fact - the richest have enough spare capacity in their budget that they can allocate a good amount to investments which make them even richer.",

Every rich person hangs out with another rich person who knows another rich person. So when they need something all they have to do is put a call through to one of the rich person in their circle who may have a connection  or establish a connection with whatever they may need. On the other hand, poor people do not really have as much leverage as do the rich. I mean the margin is so wide that what may take a call to fix a rich persons problem may take a lifetime to fix in the case of the poor person.",

Also the rich and poor people do not have the same opportunities that knock on their door. While rich people can easily make money because they can just inherit the wealth of their parents and make them grow, poor  people still have to find good means the hard way just to generate money. So it’s not surprising that the rich people will tend to become richer, while poor people stay poor the whole time. It’s not only because of the mindset but the inequality of opportunities matters too.Of course the opportunity will not the same, and so it just boils down to the mindset. There could be opportunity for poor people that they don't realized maybe because they thought that they will be poor for the rest of their lives. And that's why majority of them did, so again the mindset could be the biggest factor for any individual. And we wish that we know this when we are growing up, although I would say that my parents open my eyes on investing on stocks which I did when I got my first job, saving for the future and financial freedom.",

It is different with poor people, once they fail in one investment, they probably lose all their money. So, they cannot try more investments since they have no longer money.

The wealthy usually encourage each other to be brave and bold. While the poor are finding new methods to oppress each other and keep each other down. The rich believe the natural state of humanity is to succeed. While the poor believe the natural state of man is failure. You can sometimes tell whether someone is rich or poor. Simply by watching the pleasure they take either in the success (wealth) or failure (poverty) of others. One demogrpahic celebrates success, while the other does the opposite.

The groundwork was done by Kiyosaki, explaining the second point mentioned, that the poor work to earn money while the rich make money work for them. An essential characteristic of the middle class being that they buy liabilities, such as cars or the house they live in, thinking they are assets. Although in the case of the house, this would be more debatable.One essential feature that I do not see in the debate is the difference in the idea of rich.If you believe that the rich are evil and that to get rich you are going to have to cheat, swindle, and exploit, you are never going to get rich, unless it is by committing crime.The rich instead have an idea of rich people as generous, strong-willed, focused on the long term, and so on.
