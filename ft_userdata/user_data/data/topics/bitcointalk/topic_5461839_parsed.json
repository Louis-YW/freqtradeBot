  "content": "Why do XRP proponents keep claiming that it's going to replace SWIFT for international transfers?Do they think SWIFT is just going to sit idly by, while they watch another company steal their market share and run them out of business??No. That's why they recently introduced \"SWIFT Go\", which can settle international transfers \"quickly\". How \"quickly\" is anyone's guess, but it might be fast enough to put up some stiff competition against XRP, making it an uphill battle for it to gain adoption, especially since the whole world already uses SWIFT, and banks will be reluctant to change.https://www.swift.com/swift-go/en/what/https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/23715/what-is-swift-go-and-why-is-it-so-innovativeBeing an XRP holder myself since 2017, I'm concerned about this. Why does it seem that no one else is? Have they even heard of SWIFT Go?Please enlighten me, if I'm missing something.",

They are just shilling to boost the token valuation since it’s very common for crypto projects to exaggerate things and connect to big company name to share the spotlight. Ripple doesn’t even close to swift in terms of the range of customers volume and usability. Ripple supporters including the team is well know for hyping their project ever since they launch this project. Expect more exaggeration coming this project. Why people keeps investing on this centralized project that use blockchain. It’s just same with bank.",

Hopes for XRP's wider adoption is good but you also have to operate in reality. It's wishful thinking at this point that financial institutions will completely leave the traditional ways of doing things just to try something that's not accepted on a massive scale yet. A lot of people have already accepted that BTC will never replace fiat and serve only as an alternative so I don't see why it's not okay for Ripplenet to become one.",

They even got into agreements with a few banks but this business part of Ripple didn't got much success. At the moment, Ripple is not in anyway a competitor to swift and that goes to any other crypto as well. Ripple has evolved much from that point (into XRP) but they again repeatedly failed to achieve most of their promises. There are better options even if our focus is just trading.",

It's not entirely decentralized in order to give it a point for that matter. It's neither privacy focused nor a completely transparent ledger. The delays related to swift payments are mostly due to the partner banks than it's digital capacity to initiate transactions. Ripple would face the same issues of taxes and source of incomes and it would be much difficult to produce the documents. Cryptocurrency is and should be alternative to the banking system rather than trying to fit into them.",

And I will say that Swift has the monopoly way before crypto was introduce and they don't have any competition.But right now with the advent of crypto like XRP who focuses on banking transactions, it's going to be very different now. And perhaps Swift needs to adapt to the ever changing business. XRP though is taking advantage of everything here, they even partnered with Moneygram already if I'm not mistaken. So competition is going to be tough as far as cross border payments.",
