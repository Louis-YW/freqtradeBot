  "content": "Over Christmas,  I found this casino that started out to be pretty cool.  They try to act legit, and even paid a couple of failed transactions manually.  Long story short,  in the end they owed me 8,5 million satoshi balance on my account, PLUS 8x 30k satoshi LN invoices with error code (no route)  Then they blocked me from access to the site, deleted my user account, blocked me on Discord.   The link below is to a shared album on Google Photos.  open to the public.  Take care everyone!  Someone said in another post to post this here and let Macaw respond....... I'm looking forward to it.I have created a shared album public access on google here:    https://photos.app.  goo.  gl/GS3dSv8SCwkFHXwF9p.s their backup site I assume.  https://  macaw-gala.com/Image collection updated 7:51pm 12-29-22Update 12-31-22 2:28pm MSTI gave these people one last chance to make things at least tolerable as seen in my reply to this thread and as of this time, no response.  They have tried to bash and make me look like a dishonest thief, which in my opinion I have proven my honesty in this matter.  I am going to go ahead and leave this issue in my tailwind.  The most important reason for my determination is that all of us that are involved with BTC or any other coin to any degree have no other way to make a fair argument than forums like this one.  Yes, there will always be scams, crooks, and COWARDS out there, but there will always be people like me that won't stand for it and defend themselves, and communities like this forum to settle the arguments. Thank you to all of the high ranking members, and any other that provided feedback no matter what. I hope to remain a member of this forum due to the level of fairness and also the involvement.  I honestly didn't expect anyone to give any attention.What goes around most definitely comes around by karma, and nothing can stop that.To @macaw_casino EPIC fail at conducting business, proving the SLANDER that you attempted towards me, and more importantly EPIC FAIL at having Integrity, or any other human values.  That little debt that you acquired with cheating me will be multiplied x1000's of times by the time you go to your judgement.  I can only pray that you feel it was worth it.  I am Nobody in this world, out of the spotlight, away from any kind of publicity for a reason.Whenever you meet karma for everything you do (I'm sure I'm not the only one) and you get brought down to your knees and beg God for forgiveness, Nobody will be blame.Everyone please enjoy the time bringing in the new year, and try to bring it in properly.  2023 will be a very unique year concerning karma and the way she handles return on investment.  No matter good or bad.  By the way, here is another gallery on this subject since only 1 person that I am aware looked at the google album.https://imgur.com/gallery/WnBcbmW",

That's quite a skill of OP that your staff believe. I didn't see the threatening messages.On the part of the JuanS2099. I think there is missing from his photos. Macaw seems to be helping all that you need in order to withdraw. So why you guys end up talking about ref link?",

His screenshot contains unique transaction ID that only means he is actually winning on your casino. How come he can manipulate this info by just changing the html? Also why you block the account instead of providing proof that his account doesn't contain any real balance? Blocking it only show that you are dodging responsibility for paying his winnings.Since the OP has proof of his balance as well as his betting history. His case is very strong against your casino since you delete all the evidence that will support your claim.",

But there is still much more to be known to make the whole matter clear. If there's no suspicious activity after a big win, they shouldn't freeze your funds. Hopefully the facts behind it will come out and the community members will know who is at fault here. Because such slander of a casino's name will surely have a big impact on their reputation. I look forward to hearing more to see how this matter will be resolved.",
