      "body": "I always recommend Rotki every time anyone asks what is a good and private cryptocurrency portfolio tracker. It is a project that is open source with a freemium model. Also, the application itself is fully local so the data is only saved on your devices. One consideration for your requirements is that the free version only allows you to watch the total networth graph for 2 weeks. And to be honest, the free version works pretty limited compared to its premium model.If you considering other alternatives, pretty much most cryptocurrency trackers are able to manually input the transactions. Moreover, If your concern is only not to trust connecting or inputting the address of the trackers, then I believe you have a lot of options. But, if your main concern not to trust is your privacy, Rotki is a plausible option.",

But manually entering the value instead of giving the wallet details seems progressive but I don't remember any of that kind and if there is one its better to be used over giving wallet/address details to a company which can be used by them to make money in someway.",

However, it displays only those coins created within Ethereum and layer2 networks ,such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Zksync.era and BNB, and numerous other layer2 networks. For monitoring portfolio on cosmos network, use this app. https://wallet.keplr.app/",

It might be a good useful free app for you as it also udpates the price and current token valuation details like when you are searching for tokens. But there are plenty of other defi platform such as defidot, zerion, debank. Personally I like debank for casual monitoring of your asset as it can see all on your L1wallet.",

It can be used for linking wallets, but most of these apps had still issues with that by somehow messing up tx fees and money you used for purchasing or trading the cryptos. But you obviously can just manually set up purchasing price to zero and stuff like that.But may i suggest taking a look at Notion. You can use that among many things to to track your portfolio real time, by installing notion api connector. It takes some tweaking and learning curve might look overwhelming at the start (if you haven't yet been using it for something else). And of course you can use free notion templates just designed for your investment tracking if it seems difficult.",

I will like you to use TradingView and cryptocurrency alerting apps. For the cryptocurrency alerting app, you can be alerted when the price of the coin hit the position your setting placement of the alert. And in the TradingView you can check the price of the portfolio every minute and day. But the cryptocurrency alerting is only when the price hit the position you set.And to know if you gain or loss. That is you have to check the time you buy it and whenever you are checking, you to check the present price and compare not to the time of purchase then you will know the differences.",

It's easy and safe to use to track your portfolio especially when you use the app instead of the Web. You can also add your exchange and Wallet holdings to it which makes it support both DEX and CEX holdings because you don't need to connect any of them.",

Who knows, maybe it's buried deep in all the threads here in the altcoin section. But it's really helpful for monitoring the value of each coin and they have a wide number of listed coins in that application. After that, you could add some widgets so there won't be a need to open the application itself. Sometimes it doesn't load due to maybe slow connection but a refresh will do the trick by force closing the application and re-opening it. It's been years that I have been using it, and even when I changed my phone that's the first thing that I installed because it's really a big help for me.",

I usually find out on CMC only 2 points, the first is the type of coin and which market it is listed on, apart from other important information.If the OP has entered trading in market Crypto, I think this data can also be seen in the stock exchange application that he has downloaded on his smartphone.",
