Not all engineers will want to move, and it is very difficult and expensive to prepare a qualified replacement. And very important developments were carried out in the Russian office.If they don't let me into Europe, I will spend my money in Turkey, Egypt or in my own country. I think that if sanctions prevent Russians from spending money in Europe, then this is a nail in the coffin for the European economy",

In the past I used to rent some hashrate from miningrigrentals, and there's a considerable number of Russian rigs to rent.But it's hard to find these numbers, specially because they will probably be in russian language.There's a lot of things happening at the same time, the chips crisis, war in Ukraine, China threatening Taiwan, ETH POW end...Talking about GPUs, what you guys have available right now? AMD only?",

I think it's a calculated move. They probably took time to think about the consequences, and it's probably why they have taken a while to act, unlike other companies that pulled out in the very first weeks of the war.",

It's really sad to see that innocent people are being impacted because of the decisions made by a communist leader.

Trump does the same thing. As I recall, when Putin faced presidential term limitshe put his puppet Mevedev in the position then forced him to change the constitution to eliminate term limits so Putin could become President for life.This time Medvedev is just playing the good puppet again saying things Putin can't say out loud wihout alarming China and india, his only friends left.BTW Putin is a Czarist, not a Communist.
