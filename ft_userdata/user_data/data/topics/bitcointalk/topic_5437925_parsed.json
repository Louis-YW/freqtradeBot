  "content": "With the positive note from Indonesian Ministry of Trade, they are hoping to launch their own national crypto exchange. So this is nothing like their own digital currency but fully functioning National Crypto Exchange which will be under direct control of Indonesian Government.This is positive because Indonesia wants individual and businesses to get involved with the crypto market alongside the stocks and shares and thus dont want to be left out of any kind of market. QuoteIndonesia’s Ministry of Trade is reportedly aiming to roll out a national crypto exchange by June this year, six months after its previous target of December 2022.Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan shared the new target launch date on Feb. 2 at the opening of Crypto Literacy Month in Jakarta, noting that the government is currently reviewing which companies meet their criteria to become part of the exchange, according to local reports. Government even wants their public to be actively involved in the same and has asked to be patient about its launch. The government is also as excited as any inidvidual would be about the Crypto exchange like this and that too backed up by Government itself. According to the source, the clearing house of nation is involved as escrow thus securing all the trades between buyer and sellers. I think these are some of the good steps that every nation should follow while preparing their own budgets everywhere. It could really take the crypto in right direction and can work alongside the normal assets. QuoteThere are five active crypto exchanges that are currently registered with the country’s regulators, and according to Zulkifli, the ministry’s crypto exchange could encompass all of them.While these exchanges are currently facilitating all trades within the nation, the ministry’s exchange would act as a clearing house and custodian in the local crypto market.A clearing house is essentially a mediator between a buyer and seller, ensuring the transaction goes smoothly. At the same time, its role as a custodian would see it manage the movement of assets between the two parties.The trade minister urged the public to be patient with the national crypto exchange, saying: “Let us not rush because if it is not ready, things will get messy. The government does not want this to massively take a toll on the public because people do not know much [about crypto trading].”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Indonesia had planned to set up its crypto exchange by the end of 2022, but it was delayed due to a number of obstacles.Indonesia targets launch of its national crypto exchange by June",

In my country, there's already an approve local exchange though because of the dominance of international exchange, they seems pretty neglected by many locals, I hope they can get a good hype as well and the locals will start supporting their own exchange.",

In recent years, we saw Indonesia and their governments starting the adoption in the country, now we can see many famous bitcoiner people and companies talking positively about Indonesia because there they will provide enough space for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.",

It's but obvious that we can get more than happier and proud if our government's start doing positive stuff about the crypto currencies. Until now we have see full legal tender in western hemisphere and now from Asian countries such news is really another level connectedness for the whole thing. It's always start as small beginning. Lets say today Indonesia adopts it fully and neighboring countries start seeing the good developments and positivity, then eventually they will also follow the trend and try to be in the market for the same - after seeing their financial goals off course.

      "body": "Indonesia's announcement that it would build its own national cryptocurrency exchange is quite promising. It's fantastic that the government is making concerted efforts to attract more people and companies interested in the cryptocurrency industry. This will allow users to spread their investment risk over a wider range of assets and offer a secure environment in which to trade cryptocurrencies.Having the national clearing house act as the escrow service is a brilliant concept since it guarantees the safety of all transactions between buyers and sellers. Greater trust and openness in the market are precisely what the cryptocurrency industry needs today. The government's support for the exchange guarantees that it will be widely publicized and visited by those who are interested in cryptocurrency trading but haven't yet had the opportunity to do so.When the Minister of Trade warned against rushing the establishment of the national crypto exchange, I agreed. Taking care to do things properly and check that everything is in order is crucial. There's no use in trying to solve the problem quickly and making things worse. The public must be comfortable utilizing the exchange and knowledgeable about its operation.With any luck, the debut of Indonesia's national crypto exchange will be as successful as I expect it to be. The cryptocurrency industry might take a giant leap forward if other countries follow suit. Envision a scenario when all governments accept crypto and provide a secure trade environment.",

This will ensure more transparency for users and greater guarantees that their savings are safe. There is a large number of users in Indonesia, as it is one of the largest countries in Asia in terms of population and the largest country in the Islamic world. If it really succeeds in launching this platform (which I doubt), other countries will certainly follow suit.Despite everything, I still think that Indonesia is logistically unable to control efficiently in this field. Therefore, it is not surprising that the launch has been postponed many times. Other countries, more technologically advanced than Indonesia, did not risk such an experiment.",

Actually the government does not need to worry about Indonesian citizens or society to be actively involved in this matter. Because from the data revealed by TEMPO.CO, that almost 20% of Indonesian citizens are still very active and involved in crypto exchanges. But I believe more than that or even up to 30% of people in Indonesia who have started to engage with the crypto space in general. From a local source I read that the government's planned launch of the crypto exchange has been postponed several times in the last few years. The platform was originally planned for 2021, but the deadline was pushed back several times due to unforeseen operating issues. For now, cryptocurrencies will be traded alongside commodities in contracts managed by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency in Indonesia.

It could really take the crypto in right direction and can work alongside the normal assets. This is indeed looking very good and also very good for citizens as well as for countries that still don't really believe in crypto. But for Indonesia itself Didit Nurdiatmogo, head of the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Popepti), has indicated that the government will set up exchanges before the Financial Services Authority takes over crypto oversight from the Commodity Agency. This means that the authorities in Indonesia still need time to prepare this in order to be successful in the near future. Source: balicitizen.com",
