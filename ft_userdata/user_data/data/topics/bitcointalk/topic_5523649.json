      "body": "Please take my reply with a pinch of salt as I've never experienced buying any Bitcoin product on stock exchanges. Anyway, in terms of safety, it's safe in a way because you're doing it on a highly regulated and compliant platform, but unsafe in a way because you don't actually own any real Bitcoin, only a kind of ETP. So, you aren't actually in control of your Bitcoin. As to the price, I guess the crypto market and the stock market more or less mirror each other's Bitcoin price, but you'll probably spend more on fees and commissions when buying on the stock market.By the way, are individuals or the retail market allowed to buy Bitcoin on LSE? Last I heard only professionals are allowed to do so.",

The \"bitcoin\" you will buy is regulated by an authority and therefore you do not actually have full access nor control over it which is to me not safe since I would want to be the one to hold my actual bitcoin.QuoteHow dose the price differ from BTC its self?What commision do they charge?Each market has some differences due to real time tracking errors. It is possible that the price in one market appears a few dollars short or vice versa. But with stock exchanges there is usually the broker fee you have to consider. I am pretty sure it differs per each one so you are going to need to choose the best one.May I ask why buy in stock exchange though??? Why not just buy in a crypto exchange if you really want a centralized authority holding your coin",

Like imagine of a demand for buying stocks on a Bitcoin or cryptocurrency exchange, see something wrong here?Buying shares of Bitcoin Spot ETF is risky because these shares have to be backed equivalently by bitcoin. You have to trust the ETF share issuers and their custodians like Coinbase. If anything is shady, wrong with either the issuer or the custodian, you won't be able to claim your bitcoin from ETF shares.QuoteMay I ask why buy in stock exchange though??? Why not just buy in a crypto exchange if you really want a centralized authority holding your coinI agree with you on this.Want stocks? Buy them on stock exchanges.Want Bitcoin?

If your goal is to own Bitcoin (I assume so looking at his post history) and if you can't find a good exchange to work with, you can try P2P. It will probably be a bit expensive and needs some trial and error, but you'll get your Bitcoin in the end.Anyway, other than Coinbase, what other exchanges have you tried OP?",

Do you think the stock broker owns any bit coin though? meaning they own the bitcoin and you dont they just owe it to you like banks and fiat currency. Or is it just a futures market thing where there is no actual Bit Coin in there?We're talking here specifically of ETN because that's the kind of ETP that's being offered on LSE. I guess the general description of an ETN is that it is unsecured. Meaning to say, it doesn't own the asset it is tracking. However, there are actually Bitcoin ETNs offered in the market that are fully collateralized. I've read, for example, that VanEck's Bitcoin ETN is 100% fully-backed by actual coins kept in cold storage.Furthermore, I'm referring you to the Crypto ETN Admission Factsheet, a document which specifically outlines the admission process of crypto ETNs on LSE. It says there that crypto ETNs, to be admitted, should be \"physically backed\" or that it \"has Bitcoin or Ethereum underlying cryptoassets\", 90% at least. Finally, of course, you will have to do some due diligence as to the issuer of the specific ETN you have your eyes on, its fees and whatnot.",

Last I heard only professionals are allowed to do so. Yes, you heard right; only professionals are allowed to buy BTC ETP on LES, according to the UK Financial Conduct Authority. The main aim is to protect beginners or less experienced individuals from potential risks, which is why they allow only professional retailers. Here is the linkThe OP is getting into the professional lineup, which I think is not suitable for him right now. Firstly, you cannot hold the actual Bitcoin, and secondly, there are higher fees and commissions from brokers, which cause high costs. Instead, he can buy it directly from exchanges and own it in a wallet. Moreover, the price is actual, and he doesn't have to pay any commissions or fees.",
