If no, then as soon as the BTC enters an exchange account or wallet, it's the individual who deposited it and the exchange in question that's going to be at risk. If anyone ever purchases BTC from that exchange, the Silkroad BTC won't be linked to them because they might have mixed with other BTC on the exchange. There is also a possibility of buying that coin and mixing it with any Bitcoin mixer out there, and the address might no longer be linked to your own.",

Do you go to bed pondering over whether the cash you got today from the grocery store was previously obtained from a drug deal? No you don’t. Besides how are we supposed to know where the bitcoins have been anyway?? IMO as long as you bought those “tainted” bitcoins legally and can explain your source of income if need be, then you don’t have a problem with the authorities. I think this is a problem bitcoin mixers solve. You can use a mixer to clean your bitcoins if you’re so worried about where they have been, you send the bitcoins to a mixer and they will come out sparkling clean.",

They would have to destroy it and never sell it. What happens when you buy these coins from the government, because many people bought seized coins on auctions? Can bitcoin be really destroyed? I don’t think it possible except you mean loosing the private key to its wallet as that would be the equivalent of not having it been transferred or used by any means.So in what context were you implying this?Still, you have a commodity in the market and not the blackmarket or its likes but this is the US government putting out some seized coins for reuse by selling it to willing buyers. There isn’t anything wrong in that. It’s just business and should you care about your privacy, you can take steps to mix coins before retrieving it to a safe wallet.",

I think the authorities can blacklist the bitcoin addresses that have been linked to the criminal activity, and since the blockchain is a public ledger, everyone can see when and where the bitcoins from these wallets are being moved, this is how the government follows the trail to find where the money is going. They also have the power to ask centralized exchanges to cooperate with them and report any suspicious transactions from such addresses. Like I said before, using a mixer makes it difficult for anyone to track your bitcoin transactions.",

Rather, their post was about how safe would it be to buy these, most likely because of the 'taint' concept centralized custodial exchanges/governments are pushing. In this case, since the bitcoins were sold to coinbase, if op were to deposit them to another CEX, rather than silk road, it's likely to be associated with Coinbase.",
