  "content": "I know I have been asleep for over a year. I get that. I was busy in real life.Anyway, I have recently taught myself Tailwindcss. I know my layouts have been shit in the past but this time I put a lot of effort into the design and I am actually proud of what I've done. I also used a bit of jQuery to make the site look nicerHere's the link to the site I have recently designed. Just ignore the content and focus on the layout itself.How does it look? Am I getting better? If you would like to hire me, I will do a layout for cheap as I am just estabishing myself as a web designer still.I also know Laravel and a bit of Node.js. I have a little experience working with the MEAN stack and I'm halfway through a MEAN course on Udemy.PM me if interested.",
