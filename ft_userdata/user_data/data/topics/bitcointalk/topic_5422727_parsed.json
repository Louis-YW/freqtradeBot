For sure it hadnt been done ever since considering on what would be the effects and this is why we do see that inflation due to continous printing but of course it would really be that on controlled manner because if they would really be doing this then we can already picture out on what would really gonna happen.Speaking of criminality then it is really just a normal thing that we do seeon a society since from the beginning of time where there are people who are really that having this kind of mindset even if they arent on a verge or situation where they have not something to eatbut rather they do have other personal motives and intents which is really not that always pertain about economical aspect.",

The government should also ensure the safety of every people while dealing with the economic crisis, by this they can rise again at the right time.Whenever there is recession, we can experience the increase in the crime. This is all because of the money getting accumulated with the rich and not falling down to the common man. This leads to increased crime in all ways. Most of the jobless people and the people who got fired during the time period looking for a way to earn makes them get into criminal activities. Here we can't mention theft increase, because the theft who steal for his food tomorrow does the same to have luxury. At the base it needs to be stopped, and this can be done by the government.",

Don't you worry about the richest people who are paying body guards for protection, because they certainly don't think about you and are more shielded than the average person on the street will ever be. I don't know what poor and corrupt country you are from, but even in the middle of the worst recessions people are free to drive in their flashy cars without fear in most western countries. Your ideas about turning on and off the printers are totally detached from how crime levels are fluctuating. You can have recessions whether central banks are gorging or not.",

First, because there are opportunities that the perpetrators can take advantage of against those who will become victims, and second, because there is still hunger among a group of people, so they choose to commit various crimes in order to get what they want in life. One of them is money and food, and it certainly doesn't look surprising in some poor and developing countries because usually job vacancies in poor and developing countries are not that many.QuoteSo anyways we all want safe life so we know solution we got to turn on money printers and make sure inflation not going high.Back in the days people use to be soft more but now people cant handle dangerous surroundings.Printing too much money without having a certain amount according to the cheat rules will also be very dangerous. Because when there is more money circulating in society and it cannot be controlled by certain parties within a country. Then the value of the currency will also decrease so that money will look like paper that has no value because there is nothing to rely on anymore.",

      "body": "I was watching the content of an independent investigative reporter travelling through american cities to see how bad things were. When she arrived there was a man lying on the sidewalk spasming, while surrounded by discarded needles. Overdosing on whatever drug. She interviews one of the city residents and they say that its normal for them to have around 5 people overdose and die in the streets everyday. She interviews a local business. Across the street a store is being robbed. The business owner says its normal for them to be robbed 3 to 5 times everyday.It is possible everyone underestimates how bad things are getting in big cities in the united states. America didn't see this type of wholesale homelessness, crime and violence until the economic crisis of 2008. But now it seems that things are getting worse. Its bringing out the worst behavior in many. Hopefully it will also bring some good, although I can't see much indications of it.",

I couldn't agree with you more on that, bruh. These things happen as a result of greed inherent in man. Where I come from, our leaders take advantage of economic situations which in some cases they create just so they can benefit from. I think crime comes as a result of two occasions; 1. Where human beings are naturally not satisfied with what they have,2. Those who feel cheated of what's supposed to be rightfully theirs .",
