That Ledger is a shitty company that has not only been so careless that it has let its customers' data be stolen several times but is also going to implement a program that goes against the principles of bitcoin and what a HW should be?It's a topic worthy of debate but they're not going to send anyone's seeds if they don't pay, at least in theory.Quote from: NotATether on May 16, 2023, 01:10:36 PMThis is a paid feature so it's not sending your seed phrase anywhere unless you pay $9.99 per month for it (which is a dumb subscription).Seeing that the last thread in Important Announcements was: Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts  and that the previous ones were 4 years before that, I don't see the issue as important, but maybe theymos does.",

Do we know that people using Ledger are being put at significant additional risk just by upgrading their firmware, if they don't opt into any backup stuff?Ledger claims that it is exactly so, but my opinion (as well as many others) is that this company can no longer be trusted - because what they do is the complete opposite of what every hardware wallet represents, which is that seed can never leave the device in such a way that it can be sent electronically, regardless of whether it is a voluntary consent or the possibility that someone inside the company or some hacker can use it.The risk definitely exists, even for those who decide to use this service, because regardless of the way to protect such sensitive information (seed), it is just an additional risk that is also paid $9.99 per month, and requires KYC. We can only guess what the possible implications are for those who will use the new firmware without this option, but I think that people should be warned about what is happening.",

Quote[...] if you have a lot of crypto assets, is to use a hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421039.0I would suggest theymos to edit the Ledger part.

Seems they are moving towards Eth foundation mindset.There are many who think of bitcoin as an investment and are afraid even to keep the seeds, they think it is a big risk and therefore the idea of having a third party that enables you to get your money back will be attractive to many of these beginners.It seems that most of the buyers of this HW are from these people, unfortunately the market is what moves these companies and not what you want.Quote from: digaran on May 17, 2023, 09:25:37 PMKYC for bitcoin wallet?

Why no important announcement about Trezor's unfixable seed extraction vulnerability? Why no important announcement about Trezor/Wasabi's government sanctioned surveillance and censorship? Why no important announcement about Coinomi sending seed phrases to Google servers? What about Block's hardware wallet which is specifically built on this exact idea of sending your seed phrase to a bunch of third parties? And if people are so concerned about the fact your private keys can be extracted from the secure element in Ledger wallets, then what about all the hardware wallets which don't even have a secure element in the first place? They are just as risky.There are a plethora of critical vulnerabilities and horrible business decisions out there that we don't have announcements about.
