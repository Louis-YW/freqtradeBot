I wouldn't recommend buying large microSD cards, for different reasons, though.These include performance, long-term reliability and the ability to use other form factors like 2.5\" SATA for a number of different applications, meanwhile with a microSD as boot drive you're pretty much stuck to single-board computers.",

In theory is it recommended or possible to run a node on 1TB micro SDXC with every 10 minute block updates? It is possible to run Bitcoin node of that system but I won't recommend you to run it on Raspberry Pi 4 as its processing power is very low and could be the cause of instability. It is technically possible to download and run the blockchain copy on 500 GB SSD, but you should also keep in mind that the size of Bitcoin blockchain is growing with all new transactions and thus 500 GB is not future proof enough.Micro SDXC is not a good option for storing of the Bitcoin blockchain as the storage device is very slow and its life expectancy isn't good at all. The read/write speeds of that micro SDXC are so slow and if added that on an already slow RPI4 then that will make the system even more instable. Although transferring of blockchain from the SSD to micro SDXC won't affect the life expectancy of it in any way but writing of new blocks for extended period will affect its life expectancy of the storage device.It's better to go with a 1 TB SSD as that will still be a better option than micro SDXC for just running the node, but still the overall system will be instable due to low processing power that RPI4 offers because that processing power isn't sufficient enough to run the Bitcoin node with stability.",

Never give those scalpers what they demand, at least I refuse to do that. Have a look at https://rpilocator.com/ maybe you get lucky and can fetch a device when a shop gets them in stock. Some shops offer their customers some kind of membership offers with limited amount of devices and reserved for shop members.I got my last RPi Compute Module 4 with 8GB RAM from such a shop's club membership (only registration needed, no extra fees or similar crap) for a totally normal price. With an appropriate mainboard such a RPi Compute Module 4 can also use NVMe SSDs which offers easier setup with TRIM support for the SSD (TRIM support is also possible for a normal RPi 4B and USB3-SATA-adapter, but this depends heavily on the adapter. Some work nicely, some are a pain in the ass.)",
