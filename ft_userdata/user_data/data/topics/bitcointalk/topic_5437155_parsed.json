  "content": "I was fortunate enough to learn about Bitcoin before it became so popular. Similarly, I'm one of the idiots who saw this as a huge opportunity to make money, didn't think twice about it, and let it pass them by.Back in 2014, I started my first full-time job online on Fiverr, and I had a couple of friends who were passionate about Blockchain and Bitcoin. It didn't take long for me to make a friend named Michael. We talked a lot about programming and new technology like IoT and AI most of the time. We used to play video games together most of the time when I visited him.One day, after finishing the game, I took his phone to call my girlfriend, and then I noticed something on his phone. It appears to be1BvBMSEZstWetqSFy5Au4m4GFg7xJaHVG6. I noticed that he wanted to send it to someone. I was like, what kind of nonsense is this? He said it wasn't gibberish, then he explained everything I needed to know about Bitcoin addresses and blockchains, and his enthusiasm for the subject captivated my attention so much that I didn't want him to stop talking. But then I recall most of the Ponzi schemes that I fell prey to in the past. The more he talked about it, the more Bitcoin appeared to be the better option for me. It was worth a shot.One of the biggest issues I had that year, and it was the worst year of my life, was that I was very poor, and I didn't have extra money to gamble on something I don't know about. As a result, I concluded that I can't gambling on this.I'm furious at myself for not purchasing bitcoin sooner. Though I'm a happy man now because I can now smile at my wallet.Invest now, so you will not regret it later.",

      "body": "I totally agree with you, my friend. Never do the things you will regret and if you do, never regret. I understand where you're coming from with the hesitation to invest in Bitcoin back then. BTC had a bad reputation and the association with the \"dark web\" and Ponzi schemes made it hard to trust. But as we both know now, it's a real digital currency with huge potential to replace fiat currencies in the future. It's true that there may be \"lost trains\" when it comes to Ponzi schemes, but a good project like Bitcoin is always a good investment. It's never too late to start investing and we should never regret not starting sooner.",

I usually don't tell people to buy now or regret, I'd rather make them consider all the pros and cons of owning a bitcoin. Once you think about it for a while you'll come to a conclusion that there's a lot of pros, so many you  could make a list, but only 1 significant con (not being able to turn your coins back into fiat without a loss if after you've bought btc enters the bear market).",

It is not shrewd to invest when you do not ave sufficient amounts to spare at the time.Quote from: Cyber_Alien on January 28, 2023, 08:53:58 PMInvest now, so you will not regret it later.Invest as much as you can risk at the time.- Jay -",

Better late than never! ~snip~^ Because there are people who don't get easily believe in BTC the same as me before, I have heard of BTC since 2015 but I don't what it is that is the reason I ignored it at that time, but after a year there is a lot of my friend talking about BTC until the such day I become influenced by them and I did not regret that until now BTC became a famous and very valuable asset.Yes, it is not too late to invest, as long as you have money that can afford to wait for a long-term purpose, then, it is a good asset. People will regret will most likely seeing the price is on ATH but when there is a huge correction, it is always doubted.",

My word to you ops is that you should invest only what you can afford to use and leave alone for a long time, and not to push in so much that you can't bear it all because you want to recover the lost time since you think you have missed out a lot since 2014.",

Not all people are going through same circumstances; some could really afford losing from market price downfalls but most are not. We also have different investment capabilities concerning capital. What's best for those who are planning is to invest first on the knowledge to avoid getting too dragged into hopes of being rich from this industry. That would also help them to know where would they start and focus in this industry. Also, there's no such thing as late; the best time to invest is when you are financially and mentally stable.

I heard someone in the past, he doesn't need to pair anything, his mindset; bitcoin is bitcoin, 1 btc=1btc, so if we think like that, we have sure we'll be fine if the bitcoin price is back to $0.1, reverse, when btc price to be $1 million, it's just a bonus.",
