Actually, popular IPTV charge a lot of money, some charge you like $10 or more every month, but there are cheap IPTV that does not buffer a lot, and I think the poster above have a good recommendation as the OP of that thread shared is still active until now and at the same time no red trust.",

Those offering services in this forum starts at 10$ but i have seen some local vendors in my country offer way less than this amount.You have such services for less than $5 a month, but in 90% of cases you will have problems with viewing because such service providers compensate the price of the service with worse servers and a much larger number of users than they should have. If you want a somewhat high-quality service, then you will have to pay for it, although always ask for a test for at least 24 hours and try to do it on the weekend when the server load is the highest.Quote from: noormcs5 on January 25, 2023, 11:40:39 PMAlso i have asked what is the different between B1G, 5GLIVE, OPPLEX ? Are they different servers for IPTV ?As far as I understand from the offer, these services offer programs from India, Pakistan... and it is possible that they all have the same owner, because that way they get more users. The only way to know if there is a difference in quality is to try each one and then decide on the one that works best for you.",
