  "content": "Hey all, I’ll preface this post with I am very new to the bitcoin community and don’t have a ton of experience with Linux OS or Bitcoin core. I recently installed Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on an old laptop, and downloaded bitcoin core from the software center to setup my first node. However, during the IBD process the window began closing without an error. It downloaded the first 25% of the block without an issue, but now bitcoin core will only stay open for 45 minutes to an hour before automatically closing. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

That may be related.The earliest blocks are relatively smaller compared to the rest so there aren't too much verification or file size to write.Please provide more info just as described in this sticky topic: [READ BEFORE POSTING] Tech Support Help Request Format",

As for space, I wiped the computer when I installed Ubuntu 22.04 so it is completely empty outside of whats been downloaded so far from the IBD. The bitcoin core version is 24.0.1. What is the best way to open the debug log file?",

Open the \"debug.log\" file as text, it's inside bitcoin core's data directory.If you haven't set a custom datadir, here's the default data directory: en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory#Default_Location",
