There is no very important or best it's all depends on the ASIC units performance and efficiency there are lots of ASIC miner that support sha256 algo and for me, both Canaan and Bitmain units are fine",

Um, virtually all use -ck's/Kano's cgminer as their embedded miner control software along with their own specific chip driver to communicate with it (and in violation of the open source GPL lic refuse to publish their source code)-- not Luke Jr's ripoff of it...The only exceptions are those using Bitfury chips (Bitfury has their own miner code) or folks that switched out the OEM cgminer code to use Braiins.",

RPC MinerEven many mining softwires have appeared in recent times, among them CGMiner Bitcoin Mining Software is quite popular. Due to several advantages of this mining software, it has gained maximum acceptance for use by all. Especially CGMiner's open source build's ability to run on any computer, as well as its easy compatibility with mining hardware, keep it still at the top of the miner's choice list. But this software runs on Mac, Windows and Linux but it is difficult to install on Windows 10 computer. But this manning software is compatible with ASIC, GPU and FPGA. A miner basically uses mining software to his advantage. Many miners can also use BFGMiner and MultiMiner software for mining.",
