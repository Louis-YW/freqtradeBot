If it's a decentralized exchange, you won't have to pay any fees, the listing will be done for free. For centralized exchanges, we have a lot, but I can tell you there won't be free here. If you want something that's both good and free or cheap that doesn't exist today, everything has to be measured in terms of money, that's true. It's just like you want your coin to be used by many people and increase in price so your coin needs to be really good so don't expect something cheap but best out of it.",

In my opinion if these days there are not free listings. The problem is how can your token comply with all of requirements needed by exchange site to list your token. yeah even binance can listing your token for free but the question is what progress that already made by your token? how reliable the platform to support your token? there are bunch of things need to be filled when you wanna see your tokens to be listed in legit exchange site with decent daily trade volume. I think these are valid point to remind you that these days requirements are so hard. I can only suggest bitmart.",

Thanks again.Centralized exchanges which are highly popular never comes with free listing or the fee which is cheaper, it will be atleast few thousand dollars as far as I know and even the fee is not going to be enough until you meet all their listing criteria. I don't think the fee for listings are available for public so you can contact the exchange for detailed information and also can apply for listings with the provided form and all the information about your project.",

Thanks again.maybe DEX is the best place for that. as far as I know, to list on the CEX, requires quite a lot of money, and the better and the quality of the CEX, the higher the fee required. If you want quality, then you need to spend a lot of money for it. If you want to quickly list the coins so that they can be traded, then DEX might be good enough to start with, but if you are targeting CEX, I don't recommend looking for cheap ones, and it might be more memorable when the coins you have listed are the first popular CEXs.",

Thanks again.You will face the problem of liquidity and therefore listing the platform “for free” does not mean that it will gain sufficient liquidity for its continuity. If you do not have a good marketing plan, your platform will end up without orders or be removed from the central platforms.",

I do hear news in telegram about how they make a deal, most exchanges will want part of the total coins that you have and then some in USD. Binance has an event of free listing before but it requires a great deal of effort. From re-tweeting to total sold coins of the project in a short span of time.",

Ithink that you shall go to the low tier exchange site but the main problem is if it has no enough liquidity and fully traded by bots. There are so many small exchange sites in the market and only a few exchange sites that were showing the real volume while majority of small exchange sites are manipulating their daily trade volume. This is not a recommended thing to use it. It's better to list your token in dex and add liquidity with your own money",

Most of the cheap centralized exchange offers only small volume and most of them are from fake trading. Your only chance to get listed on exchange with good trading volume are on DEX which doesn’t charge any listing. The only thing you need to do is to make sure that your tokens has sufficient liquidity for traders.",
