There's no board specifically assigned to that.Quote from: LowRezStudios on February 22, 2023, 03:21:46 AMAre you guys open to adding a dedicated place for art?There may not be a dedicated place for arts but just as being said earlier, you need to define the purpose of your art with the content before finding a suitable board it may fit in.Quote from: LowRezStudios on February 22, 2023, 03:21:46 AMIs that dedicated place the Off-Topic board?Every off topic or threads posted on the wrong board ended up here, but i can tell you that we've got alot of art contest thread nit ended up being on off topic because they were always on point.",
