It is good to hear about your achievement, but starting to achieve income or profit does not mean that you have become financially independent.Earning money from trading is the first step, and then you need to double that money to reach a time when you have enough money to pay your expenses for a year, two or three, which cannot be achieved with $300 anywhere in the world.You have taken the first step and there is a lot waiting for you.",

Though I lost money trading, I did earn a decent amount of cryptocurrency from other sources such as campaigns and marketing. Some holdings performed well, while others disappointed me. However, the overall position in cryptocurrency is good. You just have to be cautious and learn a lot if you want to make money in the crypto space. Because there are a lot of shit tokens around us and a lot of scammers seeking into our funds. It is becoming extremely difficult to earn cryptocurrency on a frequent basis.",

Now that you are already making money, even if we say it’s not something big, but at least you are now in profits. Just continue to learn and do your best in trading, you will gain a lot more when you become skilled at it. For now, let me say congratulations and I’m sure your parents must be so proud of you.",

I didn't have any special skills, nor was I participating in a signature campaign. However, I managed to acquire some BTC through faucets, which were quite pointless back in 2014 but worth a decent sum of money in 2017 and were sold for a decent profit then. I slowly acquired more knowledge and entered a signature campaign, from which I was earning a semi-decent sum of money per month.Unfortunately, I abandoned the forum in 2018 and returned somewhere between late 2020 and early 2021. I can't say that I'm independent because of Bitcoin, but I can certainly claim that it has helped me acquire financial freedom.",

Although, I think the important thing to highlight here is you've taken a step of actually owning your money, and not relying on third parties. The only thing about that, is the image you posted above an exchange or a wallet? I assume, it's an exchange, as long as you aren't storing your Bitcoin without owning the private key, and definitely don't share that private key with a third party. However, I'm sure a lot of users here have found financial independence through Bitcoin, it provides opportunities that the traditional fiat system doesn't provide or at least there's less competition for offering services, which will eventually change.",

New investors like me have already been given the opportunity with this bear market to invest in bitcoin. With little profit made. The next step is to diversify it to local businesses like holding agricultural produce for the upcoming recession. With the diversification one could DCA or do future trading under no pressure. The other business could spare as source of means.",

Even though I lost my money, I still had this man in me that hungered to know more about this bitcoin of a thing - this was how I continued and today, I am glad I did not give up, bitcoin have given me a new kind of life and have provided opportunities for me in places where I never did thought I would find such opportunities.All thanks to the genius in Satoshi Nakamoto, for giving the world a new kind of light and hope to many that would have today been hopeless.",

We can always benefit from crypto as long as we never think of quitting just because of initial losses. Of course, losing is inevitable in trading but that won’t mean that we will always keep on losing, we will gain rewards eventually after we finally learn how to be good traders. Just keep the momentum. Although the profits are not that big, but the fact that you keep on honing your trading skills, you will do great in the future. Break a leg!",
