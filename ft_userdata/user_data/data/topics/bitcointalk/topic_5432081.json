Yeah, back then, there were alot of sites in operation but only few did stuffs like this ....Secondly, what's the essence of trying to login your email if I may ask? Don't tell me you're tryna claim some audio Bitcoin that weren't shown much concern when awarded until now, is it? Cus virtually everyone HODLing much BTCs in the system got some as you did too; they weren't as careless as you to have gotten it in their control until now, No...that wasn't the case.The only thing you'd do to save your ass (if only it works) is to try recovering that OLD email, except maybe you added a recovery email back then, if not, ¬†it's gone for life, just as you never wanted 'em at first. Good luck with that!Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

Exactly, even if that site is alive the chances are almost zero as things have changed in the last 12 years. When OP got those free bitcoins, it was worth less than 1 dollar, and now they are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, asking the site to pay for those bitcoins will never happen. OP, those bitcoins were once in your possession, but since you don't withdraw them to your non-custodial wallet, if you can find them again, they will have no reason to pay you. Their value has changed a lot, no one gives you hundreds of thousands of dollars for free.",
