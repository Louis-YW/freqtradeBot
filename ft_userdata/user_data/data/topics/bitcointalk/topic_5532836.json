Trump have already did his initiative to stop them so expect that those that are in plan will also follow suit. And, if they are still in there. CBDCs are not a Bitcoin killer. It's far from what it is believed to do if they're launched. While they have a say to the progress of Bitcoin, no matter how hard they try their range of power and jurisdiction is limited.Compared to how vast the Bitcoin community and the support that it gets globally.",

Though, if CBDCs introduce normal people to a technology that operates similarly to Bitcoin, they'd inadvertently be giving people practical experience of how the Blockchain works, how to do transactions, and validating the overall concept that Bitcoin started, inevitably leading to people researching what came first, which inevitably leads to a switch to Bitcoin. CBDCs may not be good in the interim, but they may be good for adoption in the long term in my opinion.",

They can implement that everywhere but no longer US is going to push for that. I think last year there were several countries that have it ongoing and that's up to them if they will push it. Knowing China, they're very random in terms of this.So, if they give a go signal and pushes for it. They're free to do that and with all of the economic issues that they are facing and agreements left and right, the talks with the US.

Currently in my country there is a 33% tax on\"crypto\" profits, the government are taking revenue from the sector, why would anygovernment try to cut that off?I do see though in the future governments trying to control Bitcoin because as itmatures further its value will increase so I can see that happening, or possibly conflict between countries to try and control as much as possible.",
