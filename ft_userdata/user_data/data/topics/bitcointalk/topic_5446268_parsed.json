  "content": "Privacy coins and mixers are designed and engineered to make transactions which conceal the identity of end users, allowing them to maintain a relative degree of anonymity.While many who are not knowledgeable overreact assuming sinister motives are involved. Privacy coins and mixers are no different from browsing the internet with an adblocker. Most people do not want the fuss of having their transactions being scrutinized by random 3rd parties who will spam them with nonsense advertisements related to their latest purchases. Most also do not want their data sold for profit, if they can help it. This leads to cases of moral and acceptable utilization of privacy coins and mixers.The complexity and coding of most privacy coins and mixers is typically not suitable for criminal applications. Using apps which leave digital footprints across the internet are not a good method for laundering money. Gold and cash are king when it comes to conducting criminal transactions. At the moment, privacy coins and mixers have no specific laws which make them illegal. Most of the action taken against coins and mixers have been under the direction of regulatory bodies like the SEC. Which have been taking action, without having to prove anything illegal occurred in court. Or even having to prove that any laws were violated.While that could change as AML (anti money laundering) proposals are considered. Which might eventually deem mixers and privacy coins illegal. There are no specific laws or regulation which have been passed in the united states that says privacy coins and mixers are illegal and outright banned.As proof of this, we see there remain mixers and privacy coins operating with a presence inside the USA.While some have claimed mixers are \"obviously illegal\" I have yet to see them cite any proof or evidence of this.",

Scammers are preying on innocent investors with the promise of high returns by using all sorts of different tactics to trick people into believing they're getting in on a good deal.

Though dash and zcash cannot be considered as true privacy coins but they delisted them to the point that the coins decreased very well in price and value. The next thing we heard about was that Asians were buying the privacy coins to have the opportunity to earn more. What happened? Their price went up back.Who are the government? Know that the world government can not think the same at the same time. If US government are no more supporting privacy coin, that does not mean that many governments in the world make it illegal already.",

There's also the case of people using it for crimes, but I don't believe mixers are the ones that should be persecuted, the perpetrators should be. I've used mixers in the past to clean my cryptocurrencies and I could tell you right now even though I'd sound like I'm blowing my own trumpet that I am as trustworthy as they go. Does that give the authority grounds to arrest me? I don't think so. At the end of the day, it's the actions thereof that are illegal, not the means that which enables the crime. If that would be the case then guns should be illegalized, knives should be, and owning wealth more than 99% of the world's population too!",

Now if it is known that a certain degree of ring signatures can be followed back, couldn't the security just be raised to a level where statistics make it impractical again? I have never looked into the statistics for that, but stopping mixers seems easier to me then stopping Monero. Mixers would always have to rebuild trust or are there decentralized options?",

But I was reading reviews and discussions, and other people who use same banks were not so lucky and had their bank account frozen for doing large p2p transfers.if you read regulations. a custodian/bank/money service has to allow the funds to move unless they are court ordered to not.., they cant just freeze accounts and steal funds.. the most they can do is allow customer to remove/transer balance and close the account. emphasis banks/custodial services cannot just steal funds as part of their business policyso when something is just \"suspect\" but if it meets a certain suspicion threshold, the money still moves but the service sends a SAR to tax office of financial crimes office(depending on reason) where by if there is criminality then a court order is THEN done to request more information and to freeze accountso account funds are not seized for simply moving money(otherwise rich people would have banking headaches each day they buy a lambo)now the separate situation you experience/heard:many of the p2p transfers are not frozen due to amounts. otherwise businesses/rich people will have accounts closed all the timewhat is actually found is that scammers wanting coin buy coin via p2p. then they call their bank and say that someone hacked their account and spent their money on something the (scammer) didnt want. and request that the transaction is fraudulent. thus red flagging the bitcoin seller as a fraud/thief.. even though it is the buyer being the scammer. where the scammer gets a fiat refund whilst also keeping the cointhis is a known thing called \"chargeback scamming\" it went rife in the days of localbitcoins which eventually made localbitcoiner sellers have to do their own due diligence by asking for KYC to prove the buyer at the keyboard was the account holder. to protect the seller. this then made local bitcoin less popular and now people do it via De-fi to avoid kyc.. which is only at the beginning of people doing chargeback scamming. so expect many sellers to see bank problems when chargeback scamming becomes rife on de-fiand yes many exchanges got red flagged by banks where even centralised exchanges were getting chargeback scammed. which means other innocent people using same cex had a warning to not use that service..over the last 9 years banks were not anti-crypto as much as said. it was that the chargeback scamming was so rife that anything associated with crypto services that were victims of those scams became headaches. where some banks just said no rather than handling things(said no to new business account applications where businesses were 'crypto' based)",
