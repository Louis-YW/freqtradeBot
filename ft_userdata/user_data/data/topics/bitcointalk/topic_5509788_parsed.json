It appears that you are a lover of trucks. From your previous posts, which I have come across, if I remember correctly, you made mention of a van, and at this stage and point in time, I don't think you even need to worry much about the profit as long as you are doing what you love; the experience is all of it.  And, oh yes, I will definitely love to be reading about the experience. If you have the time to be updating the thread with them, I will definitely put it on my watchlist.",

This is just my opinion  but I think that it's more interesting too if you also include other aspects of living in a camper van because nomadic lifestyle is a pretty much new concept for some people here so it's going to really pique their interest if you ask me. What are you planning for your Internet though? I think that a stable Internet is going to be needed right?",

Most people see running a node as a fun thing and of course adding mining to it would be nice. All should be good as long as you have nice electricity and of  course Strong internet connection. I won't really advise making use of a free WiFi or your tether hotspot from your phone since sometimes there is usually slow internet connection though it depends on your location.Anyways congratulations on your new van. I believe you bought it with some bitcoin too  anyways it would be nice of you to share your experience here from time to time it may even assist others who want to venture solo mining and running a node too.",

So, write, and better yet, with a photo for clarity.Regarding \"wood burning stove\", you can heat the room using miner instead of stove. In this way, you will solve the issue of heating and removing excess heat generated by miner. This will be a bonus to your lottery and contribution to supporting the BTC-network.Oh, you are talking about USB miners, and not full-fledged mining rigs? They probably have very modest heat output? And the connection from time to time will reduce your chances of \"winning the lottery\".",

I think as we grow older we need to look for ways to stay excited and for someone like you this is something nice that I would add to the bucket list of things I would like to do, which is stay in a camper van off-grid for a very short time even if I'm not able to do it for a long time or try mining from it. @Jet Cash, I look forward to it.",

I personally like the idea of a camper van, seems like a neat idea to travel and be sustainable yourself, a remote hotel on wheels. If I were you, I'd look into attaching a few solar panels on the roof that you could use for extra electricity, with which you could potentially run a small ASICs miner, increasing your chances if mining a block.It's definitely going to be an interesting journey, keep us updated with the restoration process.",

You will put the solar panel on the roof of your fan, I've seen  someone do this in the US, Texas to be precise. Raspberry is the best solution to running Bitcoin nodes because they use less energy, and yes USB miners will be good for solo mining, it is like using free energy because those USB takes almost zero power. Good luck with your adventure lifestyle of living, I've seen those living in a truck to be more happier than many US citizens living in a block home, there is a good feeling about this that many don't know.",

USB miners are very, very weak compared to ASIC miners, so chance of you hitting a block is enormously low in an environment where difficulty increases all the time and brand new miners with higher hashrates are released. You'll only waste electricity without any profit. If you want to do it for fun, then do it.

The idea of treating solo as a form of entertainment is even without high hopes. Though, it's interesting. Really like the lottery!I'm certain many will want to hear of your stories. Maybe sharing the experience might inspire many people to take different paths, or perhaps give insight into some of the hard-to-cover pleasures of cycling with the crypto industry. Ever wondered how you could save or share that content?Quote from: Synchronice on September 21, 2024, 11:02:16 AMSolo mining with USB sticks as you said, is absolutely meaningless.

If I were you, I would do a lotto or invest a tiny amount of my money in memecoins just for fun only.It is actually really true. The chance is very low, namely hitting the block. Mainly, especially with complexity and congestion such as in the ASIC miners, if only for entertainment purposes. Not that unimportant yet; it is even more important to have realistic expectations.Your putting your few coins into memecoins or even trying your luck at the lottery is an interesting option. At least with those options. It is possible to be happy without the same kind of materialism. In the end, it is all about finding fun in whatever you want to do. Whether it's mining or other routes.",
