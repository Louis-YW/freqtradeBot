This is the entire family of S19 miners from 2020 to now.I am pretty sure that there are wildly different ASIC chips being used in all of these miners with different packaging sizes such as 7nm, 5nm, even 3nm maybe. But the Bitcoin Wiki page for miners is terribly outdated (partially my fault for stalling the update of new miners) and the product details are just scattered across different sections of Bitmain's website.The data will help me answer the question: \"why is Bitmain still using the S19 product line and haven't released a new miner like say S21?\"",

Thanks for working on updating the wiki, it'll be indeed good to have a bit of fresh air on it! I wanted to do it myself for the asics and mining pages, but as I didn't have the right to modify them, I was blocked. It's good to know that it's going to be refreshed",
