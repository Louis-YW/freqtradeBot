  "content": "Hello all,Jean-Luc-Pond said that in his version of VanitySearch no RegExp is implemented and available. However, the original version VanityGen from sam7 contains a regex function. This is also mentioned in its readme.Does anyone know if there is a modified VanitySearch version available that also allows PCRE/RegEx searches? If not, is there anyone among you with C++ skills who could re-implement the missing code from Sam7 in VanitySearch? Looking forward to your comments.",
