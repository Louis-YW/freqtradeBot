  "content": "As of lately we know that Bitcoin is widely criticized as a global reserve currency. Indeed Bitcoin has no intention of replacing any other currencies to take that place. But if the world supports this digital currency to their advantages from the basis of acceptability then it can be used that way. Overall Bitcoin is completely neutral.International trade or exchange requires a universal currency as a reserve currency. Because the powerful countries try to influence it in various ways due to economic and political issues. The dominant global currency changes over time. As we have seen in the past many currencies functioned as global reserve currencies. We knew about some world reserve currencies which were dominate the world as reserve currencies.The Dutch Guilder[/url] (15th and 16th centuries)The Spanish Escudo (17th century)The British Pound Sterling (19th century)The Euro (2nd Global Currency)The US Dollar[/b]The US dollar has been followed as the international reserve currency since World War II to till today. But with the change of time, the world is losing confidence in this dollar due to various reasons. As a result, there is a possibility for another change world reserve currency in the future. But in this case I think Bitcoin as a global currency which will be certainly acceptable.If Bitcoin is considered a neutral global currency it will gain universal acceptance. By which no country will have any authority. No one can influence that currency. Global trade, transactions will be done very securely and in a short time.Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operated through a peer-to-peer network and has gained widespread acceptance in the global economy today and will continue to do so in the future. Although we know that there are many issues involved in being a reserve currency, considering the benefits of Bitcoin, if it can be taken to such a level, the world can greatly benefit from it. We can expect Bitcoin to be a global reserve currency in the future as it has been researched in recent times.Advantages of Bitcoin being a global reserve currency# Bitcoin is decentralized, Bitcoin has no regulatory body. As a result, no country's government or central bank will have any authority. Moreover, no powerful country in the world can influence it in any way.# It is the best in terms of security. Bitcoin uses advanced cryptographic algorithms to keep its transactions secure and fraud-free, making it completely safe to use.# All transactions are recorded in a ledger through a public blockchain, creating an environment of transparency and accountability.# In the present time, Bitcoin has gained wide acceptance all over the world. Big companies are holding Bitcoin as their savings and the government of the country is also implementing various projects and strategies including payment in Bitcoin. We know that El Salvador has recognized BTC as legal tender. Such an initiative by the government of the foremost country certainly points to Bitcoin becoming a global reserve currency in the near future.Source",

Besides, perhaps you don't know what the \"world reserve\" is and what's meant to serve. If you do, then you must have known that Bitcoin can't fit into that as it has a limited supply of 21 million BTC.The world would need far more than that for reserve.The limited supply can't even be enough for the masses not to talk of the countries, that's even if they turn a blind eye to price stability and newness.",

Global trade, transactions will be done very securely and in a short time.This is the advantage that is been played and would be enjoyed if bitcoin is used as a reserve. Its lack of centra authority will make countries be equal. If we look at the mode of dedollarization, countries aren’t moving towards another countries currency like the yuan because it will still have same problem like the dollar which a country dominance or political power over others. Rather reserves are been diversified into different assets. Some countries like the BRICS association are still suggesting the creation of another currency as an international currency or reserve but this still will be controlled one way or the other.

Although I would love a global adoption of it and possibly it being a legal tender. But its volatility is still a problem for it to be used as global reserve. There’s nothing bad if it is used but all reserve shouldn’t be in bitcoin but rather diversified into various stores of value, because of the volatility.",

      "body": "Before the currency can be a reserve currency, it must have enough spread and market capacity that makes countries use it. Bitcoin, in its current state, is not suitable to be that currency because of the small capacity of the market and the possibility of influencing it from external variables. It is also affected by global events, just as most markets interact. almost.Therefore, after Bitcoin achieves these requirements, it will stand in front of two main challenges, the first is that there is a country ready to adopt Bitcoin, and this means that there is enough demand and supply for the continuity of maintaining market capacity, and the second is the reaction of the United States, as the presence of a competitor to the Federal Reserve means that Loading all countries of the world on the debts of the United States is no longer the same as in the past, and therefore the United States will not stand by and watch as the rug is pulled from under its feet.What I am trying to say here is that the global reserve currency must be centralized, because what will protect it is not people's trust, but military power, and this means that we may need a global war to change these concepts.",

With time, some government may consider bitcoin as a reserve currency though, but fiat is what the governments will prefer most becuase fiat are centralized and not decentralized like bitcoin which government will not like.",

Also, Bitcoin price will be pump hard just to convert all the reserve to Bitcoin since it’s not same with fiat that government will just print money and gold with unlimited supply. Bitcoin is scarce, I wonder how far will the government will purchased Bitcoin since it will surely pump the price to the roof while no one might sell their holdings in the future due to the demand.This is a good idea for us Bitcoin holder but I doubt government will trust decentralized asset with high volatility as reserve.",

But the world is far from ideal. The main problem is whether all countries will be able to agree among themselves on the adoption of btc as a reserve currency. As usual, each country has its own interests and more often than not, they can't agree even on simpler issues. Therefore, I am sure that they will not do without disagreements.There is one more point. A large part of bitcoin is already concentrated in the hands of whales, which means that if btc is accepted as a global reserve currency, a very large financial power will be concentrated in their hands. Any government is aware of this and will not want to give advantage to the whales. I suppose that this factor will also be one of the deterrents from acceptance.It's no secret that the dollar is losing its position as a reserve currency, but still continues to dominate. We should not wait, tomorrow all countries will refuse the dollar. This process can drag on for many years to come. Whether bitcoin will move out dollar of this position is hard to say. I think it's more no than yes.",

But there's much more to a reserve currency than its stability and reliability. The currencies a country uses as a reserve depends on political relations as well, and the thing with Bitcoin is that it's not affiliated with any state. It's good in a way, but can also be seen as disrespectful by many countries that want their currencies to be used more as reserve currencies.I think another obstacle for Bitcoin as a global reserve currency is that Bitcoin is treated as property by various countries, which means there are serious tax implications of using it for international trade or something.",

If bitcoin still has two side about agree or disagree as global currencies always get chance for bitcoin up and down, we can get moment for bitcoin going down to buy back and selling when bitcoin back to higher price again.
