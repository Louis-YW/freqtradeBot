You can use bitcoin core if you are fine with running a full node or choose Electrum if you are fine with running an SPV client.However I have not yet seen any wallet that lets you create SegWit version 1 addresses (aka Taproot) easily.QuoteWhat are difference between Segwit and Taproot transactions?They are both SegWit transactions but what you call \"SegWit\" is the version 0 and what you call Taproot is version 1.Version 0 was introduced in 2017 and it was the first attempt to increase the block capacity among other things and pave the way for future development. Generally speaking when you use SegWit transactions your tx weight becomes smaller so you pay a smaller fee.Version 1 was introduced recently, it introduced Schnorr signatures which can take up smaller space and Taproot changed the way scripts work and opened the door for some interesting smart contracts. For example your script could have many branches but you only spend the output by revealing one small part of the branch. Or when it comes to multisignature scripts you could take advantage of Schnorr signatures and combine all the participant keys and only publish one pubkey+signature unlike the previous versions when you had to publish all pubkeys and signatures, this way the tx size is significantly decreased.QuoteBetween Segwit and Taproot address, what should I use?Use SegWit version 0 since there is no user friendly way of using version 1 (aka Taproot).QuoteIf a wallet supports Segwit and Taproot address, does it support Lightning Network?Not necessarily. For example bitcoin core supports both versions but doesn't have any LN code while Electrum supports version 0 and also LN.",

Is that correct? Taproot certainly helps with multisig transactions, but if I remember correctly, they also make other scripts lighter. Timelocked transactions, for example, take up more space in a block than regular transactions. If I am not mistaken, such (more) complex scripts will take up less space thanks to Taproot.

If so, then this imposes restrictions, because as stated in this thread, only Bitcoin Core and Ledger wallet support Taproot addresses at the moment. Maybe some more, but still, apparently a little. No, no Taproot is compatible with other address forms as well. You can send from a Taproot address to a Legacy or Segwit address. However, you won't be able to take advantage of signature aggregation that is offered with Taproot.  The service you are using will have to be compatible with Taproot addresses though. Just like when Segwit was introduced back in 2017/2018 we had many services that didn't recognize Segwit addresses as valid Bitcoin addresses and so you couldn't send Bitcoin to those addresses from those particular places. Even today some platforms haven't been updated to support Native Segwit.",
