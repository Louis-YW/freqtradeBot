I believe this is already putting bitcoin into threat zone because once the regulatory framework comes it will become hard for all those involved countries to adopt it freely. It’s already made very hard though, but with such Official meet ups and statement it would become more evident for peeps to be afraid of investing more into the crypto.

Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think their decisions are legally binding to anyone, it's more of a declaration of the general stance. I hope, actually, that they won't manage to come up with a unified regulatory framework because even India isn't exactly pro-crypto, and a few others in G20 aren't very friendly either.",

Legalizing cryptocurrencies takes away options from governments to crack down on crypto later down the road. They have a careful stance and leave the door open to attack Bitcoin whenever they want. Leaving it in the greyzone leaves the investors and users at risk. That is what they want. Criminalizing it would require them to take action and that would be too big of a task for them. It is just not possible as we have seen in a couple of other countries now. India tried it and China tried it countless times, but how are you even going to enforce that? Put people into jail for 15 years when they own some crypto or mined DOGE with their graphics card? Other regulations are more painful, like the one that states that you might soon have to KYC every single wallet you ever use to send crypto to an exit point / exchange. That would be quite the hassle for many people and also destroy any effort you put into privacy.",

With a collective decision, we can ensure that regulations are implemented fairly and consistently across countries. That is especially important for countries that currently have restrictions or limitations on crypto, as it could open up opportunities for people to participate in the crypto market.I think it's important to keep in mind that globalization has made it difficult for one country to effectively implement these regulations alone.

India has as much as 30% taxation on the crypto transaction + they are charging 1% TDS. That is the commercial taxation rate for an individual which is really hard to digest, to be honest.
