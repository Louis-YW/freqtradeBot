Then when I clicked on the profile I noticed the tag wasn't there but reading through wiki I noticed it again finally off then, so while this thread pop as notification I decided to tender the profile as to know why.Please is there anything I am not getting correctly? Please correct me if I am wrong.A user can join a forum today but in as much such user is active reading through post then there's a lot for him or her to discover in the forum, so I may not be as old as you think over here but all thread and topic are clickable and readable here so when making findings you could see what others may not see., And it was through this forum I also learn how to use Electrum wallet and many more. I learn almost every day here reading and taking notes of most of the happenings.",

Does the forum known cases when a moderator was fired, or, shall we say, excluded from the list for some kind of abuse? I know cases when moderators left the forum and gave up their powers because they did not have enough time for it. I have never heard of a layoff. Have there ever been such cases in the history of the forum?What I know Lauda is croatian moderator before and correct me if I'm wrong he was fired due to involvement of alleged extortion attempt.Here is the case posted by Quickseller https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1764757.0 don't know if this is the real reason but this heat up argument between them before.",

We're essentially seen as volunteers and not technically employees but we are paid a modest amount for our contributions based on how much we've done that month. If staff weren't paid we'd be going through multiple mods every year and despite even being paid a fair few mods do just leave for whatever reason.",
