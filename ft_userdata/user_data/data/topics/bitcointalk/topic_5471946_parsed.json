Since one can gain a certificate online, I want to use my free time to study a course; nothing specific on cryptocurrency and block chain technology. I researched on some like coursera which I saw doesn't give certificates in respect to Block chains (I don't really how true that is) and also mygreatlearning but I don't know how good their course is.

      "body": "Good idea, but I don't think there would be any free course that gives certification on Blockchain. Coursera and Udemy and others probably have some good courses on Blockchain. There are somethings you have to consider like, you have to have a specific focus on the course you want because you can't just go learning all once and don't forget Blockchain are built with different mechanisms like Bitcoin, it is using the PoW while some PoS and others. Aside this, are you planning on becoming a Blockchain developer, technical writer on Blockchain or others this are things to be considered (though they are others) in order to get a course that suits you interest. If are planning on sticking with learning about Bitcoin, this forum will be your best guide in case you ever have an issue, more like a term you understand or others during your research. Here are some good resources:Mastering Bitcoin bookLearn me a BitcoinYouTube , This channel teaches about hardware and software relating to bitcoin. Also I see adding the fact that you are Bitcointalk member to your CV would actually increase your stance of getting a job and others.",

You can read a good book like \"Mastering Bitcoin\", and based on your skill set, you can start with as simple as a game that involves bitcoin. I have never heard of anyone acquiring certificates for cryptocurrency courses, I'd stay away from it.",

      "body": "HiI don't know about certifications, but of course there are many sources out there, given the cryptocurrencies deal with many many fundamental topics worth their own course (computer science, cryptography, games theory, economy just to mention the major ones). Laying on those, any cryptocurrency has its peculiarities, and this again open a big landscape. So I guess first you should understand what you want to improve (I suppose you already have a basic knowledge of the tech).That said, my opinionated hint is Foundations of Blockchains by Tim Roughgarden: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEGCF-WLh2RLOHv_xUGLqRts_9JxrckiAno certification, and not all the lectures have been released yet (my educated guess is half of total have been; it's partially funded by IBM grants so I have no worries about its completion) but it's a very high bar course (university level) and free of charge. It deals with computer science side of blockchains, the only resource I have found going very deep on state machine replication flavours, BFT, longest consensus, PoW e PoS anti-sybil leader election strategies, and more. All of that with agnostic style. It's a long term effort, and you won't master a specific cryptocurrency after it, but you'll have powerful knowledge tools to analyze the many promises of this field, and why not, to choose which technology to devote to.my2cQuote from: She shining on October 27, 2023, 09:50:17 PMHello everyone, I plan on improving my CV by adding some cryptocurrency courses .

They give certifications after you finish the course which usually runs in a space of 3-6 months and it's something that can be flexible even when you are tied up with something else. I see you are looking to fill up your spare time but this will come in handy as they touch areas like Blockchain, Cryptography, and others.. check here; https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=blockchain or you can also try  rise in.com",
