I will say yes. There are times I will be with my friends and we can take laptops and phones and gamble together. That makes it an entertainment for me.There are times that I may be alone and I have nothing doing, I can gamble with little amount of money that time. I am always busy and I only have little time for this which is during weekend.Quote from: Outhue on September 18, 2023, 08:01:41 AMWe can see what the world is becoming now, things are getting harder and what's on peoples mind is how to make even more money, there is no time, there are too many responsibilities,  are you sure you getting entertained? When I was addicted, I remember it was because I was looking for a way to be earning weekly income, I tried gambling and it affected me negatively until I realized that I was stupid for thinking like that. Gambling can not be a source of income. When I started to work, all I was thinking is to use 5% or less to gamble. There are many people that are contented with what they have but people can not be the same.Quote from: Outhue on September 18, 2023, 08:01:41 AMSome people already feel like they are not having fun, because what they have in mind is making money, to all people that feels this way, If you feel like you aren't having fun I believe for the greater good, it's better to take a break from gambling and do something else.

Online gambling, like any form of entertainment, should primarily be about enjoyment. When the line between entertainment and financial desperation blurs, it can lead to unhealthy behaviors and addiction.It's true that the world is challenging and many are seeking alternative ways to make ends meet, but gambling shouldn't be seen as a reliable income source. The moment the primary motivation shifts from entertainment to solely making money, the essence of responsible gambling is lost. Those feeling overwhelmed or not deriving joy from it anymore should indeed consider taking a break, reflecting, and perhaps seeking other forms of entertainment or relaxation.I agree that a healthy relationship with any form of entertainment involves balance, self-awareness, and boundaries. It's essential for individuals to check in with themselves regularly to ensure they're engaging in these activities for the right reasons. Your post serves as a valuable reminder of the importance of self-reflection and moderation.",

It's crucial to emphasize that responsible gambling practices should be promoted and followed regardless of one's social class. Problem gambling can affect individuals from all walks of life, and it's essential to approach gambling with caution, seek help when needed, and be aware of the potential consequences. Education and support for responsible gambling can benefit everyone, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts associated with gambling.However, i don't think it's not only about social status that is the source of fun experience. For me it is the experience of winning. Who else enjoyed losing eh? So once you start losing over and over, you're getting angry, then you lose interest. That's for me when I slowly lose some fun.",

In fact, those who are somehow gambling beyond their means, with income, or even somehow using gambling as a form of income...they are all in for a shock. If you are exceeding 10% of your available crypto/cash each time you gamble, I can tell you that you are gambling not just with your money, but your future.

The adrenaline rush of wanting to get Max Win is of course the next goal to get back the money that has been spent. Having fun is probably only 30%, the rest is for making more money.The more money you spend while gambling, the greater your desire to get more money than you have spent. When the activity you do is only to earn some money, then the desire to have fun will become secondary.",

Unfortunately, I rarely get big wins and can only win a small amount of money, perhaps more often than not just breaking even. But that's enough for me because I'm not after winning and just want to enjoy my time gambling.If they only think about winning from gambling, they may not get a win but a loss. They can also experience gambling addiction because they only think about gambling instead of seeking pleasure from gambling. So it depends on each person's point of view how they treat gambling.",

I know the feeling when even when I’m resting I can’t stop thinking about making money (in my country this is the norm haha), but if I’m relaxing and doing something interesting to me, then I’m relaxing. If an activity no longer brings me pleasure and relaxation, then I simply stop doing it. It’s not about thoughts about making money, but about the fact that you personally are tired of gambling. I think you need to find something else to do to relax. As for those who get involved in gambling in order to make money, this has been written about many times - gambling is not for making money but for entertainment.",

Obviously if we look at gambling it's really nothing but a place to have fun and not at all to make money, but I don't know and I think the potential or opportunity to get a lot of money instantly in gambling has completely made them like blind and not at all think about any risks that are there. I think the reason is as I said above and you also said that the world situation is not good now especially in the economy, I'm sure they want to get a job but now it's very difficult to get it and to start a business there may also be many obstacles. Yes I understand this will only worsen the situation but it only explains the logical cause why more and more people end up gambling. because yes, but the best thing is that you can avoid it because this is not a solution. Yes, it's true, it all comes back to their own mindset, I hope they will understand about how real gambling is especially in the risks, don't let you see this as an opportunity or solution to fix your financial crisis, it will only cause a lot of problems, nothing more than that. So yes that is very true, I say you are a healthy and responsible gambler by only seeing gambling as a place to have fun and limit the budget when gambling on holidays to fill the time, so basically I like this mindset like you.",

Once you win a large sum, it’s as if a person falls into a trap. People are all different, the one who is not subject to excitement will calmly receive his winnings and end the game. But the other one will want to repeat it again and again. It’s difficult for me to talk about the feeling that a person who has lost everything experiences, since I am not a gambler, but I would always like to understand such people at least a little. What takes hold of them is that they can lose everything and remain completely bankrupt. What's next? It’s good if there is a source of income that can be replenished, but if not. What then? Can something like this be called entertainment?",

This is the reason why I changed my strategy in casino games, I am not pursuing small wins anymore and trying to hit that big jackpot which in my experience had already happened like 5 times, and at all those chances I made a withdrawal as fast as I could.",

I can't agree.AFAIK, gambling addicts are having fun while gambling. I have never seen a gambling addict, who looks and feels miserable, while he gambles.Gambling is always fun, it doesn't matter if you are a moderate gambler or a hardcore addict. The problem is how do you control your gambling behavior and do you have any control whatsoever. Drug addiction is also fun, but the drug addicts don't realize that their life and their health condition is slowly turning into ruins.",

The fun of gambling will disappear when you don't see it as a fun activity, when you start to see it as a way to make money you will hate the bad side of it. When you take gambling for the entertainment purpose, trust me you will find a way to quickly forget any bad encounter that you face. For instance, you earn $1000 a week as an average salary and then from that amount, you remove $50 from it to gamble for that week and you lose, some people may feel it depending on how heavy your bills are but how do you think it's going to feel if you use $500 from the weekly wages to bet, you will definitely feel the pain. In essence, gamble with what you can afford to lose, that is the only way you can see gambling being fun.As for hardship, I think it would be absurd to think that gambling is an opportunity to make passive income to feed and pay bills. It is not a place to make money daily, anyone who depends on it to increase their income will end up disappointed at the end of the day. Look for a normal job to uplift your bills and treat gambling as it should.",
