It's an expansion and it's pretty easy to guess the reason. It's convenience over everything else when it come to satisfying mainstream users and Visa understands this perfectly. Ethereum's higher gas fee and slower confirmation time compared to Solana will be a problem to some so it's a good decision from a business perspective.",

      "body": "That’s somehow interesting news to the ears. I never thought VISA would partner with existing chains to run their projects. I find it somehow ambiguous as to why they can’t have their own on chain projects to speed up the transactions. As far as data is considered VISA and MasterCard are the foremost players when it comes to instant payment settlement. Both of them are competing so it could be prime reason for VISA to make such bold move. If they get backed up with Solana then definitely that crypto coin is going to see its golden days really soon. This news does need more digging and valid docs to study further. Great share mate.",

This news looks more like something like a new partnership between Ripple and some bank. I mean, it's just hype.There are already services that allows cashing out crypto using visa networks in ATM. And as USDC and crypto coins are settled on their live price compared to USD, the users would be responsible to any loss due to volatility and accepting parties are going to deal with fiat as user pays with crypto at current price+fees+commission. Yes, it would have been pleasant if we could entirely deal with crypto but till than what VISA could offer would be helpful. And VISA always have been a fiat centered service, for them to accept crypto transaction for it's partners and now by themselves is a bold move from their side.",

They usually react significant news pretty explosively. But good for SOL i guess. I don't have anything against them, but i do wonder if visa's crypto guy knows what he is doing. Is SOL really the one that is a synonym with reliability in crypto? I wouldn't count on it, but then again i am not a coder.I might even buy some SOL. I am having a good feeling about it. It most likely means it's going to crash, so you are welcome.",

For a project like solana that has plenty of centralization risks and scalability issues from time to time, they should've gone with alternatives.

That is not surprising because many experts have noticed that the time will come when bank companies will adopt it.However, this is still a point for us crypto enthusiasts in this industry. Then this Solana can be said to be a potential altcoin that can also provide good profit in the future; the development plan of Solana is also good, and it is one of the good cryptos to hold in the long term as well.",

Visa is so popular so it already had taken off but they can greatly benefit more if they support crypto payments.
