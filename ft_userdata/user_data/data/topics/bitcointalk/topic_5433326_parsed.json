Jokes apart, I believe many things will be cleared about the PA on the next CPI data and FOMC meeting. Lets watch out how ot develops, step by step!This needs to get moved to speculation board.",

In my experience, it's very rare to find a successful person who chooses to make a profit in a short period of time even though buying and selling is not my main job.Buying when the price is declining is of course a good thing and choosing to hold on in the long run is much better to save from losses because we have already seen how the market conditions and situations over the past year.Please consider the advice below.Quote from: Hispo on January 07, 2023, 03:53:43 AMI believe your thread would suit better on the speculation board, honestly.",

This will be a good year hopefully we'll beat the inflation as just this week alone the price went up. Though there are still bad news coming up like exchanges warning users to withdraw coins and people saying they are insolvent.

I think you should stop and change your strategy so that you can make a profit instead of continuing to lose. If you switch to holding instead of trading for the time being, holding will give you the opportunity to recover your trading losses. I'm not saying you should give up trading but wait until the market is better, then come back and for now focus on holding that will be good for you.",

Did you started your journey on 2020 or 2021? Because if that is the case then this explains why you think 2022 was such a bad year.Now do not get me wrong 2022 was in fact a bad year for almost everyone, but the same could be said for 2018 and any other year in which the bear market was the dominant force, and if you are facing losses to the point of being destitute then you made a huge mistake, since during a bear market your goal should be to protect your capital or at best to increase your holdings, if you have any, but other than that making money is incredibly hard, something it seems you have discovered on your own.",

For starters you seem to be missing the point that with trading you can make money when the market goes down as well. So it doesn't matter if the market will go up again or when it will reach $60k, because if you really knew how to trade, which I doubt, you could make money too.",

The only way to determine it is when it happened already which means you need to try a position for yourself when Bitcoin price side ways or show a bullish signal pattern. This is what many traders doing for a long time and just using a stop loss as safety precautions once there analysis fail.Just hold Bitcoin and you are good to go. You will save yourself on stress for overthinking on what’s gonna happened in the price since Bitcoin will always recover and pumps in the future. A loss on spot trading is just a paper loss.

But for a trader, bear market, or bull market, I think both can make a profit, and it depends on your trading skills. So you can't blame the bear market when you lose. I don't know if you are new or experienced in the market, but you need to review your trading skills rather than blame bitcoin.As for the question, can bitcoin hit $60k again? my answer is yes, bitcoin could hit $60k and possibly $100k, but no one can tell when that will happen.",
