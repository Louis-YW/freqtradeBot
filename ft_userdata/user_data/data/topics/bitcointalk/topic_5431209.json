Apparently we are hoping for the same thing, we are hoping that the market condition should be better than it was in 2022 and I do wish it comes to pass. Because so many businesses that are involved in cryptocurrency are stuck and they can't sell their holding because if they do they're are going to sell at a loss. But I do believe that we are going to see a brighter day come 2023.",

Wow. Of course i know that we are in a heavy bear market because obviously there was no way to miss that but looking at those raw numbers now just makes clear again how much wealth was lost in those last 12 months in the crypto market. I mean even BTC lost more than 60% of it's value. Those are just massive values. If such price swings would have happened in the traditional stock market, then we would already have another world financial crisis in the same extent as the one from the 1920's i think. Monero was holding up quite ok at the first glance but the reason for this is, that monero did not pump as much during the last bull run as the other projects.",

Including me, I have been expecting this crash since 2021, after I sold most of my crypto assets. Bitcoin has always been like that, after creating ATH then a serious drop will happen, and that's when we start accumulating from the beginning. Investing means we buy low and sell high, and down season is when we buy instead of panic. Not only that, I also hope that this bear season will last longer because then more investors will panic, and they will have to sell their assets at the lowest price, and that would be a better chance.",

Hope next year will be better. If you'd break down each month, you'd definitely see more which would show how volatile the market is  From reaching its highest market price to deep market prices at the present. The market prices increased in a short period of time as well as with its downfall and we just cannot avoid such thing especially if the market price of something, perhaps cryptocurrency in this case, is solely dependent with the market demand. Many things could affect the interest of investors which would reflect to the market value. Given how many things happened in this industry for this year, it somehow answers why in a sudden the market prices are struggling at a certain point and no signs of recovery still, is obvious.",

I know Monero never does huge leap in bull market but anyways it can prove that it has certain value/ or certain benefit attached to it. I personally loved privacy coins back in 2017-2018 era, many of them quickly gained transaction but nowadays they are rather unpopular.By the way it looks terrible for Solana. Its so strange to see that coin dying. I hope it can survive, it may badly affect crypto markets. Sad!",
