After leaving gambling for over a year during the time, the only way I am making money is through my job. I put less than 5% weekly income on gambling and I have fun with it. This time, I do not think I am experiencing anything like threshold, if I lose during weekend that I only gamble, I play no more, if I win, I have another money to drink bear.",

For me the threshold is the money I have deposited in my casino account. I have a rule of never adding to the balance during a session. If I lose it all it means the and for that day, maybe for longer, depending on how long it was since the last time I sent money to a casino. Sometimes I played on a casino account with the money they gave me for free or money I got from a signature campaign. If that went to 0 I'd stop until the next paycheck.",

To me that is very simple, I have a monthly budget to gamble and while it is not huge or anything I make small bets to allow me to last a few gambling sessions during that month, if I happen to lose that money early then I am not going to deposit any extra amount to the casino and I am just going to spend the rest of the month without gambling more money at all, however I think that study most likely only takes into account the average gambler as an addicted will probably not stop gambling until they have spend every single dollar they have to their name.",

Both are true, we're happy with small wins and that makes us content and want to gamble again sometime. And when we lose, it's the temporary halt that we have to make but after moving on, we'll gamble again from that loss.",

This is just based my experience.Easy to think about this one, but is hard while you gambling.It's really hard to resist especially when you have all the means to bet again and the only time you manage to think it was a huge mistake is when you don't anything in your pocket anymore. That's why people always try to say stop when you think you are losing too much but in reality, the word \"stop\" won't show until you drain your money from betting too much. I appreciate those people who know exactly what to do when they feel they aren't winning the game at all and they just left it like that not chasing it anymore and moved on with their life.",

I don't gamble much by nature, just a few times as I have often said here, I don't fancy loosing money so I assume that my threshold of loss is really very small/slim, because after loosing any money any day I decide to gamble, I do not want to continue, it hurts so much, guess I'm among the persons who have a strict loss threshold. I think it is possible to say that some people may react differently when they make losses in gambling and hit their threshold. While some like me may withdraw from gambling for a while till the pain of loosing fades away, some may see the loss as a motivation to want to try again and maybe this time win the casino. In trying they may be loosing more, but the thought of trying to win keeps them going and unknowingly they continue to expand/increase their threshold of loss till it puts them in problems.Gamblers must understand the need to maintain their threshold of loss and not expand it so it doesn't cause them issues.",

I think most of the times I can hit itas long as it's predetermined before you are gambling. It should have been planned in the first place on what threshold you can manage your loss, it shouldn't be just popping out of nowhere, my answer is that it's being planned or you should know how much you can gamble for a day - win or loss.",

I usually limit my losses to 10% of my total savings in my crypto wallet. This is the maximum amount I can afford to lose and reaching will be a major upset to me that makes stop gambling for a certain period of time. I don’t know if everyone does this but I guess most of the gambler play without a threshold and only stop when there balance is emptied.That's still a lot. I don't think I would be able to sleep at night if I ever lost 10% of my bitcoins. That would be years of saving up down the drain. I usually don't gamble with more than $100 at a time. I'm a casual gambler and I can spare a hundred here and there from time to time, but that's all. I don't lose a lot and I don't win a lot. For me it's just a way to have some fun and feel the thrill.",

For me, I have no threshold, in fact, the idea of having a set threshold have never occurred to me, what I know is that I just set out some certain amount of money I know I am ready to throw away and decide to gamble with it, I naturally don't gamble frequently, so the idea of having a set threshold doesn't really apply for my kind of gamblers, there are some periods that it takes me about a month to gamble away $100 which is most times even lesser than that, I have won on several occasions, and that period I won are usually the period I gamble the most because I always end up with this feeling that I could win more, and the fact that am I now gambling with the money I won and not extra money from my pocket gives me peace of min, i can gamble away any amount of money in a day anytime i decide to gamble, i have no set threshold, the amount i wager away mostly depends on how i feel about what am gambling on.",

Threshold would be usually on the time that you dont have already money or funds and it would be depending on someone whether they would go into some extent or would completelystop if they do saw that they are losing that much? This is actually depending on self preference since not all could able to tolerate their gambling interest whether they can afford to lose even morebeyond their limit or it is just they are really that impulsive on where they cant really just stop as long they do have the funds for them to play.?I cant afford on losing beyond my border line.When i said enough then it would be enough and dont tend to play even more and this should how people do play with gamblingwhere setting out limits so that you wont really be facing some problems later on.",

The budget allocated for gambling can be of different sizes, so in each case the loss threshold is different. The only question is the discipline that allows us to stop in time, but if we are discussing the situation when the player himself ceases to want to play after a series of defeats, then I don’t know how to determine this threshold for me personally.
