The implosion is, in turn, consistent with the submersible not being certified to operate at such extreme depths (such certification being deemed \"unnecessary\" due to her status as an experimental vessel) as well as poorly covered-up engineering reports that she could only withstand a maximum depth of 1,300 meters (versus the 3,800 meters she was expected to descend to).Let this be a grim reminder that seaworthiness certification is not merely annoying red tape to be avoided by declaring your vessel to be \"experimental\"; safety regulations are written in blood.",

Deep ocean diving shouldn't be taken lightly and given that they were using a cheap game controller for the sub, and rejected a pro military experienced personel because they weren't inspirational enough.

It is impossible to overstate exactly how catastrophic this \"catastrophic implosion\" actually was. The pressure at that depth is 2.5 tonnes per square inch. A human body instantaneously subjected to such pressure is, frankly, not going to look like much (of anything) afterwards.

These billionaires practiced a hobby of their own choosing and with their money, and they did not force anyone to follow them. From a moral point of view, no one can blame them just because he sees that hobby as trivial, or that there is something more important than it, according to his point of view. And if governments were organizing those dangerous journeys, perhaps they should be prosecuted.Secondly, about paying attention to the causes of the death of that adventurous team. I think it is necessary to do so for two main reasons: The first reason is criminal in order to prove that the accident was not premeditated, which is what research must prove. The second reason is scientific because it is important to study the reasons that led to the submarine explosion and to avoid mistakes later.",
