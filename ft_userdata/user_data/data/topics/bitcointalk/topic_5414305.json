Im sure that some of these projects have very big potential to be as big as major crypto in the next bullrun. You can check it here https://icodrops.com/There are so many projects that have been successfully to raise the money for their development purpose. Those projects are still in the early stage of development. You can pick some from all of them. They have potential to be listed in major exchange site in the future",

You'd rather prefer them than the new project that possibly could just be a scam one day. The early stage of the project may be attractive but there's no assurance of its success. We are in bear market, there are plenty of them with cheaper prices than what its prices back in the peak of 2021.",

I'm more of thinking this discussion is good for sharing the bad projects instead.Generally, almost all projects are promising and their respective roadmaps should look interesting. Of course, that's what a project should look like. However, we don't know if they will keep their promises and maintain the development on their roadmaps. If others will share their list of promising projects here, it might lead newbies to just follow them without any precautions.Why risks for new projects? There are lots of coins out there that are worth to risk.",

They don't have enough experience to know new projects mean more risk and risk of loss, risk of scam, risk of rug pull.They can luckily to win with one or two new projects but because they are inexperienced and obsessed with hunting for new projects, they will lose money quickly later.My advice is trying to find good entries in market corrections with old projects with good trading volume. It is safer and almost no risk of rug pull. Still have risk of loss as it is part of investment.",

The top projects are heavily discounted but there is no absolute guarantee that they will continue to survive when bear season rolls around, as we also saw the top coins of 2018 mostly replaced in new altcoins in 2021, the battle of altcoins is extremely harsh. For example, XRP since hitting an ATH of $3 in 2018 has never been able to return to that price since.Investing in altcoins always involves unpredictable risks, so wherever you invest, you should take into account the risks you face.",

BTCMaybe you can look in the Announcements (Altcoins) section to find the project you want because I don't really care much about early projects just launched. Usually, after one successful trend, many other projects have almost the same resemblance to the successful project so they will say that the project is the next project to succeed in the market.So I guess you better look it up from that section to know which projects have good potential in the future. I prefer old projects like bitcoin, which are viable and can rise higher than the previous ATH, rather than investing long term in new projects. But that's up to you.",
