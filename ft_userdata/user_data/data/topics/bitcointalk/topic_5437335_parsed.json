Ukrainian people switched en masse to cryptocurrencies. Some other digital services were moved to different blockchains or smart contracts on various platforms. To my knowledge it was Russian and Belarus cards in Ukraine that were blocked, because why Ukrainian people block their own payment cards?Also tell us what digital services were moved to smart contracts, and even several blockchains? That sounds improbable and i have heard none of this.So in this age of misinformation can you please give us some legit sources with that please?",

That's why people in Africa try to adopt crypto ASAP.I don't know about the news that Ukrainians switched to crypto after the war, but what is happening in Africa, especially Nigeria. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are trending here, and it helps many people as their Naira currency is depreciating more and more due to government mismanagement. Bitcoin is not a paradise but it is the best solution right now for those who are struggling there. I am not from Nigeria, but my life has also improved a lot from bitcoin, it can be said that my economy is stable thanks to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.",
