This will help people know some useful terms when they hear it and moreover one can make him or herself familiar with it early enough to not be taken unawares when such is mentioned to their hearing. Terminology matters in every field of life so getting acquainted with it would help ease some stress of communication and make one fast in adapting to the system in which they find themselves. You have done well OP and I will suggest you keep updating the list as time goes on because I believe there are more that are not yet on the list.",

I completely agree with you! I think that when poker is played in person, it is less of a game of luck and more of a game of trying to spot the bluffer. This is easier because you can tell by emotions and facial features or even the tone of voice. But online poker is quite different, there is no face to look at and nobody except perhaps a username to judge. The online version is basically a game of pure luck, I would therefore say.One of the reasons why I do not like to play online poker, really...But there are live webcam versions, I think. Not that I have seen many of those, though.",

Perhaps, it is because those are used more frequently in the English speaking parts of the world, while here in South America it is easier to come up with our own things when comes to playing cards. The game of Truco is a very good example of it.Anyways, thanks to OP for taking the initiative.",

I would say that \"tilt\" is when we lose control completely. It happens after making a few or more bad decisions. When we keep losing hand after hand and when nothing is working... So we start making irrational moves due to that frustration and anger, going all ins on any game at any odds. I had some good recoveries after \"tilting\", but many more times I suffered more significant losses... So \"tilting\" is really bad, when we let our bad emotions take full control most of the time it ends up badly!",

I believe Insurance and Double down are terms used for Blackjack and not on Poker since there’s no insurance feature available on poker while raise is the normal term use when increasing the bet instead of double which is just x2 of the base bet on Blackjack. Rakeback is the most used terms in crypto but I think everybody here is already familiar on it since every casino provides it’s definition for their bonus program.The OP terminology is more on the specifics of Poker which non poker player will not understand since most of them is just the name for the cards and bets terminology.",
