  "content": "Bitcoin has never been featured in a Google doodle. If you believe that Bitcoin deserves recognition on its 15th anniversary (January 3rd), please consider sending an email to doodleproposals@google.comHere is some information from Google:Quote from: https://www.google.com/doodles/aboutWho chooses what doodles will be created and how do you decide which events will receive doodles?A group of Googlers get together regularly to brainstorm and decide which events will be celebrated with a doodle. The ideas for the doodles come from numerous sources including Googlers and Google users. The doodle selection process aims to celebrate interesting events and anniversaries that reflect Google's personality and love for innovation.How can Google users/the public submit ideas for doodles?The doodle team is always excited to hear ideas from users - they can email doodleproposals@google.com with ideas for the next Google doodle. The team receives hundreds of requests every day so we unfortunately can't respond to everyone. But rest assured that we're reading themI believe Google maintains a neutral stance on Bitcoin, which is appropriate. Maybe they just need more people asking for a doodle.Additionally, Google showcased a countdown for Ethereum's The Merge last year:Quote from: sabotag3x on September 15, 2022, 01:10:44 PMIf you believe Bitcoin deserves a doodle, please email Google using your own words.Perhaps if Google receives thousands of emails about it, they may consider the suggestion.",

I am afraid that they did that for ETH, because they support the idea of PoS, and the narrative against PoW might bring some heated views. Brand PR doesn't mix well with heated views especially when it comes to climate change and energy consumption, so Google might want to distance their brand from that payload.Even though one could make an argument about energy consumption of google and google related services, but it wouldn't help the cause to call them out on any hypocrisy.But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to explain why it deserves it. Focusing on the idea freedom, use cases like donations without borders, and green energy used for it could be good angles.",

The halving event will take place some time in April. OP mentioned the date which is the 3rd of January. So that's the date Bitcoin was launched in 2009. I might also help this cause and send a suggestion to Google about the doodle on its birthday. But I'm not expecting much. I agree with OP that Google seems to adopt a neutral stance regarding Bitcoin. They probably think it's safer for them that way. Regardless, there's no harm in trying.",

I am afraid that they did that for ETH, because they support the idea of PoS, and the narrative against PoW might bring some heated views. They must be enlightened that Bitcoin with its algorithm Proof of Work uses good percent of sustainable electricity up to 59.9% according to H1 2023 report from Bitcoin Mining Council that accounts for 43.4% of global Bitcoin mining network.I am afraid that Google chose to did a wrong thing. They support Proof of Stake, ETH and even Ethereum is a second biggest cryptocurrency, Proof of Stake is an algorithm for very centralized network and we can not exclude scam trend in the past with Proof of Stake, Masternodes.Bitcoin is better than Ethereum, it's decentralized, non censorship and Proof of Work network is not very harmful for environment like many attacks on Bitcoin wanted to say so.https://bitcoincleanup.com/https://endthefud.org/energy",

      "body": "I agree that Bitcoin deserves some form of recognition from Google via its doodle act. However, I also agree that maybe Google or rather the people behind it may have an issue with it as PoW rather than PoS. While it is already debunked that Bitcoin is so bad for the environment, this is something that maybe hard to go against with. Anyway, Google is not a factor for the continuing growth of Bitcoin so in my opinion it does not matter at all.",

Remember, these are people connected to technology, they know Bitcoin well.It is true that the PoW factor can be demotivating to create a doodle. But, if some who are miners are careful to report how they have made efforts to use green energy, it can give a different perspective.It’s about gathering ideas and sending an email. At the very least, they will read the word BITCOIN many times, even if they don't make any doodles.",

It's a technology based company and am certain they have digested Satoshi's white paper to be able to support the idea of Crypto currency in the first place. Marking btc's15th aniversary is a show of testimonial of success in the implementation of the idea it stands for. Google has done well to be true to its vision too. It's no wonder why the stretch out of arm coming from Google is more welcomed than one would have presumed.",

But if it's also allowed to send them an email and then suggest that they should do a google doodle showcasing Bitcoin, that's what everyone has to look at and unite in informing them that we have the same request. If they have done that already with Ethereum, then possibly that we also get to see that with Bitcoin and how they're going to show their artistic side with Bitcoin. That will be cool if one time we get to see that or as soon as next year.",
