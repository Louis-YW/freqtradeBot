A Duke University professor recently called for $14 trillion in reparations for the descendants of American slavery (roughly $350,000 per recipient).The professor, William Darity, isn't the only one calling for reparations. The mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu, has established a task force that will explore compensation for black citizens. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has signaled his support for the idea. Detroit’s Reparations Task Force is currently exploring forms of compensation for the city’s black residents. Similar events are taking place in St. Louis. In early May, California’s reparations task force approved recommendations that could see some black residents receive $1.2 million each as compensation for slavery and racial discrimination.Reparations are a terrible idea. Calls for race-based compensation appeal to emotion, not logic. First, how do we define slavery? Contrary to popular belief, African Americans weren’t the only victims of slavery. As Stephan Talty, an author who has researched slavery in great detail, has noted, white people were also the victims of slavery.In a piece for Salon, a hyper-progressive online magazine, Talty discussed the fact that, contrary to popular belief, white slavery did occur prior to the occurrence of the Civil War. Talty referenced the work of Joel Augustus Rogers, a historian who meticulously documented the many ways in which whites were kidnapped and sold into slavery. These kidnappings occurred from the early 1700s right up until 1861, the year the Civil War started. Some of the victims were orphans or unwanted babies, while others were impoverished immigrants. White slavery occurred in America. This is an inconvenient truth that receives little or no attention, probably because it contradicts the \"white privilege\" narrative that continues to do the rounds.Even if we were to agree on a definition of slavery, how are we supposed to verify those that claim to be victims? Then, of course, there's the matter of financing reparations. Where will the money come from?For comment on the matter, I reached out to David W. Rasmussen, the director of the Policy Sciences Center at Florida State University. Rasmussen recently published a paper discussing reparations for black citizens, and why such a system of redress for past injustices deserves criticism.Rasmussen told me that although it’s easy to make the case that black citizens are owed reparations—the right to own slaves is embedded in the Constitution, after all—this doesn’t mean that the case being made has any real substance. The idea of reparations, noted Rasmussen, fails for many reasons....",

Not every African American is a descendant from a slave.If you went back far enough, you could find some systematic oppression that created inequity in everyone. How far should we go back? And how much do we owe everyone?",

Where you have your wife been taken before your eyes...It's just not worth saying but, don't try to bring it into context for any comparison, it just doesn't feel any appealing.Certainly crimes are always being done. These kinds of crimes are still being done between some influential employers and their employees. The wrong part is to redo the crimes against and between races... even the race of employers vs. the race of employees. The question is how to deal with each crime on an individual basis, so that criminality is not done to the innocent.Quote from: Kavelj22 on May 20, 2023, 11:53:37 PMQuote from: BADecker on May 20, 2023, 10:33:03 PMYou can only help people of non-white races so much.

The point of the article - though it is hidden somewhat - is that of racism in different directions. Slavery doesn't have anything to do with racism. Slavery is simply between the master and the slave, no matter the race of either. Reparations as they are generally touted, have to do with, and are, racist.In the big picture, reparations are simply a way for somebody to make money by inciting the races against each other, and then profiting off the insurrection that follows.Quote from: yhiaali3 on May 21, 2023, 02:57:33 AMQuote from: BADecker on May 20, 2023, 10:33:03 PMRasmussen told me that although it’s easy to make the case that black citizens are owed reparations—the right to own slaves is embedded in the Constitution, after all—this doesn’t mean that the case being made has any real substance.

Or is he talking about the old constitution when it was legal to own slaves in the United States? please explain.Slavery is Constitutional in at leas two ways:1. The mindset of the people who were behind the Constitution that they wrote, was a mindset of allowed slavery. This means that all their Constitutional writings were written with allowed slavery in mind, as well as a whole lot of other things... including correctly done freedom for a slave.The 14th Amendment takes freed slaves and turns them into a thing called citizens. What are citizens? They are slaves of the government that they are citizens of. Before the 14th Amendment, the US government essentially had no man/woman citizens.2. Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 in the Constitution, is known as the Contract Clause, the right to contract. If a man/woman, having complete understanding of what they are doing, contract themselves into slavery to another, there is nothing that can prevent this, legally and lawfully. The courts have adjudicated that people are free to enter into contracts, and that government doesn't have any authority over this freedom - https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-10/clause-1/contract-clause. In fact, all contracts bind their makers into slavery in a fashion, by limiting their freedom in some ways.In fact, the only reason why people are required to pay IRS taxes is because they have contracted themselves into doing so... although few people understand this, or how to contract out. The IRS Form W-4 is a quasi-contract that binds a person into a form of slavery to the IRS.",

You are trying to get reparations from people who didn't have anything to do with harming you, Africans, or your/their ancestors.Find someone who is a slave, or find someone who has ancestors who were slaves, and then find the people who made them slaves.  Then go after those slave traders for reparations.If a thief steals something from me, who do I go after to get it back? I go after the thief... not after a nation of people who had nothing to do with what the thief did, and couldn't have stopped the thief if they even knew what was going on.The life of blacks in America became better just by being in America. How do we know? There aren't many who want to go back. So, stop being so racist against whites who helped Africans out by making their life better, even if they were slaves.All you want to do with your racism against whites is to steal from other people. You don't care who they are, really. They could be green Martians, and you would go after them if you thought you could get away with stealing something from them.",
