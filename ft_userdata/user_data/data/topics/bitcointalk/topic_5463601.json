  "content": "I am so confused after reading an About us text from the official website of Blockchain.comAs per their claim they stand out to be one of the first to build a blockchain explorer in the year 2011 and I wonder that is how they got hold of the Premium website domain name with Blockchain in it. If as per the Blockchain.com they were the first to build then what was before 2011 and after 2009?Did we just transacted before that with peer to peer approach and waited for the Bitcoin to appear in our wallets? QuoteBlockchain.com got its start as an early pioneer of key infrastructure for the bitcoin community. First, with a Blockchain Explorer that enabled anyone to not only examine transactions and study the blockchain, but an API that enabled companies to build on Bitcoin. We also have provided the most popular and widely used crypto wallet that enables anyone anywhere to control their own money.I tried to search over the internet with key words \"worlds oldest blockchain explorer\"\"first blockchain explorer\"\"blockchain explorer beginning\"but all of them are just pointing me towards how blockchain started in the old days. All of them are referring me to how it started with Merkle who coined the whole concept as early as in 1979 through his \"tree authentication\" in his 1979 Ph.D. thesis for Stanford University.After searching more there is evidence of Blockchain getting mentioned in the New York Times news paper published in the year 1995. But that was just regarding the talks about how we can cryptographically seal the digital documents. A cool pic to look at from the old era:",

Because if the Blockchain explorer of theymos is the first one then that thread is also made in 2010 and BTC was originated in 2009. Well, if that's true then how it is possible for people to trust on BTC at start and even in the early days there was a IP option available too to send and receive the funds.Thanks for pointing out this new set of information for me, because if you had not asked this question then ranochigo might not have answered it. Well, it indicated every project even BTC took one year to make huge developments. I know taproot, Lightening network and now this ordinal things are also huge developments and God knows what types of developments are we going to see in upcoming years. But point is, Good things do take some time and i really appreciate those who have held BTC for that long period because if i were at that time found no explorer then i would not trust the system.",

The full fledge explorer was built by blockchain only (it seems like that). But obviously High respect to @theymos for building it. @Faissal2202 I am also surprised to see the answer and know more historical aspect of explorer. I thought when Merkel designed the blockchain very first we were able to see the data over public ledger. However, it seems that was different interface as compared to what we experience today. I think people are more keen on having confirmations through the explorers now. Initially it seems very smooth. It was actual privacy by the way.",

Good programmers could dig up more info about transactions directly from a local copy of the blockchain data. They did this using command-line tools, and often had to run specific commands to make the data readable.This is essentially how theymos came up with the idea of making data easily viewable to the public, leading to the creation of the first blockchain explorer.Quote from: theymos on November 10, 2010, 02:33:29 AMI created a site that lets you view detailed information about Bitcoin blocks, addresses, and transactions.http://theymos.ath.cx:64150/bbe/This data is all gotten from the block chain. It has always been possible to get this data, but you had to patch Bitcoin with getblock or use the clunky -printblock switch in Bitcoin, and then you had to search through miles of data to get what you wanted.

So basically it is true that no one would have ever imagined that they need a block explorer to work with the transactions. It is just some \"other\" enthusiasts who entered the market and made it one sort of business. They first got it launched as explorer, then slowly launched the wallets in the same official name and thus it was clearly business point of view. I think then they also brought the exchangers and now rest is history with trillions of dollars already transacted through various wallets until now (maybe more).Quote from: lassdas on August 17, 2023, 09:26:44 PMQuote from: Faisal2202 on August 17, 2023, 05:15:50 PM(...)

Makes complete sense. I think initially only the highly technical people who understood what bitcoin is must have entered the realm of blockchain. Its like they knew very well what they are getting at and what is needed to \"run\" the process. Also makes sense why many people did not even bother to claim the faucets when they were distributing more than 5-10 bitcoins per claim. None of them were wrong, it's just that the knowledge, the future clarification, actual usage nothing was clear back then. I believe, explorer, exchangers, wallets increased over the time and then it was \"ready made\" tool for common/ non technical person and that's why the boom of Bitcoin.",

Yeah, I can not agree more because I will not take anyone else's example here but of mine. If I found no Explorer at that time it would become so hard for me to trust the system. But those who trusted and worked consistently are teaching us a lesson, a lesson for new projects, and new innovations, that we should not give up.

We're talking about times when anyone could get 5 btc from the faucet and many didn't even bother to claim that.Yeah, I can understand, in fact, the thing is, that opportunity of getting free BTC has triggered people to not give up on any new token since then which provides free mining and earning them free. (I know we are BTC enthusiasts who do not talk about shit coins but we cannot also ignore them too at least I can use them in my examples). The trauma of missing that opportunity out had hit everyone so hard that they just do not want to miss any other chance and I can see the smartphones of my friends, family members (talking about my father), and other connections downloaded almost every app related to mining. I mean really that's some scene of watching with popcorn. Once I joined a Zoom meeting (the link was shared by a class fellow who asked me to join it because they are teaching us to make money) and the funny thing is, the representative of the meeting was selling his coin and saying that we have lost the opportunity to grab the BTC but you guys have another opportunity like that buy our token blah blah blah). And I was laughing but I tries to tell my CF that this is a scam and I will lose her money but she did not listen to me and in the end, she lost around $150. Quote from: lassdas on August 17, 2023, 09:26:44 PMWhy would we need a blockexplorer to trust in BTC?And why should we trust the blockexplorer (instead of BTC?)? ...............I can understand your concerns you must be one of the very early adopters of BTC that's why you are an enthusiast about BTC because in today world I do trust BTC and its decentralization but I meant to say, live data is bit relaxing for everyone because it gives them some time to wait just like this newbie who just entered crypto sphere and worried about his trade in BTC. He is totally depend on BE. Quote from: gligoresti on August 18, 2023, 03:24:06 PMPlease help me to understand what happened with a bct transaction I made from one cold wallet address to another. In short: I transferred the correct amount in the receiving address and when I check the status, it appears another transaction with a similar but smaller amount to a total unknown btc address. This unknown transaction appears on top of my correct transaction. The transaction(s) is pending since one hour and in the explorer it shows that the transaction will be completed in 12 hours.Are you suggesting to creat a full wallet node instead of using SPV wallets? Because if Blockchain Explorer is not trusted then things will get confusing for everyone. Because it just displays the data of blockchain even the validators and miners are increased so much since the inception of BTC so we should trust the BE.I do understand that everyone was running a full node but what I do not understand here is how that provides one information and history of transactional data in live time. Just like the BE do. Because AFAIK, the addition of new transactional data when occurred then that data is also upgraded in all the blockchains (means who have run a full node). But what happened in between that time who knows that live status's information?",

I think back then it was not even private because you could literally point out the person who made that transaction considering the number of transactions. Like in the Block #170 or a few previous other blocks the input and output of mining is around 50 BTC with repeated bitcoin addresses. Let us say back then the whole world was watching these few miners doing their jobs they could easily tag the Bitcoin Addresses with the names and keep track ever after. This anyway did not happen but it was possible back then. In similar ways as they kept the tracking of Satoshi's address, it would be done for the others. However, the reality is, the network has outgrown so much that even with the Block explorer you end up in the giant network of conformations and see thousands of them intertwined due to various destination transactions, output and input both.",
