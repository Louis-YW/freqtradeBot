  "content": "Bitcoin is very famous already and Bitcoin gained so much in value (for example Bitcoin was around 250$ in 2014 and is now (2022) at 40,000$). As a result, many people are rich from Bitcoin now and some are rich enough to cash out a bit (like USA where it’s very common to cash out Bitcoin because Bitcoin is adopted, especially in California). Being and getting rich from Bitcoin is not a self-fulfilling prophecy and people need to work hard for it: HODL In gratitude for it, we can see common patterns. Very likely, Bitcoin will continue to be a formidable store of value like Gold and Bitcoin will deliever a good competition against Gold as a store of value. But what are rich Bitcoin people and aspiring rich Bitcoin people doing else except Bitcoin? Let’s collect some facts! - Owning a large house and a pool- Large glass front in direction of your pool- Watering your large garden extensively- Your garden is always in top style- Living in a mediterranean climate zone (or similar warm areas, like California (or Florida))- If you don’t own a large house and a pool, you are living on a rooftop (including a pool)- Advocating for a free market- Owning an American Flag (‘Murica!) and supporting it- Good dining every week- Lambooo- Your car has a HODL! plate- Owning a separate room for observing Bitcoin (TA)- Owning multiple large screens to observe Bitcoin- Owning or renting a yacht- Posting Memes on WO…Some facts are only applying to rich people and not aspiring people. Surely, my list isn’t complete. You can always add a comment and present more facts. Have fun getting rich! wagmi",

You are right, Bitcoin can be a real game changer for everyone. But to be successful, we can also be normal, private citizens and don't need to be enterpreneurs. Some very early HODLers are private citizens, like Lazlo but he should have kept a few of his Bitcoins, when he purchased his Pizza. It's unfortunate for him but he was an early Bitcoiner.",

Bitcoin allowed them to do so in the first place, and sure enough that's what they will be doing. Some may still be trading because they still want to be closely involved in the space, although of course the end goal is to get more bitcoin in the end and add it to their stack. If I actually got lucky and see myself sitting on a nice pile of bitcoins, perhaps I'd also just hold it for long and just enjoy life, just like what some of these people are doing right now.",

True. Rich people also gamble with their bitcoins because it’s now the trend these days if you are playing in crypto casinos online. So aside from investment, bitcoin too is also profitable when used in gambling. But knowing that bitcoin value will still go far and has the chances to make it to its all time high, then I prefer to hold bitcoin and benefit huge profits in the future.",

If it doesn't happen it will at least retain value and give me more than I'd ever get from a bank. I'm already up at least 20x on my investment even in this bear market.

The US is not very friendly when it comes to taxes on crypto, and some countries in the EU have 0% tax, you can sell crypto even without KYC and buy almost anything you can imagine.Quote from: wagmi on September 04, 2022, 04:50:22 PM- Posting Memes on WO…I didn't know the people who do that in WO are rich, or they aspire to become rich by posting memes on forums.

So, instead of checking the market daily, why not make ourselves busy with other stuff and enjoyed life? For sure there are several ways to earn profit from different kind of investments possible. Not all people are into this \"crypto craze\" kind of investment, especially to those older generations. They would be more into stock market( not to generalize). Also in this industry, there are many ways to diversify your assets such as thru gambling (not really advisable), trading (as you've mentioned), staking, and the likes.The only goal is to earn profit. I even have a friend who functions as an 'exchanger' thru p2p to earn, I think he earns from his 'fees' or additional charges he puts in transactions. Small or huge movement; that won't matter as long as you are happy with what you are doing while earning ofcourse.",
