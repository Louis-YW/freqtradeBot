It saying my btc refunded but I don't see it on my wallet! https://viewblock.io/thorchain/address/bc1qzlcemzvsxl7pd7zswucl3a0ltdjppehelsq65uMy btc: bc1qzlcemzvsxl7pd7zswucl3a0ltdjppehelsq65uIf you get me this solved I give you 500$ tipMove this on services section if you are offering a 500$ tip in Bitcoin for those who will help you. This Bitcoin of yours is not a native Bitcoin anymore but rather WBTC on thorchain which is not real Bitcoin since you already swapped it on thorchain so it’s not fit here on Bitcoin discussion board. Thorchain doesn’t need to wrapped asset to swap but still this discussion is not suitable here since it’s an altcoin project issue.I’m wondering why the status type of your transaction is noted as refund/doubleswap?",
