They are telling the truth that you are not profitable and casino is not in the business to give consistent profit to all players. You can still bet with limited funds meaning they still want you to play on there casino. It’s either you will change your casino or accept that current betting limit. There security tram saw something on your betting pattern that alert them to limit you for now.",

Afaik sportsbooks themselves have a limit of bets for each match, so they may have applied it on each account instead of each match. And it is as you said, they limit it because casinos don't really want to go out of business due to a few bets, especially if it was from someone who has spent a low amount to their site. They're still a business after all.",

This means that an operator could argue that it has a legitimate reason not to accept a sports bet from a patron.Legally defined legitimate reasons include refusing to allow a minor, someone who has self-excluded or an excessive bettor to gamble.If article L. 121-11 is violated, operators can be fined up to €1,500, which could be increased to €3,000 if the violations are repeated.In addition, offenders could receive two years in prison and a fine of €300,000.",
