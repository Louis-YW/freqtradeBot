I did not remember when I was given a paper work to fill when I signed up to be posting here, this community is to share ideas and give our ideas, it doesn't translate to work in a way.The money some are getting from it may be the confusion but it is only because of the traffic value added due to many participations. It is not a job.As you can see even from the image there is not any demonstrated hunter. I don't think the forum will be included in such a celebration, I agree with saying here is the place where we share ideas and educate each other.",

Does that make any sense to appreciate or to wait until we are all made contractual workers and given a paper work form to fill? I don't think so and neither you too!QuoteAnd it encompasses both paid and volunteered workers all over the globe.If you have read understandably to my letters you would have noticed this line quoted above mate.  . But all the same your perspective is noted.",
