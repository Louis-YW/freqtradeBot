If a beginner decides to be lazy and listens to whatever they say, they may fall victim to the \"pump and dump\" scam.And, once again, as a beginner, I recommend that you take your time studying a project before investing in it. No matter how little you want to invest in a project, make sure you do thorough research on the project before proceeding with your investment.They should also be wary of ICOs. Most ICOs that are currently being conducted are simply a method for new scam projects to collect investor funds before disappearing into thin air. I believe that the ICO era is over.And, above all, invest in BITCOIN.",

What is your recommendation for a beginner?For beginner with money maybe trading is a good choice. Also mining is best if his conservative of losses on trades. The only thing is it has some equipment needed and some factor to consider like bills on electricity and prices of those equipment, and the rate on which the mining can be profitable. You can compute that if you are already running a rig.Also ICO investment is good but its not easy to access it unless you have connection to join some seed sale or private sales.",

After learning now it's you choice either to make own Blockchain crypto team or work for any company. If you just want to use cryptocurrency for part time and just use it for trading purpose then my first suggestions is to read the market up and down for a week. start your trading from low amount like 59$-100$. Don't part in any ICO, IDO. Their locking period is too long and very few new projects will perform well. Try to choose Binance or any big exchange for trading purpose.",

If lots of people are trading something one way how are you going to do things differently yourself to do well? If you follow the crowd you might just end up in a crowd.Don't rush with learning though. Influencers might tell you there's a specific time that's good for investing but no one can know and time in the market is only better than timing the market if you're not going to pull your coins out when you're down 70% (which isn't too unlikely).Take your time and get used to things it can only make you improve your outset or decide it's not for you.",

It doesn't make sense if I force you to invest in Bitcoin, but you're think Bitcoin is scam, dead etc, of course you would regret when your speculation doesn't come true.If you're a beginner, it's better to start with investing since it's the lowest risk compared to trading and mining.In trading most people end up losses, while mining you need to have a good understanding about the hardware and maintenance.",

Social media influencer prediction are not to be taking too serious because they are paid to promote a particular coin, which can only results to pump and dump. Before you invest look for project that have solid foundation and things backing them up.. when I was introduced new to crypto I started with blockchain own coins, which are the coins used by the exact blockchain to cover transaction fee, before I decided to buy BTC and store for the future. Another advice I will give to you is, if you are to use centralized exchange in buying any coin of your choice. After successful purchase always move out your coin/token to a wallet which you have the private key/phrase \"Not your Key, Not your Coin\" For assets which you don't fully have control over it is actually not your own.",

Concentrate your investments on Bitcoin alone. This is simply because Bitcoin has come to stay. It may dip badly but it will surely recover unlike alts that can disappear into thin air. Two, don't take any advice from anyone who sends you a PM asking you to invest in a certain business. Don't trust anyone quickly here, verify them first. Just like we've nice guys here, we also have bad guys and scammers too on the internet space. Have it in mind.

What is your recommendation for a beginner?for beginners, I will likely to advise them to go for more research before they decide to pick any aspect you have mentioned either trading, mining or investing. But for own research I think investing is a option is because it don't involve stress and risks like mining and trading.I will also advise beginners to stay away from altcoins and fully face bitcoin because it more secured than whatever we call altcoins.and again we have experienced many of  altcoins which after turn to die project. Also avoid using centralized exchanges because their not a well secured place for your investments except you just want to use it to purchase Bitcoin, which I think it will only make it easier using so. Please don't allow anybody to help you create your wallets because you are only the one expected to know your private key or your trust close one incase if any happen especially when you are not life, if anybody knows your private key your Bitcoin are not safe due to they have access to it.",

Beware when someone bothers you, messages you about a job, wants to help you when you're not asking for it, has an investment opportunity for you. 99.9% of the time it's a scam.2. Don't waste time on learning about new altcoins. Most of them are scams or pump and dump schemes. Sometimes you make money sometimes you don't but you always waste a lot of time getting to know protocols and they're usually just ideas that never become anything real. 3. Buy bitcoin. Just get exposed to it. It doesn't matter how much money you can have.  If you have spare $50 use that and hold for a few years. The more you have the better. I wish I knew this years ago when I came here but I thought all coins are equal just different in the goals they want to achieve. It's not true. There's bitcoin and there are altcoins. Don't let people fool you that it doesn't matter what you buy because it's the same crypto space.",

What is your recommendation for a beginner?My recommendation for beginners is very simple. First of all, if you don't have enough experience to trade, then don't trade before you really have the knowledge for it and understand how the risks are. Second, if you are good at assembling a mining machine, try starting it if you have sufficient capital for this.And the last is investing in several platforms such as ICO in the past even though at this time ICO is no longer seen as a good land for investment, but if you want to invest in the long term, I can only advise you to invest in Bitcoin. But if you also like altcoins, don't look at new altcoins whose potential and future are unclear. But try to see the altcoins that are often in the top ten in cryptocurrency rankings even though in my personal view any altcoin is only suitable for short-term investments.",
