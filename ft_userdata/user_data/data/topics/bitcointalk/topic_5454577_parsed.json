  "content": "I have an S19 that ran like a champ for about 3 months and then one day would fire up, mine for a few minutes and then stop. I updated the firmware and that fixed the problem temporarily, but it is back. Seems to have one fan that is running 4+ times as fast as the others. Any suggestions?(I've done lots of work on S9's but not on the S19)",

      "body": "If one of the fans is running faster than the other fans I guess that one of your fans is not giving the right signal or it is not plugged properly or maybe the blue wire(Signal for PWM) has no connection because if it doesn't have a connection the fan will run at full speed.What I would like you to try before replacing it with a new one as suggested above try to unplug it and clean the terminals and connectors and plug it back properly then test it again.If it didn't work if you have a multimeter check the blue wire resistance if it still has continuity if it doesn't have continuity then possible it may have cut connection inside you may need to replace that wire or the whole fan.",

Wish I'd tried that earlier. I already ordered 4 new fans for it, so if it does it again I will try the above advice. Thank you all. I really appreciate it.",

That's a weird issue without the kernel logs it's like we're guessing what's wrong with your unit but if flashing it solves your case then that's fine. Sometimes unsuccessful flashing may cause some issues I always try 2 to 3 times flashing them before deciding if it's a hardware issue.What firmware did you flash it again the latest one?Why not try their TF card firmware?",

Strongly suspect there is a fan that was malfunctioning...could be the meter on the blue wire was doing 2x what the fan was really doing.maybe the firmware corrupted and the error was in the firmware not the gear.you donâ€™t need to replace all the fans if it is a fan. but having a few on hand is big.",

      "body": "There is some evidence that replacing only one fan can create a airflow imbalance, stressing the old fans because even with identical RPMs and current draw you can have different actual air flow depending on design or even age. Many models of s19 are now supported by third-party firmware, these solutions can just ignore the RPMs.",

Strongly suspect there is a fan that was malfunctioning...I do not recommend to run the miner with only 3 fans it wouldn't be enough to cool down your miner while mining because if the miner overheats you just shorten the lifespan of your hashboard so you better wait for your ordered fans before running the miner again.And about the RPM it might be just an airflow imbalance as said above having extra fans is a good way to troubleshoot this case.",
