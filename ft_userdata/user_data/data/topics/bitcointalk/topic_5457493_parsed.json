The covid-19 was something very hard on people and his disappearance was far before the pandemic, no one knows what has happened to many of us and sometimes in situations like this we need to consult those who are from same locality with them to detect and know about the situation of those that are from same locality with them. Locality is something very important which mostly connects us together and bring users closer than its. And also, Theymos knows his staff and who knows if he communicates with them?I pray he should be safe anywhere he is now and let him or her come back to the forum.",
