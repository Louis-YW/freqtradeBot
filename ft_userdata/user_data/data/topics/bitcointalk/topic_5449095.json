But to be sure, a mod needs to ban you permanently, you check how it words and then report it with your temporary alt account (meta only) then the mod unban you again 🤣It should be an interesting testing.

LOL Smile 🤣I never think is a thing one should experience because I know how painful it's seeing yourself only on a reading mode without you having  access or the power to post and even create a post. Like as you two suggested above, I don't know how possible it is but only a mod/Admin may clearly explain that part to us currently.Btw why do you asked @op?",

So yes, permanently/temp. banned account can still receive PM just like what i saw on some users. Like some campaign managers before who were temp. banned, receiving PM on forum then reply on telegram for some instructions passed to responsible users s/he wants to post in behalf of him/er",

      "body": "You should be able to receive PMs even if you are banned. Obviously, you can't reply to any of those PMs. You can't post of edit your previous posts or merit other users. I remember someone suggested a while ago that the forum should warn users who are about to merit a post by a banned member (we can already see that by 3rd-party scripts anyways). I was against it at the time and still am today. Just because someone got banned it doesn't mean they didn't have a history of quality posts that don't deserve to be merited if someone likes them. A warning that the person is banned would affect that in my opinion.",

I experienced it and funny enough that at that time I was accepted in a high paying campaign managed by yahoo. I think it was Bitsler. The mod banned me for a week. The day they banned me I was accepted in the campaign. Yahoo had to fill up the slot so he picked another one. The next day the mod realized it was a mistake (or something similar). They unbanned me but I lost the spot LOLI think after few months Bitsler had another open slot and finally I was on-board. Seeing the red text font telling you are banned for x number of days is a painful experience.",
