  "content": "Hi everyone!On this forum there are lots of posts about Freewallet org, which is often called as a great SCAM project.Several days ago, on 08/02/2023 I made an official crime report to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (UK authority which investigates online scam and fraud crimes). My report was registrated by number NFRC230806087223.I created online petition with an appeal to the NFIB to investigate the fraudulent activities of Freewallet ownersIt is available here: https://chng.it/JVYrmzzHGKI ask everyone to sign this petition! It will take no more then 3-5 minutes but in may be significant to stop Freewallet scammers!The full text of petition:Freewallet.org is a site created by scammers to steal digital money from customer accounts. The site's owners call their product a cryptocurrency wallet, but it's actually an app that takes victims' assets and blocks their accounts.According to some reports, the owners of Freewallet org are residents of the United Kingdom Dmitrey Gunyashov and Alexey Gunyashov and a guy from Russia named Vasilli Meschyerokov. Some witnesses also mention Andrey Savchenko as one of the investors. (source: https://freewalletscam.boards.net/thread/2/freewallet-administration-stole-500-000)How the fraudulent site Freewallet org works:The victim creates a wallet to receive and send cryptocurrency through the Freewallet app.As soon as a large transfer is received on the account, the site administration transfers coins to someone else's address.If the user makes a claim, he is told that he himself sent the money by mistake to the wrong wallet, and the transfer cannot be returned.If the client deposits a large amount, the administration blocks the account under the pretext of verification.During the verification process, the administration ignores requests and submitted documents, constantly sends new requests.A detailed description of Freewallet fraud methods can be found at the links:https://freewalletscam.com/freewallet-the-scam-project-that-threatens-thousands-of-customers/https://freewalletscam.com/freewallet-app-reviews-is-it-safe-and-legit/https://freewalletscam.boards.net/thread/7/freewallet-stole-cancer-patients-savings...and on many other sites and forums! Freewallet scammers stole more than $8,000,000 of savings from thousands of victims. Among the victims there are people who collected this money for cancer treatment or made a transfer to celebrate their daughter's birthday.We ask you to sign this petition to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. On August 2, 2023, we submitted a formal request to this authority to conduct an investigation. The crime report is registered under the number NFRC230806087223. Since the owners of the Freewallet site may reside in the United Kingdom, this crime is under the jurisdiction of law enforcement in the United Kingdom and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.Some of the victims may also be residents of the UK. Some - live in other countries. According to sections 1, 2 Fraud Act 2006, a person is guilty of fraud if he is in breach of any of the sections listed in subsection (2) (which provide for different ways of committing the offence).A person is in breach of this section if he— dishonestly makes a false representation. Freewallet.org owners commited false representation of a possibillity of cryptocurrency payments and then appropriated their victims digital asssets. According to this, we ask you to sign this petition and we ask NFIB to investigate and bring the founders of the fraudulent Freewallet project to justice!",

      "body": "OK, guys, so, what do we have now.We are running the website about freewallet scam (https://realreviews.info/) and also we launched a petition claiming the NFIB to investigate those crimes. Freewallet team could give a public response to these accusations. If Freewallet org really was a decent service, its representatives would at least try to explain the reasons why hundreds of people lost assets by transferring them to the wallets of this “company”. Instead, Freewallet lawyers are writing complaints accusing us in “illegal use of the trademark name”, although there is no evidence that such a trademark even exists (on the official website of Freewallet it is indicated that the owner of the service is a defunct company).As a result, Freewallet scammers blocked 2 of our domains (freewalletscam.org and freewalletscam.com) without any reason. This  trick didn’t stop us, but on the contrary, only convinced us that we were right. If Freewallet were honest, they would be open to public discussion. But they hide from answering the questions of hundreds of victims and try to block resources where potential customers can read real reviews.Better for us, because even some crypto news websites are now starting to share our materials. https://realreviews.info/sign-a-petition-calling-for-an-investigation-against-freewallet-org-owners/",

If by any chance the whole matter was under the jurisdiction of the US authorities, I think that we would have seen some concrete moves long time ago. European authorities (with a few exceptions) are not even close to their American colleagues, especially when it comes to something like cryptocurrencies.",

If a person itself is a victim, it's more efficiently to make an official crime report. This is the only way to get your assets back. But in crypto community there are many people with active position who are tired of different scammers but didn't lose money (yet). And those people can't send an appeal or abuse since they are not crime investigation subjects. At the same time by signing a petition you show, that this question is important. And when government authorities find this petition (and they do cause we send to them all links, including even lnks to this topics), they think \"ok, so ot's not only one victim, there may be lot's of them. Maybe we should pay more attention to this issue cause there is too much public activity around this issue\". That's why we reccommend this \"algorythm\" of fighting against Freewallet",
