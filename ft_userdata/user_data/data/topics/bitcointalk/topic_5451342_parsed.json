Really interesting thread mate, and yes I have bet on underdog before if it also implies to virtual soccer games and yes again I bet on them when am feeling that I have lost everything and I decide to flip in my whole remaining cash so I just relief myself of the pains of take more time to lose and it eventually works well for but not all the time though but I can remember one or more times that I have done this and it worked out. I placed a bet on an odd of 21.00 against a 1.11 odd and they won for me but I guess it was my lucky try because most times trying i also get bad results.",

Winning this kind of bet gives a lot of satisfaction to bettors, but I don't usually risk a lot of money on this type of bet.Quote from: robelneo on May 05, 2023, 12:28:53 PMHow many times you did this? I can't give an exact count because I haven't kept track, but since I have been doing sports betting for five years now, I have probably done that more than 100 times.Quote from: robelneo on May 05, 2023, 12:28:53 PMAnd what made you bet on the underdogs is it because of insider tips or just an insight based on your analysis?

If I win my bet,I will have a huge profit. Though,most times I do it for fun just to try something different from my normal betting. It all boils down to your luck when you bet on underdogs because luck can fetch you the huge profits.",

And what made you bet on the underdogs is it because of insider tips or just an insight based on your analysis? Sports events can be analyzed if you know what to look for and how to find the right opportunity. I had various techniques in sports betting, and one was to bet on underdogs, but not on wins or losses, but on the fact that they will score a goal in the match (I'm talking about football of course). Of course, you need to monitor the form of the team and how often they score/don't score, and when you find the right opportunity, it can really pay off.The odds I played on were usually between 1.4 and 1.6, which means that each bet could be doubled if you combined two events.",

Your level of risk when betting for underdogs in the hope of winning by upsets?I have bet on underdog teams from time to time. But like I said it wasn't often because I don't get that much courageous that often.    The reason why I bet on underdogs in those times is that I analyze the teams in a match, consider the recent conditions of teams, check if they have any goals to go for in the remaining part of the season and so on. If I see some sense in trying my luck for a bet like that then I go for it.When it comes to how much I take risks I can say that I don't bet with a big amount of money in those times. Let's say I bet on a parlay that I trust a lot first and bet with some big amount. After that I allocate a little money for a surprise bet on an underdog team if I see some hope in it.Lastly yeah, there have been some times I won but the number of it isn't that high. I'm not that lucky.",

Your level of risk when betting for underdogs in the hope of winning by upsets?From a statistics and probability mathematics perspective, there is absolutely no point in betting on the underdog. Sure you are given better odds but historically, they are the underdogs for a reason. Because they lose very often.I rather bet on someone with a history of much more wins than losses.I also would never trust anyone who provides me \"insider tips\". Nobody is going to be giving away real insider tips without expecting something for it. And obviously nobody except the big dogs and those connected to them can be expected to have such tips.Anyone who does that can only be considered to be extremely naive.

I didn't place a very large wager because I had some reservations, but to my amazement, it has paid off. I have tried the same thing once more without success.

But for underdogs, I am not betting as big as with my bets with where I am more comfortable with. Whenever I am winning with upset bets, it is quite giving me regret of not making the bet bigger or using my usual amount of bet. But eventually, I've learned that earning less is better than earning nothing. Also, it would be less frequent to win with your underdog bet so I got along with smallet profit. Nowadays I am still doing some random bets but with those whoch are having close odds especially if I have an extra money, just to grasp a chance of winning without having that mucb of a good expectation. Some sort of \"for fun bet\". Fortunately, I am currently having a 70% winrate on such scheme; quite lucky I guess.",
