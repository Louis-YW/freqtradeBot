  "content": "Can you guys help me understand the math behind 6 confirmations? I have read that at 6 confirmations there is less than a 0.1% chance of a successful attack but I cannot remember where I read that. I have always wondered why the standard of waiting for confirmations to prevent a double spend attack was always 6 confirmations. I am aware that some places do allow at least 1 confirmation but if you accept 1 confirmation what percentage difference compared to 6 confirmations would I be taking a big risk by accepting 1 confirmations compared to 6?. I've searched around the internet and most just say that it reduces the chances but the exact numbers haven't been declared. For someone who might be developing a Bitcoin payment system or accepting Bitcoin on their website or for a service this should probably be more clear than it is. We should not blindly trust because it is the standard. I do not doubt that the standard has solid reasons I am more intrigued on why we have come up with that magic number. Does 6 confirmations reduce an attack by >99%? I ask because the wiki is no longer up to date but this information was answered before on there. Take this quote as an example:Quote from: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation#How_Many_Confirmations_Is_EnoughTransactions with 0/unconfirmed can be reversed with not too much cost via Finney attack and race attack, but in some cases may still be acceptable especially for low-value goods and services, or ones which can be clawed back.For transactions with confirmations, the website (https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html) can be used to calculate the probability of a successful doublespend given a hashrate proportion and number of confirmations. Note that in the reality of bitcoin mining today, more than 6 confirmations are required. (60 confirmations to have <1% odds of succeeding against an entity with 40% hash power). See Section 11 of the (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf bitcoin whitepaper) for the AttackerSuccessProbability formula.The only problem with this quote is that it talks about more confirmations preventing an attack which I understand but it talks about up to 60 confirmations to fully mitigate the attack so why are we using a 6 confirmation standard when there is still a chance of an attack succeeding is it because it is so low chance that it realistically will never happen? The reference https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html returns a error and does not have the information any more.Quote from: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdfRunning some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.q=0.1z=0 P=1.0000000z=1 P=0.2045873z=2 P=0.0509779z=3 P=0.0131722z=4 P=0.0034552z=5 P=0.0009137z=6 P=0.0002428z=7 P=0.0000647z=8 P=0.0000173z=9 P=0.0000046z=10 P=0.0000012q=0.3z=0 P=1.0000000z=5 P=0.1773523z=10 P=0.0416605z=15 P=0.0101008z=20 P=0.0024804z=25 P=0.0006132z=30 P=0.0001522z=35 P=0.0000379z=40 P=0.0000095z=45 P=0.0000024z=50 P=0.0000006Solving for P less than 0.1%...P < 0.001q=0.10 z=5q=0.15 z=8q=0.20 z=11q=0.25 z=15q=0.30 z=24q=0.35 z=41q=0.40 z=89q=0.45 z=340 The Bitcoin whitepaper has this information which I assume is related to confirmations but this does not make any sense to me.

A successful attacker will need to mine all blocks again since your transaction. It is considered  permanent and practically impossible for an attacker to mine 6 blocks faster than the whole network. This is why 6 confirmations is enough.If you are talking about altcoins, like bch or brg which have significant lower hashrate, the 6 confirmation rule is not enough.",

      "body": "The probability of any miner finding a block is a Poisson process, where the probability of an attacker finding a block is relative to the hashrate that the rest of the network. Hence, you can see that the expected value of the number of blocks being found by an attacker is z(q/p), where for eg. if you have 50% of the hashrate, you are likely to find the next block 50% of the time. What the rest of the simulation is would be to calculate calculate the probability of the attacker getting the next block given that he has also mined the last z blocks. The reason why Poisson distribution is used, is because the probability of getting a block with q percentage of the hashrate is not an uniform distribution, and hence we have to use Poisson distribution to approximate the number of blocks to catch up.The point here is that the attacker needs to outpace the network, by catching up with the number of blocks that it is behind on the network. The re-organization has to be strictly mined such that the successive blocks all belongs to the attacker. As such, this calculation assumes that the attacker is simultaneously mining with the network and is able to mine d successive blocks to outrun the network. This assumes that the miner isn't selfish mining, which would skew the probability significantly.Now, if you observe from the results, 6 confirmations only provide a 0.1% chance of the miner doing a double spend assuming that the attacker only controls 10% of the network hashrate. This number increases with proportion of the network hashrate that the attacker hold. 10% of the hashrate is fairly large, and that is also where game theory comes into play; attackers are unlikely to be willing to waste more than that to double spend a transaction and the probability of success is reasonably low across various proportion of the hashrate as well.It is not correct that the probability of double spends beyond 6 confirmations is 0.1% at all of the scenarios, but if the attacker controls 51% of the hashrate, it will always be a 100% probability of success because it is always able to generate blocks faster than the rest of the network.",

Disabling RBF does nothing other than preventing another miner from potentially mining a competing transaction by chance. If there is any ill-intent present, then there is no point asking them to disable RBF because they would have gone a little further to try to get their transaction to get double spent. There's this misconception that disabling RBF prevents any easy double spending but that is false; the primary purpose of RBF is to allow users to replace their transaction with another that spends a higher fee and disabling defeats that purpose especially in instances where fees spike were to occur.The one and only way to be certain is to wait for 3 or more confirmations (if you are that paranoid). Otherwise, there is little to no security benefits. Anyways, stale block candidates are easily detectable with a well-connected node.

I don't recommend people accepting unconfirmed transactions, because you are creating potential problems for yourself and your customer. If it remains unconfirmed for an extended period of time, you won't be able to spend it and neither will the customer be able to spend their change. The latter is more than fine, because you should be accepting confirmed transactions. The volatility of the fees in recent times hasn't been very kind and there is still a good enough possibility for the customer to be able to push it directly to a mining pool, RBF or not.

My understanding of the OP's question is that he is asking about the probability of there being a chain of orphaned blocks that is 6 blocks deep. The OP does use the words \"double spend attack\", but the context of his question appears to be asking about orphaned blocks.When a block is found, it will take x amount of time to propagate throughout the network, and if another miner finds a competing block within that time, there is the potential for some of the network to be working on top of one block at height y, and some of the network to be working on top of another block at the time height. If this were to happen, and both parts of the network find block y + 1 within the aforementioned x time, there will be a chain of two orphaned blocks. Without knowing how long it typically takes for blocks to propagate, it is difficult to calculate the chances of a chain split that is n blocks deep. I do know that the miners, and mining pools have invested heavily in getting their found blocks to the other miners quickly, and over time, the time required for a block to propagate has been reduced. With the above being said, just because there is a chain of orphaned blocks, it is not necessarily going to be true that there will be a different set of confirmed transactions in each of the blocks. In general, miners will fill their blocks with transactions based on transaction fee rate, so all miners are more or less expected to include the same transaction set in each of their blocks, notwithstanding transactions that were very recently broadcast immediately prior to a block being found.",

The user have to either intentionally make a transaction with a higher fee or do so in a subsequent transaction, provided that the next user doesn't care about the unconfirmed output. Mempool seems to accumulate over time and it would be far more expensive to do a CPFP later than to have an RBF now.

For a cup of coffee, though, Lightning is a better solution. But, for supermarket fulled cart, that can't be easily paid with Lightning, since there's high chance of routing failure, and where there's rush, the merchant should accept unconfirmed transactions. I'd be willing to open a channel with my supermarket, if it was possible, though, and make my purchases instantly. But, that's just me, I can't expect the others behave same like.",

If your probability is as low as 0.1% or 1%, it's a big gamble to make, with a lot of money on the line (a big chunk of the mining network in electricity cost for an hour). This only makes sense to double-spend a pretty rare transaction, worth millions or with a very well paying lobbyist / politician (in the case of a censorship-motivated attack).",

This can happen if a big mining pool decides to.

I mean, if the USA agreed on paying 10,000 BTC to Putin for, say, buying a lot portion of Russia's gas, and somehow managed to double-spend that, first of all, they wouldn't get any gas since it'd take some days (hundreds of blocks) to deliver, and second, that would probably be the reason to officially set sail to the second cold war. It makes sense to double-spend only if you do things anonymously or if the seller can't reach you.",

Even with a third of the hashrate cooperating, and a lot of money on the line, the probability of success will still make it a big gamble to reverse a 6 confirmation transaction.

That's a good point. It would need to be something of very high value that can be transferred with total finality within 6 blocks or roughly one hour's time.",

Receiving it, may show as pending, and you just wait. Sending it, depending on if they batch your transaction or send it later, you'll also have to wait.Normally you don't wait more than half an hour to an hour anyway.To fuss about some transaction not having 6 or 10 confirmations and it's less than the price of a pizza (whether that's back then, or today) is just wasting everyone's time.",
