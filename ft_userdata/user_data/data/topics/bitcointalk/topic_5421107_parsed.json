FTX had also done this sort of behavior afaik with the tokens on SOL. So many of them falling even the exchange not affiliated with FTX are also halting withdrawals posturing maintenance. They couldn't just say bankruptcy, they still poise Chapter 11.",

A few months down the road, they just looked me out with not even a single warning. Luckily, I didn't have any funds there.

When ICO is over, the price is dumped and retail investors are lured to think its price still will go up. That is literally taking the money of users while most people here just advise buying BTC, but they market the token to be undervalued.",

What the hell is even that?  Lol.  I've never heard of an IUO before--This was a trend way back when the ICO hype was still strong. IOUs represent ICO tokens that are not yet distributed, either because the ICO hasn't started yet or it hasn't ended yet or the distribution date hasn't yet arrived. But the tokens are already traded by way of IOUs. The latest that I heard of an IOU being traded is when the weird Justin Sun's Poloniex offered ETHS (representing Proof Of Stake ETH) and ETHW (representing Proof Of Work ETH) before the scheduled Merge and possible fork.

Crypto bigwigs are certainly doing harm instead of helping the original vision because they're after the money. They learned Bitcoin and went on to create centralized exchange platforms, centralized crypto banks, lending platforms, investment platforms, NFTs, shitcoins, and so on, all against the very reason why Bitcoin was created in the first place.",

Are they expecting additional money from few careless user?True, that part was indeed weird and the reason is quite obvious. I just checked the situation it looks like they finally stopped deposits as well as few hours ago they announced it via twitter, almost 24 hours after blocking withdrawals. I guess they wouldn't even stop it yet if people weren't complaining under yesterday's tweet why is depositing still possible.https://twitter.com/Liquid_Global/status/1592763572983324672",
