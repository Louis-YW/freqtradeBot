  "content": "The month of November 2022 happens to be one of the most unfavorable months for the cryptocurrency industry as an accumulative total amount of $4.88 billion worth of crypto was lost in November alone and this staggering amount has resulted in a panic that has forced the price of many cryptocurrencies to crash while stable ones like Bitcoin have battled with the force of the attack to maintain a good price up till this very moment.Mojar Bad event in November 2022:1: FTX bankruptcy scam.    This situation was when FTX declared the exchange bankrupt in court and halted customers' withdrawals and $1 billion worth of   cryptocurrency in varius customer accounts were lost while FTX reported a loss of $380 million through an exploit of the exchange by hackers, this number was declared and after clients withdrawal was halted.2: Genesis reported $2.8 billion loans balance of customer lock when the halted the withdrawal feature on the platform on November 9th,     Genesis reason for halting customer withdrawals was on the basis of having $170 million worth of crypto on FTX exchange was  locked even though that amount is not even up to 20% of the total customer balance.Lesson for the futureEven though this incidents among others have affected the adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies negatively the fact still remains that cryptocurrency was not directly involved in all of this most especially coins like Bitcoin but the actors in this incident is exchange and other third party actors who are all centralized.We should know as a newbie that we can still be 100% secure if we never store our money and assets on a third platform such as exchange.How to remain secured:The first thing to do is to have a cold wallet or good online wallets that give you wallet keys that can be used by only you to control your crypto portfolio that are held in the wallet. https://m.savi.xyz/newsdetails?category_id=crypto&news_id=e2ca81a955ceaf30ddd59724aacddb23&country=cb&language=en&news_entry_id=57758d87221208en_cb&utm_source=crypto-browser-android&utm_medium=corner_push",

Its one of the most mistakes of all that funds should not be stored heavily on centralized platform.November indeed is one of the worst month but surely it will not be the same on the following to come could be worse or yet can experience a bullish recovery.",

Worst for holders/users who keeps there money on FTX since they got nothing as they can't pull out their funds in that exchange and they are totally been scammed by them. But for investor maybe November is best month since from this they bought cheap bitcoins and other alts which they are in good profits even if they sell it right now.Quote from: Beparanf on December 10, 2022, 11:16:53 AMThis is not new because we also experienced this catastrophic losswhen Terra UST and Luna falls due to attack on their stable coin protocol. Lot's of people lost their money on this incident so this really remind us not to trust anyone regardless how big they are since there are still chances that we lose our money just like what happen on those controversial incident happened this year.",

A lot of DeFi went bankrupt same as Genesis that results to freezing on account of customers without certainty on when they will refund their money.Financially, the Terra/Luna fiasco caused up to $80 billion in damage, while in the case of FTX they are talking about $20 billion, although it may be a much larger amount. Be that as it may, both events each in their own time caused significant shocks in the crypto market and introduced a large amount of mistrust, the results of which we see today. Of course, Bitcoin is not to blame for the fact that someone has a disastrous idea, and what is even more tragic is that so many people believed in all this, as well as the fact that they entrusted their money to some spoiled kid who was not capable of running a chicken coop, let alone a company with such a serious business.Quote from: Beparanf on December 10, 2022, 11:16:53 AMIt’s intriguing how SBF try to save company that went down due Terra Luna incident and then they experienced the same loss. A completely incomprehensible attempt on his part, because why save something that cannot succeed no matter how much money you invest in it. While the whole thing looked promising (to some), many members (myself included) were very skeptical of the idea.",

And regardless, when it comes to the price of bitcoin, what happened in November pales in contrast to what happened in 2018 and the years before. Sad for newbies that left their savings in FTX. Now that they are aware that their investments are constantly at risk in exchanges, the other newbies should understand this. Not your keys, not your coins.",

The focal points of the losses of November Crypto-currency loss was based on FTX but first if you had avoided centralized exchanges the case won’t be so.I don’t think it’s should take an FTX drama to learn other than potential loss of fund on centralized exchange you would also have privacy compromise issues too.

      "body": "November was tagged the worst month in the article because the scam event that happened last month went so viral that a plethora of people knew about it. Every month they is a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme or Scam that use huge offers to deprive victims off their hard earned money. October was a bad time too for the Bitcoin Sheikh victims who got deceived with 20% returns and were promised by Da Silva that he's got expert traders that'll make his promises possible. The Brazilian who spearheaded the crime Fransisco Da Silva and his team Signed out with more than $700 million dollars made out of cryptocurrency. And other uncountable scams that happend on the month of August. So calling a specific month a worst moment for cryptocurrency like such things only happen on November doesn't curtail the truth that these ill treatments are done by humans not months. So these people decide the appropriate time to defraud people, its not time that takes the action.",

There is still a chance of losing crypto assets although we store them in private wallets (online or offline wallets).If someone loses the private keys or passwords to access the wallets, we lose all the crypto assets there.So, we must be careful to keep the passwords or private keys to access the wallets. Don't only keep it on the computer/laptop, or store it in online places, but keep also the security data in offline places.Dude, according to the content of your thread, the title should be 'a lesson for newbies on the FTX case'.",

As a newbie in the forum,I have always learnt here to keep my btc in a cold storage wallet,which I only have access to.. Newbies should take note that when you keep your btc in an exchange,you are throwing away you investment.Some of these exchange platforms came out to scam people of their investment,they will come in disguise as exchanges but the moment they see that more customers have trust them,after accumulation of the customers assets,they will shut down and come up with flamsy excuses because customers can't do anything to them.",

I mean they came at the right time as the price of crypto has dip a lot over the last 1 year, in fact it is very possible they could make a lot of profit in the long term if they started investing during last November.But of course there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this mess especially they need to keep their eyes open about the risks that exist in the crypto space especially when they trust a centralized exchange 100% without a doubt of the bad possibilities. Of course they will learn and then they will also know that a centralized exchange is not a safe depository wallet in the long term. Luna and FTX should be the reason why they can't 100% believe in crypto and something centralized. There is always a risk even if they invest in bitcoin but don't know how to store it safely.",

I might be considered a self centered fellow for this but I sympathize with people greatly affected by the this bearish period. This year is actually a great year if you just started investing in Bitcoin. Imagine it been at that 60k mark it will be high for new investors but at the current 17k it is a blessing to new comers to accumulate more. Thereby getting it both as a store of value and expecting some profits.As for the Exchange saga I think the warning has been there since, so it was a matter of time before what happened would actually occur. I just hope people actually learn from the saga and leave off making exchanges like this, their wallets and staying off shitcoins. It was a bitter lesson for some and I sympathize with everyone affected",

Bearish momentum like now will test the resilience of investors to stay in the market and not leave it. we do have to get used to it, but we also have to have some reserves in order to make good use of the bear market. during the process of retaining assets, it is also important to review and safer to store in a personal wallet.",
