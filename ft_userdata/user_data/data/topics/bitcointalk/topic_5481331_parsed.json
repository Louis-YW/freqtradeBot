Can anyone share links about?Bitcoin v0.1 (Jan 8 14:27:40 EST 2009) was the wallet used by Satoshi and Hal Finney when tweeted “Running bitcoin,” (January 11) while Bitcoin 0.2 released was on December 16.Bitcoin v0.1 was windows only for now.  Open source C++ codehttps://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/014994.htmlDownload link: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1.0.rar However, this wallet will not sync with current nodes due to Bitcoin hardfork.Believe it or not, in the first versions it was possible to send to an IP address.QuoteThere are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, youcan enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new publickey and send the transaction with comments.  If the recipient isnot online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, whichis a hash of their public key that they give you.  They'll receivethe transaction the next time they connect and get the block it'sin.",

Can anyone share links about?I am sure Satoshi and Hal knew ways to generate valid bitcoin key-pairs without using Bitcoin's software. They were both skilled professionals in cryptography. You can definetely generate the key-pairs without ever touching any bitcoin related software. I doubt they have done it though, because Bitcoin core is Satoshi's invention and it uses these techniques specifically.Quote from: Disruptivas on January 12, 2024, 01:36:58 PMToday I read some reports from users with problems related to Electrum on Tails.Tails is just an OS that does this:QuoteTails always starts from the same clean state and everything you do disappears automatically when you shut down TailsElectrum is a just a piece of software, developed in 2011. Electrum uses (as far as I know) os.urandom() to generate entropy and combines it with some other input sources (user inputs, time etc.). You can even see the main dev talking about it back in 2013 here on this forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=167276.msg1746905#msg1746905My questions to you are:1. how can Electrum face issues specifically on Tails OS? 2. where did you read these reports? You know how people behave usually, writting whatever they want. Don't trust everything you read.However, if indeed you have spotted a problem regarding Electrum, let us know and we can inform the devs on github. It's fully open-source!",

That feature contact that IP address and expect Bitcoin address as response, before the software can create Bitcoin transaction.[1] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues[2] https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/",
