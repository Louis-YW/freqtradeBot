      "body": "RBI is the reason why we have tax but nil regulations. They were the ones advocating a complete ban in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Now they will become the in charge of cryptocurrency exchanges. This is not looking good although they have ruled out a ban but still they can again place a blanket ban if this kind of regulatory framework comes in India. Back in 2018 they were the ones who placed a blanket ban. They never bothered to inform the government about it and directly forward a directive to all banks. If they start controlling Indian crypto exchanges they can place harsh directives. Already with the tax law a lot of exchanges have reported low volume. Next they might shut shop or move out of India. I don't understand how can a local fiat currency regulator and decision maker decide about cryptocurrency. The RBI governer has said multiple times in Public that crypto is a threat to India. If he thinks in such a manner then would he allow it to survive in our economy. It is a bad idea to give RBI control, it would have been wise if a seperate body would have created in this area.",

But yeah, crypto regulations should not fall under RBI or else they will not allow it to grow and will restrict people in any possible way. Thanks for the opinion though, which acts as an eye-opener for me regarding this kind of approach.",

Not only because we are in situation of no laws yet full tax but also because this would give a big certainty to a lot of people that bitcoin is not illegal atleast whatever we guys are doing is absolutely legal comes under the ambit of RBI. but yes practically I don't know how stringently will RBI act with these exchanges.",

      "body": "This entire thing makes sense because right now we pay 30% tax but we have no regulatory framework available. The crypto market in India is a bit of nonsense with all these India made exchanges. A regulatory framework will greatly help the crypto adoption in the country if the tax rate is kept at per with other income. 30% tax 8s a big no! If RBI rolls out some favorable cryptocurrency framework, I am sure it create great impact. Only the tax rate the matter of concern.",

But yeah, crypto regulations should not fall under RBI or else they will not allow it to grow and will restrict people in any possible way. Thanks for the opinion though, which acts as an eye-opener for me regarding this kind of approach.In a way, they are restricting the growth of the crypto market in India by giving RBI the authority to regulate it. I am surprised none of the big community members and the owners of crypto exchanges are questioning this decision. RBI was the one that had stopped the government from implementing regulation and wanted a complete ban. The government should come up with a different regulatory authority for crypto. They have a SEBI to regulate the share market, RBI does not have any jurisdiction in the Indian share market. This shows the government does not consider cryptocurrency as a commodity, it still considers it as a digital currency which is meant for gambling. Believe me, we won't see a deduction from the existing tax slab if this shit continues. I am expecting very harsh regulation from the government of India.",

Arent we were countering banks and other financial institutions! Then why give a bank status to a crypto exchange? I believe we would need more details before coming to any conclusion. I do think this is a bad idea for the Indian crypto community if it actually happens. We have seen in the past how they became a good example of a carrot-and-stick approach. What I meant was RBI would be holding the carrot and Indian exchanges would become the donkey.",

I think by Advanced KYC they mean one, that no customer will be allowed to trade on the forum until they have completed their KYC also in the KYC itself there will be a lot of parameters using which the user can be uniquely identified.2. All it would do is ensure that Exchanges are solvent at all times and there are no shady things such as what happened in case of Ftx is happening with Indian exchanges.3. By uniform taxation policy governments around the world means the policy of taxation which means the methodology would be same, not the rate of tax.",
