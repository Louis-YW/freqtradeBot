This forum is also a good place to choose casinos because there is a section where you can report the casino if you suspect any foul play. Some of these reputable casinos have been able to overcome various challenges and they also have a solid capital base. Rollbit has been here for a long time and has been financing a running signature campaign for some years now. But you must do your own research and choose the one that suits you. Don't also rely on a single review website to make a judgment, Â you can compare it will more. You also need to abide by the rules of gambling which include not using your casino account for saving and gambling only what you can afford to lose.",

Being specific will just make us biased of the platforms we are engaging but one thing is for sure, reputable ones wonâ€™t be in such classification if players have negative experience on those platforms. Gambling sites in crypto industry are all accepting crypto as mode of payment. Each platform could also give you offers to welcome you on their website but always choose those which are responsive with customer support. For me it does not only measure how good a platform is as a gambling site but also concerned of their players. With KYC procedures, make sure to read first the ToS to suit your preference.",

My collection contains many popular crypto casinos, but I haven't added new names to it for some time. Generally, I am cautious to recommend new casinos because they can turn out to be old scam casinos returning under a different name. But even if that's not the case, I still like to give them a few months to settle in and show they have the money to pay winners. @alinknilaI would recommend you start with Sportsbet.io. It's been around a long time and is trusted. It offers both a sportsbook and online casinos games.",

You will see them with longer threads.I can recommend you https://livecasino.ioThis ANN threads are littered with third-party topics discussing gambling and it will be difficult for beginners to find proven and reliable casinos that accept payments in crypto. Although in that section there are ANN topics that have been posted on the forum for quite a long time and are famous, including holding various competitions and events, as well as signature campaigns. It is unlikely that there are scam casinos among them. For example, here are some of them:Duelbits.comÂ  Blackjack.funÂ  Stake.com Roobet.comÂ  BITCASINOÂ  WINZ.IO But even here you need to be careful, avoiding casinos like 1XBIT.COM.Â  I think there is no better topic with reviews of online casinos than topic ðŸ¤œ GamblingBro.com ðŸ¤› Honest crypto casino reviews âœ… Tested with real deposits âœ… on the forum. But the nuance is that there are not reviews on all casinos (not even all from the forum).",

I agree with you mate, OP will not have a hard time compiling the list check out the signatures with the longest campaign, with active and long discussions.Since he asked for names I can easily name Stake, Duelbits, and Fortunejack as the three top casinos here with a very active presence and supporters here, I highly suggest that he start with Stake because the platform is newbie-friendly and they have tons of games, lots of bonuses, great support, so start on the right casino and that's Stake.com.",
