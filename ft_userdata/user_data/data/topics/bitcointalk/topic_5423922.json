OP should make his/her topic in \"Alternate cryptocurrencies\" section.From Guidelines for threads:Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMProject Development - Organization of Bitcoin and related projects (sites, software not yet developed/in development), bounty campaigns, advertising etc. No hiring here although \"looking for partners\" threads should be here.",

The token is deployed on mainnet with NFT holders receiving staking rewards. Public sale will take place in 2023.Token is used currently to purchase in-game cosmetic items in our p2e game.",

The forum will not prevent you from posting in any topic, as there is a section dedicated even to posts off-topic. Be careful that your ideas are not convincing because the members here are smarter than you can imagine. And I expect that you have an idea about this before thinking about posting here and using the forum.",

The discussion here really shouldn’t be about the project, and a link to it isn’t really appropriate in my opinion. It should probably be locked. If everyone who had a project to promote made a thread like this in Meta it wouldn’t scale too well. As far as promoting your project, this is a poor first impression of it…",

Seems like you have done your homework quite well.Marketing like this will never bring you positive impression. If you have anything to promot like this you should consider posting on altcoin section of this forum.",
