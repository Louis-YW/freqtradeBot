      "body": "This could be a phishing attack; did you check to see if the email was the official one? Because most times hackers could use email that looks like the official email of a site to try to phise users of that site so do a thorough check on the email address and also the link that was sent to you if it’s the original site link.Quote from: CoinBitter on November 08, 2023, 01:39:48 AMEdit: Obviously I didn't ask for a new password and I have confirmed my identity ages ago.Then go and change your password immediately and also your email address. Like I said earlier it’s possible that the email was not from the support personnel but from a hacker that wants you to believe it’s from support, so just do a proper security check on your account.

I haven’t used the site before but if a site that I frequent should do this I definitely would have taken it has a phishing attack and put the mail on spam.",

Especially if you log in your account on a new device, new IP address but if this activity is done by the real owner, no big issue to prove it with simple step.Scam exchanges can use this reason to pull their scam KYC card and it's not true to generalize it for all exchanges.If they sent you an email with a link to a website, to download their application, you should be careful and not click on it. That can be phishing links.Want to download an exchange application?You can get it at their website. Again, don't click on link in email. Find their website at Coinmarketcap.com, Coingecko.com and get links for downloading.",
