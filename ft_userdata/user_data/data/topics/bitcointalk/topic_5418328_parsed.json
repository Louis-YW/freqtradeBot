The majority of their money will be sat in company shares, so what does it matter if some new regulation comes in, which can be sold as cracking down on money laundering or excessive energy wasting activities at the current time? They've been fairly hands off with cryptocurrency so far, but if they get the treasury or the bank of England saying it's a good idea, they'll jump at it. They'll put the burden on the big banks to monitor and trace these sort of activities, so there is little cost involved either.",

His policies must be supported by the parliament for them to get the needed approval. He might be a supporter of blockchain technology but he must also have to convince the members of his party and others about the profitability of his policies. Stablecoins are backed by fiat and they are not decentralized like bitcoin, therefore much shouldn't be expected from this bill. All these laws are just targeted at regulating the crypto space which negates the goals or reason for the creation of bitcoin. Regardless of the reason behind this bill, the positive implication is that it would definitely create more awareness for the adoption of bitcoin and others.",

But the most important details or contentious issues when this is already passed into law will definitely be the implementing rules and regulations that would be created by various implementing agencies. At the end of the day, it's just a matter of time when cryptocurrency will be regulated. Governments' can't turn a blind eye to its emergence forever. It's either they will resist or accept its rise.",

I never believed that any of them weren't a pawn, if you are leader of a big nation, only even bigger names could get you there, which is usually rich business people who own a lot of stuff. Look at the media owners, many of the tv channels and newspapers are owned by the same people, and they are the ones who get you to the top and you help them after you get to top or they will make you look terrible on papers and help you remembered as a horrible prime minister.Maybe Liz Truss was exception, she didn't want to handle that and left. This new Sunak guy will do whatever asked of him, which won't really turn crypto too much in a good or bad way neither, but he will do whatever is asked of him.",
