      "body": "\"What is bitcoin for you?\"I find it difficult to single out just one thing in bitcoin. For me, it is like a multifunctional financial tool, the application of which will differ depending on the situation and goals.In the long term, bitcoin is a speculative instrument (still, at some point all will sell this or part of it) combining the function of a bank (savings) deposit and a protective asset against inflation.In the short term - electronic international (quoted in any country) digital money (with solvency restrictions due to the small number of sellers accepting this currency), allowing you to pay or transfer in a matter of minutes (if the meme-pool is not overloaded).In terms of independence and privacy, this is a tool that gives financial independence and freedom from any third parties (governments, banks) and maintains confidentiality (subject to a number of measures) of financial activities.",

      "body": "For me, Bitcoin can give me the freedom to manage my own assets without interference from other people, be it banks, financial institutions and so on and this is truly freedom and control completely in my own hands.And besides that Bitcoin is anonymous because I need transactions that do not have to be printed in my bank account which makes transactions difficult and time consuming, and Bitcoin is the solution and can also carry out transactions without time limits and country restrictions.And the most important thing for me is to own or invest Bitcoin very profitably when the price rises and also for my future or old age. And I am very confident and optimistic that in the future the price of Bitcoin will be much higher and also provide many benefits for me, because as long as I have Bitcoin I feel many good benefits, especially from a financial perspective. So in my opinion, while I was involved in Bitcoin, I got a lot of benefits and also very valuable experiences that I had never had or experienced before. And I am very lucky to be involved with Bitcoin, otherwise I would be very sorry because the reality is that so far only Bitcoin has the ability to change my situation.And I just tried to explain Bitcoin's uses and benefits to me to the OP and they are all real things I have experienced and know about and although there is much more. And the OP must study and understand it well if he wants to get involved, especially the risks involved because Bitcoin will be very useful and profitable if it is with the right person.",

Bitcoin has managed to turn a lot of people‚Äôs lives and make them better. As we are all different, we all approach bitcoin in different ways.

Take your time to read about Bitcoin and find threads where you can contribute positively to. Thanks you very much for this advice. There are some newbies will just come to the forum and they are the people to advise other newbies what to do instead of them to learn more about the forum and Bitcoin itself. If this Op is really wants to learn bitcoin and it community he would asked some questions, because even this topic that he has created someone has created it before and people has made comments in that thread. He would have made some research first to know if this topic has been created before creating his own. Op take the advice from Davidvictorson. You are here to learn and if you have known bitcoin before coming to this place then you wouldn't create this trash in the forum therefore you are here to learn so read more.",

It has also been discovered that these criminals get information about the worth of their targets from bank officials. Bitcoin's privacy is an option for hiding how much you are worth from the public space. So Bitcoin for me is a good way to be anonymous.The rate at which my local currency is losing its value due to inflation is also alarming. Bitcoin seems to be a good hedge over inflation. It is better to save your funds in Bitcoin than to keep it at the mercy of an inflation-prone local currency. Bitcoin is a viable means of saving for the future.",

But when I started to earn in BTC and started to use that BTC for holding purposes I realize the true capacity of BTC and why holding BTC is far better than holding alts. Then slowly slowly I learned about it and still learning. BTC has made me more profit than any other alts. Even if it's a few bucks but profit is profit.I would say in the long run BTC is the best choice over any other alts but I might choose ETH for some reason but still BTC is my first priority. It has a scarcity factor and demand is already increasing. Governments are allowing it making it legal. New tax and rule and regulations are being made for BTC and overall crypto industries and many new countries will also accept BTC ETF which will bring more adoption so all these factors are main reasons that keep me loving BTC plus BTC is the king",
