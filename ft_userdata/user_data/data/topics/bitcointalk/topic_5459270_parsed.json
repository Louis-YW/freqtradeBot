Anyway I have seen that he has been red tagged for supposedly asking for the loan without collateral but he claimed to offer collateral, which for me is not clear which one. I guess condoras is fed up with seeing loan requests of the same style in this section.",

We can say that are not even collateral...OK, thanks for the info. I didn't know that. No one has criticized you for being \"aggressive\" tagging newbies for asking for loans without collateral, as in the case of this thread? Apparently not everyone agrees just like on accounts that are found to have been bought. I am in favor of red tag in these cases, both newbies trying to borrow without collateral and people buying accounts, especially if the purchase was after the introduction of the merit system.",

Also, you could wait a week for your testing I think. A week is never too long a time and don’t be in a hurry for a business that isn’t seasonal, not like you was trying to secure a contract or something and besides, $250 is that small and something you could have gotten easily in your locality.Don’t know how you got funded, but you sure did get a tag to tell you, this move isn’t the best of ideas for you and should be avoided.",
