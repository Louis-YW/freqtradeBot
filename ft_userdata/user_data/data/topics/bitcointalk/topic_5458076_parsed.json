  "content": "I just know that running full-node bitcoin is only cost 0.48kWh electrical each day. So when I calculate how many watts we need for 24 hours: ... watt x 24/1000 = 0.48, then I got 20 watts. So, we look back on online shops In my country, I can buy Cheap Solar Kit Panel 20 Watt with only cost $50 - $60, and when I look in amazon store, I only spend about  about $37.That is quite big difference in price, but It is not my focus, we can search for more cheapest. So, with lots of sun on Asia, especially on my country where the sun shines every day, we have to take advantage of this, right? When you read the article I shared above, I need electrical costs $45.55 each year. This means when I bought 1 time that Cheap Solar Kit Panel, I can save for a lifetime, I don't spend $45.55 each year again, and maybe I have maintained the battery with a warranty for several years.What is your thought?(Correct Me If I am wrong about calculation and cost.) but, my point is we can save more money with solar kit panels.",

      "body": "I think most of the price difference comes from the fact that your country sells the kit with battery included and the Amazon link you posted is a product that doesn’t include one. It may be worth the electricity savings if you get a good quality solar panel and a long-lasting battery. From my experience, all cheap solar panel kits stopped working after months or the battery didn’t last at all anymore so take that into consideration as well.",

Running a full node is not having power as it's challenging factors for now than other requirements that are needed to run a full node, aside from having a steady power supply which i believe this solar panels generating source could produce an output satisfactory enough in that regards, then the computer system required and its specifications, the storage space, the technical aspects also is there to consider in knowing how to run a bitcoin full node, i will say that this is just an introductory aspect of begining to learn how to run a full node since running it cannot be power demanding as such needed with bitcoin mining.",

So you'e going to need 3 of those 20watts panels and a battery to store the extra energy generated during the day and needed during the night.So from a one-time payment of $37 versus a yearly payment of $45 you're going to have one upfront payment of $111 versus a yearly payment of $17.5 before battery costs. It kind of changes things, right?",

Well like any potential customer...There are a lot promises but little truth. Especially in the figures they give. Some even calculate profitability on the basis that it's sunny in the middle of the night. LOL@stompix says the truth, a 20w panel won't give you 20w. Also they sell a lot of bad quality products but even if you pay the high price you won't get 20w, that's for sure.",

So when you are looking at buying something that looks cheap, look out for its quality or else you will end up looking to replace or repair it after a year, which kind of makes it more expensive than the electricity you have been trying to dodge. Just like you have already been advised, you are going to need bigger or more panels and bigger storage if you are to run that node constantly throughout. This also ensures the storage batteries don't completely drain out, as it takes time to recharge back to full potential.",

The article use $0.26/kWh as price electricity, while yours is $0.095/kWh[1].2. We don't know how much electricity used by your device. If you use single board computer (such as Raspberry Pi[2]) or laptop which designed to use very low energy, your potential saving per year become lower.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_pricing[2] https://raspi.tv/2019/how-much-power-does-the-pi4b-use-power-measurementsThat is still a rough estimate, maybe next if I have the funds I will make an accurate in how much cost and watts I need. while I know once charging laptop is need 60 – 180 watts.Quote from: LeGaulois on June 30, 2023, 11:39:18 AM@stompix says the truth, a 20w panel won't give you 20w. Also they sell a lot of bad quality products but even if you pay the high price you won't get 20w, that's for sure. how difficult to get green energy to save the earth besides saving money too. This means this is not recommended if we buy a set directly?, or should be purchased separately?.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on June 30, 2023, 11:55:51 PMThis also ensures the storage batteries don't completely drain out, as it takes time to recharge back to full potential.if not possible, I might running node at noon where the sun shines brightly without using the battery. But it's risk when rain coming, so that it can cut off the power supply",

(sunny weather)Not to mention, it usually drops extremely low if it's too cloudy, you'll likely get 1W on cloudy weather.BTW, I installed them two years ago for a \"test\" and still working today (BOSCA Brand).Battery: You can only safely drain that kind of \"SLA battery\" down to 50% or it'll end up broken within months.It's based from self-experience since I've once busted a 100Ah SLA battery in just 4months by directly connecting 2pc 12v LED lights that are running about 18hrs/day(even until the voltage drops below 11.6v)Your very small battery can only provide you 3.5Ah x 12v which is about 42Wh of stored power (more if you'll push it to 30%).So after \"daylight\", you'll only have 42Wh before your battery drain down to critical levels.Overall, If you want to solar power your RPi node, buy at least 120W solar panel, MPPT solar charger controller and bigger LiFePO4 battery enough to run the load when there's no sunlight.Because it's not just the output of the panels but also the capacity of the battery and the panel's capability to top it up while being used/bad weather.",

Your average laptop should use 60W or less when running CPU intensive task.He probably meant it for charging, a 30-150W range would be normal nowadays for charging a laptop despite probably the large chunk of it being in the 30-45W. But for running a node, you won't be needed a gaming laptop so the actual power draw on law tasks is well below 20W, I have still my old Thinkpad and the last time I tested it it was at 10-15W with a node and a VPN server running.Quote from: nc50lc on July 02, 2023, 11:08:32 AMOverall, If you want to solar power your RPi node, buy at least 120W solar panel, MPPT solar charger controller and bigger LiFePO4 battery enough to run the load when there's no sunlight.And when the cost start adding up and he needs that upfront he will realize that not only it's far better to run it on the grid but also, it's better to let others do it. Despite all these barriers when it comes to a simple piece of equipment that still needs 24/7 there are still some who think mining with 3kw gear is still economically feasible with huge government grants. Some need a slap down to eath and reality more often.Quote from: Jet Cash on July 02, 2023, 10:17:21 AMMy problem with running a node as a digital nomad is not the electricity, but the internet connection.
