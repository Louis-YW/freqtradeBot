  "content": "There are several telegram channels/groups that act as arbitrage channels; when I first saw the advertisement, I assumed it was legitimate since I saw Binance exchange, which is well-known as a trustworthy exchange, and then there's Bnax exchange.Here's a link to how it looks with different group names.https://i.imgur.com/HJXYabM.jpg\\shttps://i.imgur.com/jqfqpjM.jpg\\shttps://i.imgur.com/xNCLyye.jpgüîÅBinance.com buy - 30061.12 üîÅBnax.nl sell - 32466.00 Profit per btc traded - 2404.88 Profit % - 8.00To profit, you will purchase from Binance and sell in bnax.Then I test it out with a small quantity to see whether it's genuine. I bought BTC from Binance, transferred it to Bnax, sold it for USDT, and then transferred it back to Binance. This was my first successful transaction, and I made a profit. I was so pleased with the return that I decided to invest all of my money in order to make a large profit, but I was unable to withdraw both my profit and my cash from the exchange this time. They require that I reach their institutional level, which requires a sum of $25,000. This is how I was scammed and lost my money.My recommendation to newbies is to not believe everything they see on Telegram, especially when it comes to free money.",

But if op is claiming that the first trade is successful then the scammer risk some of its fund to get a huge caught, or just like how ponzi works.Although, this seems a new thing but when it comes to telegram, people should be wary from people making noise and claim a too good to be true offers there, or even in any kind of platform to avoid such thing. Imagine it's a $25k, that's a huge amount sending to a random exchange with good offers.",

Nothing else but greed. Immediately you saw the chance of making a whole lot of profit of over $2.8k in one trade by a simple back and forth movement, you had to try and exploit the system and I'm sure should it have gone well, you would have continued with the back and forth trading and accumulate even more. That alone should be a warning to you that something is up with this platform. With price being different from other exchanges on the crypto space and nt slightly but a significant amount at that, its a flag up. Unfortunately, you had to find out the hard way, always know that there are no too good opportunities in the crypto space.Meanwhile in bitcointalkforum, we try to do things orderly. Your post might be targeted to warn the newbies amongst other beginner categories but still, its best you move this thread to the scam accusation board as have been directed by Examplens.",
