  "content": "Alik BakhshiRussians and their two eternal questions      Everything has a cause and what happens is the effect of that cause. Different peoples are responsible for human civilization, differing in mentality, which is inalienable from the people and responsible for its fate, in other words, it explains its past, present and predetermines the future. I devoted more detail to this issue in the article “People's Fate, or Each Cricket Has Its Own Hearth” (1).    It just so happened that in the minds of the Russian people, incapable of self-organization, there are two eternal questions “What to do?” and “Who is to blame?”. Among the Slavs living in Eastern Europe, the answer to the first question was found in the invitation of the Varangian Rurik (translated as \"falcon\"), originally from the Scandinavian tribe Rusa. Hence the name of the country he organized, Rus, with a population in the status of serfs of Russian princes, that is, Russians. This explains the fact why the name of the Russian people uses an adjective, in contrast to the names of all other peoples.      The question of what to do after the Rurik dynasty was dealt with by the Romanov dynasty - the Germans who converted to Orthodoxy. After the revolution of 1917, which was staged by the Bolsheviks of Jewish nationality, the question of what to do was entrusted to the Georgians Stalin (2), and he solved it so successfully that the state of the USSR he created automatically existed for another 40 years after his death, until the Russians ruling the country destroyed it creation. As a result of the ensuing turmoil, the power in the country, due to the fatal mistake of the Jewish oligarchs (3), ended up in the hands of a criminal group led by the St. Petersburg gangster Putin, who, as it turned out later, was a Nazi who found the answer to the question of what to do in protecting the Russian world in neighboring countries formed after the collapse of the Soviet empire. However, the bandit and his accomplices robbed the country so much that there were not enough funds for the plan to restore the empire, conceived by the revanchist Putin. During the year of active hostilities, the resource for waging war with Ukraine was exhausted. Putin found the answer to the question of what to do in the partial emptying of the wallets of the members of the gang of criminals he had created, which naturally did not delight them. ). With an army of mercenaries, mostly recruited from among the prisoners, Prigozhin captured Rostov without a fight, the population of which not only did not resist, but even welcomed such a bold step, after which he went on a military campaign against Moscow, which he called the \"march of justice.\" Having shot down an airplane and three helicopters along the way, Prigozhin, being at a distance of 250 km. from the capital, turned back, apparently realizing that he did not have enough strength to hold out if he captured the Kremlin. It is quite possible that Prigogine did not have a plan for the future, everything happened so unexpectedly. By the way, I have no doubt that Muscovites, like Rostovites, would hardly have resisted Prigozhin's bandits.    Putin's reaction to the act of his friend is interesting, at the beginning he threatens to deal harshly with the rebels, however, everything ends in a peaceful outcome. (5) But the reaction of the Russian people to the showdown between the two bandits is even more interesting - it is no! For thirty years, the Kremlin dictator has so lowered the people to the level of the most real cattle, which everything that happens silently and indifferently takes for granted, however, this is traditional for the Russian people. The showdown between the bandits of Putin's group will certainly lead to chaos and the cessation of the functioning of Russia as an empire.     Here we come to the question of who is to blame? And guilty as always, I hope you have already guessed ... . The fate of the propagandists, who are not entirely of Russian nationality, who, for the sake of bribe, set the fraternal peoples against each other for days on end, is not enviable. In short, everything will happen according to Pushkin and will result in a “senseless and merciless” rebellion (6), with indispensable pogroms and the crucifixion of the perpetrators by an angry mob at the gates of the Kremlin. It is unlikely that Putin will be able to end up in The Hague.      This time, the empire will not survive the shock and will finally disintegrate into dozens of states. The metropolis itself will return within its original borders, that is, Muscovy, whose people will remain with two unchanged questions: what to do? and who is to blame? Maybe then the Russian people themselves will find the answers to these questions.  This is how I see what is happening in Russia and its future in a nutshell. More details in the links provided. 1.
