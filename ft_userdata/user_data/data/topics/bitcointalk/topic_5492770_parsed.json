  "content": "While we are quite approaching the Bitcoin dip against the halving, lot of Investors are already muscled up to dive in accumulating more to their Bitcoin holdings and those who had held the high cost of Bitcoin values as excuse is also being attracted to Invest without cost excuses anymore.Meanwhile... Due to the high rate of transactions fees, I can perceive it that lot of short term Investors would tend to have their assets stored in a Centralized blockchain for easy transactions in other to minimize transaction charges because they believe once they hits probably at the upcoming bull-run they would sell off their assets without holding for a long term.They would actually ignore the fact that it is not about how long your assets stays in a particular blockchain that can get it comprised but base on how unlucky the investors can be despites how conscious they can be with their seed phrases.So if you must be amongst of those with such mentality, I hope you get to be aware of how risky the system of storing your assets in a centralized network system could be because some investors whom had lost their assets stored in the exchange mostly wonders how come can it be possible to lost their funds when the assets has not stayed for too long there in the centralized platform.Conclusion: Don't assume to scale through the high cost of transaction fees and get your funds get risked on the centralized exchange platforms.",

Most of the bitcoin holders purchased Bitcoin using their life savings or other money with different purposes rather than investments. Because people will surely neglect the risk of holding assets on exchange if they will suffer more losses when still holding it during correction.",

Bitcoin's about security, owning your own money, true power. And with the way its designed, getting scarcer every day, folks who missed out will be kicking themselves later. Dont get sidetracked by the easy stuff now. Hold those coins, play the long game. This is about building something smarter, safer, something that lasts.",

Who do care most about transaction fee?Traders on DEX, gamblers and gamers with NFTs, GameFi, Metaverse and similar.A person can move between chains but to store their assets, they will choose best ones, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, not shit coins.

Let me take bitcoin as an example there is nothing like a centralized blockchain. We have only one blockchain for bitcoin storage and all bitcoin in circulation are on that blockchain. Be it a centralized exchange or non custodial wallet the blockchain holds your bitcoin. On that blockchain, you can only move out your bitcoin only with the key. The only difference between custodial storage and non custodial storage is that you are not given the keys (private key or seed phrase) when you stored bitcoin on centralized exchange addresses, so when the exchange goes down your bitcoin goes with it, if to say there you’re given the private key then you will have access to also send out from the address not through the exchange. So the blockchain is same and there is no such thing as centralized blockchain but rather a custodial and non custodial wallet",

For example at a time like this where we have had a big dip and there is a day left to halving, it is a good idea for a short term day trader to sell and wait for a better opportunity to buy back in. Centralized stable-shit-coins are a risky but a good tool to use in this process. As they say \"invest what you can afford to lose\". So as long as you know you can lose your money and how, I'd say it is fine to use them.As for the price, a quick look at the history shows this exact trend repeating in each halving:1. big rise in weeks leading to halving2. big drop as we get close to the halving3. sideways market during halving and right after it4. massive rise months after the halvingWe are in step 2 right now...",

And this is the wrong mentally, we have heard horror stories of people accounts getting hack from exchanges, and we don't want to be the next victim as we approach the halving.
