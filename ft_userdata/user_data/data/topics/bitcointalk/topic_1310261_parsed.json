Is it safe???Also, will this data work on it or will I need to delete the previous version with all the blocks downloaded and need to start from scratch???",

There are many factors that could impact performance on the torrent; seed/peer ratio, ISP torrent throttling..etc. Right now though there are very few peers, if any so you should get very good speeds. This torrent was also designed for people who were having trouble with the wallet while syncing, (database errors forcing the user to constantly reindex, this can happen from OS crashes or abrupt termination of the bitcoin process). With torrents the file will never get corrupt.The blockchain data is also compressed by about 30%, so you download 30% less data than if your were using the client.",

And if anyone wants to document the speeds they are getting and comparing it to their bitcoin-qt/d download speed in this thread, I would appreciate it.",

If you created a portable Bitcoin qt wallet in your c drive, then 7zipped the whole folder it might be faster to sync because it would already be indexed up to the block you synced it to before 7zipping it.You can make Bitcoin qt portable by creating a shortcut to bitcoin-qt.exe before syncing, opening the shortcut's properties, then clicking the shortcut tab, then changing the target field fromC:\\bitcoin-0.10.2\\bin\\bitcoin-qt.exeto thisC:\\bitcoin-0.10.2\\bin\\bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=.Adding the  -datadir=. makes qt put the blocks and chainstate folders in the same folder as bitcoin-qt.exe, instead of in appdata.
