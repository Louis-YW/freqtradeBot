  "content": "I looked at a lot of angles from economics, to market cyclicality, bitcoin halving, and looked at many occult aspects and many KOLs in the market.2024 - Fed stops raising or lowering interest rates - US election - Economy is forced to be positive to gain confidence in the president and ruling party - good news and new cash flows cause speculative investment markets to grow and react First reaction - if other markets only recover, not make new highs, then with its small cap, crypto is easy to outperform other markets.However, cash flow can hardly stay in speculative investment channels for a long time because the purpose after the recession and inflation is to rebuild the economy with the main goal of production and business, so the cash flow will flow out of the country. speculative channels in 2025 when the US has a president, the policies will direct the cash flow into production and business.It is not until the middle of the economic cycle when economists create a surplus of assets, then they will bring that lump into the speculative investment markets, then the cash flow in the market can be kept for a long time. is the 2028-2029 upchen period of which will last more than 2 years.Saying that to make it easy for you to understand why it is not 2013 or 2021 but 2017 is the most explosive crypto year and most altcoins are x1000 times, as well as the up process of that period is very long, from the end of 2015 to the end of 2017. , many crypto billionaires are also built up to now at that stage.So in the period of 2025-2027, don't be shocked if many policies are oppressive to crypto, just the house giving away some pawns as the KOL of the market for the purpose of resetting the game and collecting the goods after distribution.The nature of the falling point at the right time is very important, why do players need to calculate the drop in performance, why when doing an important thing, it is necessary to build psychology, so investing at the wrong time is going against the trend. Going against the trend means setting wrong expectations, leading to losses even if you are good investor.",
