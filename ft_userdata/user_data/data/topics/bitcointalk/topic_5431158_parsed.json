Whether we like it or not , projects are still dying on this bear market, however under these circumstances there are projects with a bulletproof roadmap and active communities that are taking action each month. One of those is Thorstarter community, recently they did a massive burn on their token [100M]Â  and placed their tokens into the top 10 profitable ones this week. They are also doing new partnerships with projects that are going to expand their regions in 2023 from Latin America to the rest of the West. Do you know about any other projects that are being this active during the Holidays?",
