  "content": "Hello,I'm looking for the best way to meet Bitcoiners with creative skills who may be interested in collaborating on a project I've started.I'm writing/producing \"Bitcoin Worship Jazz\" songs (not exactly sure why I started doing that!) and am hoping to team up with either other musicians, or even someone who can help bring the project to life visually (e.g. animators, script writers, meme creators etc).To see an example of what I'm talking about please see https://soundcloud.com/satoshissongbookI only have a pretty vague idea of the direction I want to go in but think it could turn into a really fun project if I found the right people to team up with to help develop the idea and gain some exposure.Â  Kinda an odd niche though so I'm bit lost on where to look - thanks for any thoughts!",
