Your answer will be \" sportsbook abuse \" like a lot of players who won on your sportsbook after they get flagged by your sports vetting provider as a winners instead of limit the betting to them like Stake or other reputable gambling sites you ban them and steal the ðŸ’° money",

If this is the case, there's nothing Rollbit can do but to wait for the conducted analysis to be completed [by the game provider, not by Rollbit] and when they give a go, your fund got processed.As this matter is solved, you might want to lock this thread and marked it as solved by editing the thread title and add the \"solved\" word. The button to lock a thread is at the bottom left of the page.",

This is rollbit announcement thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5326640.msg56653011#msg56653011If you follow them and read what people are posting there, you will have better idea too.

Do not violate the rules if the gambling sites and I do not think you have any problem if you do not violate any rule of the gambling site.I too will advice you to lock this thread when the problem as been solved.You can also change your topic tile to something like this: [solved] I cant withdraw my funds (1200$) on Rollbit.com",
