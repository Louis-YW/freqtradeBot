You are not asking for trading but rather a hyip or ponzi scam that promise huge return.Binance is the best but they are not the one dictating the coin pump but rather the trader who's buying the hype.",

Exchanges are platform that you can access to trade coins that they have listed. So you have your choice to choose what variety to trade from there in the exchange.

Don’t trade with the shitcoins just to have this profit, again its not guaranteed and its risky. The real pump will happen in time, but not in short term so expect a more pump and dump trend before we finally reach the peak again.",

Binance dont give us enough pumps You're likely going to get scammed as well if you're only thinking about getting 300%-1000% profits and pumps.I assure you that the daily income you're looking for via pump and dump schemes a.k.a Shitcoins may end up taking from you the little money you've gotI advice you calm down and be patient in this industry if you want to be profitable, for it's not a get rich quick business and do wise investment rather you might end up going bankruptcy as result of that.Quote from: 325btc on July 20, 2022, 04:44:50 PMAny better exchanger then binamce ?

As others have pointed out, this kind of pump just happen to shitcoin and meme coins in the altcoin market and not bitcoin.So you relying solely on crypto for your daily income? hmm? I don't think that is the way to go mate. Yeah, probably it's hard to get a job now, but being in crypto 24x7 to bring food in the table might be stressful, just saying.",

I remember there rarely was a coin that did 100% and this was in a very strong bull market.Only people that made 1000% gains were those that probably invested tons in Defi projects and had a good runner here and there while being rugged on some projects. Then there are those who made tons of NFTs. Or those that used Defi platforms and got 5 figures worth of airdrops. These days are long gone now…",

Now taking of Binance yes they are trying their best to secure users funds, binance don't just pump and dump tokens or coins for the matter of fact, there are some specific trading volume and value token should have before listing in their exchange.",

For this?Binance dont give us enough pumpsReal pumps only occur when the real bull run comes so please be patient as it can take a long time for it to occur judging the current movements of crypto this year. Btc and eth are indeed a good coin for long term investing but if your goal is to make money daily then you can try trading these coins.See if it works well, if not then you can also add up some altcoins because I think lighter altcoins are more suitable for trading as they can fluctuate more but I cant only promise that you can earn 300 to 1k percent of profits as that seems crazy already. Even the shittiest coin cant give a return like that every single day. You need to wake up mate.",
