  "content": "Fatherhood is extremely important to children's growth in terms of personality and mentality. A lot of us don't realize or admit that we are deeply influenced by our fathers. I, personally, don't really get along with my father. I am not gonna say that he is alcoholic but really a heavy drinker. He is ill-tempered and loses his mind after drinking. I \"hated\" him when I was young for his wrongdoings and even to this day, as I am married with a kid, I still don't know how to get along with him. All the aweful experiences have a significant impact on my growth which I hardly get rid of. How is your relationship with your father ? How has that affected you ? Look forward to your sharing.",

Blood and emotional connections between parents and children are inseparable. We have to live with a lot of things and be patient. Thank you very much for your soothing words.Quote from: Ucy on December 15, 2022, 09:42:19 AMI later realized mine respected me a lot while I was growing up.

You and your siblings are blessed to do what you want without financial restrains. It is a privilege that not many people in the world have. Please use it wisely and enjoy your life.Quote from: mich on December 17, 2022, 07:21:06 AMWell I never did meet him my father because he left my home when I was a few months old.

I guess we just have to take whatever comes across in life and be good. I forgot in which book I read about this message many years ago: every great man needs either a great father or no father.  You've made possibilities. Don't give up man!",

You are indeed blessed to have a father as your role model. Your man earns my respect as well. I have an enormous level of sympathy for you as my Grandpa taught me and loved me so much when I was young and when he died, part of me was gone too. Even to this day, I still miss him.",
