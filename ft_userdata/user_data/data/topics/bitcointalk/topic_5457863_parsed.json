I last used Kucoin, probably in 2019/2020 when I discovered that my jurisdiction was one of those that was restricted by them, something other popular crypto exchanges don't do. So I thought to myself that It was dangerous to deposit money in a platform that has their terms of service clear about restricted jurisdictions even when KYC verification was still relaxedThey have a long list of restricted countries, I am pretty sure their trading volumes are going to dwindle in the coming days.",

According to the news, old users will not be able to deposit, but they will still be able to do some things: QuoteKuCoin’s existing users will still be able to use services like spot trading sell orders, futures trading deleveraging and margin trading deleveraging. Other available services for existing non-KYC users include redemptions at KuCoin’s staking and lending hub, KuCoin Earn, as well as exchange-traded funds’ redemption.But all these no-KYC centralized exchanges will have no option later than to make their users submit KYC documents.",

Beside Coinex and OKX, there are few more exchanges that don't ask for KYC like Bitget, Mexc, Ascendex etc but its just a matter of time before they do the same as Kucoin and many other exchanges before them.",

Bummer, right? Kucoin was like the go-to spot to trade those less-known tokens without dealing with DEXs. I mean, it is always a hassle having to verify your identity and all that shit, not to mention the potential privacy concerns it raises.",

There is no lawsuit forcing Kucoin to make kyc mandatory, but as a centralized exchange if they want to be accepted in more countries and jurisdictions they have to make kyc mandatory, just as their CEO said:QuoteLyu also stressed that KuCoin set their KYC policy to comply with regulations in applicable jurisdictions since there isn’t a unified global KYC regulation.After this announcement of compliance, Kucoin will spread to some Jurisdictions where they couldn't operate before because of their previous lack of compliance to KYC regulations. The only way to trade without kyc is by using true p2p exchanges, even if centralized exchanges don't collect data now, they surely will in the long term and they may not give you the option to withdraw without submitting your data first.",

Or if they can withdraw what's still in their accounts, they might still find it useful to trade on Kucoin since they do have a ton of altcoins and good liquidity as well.I'm not exactly saddened by this news, since I haven't used Kucoin in a while and have always found their UI to be annoying, but part of me is disappointed that another exchange is being forced to go the KYC route.  I knew it would happen sooner or later with them, and I know the whole landscape for exchanges is going to be completely different within a few years, but still.  This is how the spirit of bitcoin/crypto gets broken, by government's influence on the exchanges through which people can acquire it.  Here's hoping that at least a few non-KYC exchanges remain in the next year, even if they're some of the smaller ones.  We're exiting the wild west days, my peeps.",

KuCoin isn't like AgoraDesk, for example. KYC has already been there as part of KuCoin's ToS long before this announcement. That it offered a certain limit to unverified users didn't make it a non-KYC exchange. I was a KuCoin user because of that feature until I was asked to submit KYC last year.",
