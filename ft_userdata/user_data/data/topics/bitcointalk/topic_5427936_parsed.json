After COVID the last thing they need is their health service getting clogged up by people with itchy bits   Smart move by the government & hopefully the young people they are targeting decide to play safe & look after themselves.",

Handing out free condoms can certainly prevent the spread of STIs and even in some cases deadlier deceases. I can only assume, how significantly healthier young adults in third-world countries would be if there were a system implemented a law like this. This also can bring down unwanted births and youth poverty. One has to understand that this should not be taken advantage of. There should be just safe sex practices subjects in school to make it know and understand SAFE SEX.",
