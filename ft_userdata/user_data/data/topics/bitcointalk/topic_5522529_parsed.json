  "content": "This was how I lost respect for someone I had always thought very highly of, we are both into Bitcoin investment so he knows what Bitcoin is all about until he told his followers that the idea behind buying and selling of Bitcoin is even a scam one makes me sick, he said buying and selling on others makes it a scam idea. I am highly disappointed because few other people believed this too, is the idea behind buying and selling a scam one? We went down into battle and I told him this. 1. If anyone feels that those who bought bitcoin very cheap are just waiting to sell on those who buys now they shouldn't buy, there is no one forcing them to. 2. The wrongful Idea to him is general, who dares buy a land for $200 and sell in few years for $210 got so that it won't look scammy? 3. I used Black rock and other big buyers today as examples too, they were never here when Bitcoin was at $100 per coin, why didn't they feel scammed buying at high price? Or why didn't they feel like they were just making early buyers richer? There are too many nonsense online out there, poisoning the mind of other people towards Bitcoin and the crazy part is, some people are on this forum right now and they still don't understand a thing about Bitcoin, they are surely here for a reason, I guess that is the gold rush part only, they lack the reasons why Bitcoin is highly valuable today.",

If anyone feels that those who bought bitcoin very cheap are just waiting to sell on those who buys now they shouldn't buy, there is no one forcing them to. They must understand basics.Buyers want to buy low, sell high for profit.Sellers want to sell for profit with their lower entries.At the same price, in the same market, there are buyers who buy bitcoin from sellers, and let's see what they think with their actions. Sellers feel enough with profit and sell, except if they don't have profit but don't have money and emergency forces them to sell, even with loss.Buyers who buy bitcoins from sellers, because they believe that they are buying cheap and price will rise more after their entry.It's fair mutual deal between seller and buyer.Quote2. The wrongful Idea to him is general, who dares buy a land for $200 and sell in few years for $210 got so that it won't look scammy?Investment is risky, sometimes is good and sometimes is bad, but if you have profit, is it deserved to be called as scam?If you think like this, Gold can be considered as scam by Bitcoin investors especially Bitcoin maximalists.See ROIs of gold and Bitcoin. In ROI comparison, Gold looks very scammy.https://casebitcoin.com/",

This process works the same everywhere on other kind of investment, with the first movers usually getting the best returns, it doesn't make Bitcoin a scam. Large institutional investors like BlackRock have put more than billion into Bitcoin via ETFs. Even though Bitcoin community doesn't need affirmation from those big companies, but by integrating it into their portfolios, they have somewhat legitimized it.Dismissing trading in Bitcoin also ignores its growing global adoption as an alternative to traditional fiat systems. Skeptics might choose not to invest, but when they labeling Bitcoin as a scam, those skeptics ignore the fact of how bitcoin has growing role in diversifying investments and driving financial innovation worldwide.",

We all have different perspectives about bitcoin, but for sure share the same intention, to gain significant profits after some time. However, there are actually these kind of people whom even if they have received or exposed into various bitcoin learnings, at the end of the day, they still stick to their first impression on bitcoin. That bitcoin has still high chances to end up as a scam, even though the forum itself is full of solid proofs and evidences that bitcoin is legit and is valuable, and would even become more significant and valuable in the future years to come.",

People with their own different understanding but it won't change anything about bitcoin,  those who don't have clear understanding about bitcoin understand what they know because they choose not to do research to know bitcoin well. The lack of understanding of which people have toward bitcoin won't make people who are interested in it to lose interest. It is normal people choose to be ignorant for a while but I'm sure after sometime they will learn to get the real understanding.I think they found it very difficult to understand the volatility of bitcoin and it is so unfortunate it is so difficult for them to make research to understand better about bitcoin.",
