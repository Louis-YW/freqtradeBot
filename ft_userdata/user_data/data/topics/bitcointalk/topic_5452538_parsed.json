  "content": "QuoteA hard fork refers to a radical change to the protocol of a blockchain network that effectively results in two branches, one that follows the previous protocol and one that follows the new version.In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will be granted tokens in the new fork as well, but miners must choose which blockchain to continue verifying.A hard fork can occur in any blockchain, and not only Bitcoin (where hard forks have created Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others, for example).QuoteReasons For a Hard Fork?There are a number of reasons why developers may implement a hard fork, such as correcting important security risks found in older versions of the software, to add new functionality, or to reverse transactions—such as when the Ethereum blockchain created a hard fork to reverse the hack on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).After the hack, the Ethereum community almost unanimously voted in favor of a hard fork to roll back transactions that siphoned off tens of millions of dollars worth of digital currency by an anonymous hacker. The hard fork also helped DAO token holders get their ether (ETH) funds returned.The proposal for a hard fork did not exactly unwind the network’s transaction history. Rather, it relocated the funds tied to the DAO to a newly created smart contract with the single purpose of letting the original owners withdraw their funds.  QuoteHow Forks WorkA fork in a blockchain can occur in any crypto-technology platform—not only Bitcoin. That is because blockchains and cryptocurrency work in basically the same way no matter which crypto platform they're on. You may think of the blocks in blockchains as cryptographic keys that move memory. Because the miners in a blockchain set the rules that move the memory in the network, these miners understand the new rules.However, all of the miners need to agree about the new rules and about what comprises a valid block in the chain. So when you want to change those rules you need to \"fork it\"—like a fork in a road—to indicate that there's been a change in or a diversion to the protocol. The developers can then update all of the software to reflect the new rules.This forking process that I have brought to your awareness is what has lead to that various digital currencies with names similar to bitcoin, which have come to be. Examples include the bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and others. As a newbie willing to invest in cryptocurrency, it is quite difficult to tell the difference between these cryptocurrencies and to be able to distinguish the various forks on a timeline. It is therefore essential to  do research on the history of the most important bitcoin hard forks of the past several years, unless one has a broker of course.  Otherwise it would be a waste of time and money to invest in the wrong digital currency.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp",

The successful fork is the one that has majority support from developers and community.How many Bitcoin forks are there?Many scam altcoins tried to use fork term to mislead investors and steal investor money.The only forks that had a consensus maybe up to today are some of the soft forks, like SEGWIT improvements. As for hard forks they either ended not improving or solving the problem they were created for or end up been another dead coins like the Alticoins. The most popular ones are the bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond. Most of these fork’s poses vulnerabilities and that is why the number of its users are not increasing till date. Bitcoin cash could couldn’t solve the problem of increasing the block size because it wouldn’t not be so secure as bitcoin itself and this also lead to its own forking. As for bitcoin gold trying to make mining easier it was/is been tipped to be faced by a 51% attack. The bitcoin diamond looking to increase the transaction speed and thereby increasing the supply will only by 10times the total supply of bitcoin will only make it look like those Altcoins with large supply. Bitcoin supply limit at 21 million is the reason it is cherished today. So most of the hard forks ended up not solving the problems they were created for.",

Go into some good research, upon all the new features and speed that those fork coins brings they are never successful for long, fork coins are good example of projects that I can never advice anyone to invest their money into.",
