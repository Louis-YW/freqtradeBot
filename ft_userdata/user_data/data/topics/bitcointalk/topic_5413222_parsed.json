As you're new, you need to send the money first and receive bitcoin. For now transaction fee itself cost you much as you're planning to buy $10 or $20. Find the trusted trader and make the trade. This is the simplest way than doing sign-ups to buy bitcoin.",

      "body": "Payoneer is a payment method that isn't widely accepted on most Bitcoin platforms, and it is almost impossible to use the Payoneer card to buy bitcoin on crypto-fiat exchanges. One of the fastest and easiest ways to get started is to buy bitcoin with a credit card or debit card. Most Bitcoin exchanges and brokers accept these methods. However, if Payoneer is your only option, you can use it on certain peer-to-peer platforms, for example LocalBitcoins or Paxful.",

I think it's better for you to exchange it for fiat money first to make it easier for you, after that you look for a cryptocurrency exchange that is already widely available for you to buy Bitcoin, so maybe you will be safe in buying Bitcoin.",

Use BestChange!  . This exchanger aggregator offers different crypto payment methods, including payoneer. You will need to choose a suitable exchanger from the proposed list: cheap (look at the best exchange rate) and safe (look at the maximum number of reviews). That's just about $10-$20, I have doubts and usually the minimum amount for the exchange is more, but it's better for you to check it out and see for yourself. Suddenly someone exchange a similar amount. Look for detailed information on the link above or on their official website (Hint: the link in my signature goes there).",

You can transfer your funds directly to his account and receive bitcoin in return. Of course, this approach, in case you don't use escrow services, requires trust and implies high counterparty risk, but this way, you would save on fees and your time. Ask your friends or relatives, it may be some of them don't mind making such a deal with you. Also check this FAQ: https://payoneer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/20818/~/how-to-pay-a-payoneer-user Another way to buy bitcoin relatively anonymously using your Payoneer account would be indirect exchange. Indirect exchange is when you buy some goods with the money you have and then sell those goods for the money you need. For example, you could sell a bitcoin book to a bitcoiner willing to know more about their subject of interest. You will be surprised by how many bitcoiners there are in your local area waiting for someone willing to make trades in bitcoin.",

But since you mentioned safest, I would recommend what examplens recommended. If listed on Best_Change, it is safe to use. Maybe he would bring a feedback. NOTE to OP,  it is nice to search for the safest means of buying bitcoin but I don't think it is nice to search for the cheapest means. I don't even understand what you mean by cheapest means. Bitcoin price is same on every exchange, maybe with infinitesimal difference. What you are asking for should be service fee. But if you are truly in search of the cheapest way to buy bitcoin, some scamers may lure you in and get rid of your money. So be guided and avoid cheap things if possible.",

It's will be very difficult to use the funds in payoneer account to buy bitcoins, unless the option of buying Bitcoin with the account is listed. The best thing to do since the funds in payoneer account can be easily converted to fiat currency using payoneer through bank. I will advice to convert with bank and use Bank card to buy bitcoin instead of having more issues or delay in buying bitcoins with the funds in your payoneer account.Quote from: david678345 on September 11, 2022, 10:38:07 PMAnd what is the minimum amount to buy...I would prefer to buy just 10$ or 20$ for now.With the least of $10 you can buy bitcoins but the depends on the exchange or the platform you are buying bitcoin, like some years ago someone can buy bitcoins with $10 but currently i have not buy with such value, but i know that with $20  you can buy Bitcoin.",
