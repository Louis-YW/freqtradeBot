But still based on luck though, but for me or at least the last two sessions that I go gamble on a traditional base casino, it was like a savior for me as I was only a standing bettor, but it just so happen that when I bet I got the pairs, which is x11. And then I go on the next table, hit another, and then another. I was very happy that night, as I have recoup my losses and then win some.But I know that it's not always been the case, but I will try to go and bet on the side if ever I will go and gamble again.",

      "body": "Well I think op should not conclude that side bet has more potential for winning both for in house game or soccer bets, I believe they are all coincidence or circumstantial. Side betting is also luck so if I win betting from that I just know it happened that way probably because it was my luck that shifted to that and not that the standard game is any less, in fact side bet in blackjack from my research has more failure rate than standard game.QuoteAs a general guideline, side bets in blackjack have high house edges and should be avoided. But if you insist on trying your luck, at least stick to the side bets that have the lowest house edge.https://www.888casino.com/blog/blackjack-strategy-guide/blackjack-side-bets#:~:text=As%20a%20general%20guideline%2C%20side,can%20give%20you%20an%20edge.",

      "body": "I've only tried the insurance bets on Blackjack and luckily I chose right most of the time but I have never tried the other types of side bets as I think they are too risky and on my journey to playing it those side bet requirements do not commonly come out. Sure, the payout is better but counting how many bets will it take before you are to hit the supposed cards may be higher than what you will win. It's just like cutting the number of lines in slots, in my case in Tome of Life I would pick only 3 liners and before I could hit a win, a big one, it would take 100-200 rounds with mostly losses before it comes out. Too risky, and this is not for gamblers who want the \"win now\" bets because it might take time before those side bets will hit which means spending a lot for a higher multi-win. It needs deep pockets.",

Side bet is also very risky.Perfect Pairs and 21+3 are my favorites in Blackjack while Player and Banker Bonus on Baccarat. I usually toss a minimum bet of 1$ in there in every bet that I made. I just become interested on this since I so some players that bet on side bet more than their main bet. Like 5$ on main bet while 10$ on both side bet. They win huge amount once they hit a good side bet and immediately leave.This makes me curious if this kind of side bet is worthy pursuing rather than playing on the main bet alone. But I never try that one because it’s too high risk.",

Changes are slightly against the gambler and more if you are chasing the jackpot, but those changes very much exist and they are not like a lottery bad.",

      "body": "Usually, the probability of those side bets actually hitting is very low because the conditions that must be met don't come very often and that is the reason why they offer high multipliers on them, so if you are using $1 on the side bet and the outcome is x50 if you hit it, but it takes more than that for it to actually hit at least once then I don't think it's profitable at all. Besides, casinos don't offer things that will actually give the players an advantage, they offer everything that will lure you into placing and losing more money.It basically all boils down to the luck of the gambler since gambling is a luck-based thing. If you are lucky, you might even win the side bet within the first few constant bets that you make, but if you are not lucky at that particular time, you might end up spending a lot of money on it and still don't get anything.",

It is a very rare event which happens when you least expect it and when it happens, the prize is never big enough because you wagered small money. Doing side bets will also distract you from the main event where you wager serious money and the more distracted you get, the more money you will lose. If you can’t make money from your big bets, that’s the problem you should fix first. You shouldn’t even think about making side bets at this point. If you are able to make successful bets maybe only then you should do these mini bets.
