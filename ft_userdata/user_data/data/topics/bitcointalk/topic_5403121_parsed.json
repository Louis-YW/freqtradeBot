I think this league is really intresting and its a good thing that it is played in the summer while we wait for bigger leagues. Also there are a lot of good teams especially Bodo glimt that improved a lot in the past years",

      "body": "Bodø/Glimt didn't start the season well this time, they were pretty good last two seasons. Lillestrøm is leading as undefeated now. Molde is after them. Rosenborg is another team that started the season badly. What I like about the Norwegian league is the high level of competition. You don't see a single team come forward. There are many candidates for the championship. Previously, Rosenborg was a permanent champion alone, but this changed. They haven't won the league in the last three seasons. Molde won first, then Bodø/Glimt made twice in a row. When the matches are full of goals, they are exciting, but we have to say that the general quality is very low compared to other big European leagues.",

      "body": "It seems lillestrom are taking the lead in the beginning but let's see how they continue if they can still impress the fans. Since the  start of this season, they have been able to maintain a stellar record, beating Sandjerford, valenragra and the others but lost to Ham Kam.  It's going to a tough season as the competition is quite tight and molde look to be trailing behind with 25 points as against lillestrom 27. Today's game will determine if they still get to remain at the top or they will forfeit.",

Also there are a lot of good teams especially Bodo glimt that improved a lot in the past yearsI actually don't follow to everything that happens in the Norwegian football competition, maybe it's not just me but some of us are not too familiar with the Norwegian league, my only curiosity about the Norwegian league was when Bodo/Glimt managed to beat As Roma in group stage and also the round of 8 conference league rounds this season and I search on google where the Bodo/Glimt club came from at that time, their performance in the conference league was really quite impressive, especially when they managed to beat the team coached by mourinho with a pretty big score at that time.",
