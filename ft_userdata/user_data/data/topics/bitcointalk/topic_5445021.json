That's anticipated every bull run. Network congestion is the main reason why the fees for sending are increasing. It's way even higher on 2017 for bitcoin paying a cup of coffee during that time. And IIRC, last 2021 was also quite high for ethereum transactions to make. But what's good with these altcoins, they've got other support on other chains like for USDT which has its ERC20 (eth network), it's got other networks too like in TRC20 although it can't also skip that part because suddenly the fee for transactions being done there have increased too. This problem IMO is gonna be dealt by most projects if there's a traffic and surge on its demand for transfers and transactions through its networks.",

Due to the high price of ETH, its fees are much higher compared to dollars.  Gas fees were very low in a dip market but it is not unusual for them to rise again in a bull market.  But to avoid this gas fee, you have to hold tokens in cex, but it is also very risky, so in bull market, small investors avoid eth network and focus more on bsc, trx, polygon. So you also need to use another chain instead of eth to avoid high gas fees.",

You can now go for Solana and Avalanche based projects, they provide high scalability and you can always keep up with high transacting speeds and good portfolio. Those projects are being made because of the same issue that you are accruing all the time. I only have one problem with the idea of investing only in alts. Having bitcoin in the portfolio can safeguard some investment on the way.",

Yeah, the fees for smart contract transactions like token swapping and NFT buying/listing can be even higher than simple token transfer. I agree with what @disconnectme said - lately I've been using L2 chains like Arbitrum for my on-chain activity. It has lower fees and faster confirmation times compared to Ethereum, so it's definitely worth considering if you're getting frustrated with the high fees.Out of curiosity, what kind of transactions are you mostly doing on Ethereum? Maybe we can suggest some specific solutions based on your needs.",

I mean that's kinda normal because of the price spike a lot of people use the Ethereum network making it congested and pumping the network fees, you know Ethereum is already a was already a very big network so maybe you could use other networks that are for sure doesn't cost a lot when it comes to fees. Just wait until the network is back and the fees will go back to normal, sometimes there are specific days that fees are down. I mean there's no good way to prepare for it but to buy Ethereum at a lower cost, I mean it's still better instead of paying fees when Ethereum's price already skyrockets to thousands of dollars. Fees are really inevitable especially if you used these networks and it's a big problem for everyone already in the past, I mean comparing Ethereum to Solana or any other network, a lot of investors will still use Ethereum for some reason. So just need to avoid the transaction especially when you think that the fees were not fair.",

There are only few things you can do:- Wait until Ethereum scales- Keep your tokens in exchanges so you don't have to move them from wallet to wallet- Move your tokens only inside layer 2 solutions- Use alternative cheaper chain- Be rich so you don't have to care about the fees.",

The most well-known network and one with the highest transfer fees is the Ethereum network. Following Vitalik Butterin's promise, it has been expensive from the start. However, it is a waste of time since the problem won't be solved any time soon. I preferred to use the TRC-20 network over the fast but pricey ETH network since it is more cost-effective and accessible. It's quick like the Ethereum network, but it's not as secure as ETH because the majority of fraudulent projects create their own unique networks to scam traders and investors.",

Not just ETH, BTC as well right now have high gas fees, perhaps it was due to the current rise of the price as everyone wanted to move or sell their bitcoins. So in any case, you need to check everything first before you do your transactions.And it's just part of the bull run I guess, and there are no preparations for the high fees, it's either you withdraw it with just the normal price and wait a little further or pay high fees for much quicker transactions.",

I sent stablecoins yesterday in the ethereum ecosystem and paid fees of 5-7 dollars.If you have 10 tokens worth $10 for each position, then you are in trouble. With a price increase of 5 times, commissions can cost 30-50 dollars. If you have 10 tokens at $1,000 per position, then if the price increases by 5 times, the $50 fee will not ruin you, and this is a very cheap fee for decentralized storage.",
