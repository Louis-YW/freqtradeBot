One thing I have to give him is that Putin was waiting with the attack on Ukraine for the results of the US election. Joe must've seemed weak to him because the \"special operation\" begun soon after a meeting between these two. Johnson was blindsided. I feel like what he did should not end with him forced out of the minister's chair. Many politicians ignored covid restrictions like the prime minister of Finland and she kept her position.",

I am not here to discuss who these two are and what they have or have not done. Just this statement alone is super dangerous. The world is as it is and how it is going to be, regardless of some people's influence. A great leader may make some big decisions or policies but that only happens in a limited span of time and areas. It might be an influential factor to the world but can never determine where the world goes. Being reasonable is the first thing we should learn as we grow up.",

But such comments should be backed with facts and verifiable evidence. You didn't include any document or argument to prove that it was the absence of Johnson and Trump in the political space that caused the problems the world is facing currently. During the Covid-19, what was Trumps response and what was Johnson's action? The Russia-Ukraine conflict have destabilize the world's economy, do you think both leaders would have averted or stopped this war?These two leaders had their strength and weaknesses. Trump really strengthened the economy of the US but he cared less about the world because of his policy of America, First. He made America to relinquish its title of the police of the world.Trump even canceled so many treaties signed by the past government to promote world peace and green energy. His last days in office showed Trump as an autocrat that possessed the African mentality of holding firm to power. Johnson was a very good actor that ended up deceiving his people. He did not do what he preached and this led to his undoing.",

Being so vague makes me think that you don't know what's been done under their leadership versus leadership of others. But that doesn't surprise me at all as truth or knowledge doesn't matter to this kind of Qanon-like attitude. Problem is that people who fell for Trump don't trust any media or scientist consensus, but they blindly trust other people that don't trust media or scientists either. This creates an opportunity for some people to lead these people and earn money feeding misinformation and use them.And ironically they call people who criticize them \"sheep\".",

Donald Trump was one of the worst things that come to USA and the World. Usually USA presidents have second term but luckily we get rid of him in four years. Those who think he can be a candidate again is in a big delusion. Even republicans don't want him anymore. Biden is not a saint or a savior either. Boris Johnson was incapable. UK couldn't find a good president yet. At least they still have democracy. If world is in a mess, the reason is not USA and UK leaders, it's more complex situation.",

There are many wonderful people in the world whose actions have a global impact, but they are all secluded in their own areas and only concern about the things they can influence that the rest of the world needs to survive. If a leader does or says something that will have an impact on other regions of the world, a quicker remedy will be offered to address it.",
