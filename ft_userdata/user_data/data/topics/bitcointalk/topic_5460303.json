  "content": "How it started for me in crypto truly every journey has ups and down we should always enjoy and thanks our experience will help us along the way, may we got scammed, we learn from it, just never give up because once you gave up its the end of it.When I first started I go with Mining spend almost 1K usdt I do break even when i did mining but not for long, since the difficulty goes up, i sold my equipment, for a lower price, that's when i realize i should have bought Ethereum that time which only worth less than a hundred dollars.Next is Trading after a bit disappointing mining with Ethereum and other coins which i thought would price skyrocket i turn to trading, where i bought coins, during this time , I have less knowledge so I spend dollars to unknown coins, with little less knowledge about it, and ended up losing some from it, but some investments grow, although since being a new trader when i see small breakout i immediately sold what i have, which should not be the case and not recommended to do.I also IDO Investing where you invest in the lower price but sometimes takes long and also experience projects where they run with the money, although some have high returns on investment there are also losses which we also call high risk high reward, we can also call this that risking might have good return but as a newbie or new comer don't try what i did because, if you have less tolerant to stress do not try  it, Aside from that I also try Airdrops where you spend a lot of time hunting projects or a good project giving a way free token , this is a time consuming task because, you have no guarantee of getting any just luck, sometimes turn out to be scam and also get information from you, Scammers will be all over the place targeting potential people with less knowledge I once have know a person who put their money in the project like a retirement money, then suddenly the site goes down, all i can say is just start over, because of less knowledge and being impulsive will pull you down so always remember to be curious of everything be always on guard and don't just pull the trigger.Then Bitcointalk I may be new in the forum but i have experience outside of the forum but when I'm already read the topics i known only a small part, That i need to continue learning from more experience people in this forum and outside, currently Im still trying to learn more, and getting information and sharing what i have learn before, but as a member who is just getting started, never give up, if you fail its just the beginning and there will be more, obstacle on the way before getting successful, besides maintaining your status is the hardest, like maintaining your portfolio, im telling you, as per my experience, keep learning to my fellow newbies don't just decided quickly, read and learn, currently im down again, but im not giving up because if i do then its done.",

      "body": "After reading your story, now i begin to think that all of us have the same story.  Of course not 100% same but almost events are same. Like in my story i started mining (virtual) on websites but i never invested or used any of my money. Because i had this rule that, in online work, you must not give or spend money first. Always be professional. So i just spent my time on all the airdrops, mining apps, then i left it in 2018.But in 2021 i came to know about this platform and i started to understand things. Like how new project comes, roadmap, white paper, basic growth of anew project. How i learnt these things? Simple, by joining bounties. Then i started to wrote articles and now i am a full time article writer (as free lancer).",

We are taught by circumstances and if we are able to control it all, I am sure that little by little your monthly estimate will increase from your initial capital to enter the market. getting 10-20% per month in crypto is very good.",

      "body": "Different case with me since I really search for opportunity online as I heard that there are some ways that we can earn money thru different services that we can provide to other people. And luckily I just spot the crypto especially bitcoin keyword since that is the start of my crypto journey and been introduce first in faucets where we earn a few chunks of bitcoin which we can use for another small investment that we choose. Second are those cloudmining and hyips which I lost some amount and move one since this is one of the baddest decision I take before. Then goes with investing on ICO's and after in trading where I find this one challenging since we can earn depends on how we follow the trend and the analysis we do.To many challenges has been faced but gladly all works well and I can say that crypto journey is really good and exciting.",

I expect you to buy Ethereum or Bitcoin after selling the equipment, since you don't want to keep mining, and doing this will still bring back all your losses if you hold for long term.Trading is even more risky for a newbie than crypto mining, your problem is you jump into everything to quick, you don't take your time on learning things out first, you made the same mistake in mining and in trading.",

I am more affiliated before on investing on ido and ico projects some become fruitful and some like what you said run with the money invested. But right now, I am more on strict investing on some legit ones that I am deep research with. Also I like the testnet and retroactive airdrops activity that Ive been doing now as I am able to monetize some of it. Some are good money but its still an ongoing process. Theres a lot of opportunity either its a sideline or web3 jobs. You just need to find your niche and even herr in forum if you are good posters there are signature privileges that offered to users.",

Trading was lucky and unlucky both for me in throughout my journey I did trade and holder some shitcoins but that was also not a big blunder because I did never invest in Greed.Anyway I think as we always use to say consistency is the key so always stick to whatever you are doing it will be the money bringer someday haha you need to be aware of the market.",

Utopia in the forum here also has a mining option in their platform where the user will be rewarded with some utopia coins(crp) and  it aslo doesn't cost a hell as you are implying but I guess mining BTC would be a totally different case.",

The process is challenging for some people and more challenging for others, but one thing I know that can ease the journey is when you have the experience of someone else to learn from, it can help you make better decisions that you will be happy about. You will be able to avoid some mistakes too. If you have good mentorship, and someone to ask questions (like this forum), you will know as newbie to cryptocurrency that it is better to buy and just keep the bitcoins safe than to try out mining and trading without and knowledge or experienced person to help you through the difficulties.",

Simply because I am scared of losing my little bucks ( ).But one thing I've come to realize in this world of tech, especially as far as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large are concerned is, KNOWLEDGE and ABILITY TO TAKE RISKS.When you have the knowledge and take your time to understand the market, it gives you a clarity on how the system works. Similarly, just like every other investments, Bitcoin requires you to have the ABILITY TO TAKE RISKS.My decision to join this forum was impeccable as that has been instrumental in my ability to learn and understand, even more, the intricacies in the digital currency.Voila!",

Because at every step of every day, there will definitely be challenges or obstacles, which will make you want to give up physically and mentally. But it is in this phase that everything will be determined. Do you want to keep going, or give up and stop at that point. So far I am very grateful, because since I decided to join in this crypto field, there have been no failures or big losses that I have experienced. Only small losses, that I have ever experienced.I don't know if it's luck or not, but what I've realized until now, when investing or trading in crypto, you could say I'm very timid to take big profits behind big risks. Apart from the science and knowledge that I continue to learn, maybe it is because of one of these factors that keeps me safe and can avoid losses.So in essence, when starting to start something, whether it's a field of work or starting a business, and that includes trading or investing in crypto. Indeed, there will always be ups and downs that must be prepared to continue to face. And most importantly live all phases with patience, sincerity and the desire to continue to grow.",

And these two important traits are developed through knowledge. OP lacked knowledge which was why he was moving from one section of crypto to another. The place of learning cannot be overemphasized. These days people can learn anything online without restriction. But I also encourage people to learn from apprenticeship and mentorship if they can find experienced people around the neighborhood.

Anybody that decides not to learn before investing in any sector of cryptocurrency will always learn the hard way. It is better to learn patiently than to suffer losses.",
