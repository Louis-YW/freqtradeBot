  "content": "there must be users here who have missed a raffle or an auction of a certain collectible (e.g. Kialara, BTCC or Casascius) or whose favorite spot in a free raffle has already been taken by another userto remedy all this, the notification bot for telegram, developed by TryNinja, has been available here on the forum for almost 3 years. some of you will already know and use this bot, but some of you might not have noticed it yet (like our krogoth last time ) and this thread is meant to address those usersi personally use it since the first version and i am very satisfied with it. there is the possibility that this bot reports every time your username is mentioned in any thread, another possibility is that the bot starts immediately with the words 'free raffle', which appear a few seconds ago in a just created thread/post - you can also set several words (auction, Kialara, ...) in the bot settingsthe bot also always reports when merits have been distributed to that user and immediately tells you the total number of merits thenmore information/discussions about the telegram bot, you can find in the official thread abou it: [TELEGRAM] Yet Another BitcoinTalk Notification BOT (merits, mentions, topics,+)",
