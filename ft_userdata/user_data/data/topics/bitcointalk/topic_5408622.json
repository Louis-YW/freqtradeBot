I think coinbase is one of the safest places to store assets. because there are so many coinbase wallet users. and you should know that coinbase exchange ranks second after binance by coinmarketcap. so I think your assets will be safe there. and there's nothing to worry about that.

It would still be better to use a cold storage wallet or hardware wallet if you are looking for the safest wallet.",

But, at the very least, if Coinbase goes down, your funds are safe because you have the private keys of your funds, which also means you can import your account into another wallet, a better one at that, open-source at least. And if I were you, I would do that. There's actually a wide array of free and open-source wallet options out there. You might want to check out Electrum, BlueWallet, Green Wallet, Samourai, BRD, Wasabi, to name a few.",

But please learn first which wallet you want to use, sticking the Seed phrase in many wallets is actually not recommended.",

IMO, custodial wallets or centralized exchanges shouldn't be good for storing your coins, they're only good at converting our crypto assets to fiat nothing else.  Non-custodial or hardware wallets are much better cold storage if this is your purpose, you have a guarantee that your coins are safe as long as you keep your private key safe.",

If Coinbase exchange goes down it's possible that node they are using for their non-custodial coinbase wallet could also go down, so in theory you won't be able to move your coins.However, you could just use backup seed words and import them in any other compatible wallet and send coins anywhere you want.I would always give advantage to recommended open source wallets with reproducible codes like Electrum, or hardware wallets like Trezor, Bitbox or Passport.Just don't keep your coins long term on any centralized exchanges and you should be fine.",

What Beginners Should Know.QuoteIs Coinbase safe?Coinbase is one of only 4 exchanges licensed in NY under the BitLicense pilot program. As such, it adheres to strict KYC (Know Your Customer) rules and remains to the extent possible to comply with the rules and regulations.As I mentioned earlier, it has more than 40 licenses to operate in the United States alone and is licensed to operate legally in the 31 other countries on its list.Plus, Coinbase keeps your assets insured, so you can't technically lose your money through hacking and theft!Another thing that makes Coinbase so safe to use is the fact that Coinbase cannot be used anonymously. Due to KYC rules, users must submit a government-issued identity card and, in some cases, verify the address to use the platform's BUY and SELL features. As you can probably see, security is another positive aspect of this Coinbase review.Or you can see here: Coinbase Review 2022: How It Compares and Is Coinbase Safe?Seriously asking about Coinbase Wallet.",

It is connected to the internet. App's can get hacked. Operating system's can get hacked. Plug-in's can get hacked.
