Luckily an article[1] I stumbled while surfing the internet have some tips on how to Manage Gambling addiction if not recover from it.  This is an open discussion so it would be great if you will also give personal input or tips on how to recover from gambling addiction.Btw, here are some of the list of the Gambling Addiction Thread in this Forum, feel free to visit the thread discussion.Recognizing Gambling Disorders, Symptoms of Severe Gambling AddictionWhere to seek help if you need; concerned with gambling addiction.Right time for gambling addicts to come out of addiction?Gambling Addiction at its Worst! Assess your gambling addiction level.Helpful books for gambling addiction treatmentNow back to the topic,  before we go on we should first define what is gambling addiction.  So from the definition:What is Gambling AddictionGambling addiction is a progressive addiction[2] that can have many negative psychological, physical, and social repercussions. It is classed as an impulse-control disorder.[3]Another definition is:Gambling addiction—also known as pathological gambling, compulsive gambling or gambling disorder—is an impulse-control disorder. If you’re a compulsive gambler, you can’t control the impulse to gamble, even when it has negative consequences for you or your loved ones. You’ll gamble whether you’re up or down, broke or flush, and you’ll keep gambling regardless of the consequences—even when you know that the odds are against you or you can’t afford to lose.[1]In order to address gambling addiction, the player must identify if he has the signs of the gambling addiction.  He can then check if he experiences any on the list of the sign of gambling addiction.  It was stated that if ever a player experience at least 4 of the symptoms, he might have a compulsive gambling disorder.Signs of Gambling Addiction:QuoteDiagnosisA diagnosis of gambling disorder requires at least four of the following during the past year:Need to gamble with increasing amounts to achieve the desired excitement.Restless or irritable when trying to cut down or stop gambling.Repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back on or stop gambling.Frequent thoughts about gambling (such as reliving past gambling or planning future gambling).Often gambling when feeling distressed.After losing money gambling, often returning to get even.

However, today we all know that gambling addiction can be cured, or at the very least -managed. This means that there is no reason for you not to seek help when you need it. Acknowledging that you have a problem is your way out. But why seek professional help? We now have research that offers proof that we can quit gambling addiction only if we have a controlled environment.While the therapies that gambling addicts are put through are never invasive, they are extremely helpful. Most of them are based on the idea that your “passion” for gambling can be channeled in a new, more constructive direction.Addicts do not get fully well throughout their entire lifetime, but with consistent oversight, self-restraint, and even at the cost of small relapses, addiction can be treated, and eventually minimized or completely remedied. So, the answer to the question of can gambling addiction be cured is a resounding yes!Seek gambling addiction treatment in your area and know that the money you would potentially spend on a good clinic will be worth it and you will walk away from a changed personDo Not Quit Gambling Cold TurkeyIf you are planning to quit gambling, don't do it in an instant.  It is best to quit gambling slowly like making less and less time for gambling until we are ready to stop full time.  Quitting in an instant won't help because there is psychologist behind it.  It is said that altering behavior in a whim is a very hard thing to do unless a person have strong wil to do it.  People who don't will have more problem than usual because stopping on anything a person is fond with won't happen overnight.  It will be a better thing if a person who wanted to stop to go through a process. This way, family and friends can help.Use an App to stop GamblingQuoteThe power of modernity is at your fingertips and using a stop gambling app could help you not only stop gambling but also get better and even help others. Such gambling apps are proving to be useful and they may help you monitor and exclude yourself from gambling.Depending on where you are, you will definitely benefit from using dedicated software that will communicate with licensed operators that you are at risk of excessive gambling spending, and therefore not permitted to access gambling – or even not gamble beyond a certain limit.There are some excellent solutions that will work here, such as the Gambling Therapy app available on Google Play and Apple Store. The use of such apps is still in its nascence as consumers are only now becoming aware that they can use them to monitor and even improve their gambling behavior.Such apps usually provide you with tools to set limits, both financially and in terms of time, and benefit from more balanced gambling overall. Remind Yourself that Gamblers ChangeIt was a thing of the pass that gambler don't change.  Many people speculate that once a person is addicted to gambling, they will forever a gambling addict.  But this thing has been proven wrong.  Many gambling addicts who gone through medical treatments are able to recover and avoid gambling all in all.QuoteWhile we acknowledge that the compulsion to do things excessively is difficult to overcome, there are still many good examples that demonstrate how gambling addiction can be controlled and how gamblers can, over time and with the right help, change for the better.Assume Responsibility for Your ActionsIf there is a will there is a way.  We should take responsibility on every fault we do during our gambling addiction.  It is the most important  parts of tackling the problem, it maybe hard and may take a long period to admit, but it is a healthy thing to do.[1]QuotePeople are by nature defensive and often seek to excuse and project their own mistakes onto others. Like gambling addicts, we are no different, if not even worse. However, our mistakes can quickly turn too costly, and this is why we need to act on time and nip them in the bud if and when possible – admitting fault is a good way to start.Read Gambling Addiction Stories on RedditQuoteThere are many reasons to quit gambling addiction. But if you really want to quit, you need to see what others have gone through and are doing. There are many stories on how to quit gambling on Reddit, and you can read through those personal anonymous testimonies and see if that will inspire you to fight the issue yourself.Of course, simply reading about someone else’s gambling addiction is not a way to tackle your own problem, but it’s definitely a good way to see that there are people just like yourself who come from various backgrounds and they go through the same challenging emotional turbulences you do. Get Help Online If You Can’t Afford ClinicIf treatment for you is too expensive, there are lots of online gambling addiction help sites that are ready to help us.QuoteOrganizations such as the National Council on Problem Gambling and Gamblers Anonymous are trusted and reliable organizations that will get you help. While some issues with their funding remain, there are many opportunities to take advantage to ensure that you are coping with the problem.Find a Hobby and Pour Your Passion into ItQuoteIt’s not entirely accurate to say that your gambling addiction is just a hobby. There is a well-documented physiological response that happens in your brain when you win or even lose money. Endorphin is released and elation is felt. It’s a powerful emotion that quickly can become an addiction.The best way to divert attention from gambling is to look for another interests that requires both physical and mental activities.  This will occupy our idle time and if we put our passion to it, it may replace the urge to gamble by the passion to do more helpful things.QuoteHobbies are fairly similar. They are pleasurable activities that “take your mind off things” but also generate endorphin. This is what makes them a great outlet and a way to relax. Of course, gambling is also a form of entertainment but it has its downsides as well. It can get you in financial trouble.Don’t Go Cold Turkey, But Limit TemptationQuoteIt’s true that living in a “safe environment” will definitely help. There are many lawmakers out there who are right now pushing for the right set of regulatory changes to ensure that you are not exposed to gambling ads unnecessarily. There is a proven link between how many ads you see and how inclined you are to gamble, so it’s good to avoid temptation.For starters, though, you can restrict your own exposure. Google now allows you to actually opt out of seeing gambling and alcohol ads on YouTube, which is just one of the ways to control your gambling. National self-exclusion programs also do exist such as GamStop in the United Kingdom, for example. Exclusion is done on a state-by-state basis in the United States, though.Talk with your family or friends[4]Quotethey can help you and stay near to you until you'll be free from any form of addictionQuote from: coolcoinz on June 19, 2022, 06:09:39 PMI feel like the most important part is not to be alone with it. Have people who are trying to help you, watch you, support you while you're fighting it. It's even better if you have a friend who is a former addict that made it through. A bit of strong will wouldn't be a bad thing either. My mother was a smoker and she had a friend who was also trying to quit and they managed to do it together by watching each other. Each of them did not want to be the weaker one who breaks first so none of them did. They made it into a competition and it worked. cold turkeyQuoteDefinition of cold turkey (Entry 1 of 2)1: abrupt complete cessation of the use of an addictive drugalso : the symptoms experienced by a person undergoing withdrawal from a drug2: unrelieved blunt language or procedure3: a cold aloof personcold turkey adverbDefinition of cold turkey (Entry 2 of 2): all at once : ABRUPTLY: such asa: without a period of gradual adjustment, adaptation, or withdrawalquit smoking cold turkeyb: without preparationa new player who started the season cold turkeysource: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cold%20turkeyHow did you find these tips?

Most of us fall into something and we hardly accept the fact that what will be the result of any action that we are made should be our responsibility, we often blame other people or things if there's a misfortune happen to us. There's a free online consultation every where, therapy is quite expensive as me myself experienced it but not in gambling-related issue, maybe some books about self-help can help as well and lastly, having more things to do in our daily lives makes us more productive and will help us to lessen the time in gambling.",

Admitting that you are having trouble letting it go even just for a day. Looking at the mirror and telling yourself what it had done to you. How it changed you physically and mentally. Are you the same person or have you grown a tummy? How about the way you think? I had my own mistakes before betting large amounts on dice because I thought I can double the money in an instant but the difference is, that I am not having fun anymore. That's when I decided to stop playing that type of game and just go for sports betting. A big change did happen as I don't just bet wildly anymore. An analysis is needed and it gives me a lot of fun researching for possible outcomes. There are times I even forgot to make a bet because of being hooked on looking at stat sheets and other people's analysis.  IMO, that should be the essence of it, to add more joy to the game.",

Yes, and the only way to cure it is first you have to admit that you have a serious gambling problem. And then you have to reach out to your family for help because they are first one that will understand what you are going through and is willing 100% to assists you.Family members can even go as far as going to like an intervention, so it's either the gambler accept it because they want to stop, or simply ignore.",

I often meet people who are addicted to gambling are those who do not have a satisfying job so they are looking for an instant way to get rich from gambling. even though gambling is just a means of relaxation or refreshment or entertainment to entertain yourself a little, not the other way around, which is the main focus. so this is where it is important to know what the function of gambling itself is for. so you don't go wrong from the start.I think the ways to get rid of gambling addiction described by the OP are complete and clear. so I'm not going to add anything.",

      "body": "One of the most effective methods here imo is finding a hobby. If you have the money, even taking a vacation somewhere for say 2 weeks to a month without any whatsoever access to the internet or anything related to gambling/casino, e.g a farming area/fishing location where you can put in your time doing those activities instead of anything else for an entire day in that 2-week break. It honestly amazes me how those 2 weeks of being away could be a HUGE help in trying to clear your mind. If you don't have the money though, a hobby is the way to go. Let's say drawing, it may be said as a hobby but there's also a lot of studying and understanding involved that is going to take up a LOT of your time. Heck, it doesn't even need a hobby you can do, you can maybe start finding content creators on the internet to watch and sink your time in.",

      "body": "These tips are wonderful and I am sure that a careful study of this thread would assist an addict to break loose from problems of addiction. But the truth is that most gamble addict are not aware that they have a problem, hence they would not seek help. I have seen gamble addict that would give you perceive genuine reasons why they are gambling. Until one accepts that he has a problem, then there would be no solution. Another challenge that gamble addict face is stigmatization. In some quarters they are seen as criminals and sometimes never-do-wells. Most of them become shy or scared of discussing their addiction problems to people, making them to suffer in silence.",
