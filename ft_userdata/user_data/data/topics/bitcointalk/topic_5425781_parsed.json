Everyone has a number.In order to award a prize to one user, I'd like to make a blockchain based draw.I want there to be no doubts and everyone was sure that the draw was 100% fair.Is there any service/website that provides something like this?(It's not about building something like this from scratch, because I'll probably need this only once.)",

Thank you for your suggestion.I asked because I think I saw someone using something like this a while ago in some Bitcointalk contest. However, when I googled it, I couldn't find anything like that.It is possible that someone has dealt with something like this and will answer here, if not, I will use your idea. Thanks",

However, when I googled it, I couldn't find anything like that.Yes, using data from a block header is the most common way to settle a competition in a provably fair way, since it would be almost impossible for the person running the competition to manipulate the outcome.Essentially, you get everyone to pick a number. Once all the votes are in, you pick an arbitrary block not too far in the future, look at its hash, and figure out the winner based on whatever criteria you used.For example, the latest block is 765990, with the hash 000000000000000000019e0b0004a91010b557be966bfae8718a584d0d15a656. Bear in mind the hash is in hex, so the characters are from 0-9 and a-f.So you could release 16 tickets from 0-f, and whoever matches the final character wins.Or you could release 100 tickets from 00-99, and whoever matches the final two numbers wins (ignoring any letters).Or you could release 256 tickets from 00-ff, and whoever matches the final two characters wins.And so on.",

ThanksThere's a downside to that method though: you can't provide an exact time of the draw since blocks aren't always on schedule.If the application is not strict to schedule, then it's good.Also, do not use it if the amount at stake is a lot higher than the block reward (like 10x+) since a pool/solo miner can risk it to try produce another block hash with the winning number.",

Assuming 100 tickets, then even if the miner got incredibly lucky and found 3 blocks in the time it took the rest of the network to find one, you are still only talking about a less than 3% chance of finding one which lets them win. So as nc50lc points out, you would need a prize in the region of millions of dollars to make it even worth attempting.And you can easily mitigate this by posting a hash of a message saying which block will choose the winner, and the revealing the contents of that hash after the block in question has been mined.",

So the miners will know the content of the hidden hash, and can use that to alter the outcome.It's all quite far fetched though, especially since changing the block hash doesn't even guarantee a certain desired result. All it does it change the random, which leads to a different winner.",

But as above, the chance of them finding a block which also picks the \"right\" winner from 100 or more tickets is very small indeed.Quote from: LoyceV on December 10, 2022, 01:22:53 PMIn case of collusion with miners to cheat the lottery, I would assume the host is in on it. So the miners will know the content of the hidden hash, and can use that to alter the outcome.So you get the host to commit to a block number without revealing it, such as via a hash as I suggested above. You also get every participant to commit to an offset number, also without revealing it, say between -500 and +100. Assuming the number of participants is n, then the host waits until 100*n blocks beyond the block number they chose (just in case every participant chose +100 as their offset number), and then reveals the block number. All the participants also reveal their offset number, everything is summed, and that is the block number you use to pick the winner. Provided at least one participant is honest, then the block number cannot be predicted. And if every participant is in on the scam, then what's the point in the first place?But again, this is all needlessly complex and would only even be worth thinking about if the competition in question had a prize worth millions or even tens of millions of dollars.",
