First I want to acknowledge my seniors who have been in this space before me and have gained experiences about Bitcoin and it’s operations, also, thank you for the ideas and contributions shared so far, I must say it’s been a wonderful experience browsing through this forum. This forum has really thought me a lot in just a couple of weeks, how much more when I stay committed to it in some couple of years which I intend to. I’m sure it’s going to be really productive for me and help me to grow in all ramifications. Thank you!I’m also using this opportunity to welcome my fellow newbies into the forum and I advise we all stay committed and always follow the rules so as to yield good results. Welcome!Now to my concern, I’d like to seek advice from my senior/experienced colleagues and Ofcourse my fellow newbies (not underestimating any contributions/advice).1. What storage methods have you used and what has worked best for you?2. What security measures do you take to protect your private keys?3. What advice do you have for beginners who are just starting out with Bitcoin?I’d appreciate if I can get more knowledge on these. Thanks in anticipation. Y'all Rock!",

First thing you should learn is to use the search bar whenever you might want to create a thread or ask questions, some of the answers to your questions might have been addressed before and this would reduce the number of repeated and similar threads created. Quote from: Framelover on May 14, 2023, 10:30:29 PM1. What storage methods have you used and what has worked best for you?The best storage method is storing your coins on self custodian wallets and the best of it is the hardware wallets. The hardware wallets are good because they are not usually connected to the internet but they are somewhat expensive for small investors. So if you can’t afford the hardware wallets then there is the self custodian wallets like the electreum which are good storage wallets. Quote 2. What security measures do you take to protect your private keys?It depends on how best you know how to save your stuffs but the last place to save them keys is on goggle docs or email This is risky. You can just simply write them off on a steel as this has better guarantee of not wearing out than paper and hide it in place that could be accessible by only you. There are people that memorize them but due to some circumstances it is not advisable to depend on that",

What storage methods have you used and what has worked best for you?The best place where you can secure your bitcoin is using a non custodial wallet address, make sure you control your private key, you shouldn't trust any third party with your private key, anywhere you can't control your private key is not safe for you to store your bitcoin. Quote from: Framelover on May 14, 2023, 10:30:29 PM2. What security measures do you take to protect your private keys?The best way to secure your private key is by carving your private key in a iron steel, it can't be distroyed easily. Make sure your private key is not stored in anywhere their is a internet connection, always avoid storing your private key on email address or other places that can be easily hacked. Also people writing their private key on paper, it's a nice idea but not completely safe, paper can be easily distroyed incase if anything happens, but iron steel cant be distroyed easly.

What advice do you have for beginners who are just starting out with Bitcoin?The advice am having for beginners just joining bitcoin is that they shouldn't store their bitcoin on exchange, no exchange is safe, any exchange can be compromised at any moment, no matter how reputable the exchange is, I noticed newbies always prefer storing their bitcoin on exchange for easy accessibility and other reasons, your coin is not safe in exchange. Also nobody you meet on the internet should be trusted, just assume everyone you meet on the internet is a scammer, am sure it's going to really help you.",

But make sure the phone is not for daily use and only to keep your crypto.I use Ledger and a phone to store my crypto and keep it secret from others so only I know. But I plan to buy Safepal or Trezor later.Quote from: Framelover on May 14, 2023, 10:30:29 PM2. What security measures do you take to protect your private keys?Make sure to keep it in a place where only you know and not tell people you have crypto in your house (if you keep your wallet at home).I keep that hardware wallet and the phone in my home and not connecting to the internet if I do not want to transfer the coins. And I do not carry it anywhere I go so I think it is safe in my home.Quote from: Framelover on May 14, 2023, 10:30:29 PM3. What advice do you have for beginners who are just starting out with Bitcoin?Take good care of your wallet and password in a safe place and don't attract the attention of many people by saying you have a lot of coins, let alone that you have a lot of bitcoins.",

Make sure your private key is not stored in anywhere their is a internet connection, always avoid storing your private key on email address or other places that can be easily hacked. Also people writing their private key on paper, it's a nice idea but not completely safe, paper can be easily distroyed incase if anything happens, but iron steel cant be distroyed easly. Your private key doesn't have to leave the wallet in which it was generated in, don't write it down or carve it anywhere; just use an HD wallet, thus you'll have just one seed phrase, and with it you can recover all the addresses on that wallet with their private keys. HD wallets makes things pretty easy for users, as you only have to back up one seed phrase. But take note that the seed phrase backup must be safely kept because if a malicious agent gets it, they will take all your funds.",
