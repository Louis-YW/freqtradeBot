One similarity though is that it used to post in the french board just like OP's accountI wounder what kind of ban OP is talking about1. Temporarily ban2. Account lock due to the 2015 mass account hacking?3. Account lock due to an attempt to recover account via secret question?It certainly isn't a permanent ban.",

Secondly, you can explain the reason why your account was banned and if your reason is not valid, you can explain it here as proof.  In this case maybe the Bitcointalk authorities can consider it and you can get a chance to be unbanned because you donated to this forum.

It seems there is actually two bans on the account. The other is for \"Alt currencies content outside of Alt currencies board\" which doesn't have an expiration date. Maybe one was forgotten to be put in because that also is unlikely to get you a permaban unless you're a serial repeat offender.

There is a whole section for altcoins with different boards where one can discuss freely about them.You're right but if someone trolls about Bitcoin every time then such trolls may not be acceptable in a forum that's mostly about Bitcoin. The worst thing is that when such people with less knowledge about Bitcoin try to demote or defame it in order to promote those shit-coins that are nothing when compared to Bitcoin. I guess the @OP was also aware of his actions and that's why he said there was trolling going on his account in those days. Although, this forum is the best place where you can have freedom of speech but still everything has some limits and when someone crosses those limits then he/she will have to bear the consequences.

The admin will be very happy to make you recover this account only if you can prove that you own the account. I think OP already has access to that account and he doesn't need any kind of account recovery at all. The account is in his own possession but it's banned or locked and that's why OP has posted this ban appeal thread. He won't get unbanned or unlocked for some reasons but if he can prove that he is the owner of the account then he may get his account unbanned or unlocked. But, still we will have to find the reason of his ban and if he was banned for another thing other than trolling then his chances of getting unbanned are pretty low.",
