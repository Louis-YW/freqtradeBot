  "content": "Before the Terra-Luna incident, with UST crashing, I was into staking stablecoins on Beefy for an average of 12-15% APY, which isn't that bad. However, the whole incident took a toll on me and quickly withdraw from DeFi altogether and temporarily put my money on Binance Savings, for 10% APY, with interest distributed on a daily basis.Certainly, it wasn't the best move, but at that point, it was the safest option, at least till things stabilize. According to Beefy's discord server, the past few months it's struggling to make ends meet and had to go through changes regarding their fees and BiFi's yield. Ideally, I'd move my funds from Binance to somewhere decentralized again, but after UST dropped to zero, I was skeptical. I'm currently browsing on Beefy and see some interesting options, such as USDC-BUSD, linked below. It's offering 16% APY but the TVL is relatively low, should I be worried about it? Any suggestions or what to look for?https://app.beefy.finance/vault/cone-usdc-busd",

UST token was a garbage token that has no enough funds to peg its stable token. It's peg with terra luna to make it stable unlike USDC and BUSD which fully pegged with fiat money that being stored in some banks. I think that would be worth if you are staking it. Im currently still staking and farming using my stable token.",

I'd rather invest in Bitcoin and ignore staking for I know that my money is quite secure. However, I'd just think also that nothing will follow Luna's footsteps and I know for sure that we as investors are also aware of that incident which make us more careful in investing and in the next staking. I could assume that you have been thinking that decision OP and that is reason why you have take that option despite the risks.",

However it makes me more anxious now regarding that stuff.  I would definitely wouldnt trust new stablecoin staking aside those common ones.  Yes the busd apy is much lower but still manageable even with low APY.  But trusting again stablecoin like the new one on tron usd,  maybe not again.",

Though staking can still be safe with other good stablecoins and if you think the risk is worth it, then you can really try it at your own risk. BUSD and USDC might be the next best option, try to do some research as well before you stake.",

I won't gamble with my funds in a fragile platform just for the high apy.",

I'm aiming to achieve a small but noticeable increase in my passive earnings per month. On the one hand, I'm not sure if it's worth the risk, but on the other, if you're not willing to take risks, you'll never achieve higher incentives.I already have this amount of money lying around, achieving some kind of return is better than having it sit in a bank account with zero interest.",

Generally, as you've also mentioned Beefy is quite safe, and their smart contracts are mostly checked thoroughly. The only risk I can possibly find is the APY dropping in the near future. I believe that the only way to achieve a higher APY is to constantly find new vaults to switch to, providing that the withdraw and deposit fees are not high (Beefy is claiming a 0% fee in both cases, at least for the two specific vaults).",
