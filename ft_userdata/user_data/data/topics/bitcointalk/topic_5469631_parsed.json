This would also Play an expantiating roles of spreading values of BTC and attracting it to more investors.It is believed that some of us in this platform ad a Bitcointalk, when we get rewarded on 1 way or the other, na other crypto BTC traders dey help us control our crypto wallets even til date reason because we never learn BTC crypto trading yet but we found ourselves here and na so too the coins (BTC) dey take spread as e don dey profit even people way no get the idea to take it's control this na why we need a learning trading threads so as to also fit fund our wallets with our capitals without just waiting to get rewards from this forum before we can get a stake to Invest on in our various crypto BTC wallets.",

But i think everything you need to know in Bitcoin is already stated here in this forum, perhaps you are the one who have not come across it. That's why you need to study very well so that crypto related topics can be interesting to you. And you can make emphasis on them.Although Bitcoin is no longer a strange thing to me. I had a strong feeling about Bitcoin when I heard that people who are bitcoiners are millionaire, that is when I started doing research about it. I had sleepless nights watching YouTube videos on How it modes of transaction was through wallets to wallet with wallet/contract address. I was also made to know that it's not only Bitcoin that is crypto currency, there were others like: usdt,Tron,Solana,xrp, Doge coin, Luna coin,Shiba Inu and so on. I downloaded a trust wallet and studied it to know somethings about them and further ahead and even bought coin in some of them.

If someone brings you here, does not mean he will teach you every thing. Expirience is the best teacher. When you decide not know about Bitcoin is when your boss takes advantage of your ignorance.  Even if people post links that will educated you on crypto hear, and you don't devote your time to know, you would just rank up and still don't know what Bitcoin is all about or not knowing what you are doing here. Who knows if you might get scammed and you would be coming to seek advice here.",

I know everything in life is about stages but it is important that we have a pre-knowledge of how trading works and how to follow the right concept.Not many people that joins this forum wants to learn about trading. Trading is a different thing entirely and it’s not encouraged for newbies to go into it without having sufficient knowledge about it. Don’t be surprised or discouraged not to have seen a thread that gives a step to step guideline on how to trade, it is because it is very risky and many users have different approach on how they trade. The one that works for one won’t work for many and vice versa. If you really want to learn more about trading, you can check the Trading Discussion board in the forum, waiting for a thread in the local board for that might not come now if we don’t have anyone from here that is very good at trading. Quote from: Richbased on October 11, 2023, 06:56:05 AMThat's exactly what am saying that the beginners need to be conversant with some trading methods because most of the beginners here don't even have and idea of what bit coin is and most of them are being told what to do and what not to do by people that refer them to this forum, they have no idea of how things work here they just follow instructions of the person that registered them on this platform and they are instructed to just keep posting or make topics.This depends on the boundary you set for yourself after joining the forum. The person that most have introduced you here must have also told you on the rules guiding the forum and since you want to be careful not to break any rule, you’ll want to follow their guide. Following their guide is not bad but it will limit you to some certain things if you don’t add to your knowledge by exploring the forum more by yourself and get a better grasp of it. It is good to have a mentor but the rules, information and threads here is enough mentorship to guide you throughout your stay here and your journey in bitcoin.Quote from: Richbased on October 11, 2023, 06:56:05 AMFor me if someone is on this platform and finding some things strange to understand you will see that the person might start loosing interest because they might feel that maybe the person that registered them here are using them to favor themselves in one way or the other and some people here does that they open accounts for people and be using their accounts to their own selfish interest but if one becomes accustomed to how everything works here there won't be any doubt on how the account is being runnedThis also depends on your perspectives of the person and what he does to have been using your account to their selfish interest which I still can’t imagine how that is possible. Your ideas and knowledge you’ve learnt from the forum will always be yours and not even the person that brought you here can collect that from you. If you continue to be under the shadow of someone even when you can stand on your own, you’ll be limited to some things. Forum is a well explanative and interactive place that is easy to understand when you put your mind at it. So you won’t remain under a person forever if you’re ready to learn by yourself more to what you’re been introduced to in the first place.",

As a newbie or a beginner it is not advisable to just rush into trading without knowing some trading ethics that should be followed in other not be misinformed, learning is a gradual process as you can't rush into knowing basic trading terms and acronyms when you are not familiar with the trading environment, so it ought to be one step at a time then from time to time you will start being conversant with the trading methods.",

Learning all about the above you've mentioned requires you to study. Not only in this local board, you can as well go to other board like beginners and help, Bitcoin discurssion and also make use of your Google search engines. The world is evolving and so is technology advancement. You can also create out time and list the things you don't know on bitcoin and ask Google and it will give you the feed back. Note: only the short abbreviation and the little ones which not need to bring out here in other not to take some people back. You can bring up some that are so difficult to explain in Google or YouTube. By so doing you will know more despite the furum is a place to learn there are things you need to teach yourself. people who always succeed in life does not only depend on a particular direction.dey always make research and apply wisdom. You might be a newbie but if you keep your mind down and study very well, you will soar higher and people will even wounder if truly you are a newbie.",

FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is a particularly significant notion in the cryptocurrency realm. Because of the high levels of unpredictability and the \"get rich quick\" mindset that some investors possess. There are several tales of people who purchased Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies at a cheap price, kept onto them, and then saw their value explode, earning them a lot of money. This might cause FOMO in folks who believe they missed out on this chance. However, keep in mind that cryptocurrency markets are notoriously unpredictable, and there is no assurance that this will happen again.",
