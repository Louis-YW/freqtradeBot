The pictures don't seem to appear despite me uploading them and using [ img ] and[ /img ]IRON (or other coin) Dual Mining Guide for BzMiner, Rigel, and TRMCreated by Chris of Flexpool.ioZiliqa dual mining works by mining ZIL for 1-2 minutes every 60 minutes. During ETH mining, ZIL would pay slightly more than ETH for this short period. After ETH mining, ZIL pays considerably more than any other coin during this period. Basically, by mining ZIL you are achieving similar profits as you would have mining ETH back during the golden days of GPU mining for those 2 minutes.The Flexpool website auto generates the dual mining .bat for you (https://www.flexpool.io/get-started/iron/dual), but you will need to set up your config so that your overclocks switch from your current ones to ethash (memory bandwidth prioritized) ones to maximize ZIL hashrate during the round. BzMinerBzMiner makes it easy to dual mine ZIL by using its configuration generator at: https://www.bzminer.com/config-generator/ Please visit the BzMiner discord for questions/information https://discord.gg/Qz84q3AkusYou can use it to generate the config that goes in your file on Windows or in Hive OS extra arguments. I’ve provided an example of it below.  https://ibb.co/x1gw84JFor the BzMiner config filehttps://ibb.co/jZbzZPGFor Hive OS you have two options, setting it up for dual coin mining or pasting extra config arguments in the first coin to force dual mining.The below is one example of setting the second coin to mine ZIL. Note that Kaspa is selected because Hive OS in some versions does not allow selecting ZIL, putting zmp://zil.flexpool.io will make BzMiner and (usually) other miners dual mine ZIL anyway.https://ibb.co/0nfycN5In the alternative, you can paste the Extra config arguments in the first coin and force dual mining ZIL. https://ibb.co/nzjPQp3https://ibb.co/2ZbHwJz RigelPaste what you want into the below templates.

Please visit the TRM discord for questions/information https://discord.gg/yVRpAnVU8KTRM works by putting things in order with various commands using space -- to set each command. Be careful as Microsoft Word will autoformat the -- into –.For each command, use a comma to divide cards. For instance card 1 is 1800mhz and card 2 is 1500mhz so we set it as --clk_mem_mhz=1800,1500 For details checkout the TRM download at https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/releases which has detailed instructions and descriptions of what each command does. Each of these has to be repeated for each algo. For instance, you put your --clk_core_mhz=1530, 1500 and then you will need to do it again for zil. You will notice it repeats twice in the Windows Example, once for ironfish and once later on for zil. Note that TRM allows you to set more specifics for AMD cards such as system on chip (SOC). This requires less power for Iron Fish, but more power for ZIL. I’d suggest setting it higher as it seems like switching it for the ZIL round makes the card unstable. TRM supports switching ZIL OC's for Windows but for Linux they have added the tools for programs such as Hive OS to integrate it, but do not support it manually through Extra Config Arguments.To quote Kerney \"Direct support on win only. Add arguments for clocks/voltages both outside of and inside the --zil .. --zil_end arguments. On Linux the driver just isn't stable, but there we've added an event script-driven approach anyway where a user-defined script gets called on switching events and can set clocks. The Linux setup is typically for distros to implement support if they want to, or advanced users, not casual miners.\"Windows Example:/teamredminer.exe -a --ironfish -o stratum+tcp:// iron.fpmp.net:8888 -u eda8dccba5acb4a93deb6939e78a8527ca4fced470e612ca6407b1b4dc635202 -p x --kernel_vm_mode=RR --clk_core_mhz=1530 --clk_core_mv=810 --clk_mem_mhz=100 --iron_end --zil -o zmp://zil.flexpool.io -u zil14fw7uxmrjrlsxdfsjp6razax6ysk2eerc7uryy.trmtest_zil -p x --clk_core_mhz=1050 --clk_core_mv=700 --clk_mem_mhz=1790,1800,1800,1800,1800,1800,1800--eth_config=R632,R576,R576,R632,R632,R576,R632 --eth_dag_cache=0 --zil_end --fan_controlHive OS Extra Config Arguments Example:-a --ironfish -o stratum+tcp:// iron.fpmp.net:8888 -u eda8dccba5acb4a93deb6939e78a8527ca4fced470e612ca6407b1b4dc635202 -p x --kernel_vm_mode=RR --clk_core_mhz=1530 --clk_core_mv=810 --clk_mem_mhz=100 --iron_end --zil -o zmp://zil.flexpool.io –u 0x02101Ff031529661dcAb36614d0Fa5a76e4721B4.zil14fw7uxmrjrlsxdfsjp6razax6ysk2eer c7uryy.trmtest_zil -p x --zil_end",
