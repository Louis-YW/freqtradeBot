  "content": "I've never used this exchange, and despite a few high-profile instances, I'm not certain this can be labeled as a scam exchange or not.However, it seems like they must have some kind of an off-forum bounty running where they reimburse accounts for posting about Bitget while endorsing it in some way or another.Here's an example of what I'm talking about. This account has mentioned Bitget 23 times since Sept 26 and posted several links to the exchange, this one being the most recent:Quote from: Best-mary on November 02, 2023, 09:21:33 PMI guess so, I found this exchange support free trading using coupons https://www.bitget.com/support/articles/11678672728473-Bitget-CouponsHere are some account which have mentioned Bitget positively an inordinate amount of times this year (bounty seems to have started in July):Bitcoinpoly - 67 mentionsVivangeneviv - 55 mentionsZee27 (banned) - 50 mentionsAltcoiner007 - 39 mentionsCryptoababe - 33 mentionsananyabushra - 30 mentionsBest-mary - 23 mentionsJoseph-P - 18 mentions(there's several others but these are the most prolific shillers)Note that most of these accounts are not in signature campaigns and do not participate in forum bounties. Some of them seem to be bought accounts.So has anyone heard about Bitget compensating people for spamming the forum about them? Just curious.",

Just curious.I have joined months ago coinstore exchange private telegram group where members are given task for shilling (daily posting on two platform). They have google documents where they given shilling rules and words which should be used in shilling.  They gives weekly payment to each user with 1$ per day payrate. I am not sure what is real phenomenal behind it but from observation of promotion by all these accounts , it's appears that Bitget is also using same tactics as coinstore and all accounts are alt of one or two person.",

If they don't have that, they should not be allowed to advertise here because potential clients from this forum won't have a place to discuss about the service and get answers from their representatives, but if they have a thread and account, they should receive a red tag accordingly, why? Because we all know when a service acquires cheap shilling services, they are not really trustworthy, and we all know that those shills are getting paid $1 per day, so their reviews about how trustworthy and great that service is, does not imply trustworthiness.Because, if you have an exit scam plan, you won't do it to small clients, you'd wait to grow the amount of your stash and then execute the plan.So I'd say again, if there are no official thread here, administrator should issue a ban warning for those promoting such services.  Why having a thread here is a must? Because people can scrutinize them for possible red flags.",

Either way, whoever Bitget hired to do this is better than those standard shills that usually write inside the project's announcement thread. Speaking of that, 2-3 years ago I was onto a group of high ranking accounts that were involved in the similar type of shilling but they did such a good job and were very careful that it was hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they actually shilled for shitcoins so in the end I just gave up as it didn't make much sense to shit on someone's rep without proper proof.",

There seems to be an accumulation process where the incentive is to carry on shilling otherwise the rewards get knocked back down again therefore the onus is on the participant (shill) to keep shilling. They only receive rewards after they post their evidence on the Bitget Discord.Quote from: Poker Player on November 03, 2023, 04:31:18 AMI see they get paid with discord shitcoin, is that right? I have been looking for information to get the equivalence to dollars but I have not found it. There is a discord token that ceased to be traded on April 29th of this year. I do not know if it makes sense to give them defunct tokens, it looks as though they are giving Bitget rewards with strict rules about have tokens reduced if participants are not adhering to the rules. Quote from: Poker Player on November 03, 2023, 04:31:18 AMOn the other hand, I don't know if you think we should report them? Tagging them is not going to have any effect and in any case it should be with a neutral, I understand. I suppose neutral tags would be the appropriate way forward but Bitget has partnered with Argentine footballer Messi therefore those shilling will be hoping to have something on hand that one day will be worth a lot and are probably happy to take tags along the way.",
