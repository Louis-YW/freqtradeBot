  "content": "For minutes I paused reflecting about my time in the forum raising self-directed questions and contemplating on them. Questions like what are those things I can say I have actually learnt since when I joined the forum. How has my growth in knowledge of bitcoin being ever since and what more do I really need to know continuously. Some people may wonder, why then did i had to bring it to the forum, why not quietly work on  improving yourself more regarding those questions. Anyway, the need to me extending this to the forum is to ignite and reawakening in members that may have lost consciousness of that fact for them to examine themselves for a check and balance.As a member of the forum and you're not growing in knowledge of the main purpose for which the forum was created for then it's a waste of time and energy for you.  The forum is not just about earnings so if your growth in the forum is focused in ranks you are basically not growing. In otherwords, if you are lucky enough to scale through the ranks without proportional growth in knowledge of bitcoin then such growth is no good growth at all. A newbie in bitcoin knowledge but an old member by rank you just like a container without a content. So it would be nice of us if we can from time to time take a quiet moment and examine ourselves in relation to the idea behind the forum, ask ourselves necessary questions regarding our timeline with our level of knowledge to the actual purpose of the forum (bitcoin knowledge).By doing so we can easily keep track of our development and growth rate and try in balancing it side by side ranks and bitcoin knowledge. Disclaimer: Am just trying to make a  common sense and not that I think myself more aware, knowledgeable and serious than anyone else in the forum and this post was not meant to belittle anyone\"s rank at all.",

I want to know more, that is grow in knowledge just as my rank does, and because I have this in mind, I am very intentional about my knowledge and the time I spend on the forum. I read through topics that I know that I may not even be able to drop a comment, but I read through them still because I know that knowledge comes from reading and constant learning. I am more knowledgeable than I was because I devote my time to the commitment of learning. This is what it should be.",

You cannot earn in the forum without having some knowledge of why you are here. Why did I say that? Because 80% of discussions taking place on the forum are all about bitcoin, teaching people new things about bitcoin and any other new information about crypto So you can see that everyone who comes to this forum is there to learn about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Even though they will engage in the signature campaign, they must have knowledge of why this forum was created and any other things they need to know. Because the signature campaign comes later when you spend some months on the forum, and I believe that for someone who is serious and ready to learn before ranking up, they will have something that they have learned. However, someone cannot  rank up without the knowledge of which the forum was also created.",

Knowing and learning about anything depends entirely on oneself. If I don't understand something, someone can explain it to me, but if I don't try to understand it, no one can explain it to me. Curiosity makes a person more efficient. You and two of your friends are sitting in the same math class. In the same math class, your friend asked sir to understand the things that he does not understand, but you did not try to understand those things. So before we know who has gained how much from the forum, we must first understand how much we have tried to learn.",

There is no specific indicators to measure those things, it all depends on an individual perception and target.Anyway, I often evaluate or examine my development and my contribution in the forum, I know it is still far from my target. However, I'm sure it needs a process, I'm sure to develop gradually as long as I never stop learning. I also believe that improving knowledge and quality of our posts are parts of positive contribution to the forum. Sure, it is not only about growing the rank, developing our knowledge and contribution are the most important things. Basically, improving rank won't be achieved if we never improve knowledge and contribution. This is what I believe!",

Bitcoin investment, Security and privacy, and managing Bitcoin investment (holding) are what some people are always careless about, but since joining the forum, I have not stopped learning and obtaining good ideas about Bitcoin investment and also practicing what I have learned.",

Well, we don't want to spread wrong information right mate?. To know how much you learn in the forum then try answering quizzes and other things to determine how much you have learned during your time in the forum. I am planning to do the same to see if I still remember most of the things I learned in the forum about Bitcoin and other related topics.",

Ranks is not always reflected with our Bitcoin knowledge since this forum already have different branches aside from Bitcoin. Some can get higher rank with normal knowledge on Bitcoin by being good on other category like Meta and Investigation. I admit that my Bitcoin my knowledge is on the normal level because I’m not a developer that has a knowledge on Bitcoin technicals. But, my knowledge is enough to keep me safe away from hacker and at the same time invest on Bitcoin. I don’t mind lacking more technical knowledge as long as I can invest on Bitcoin same with other pro here. I leave that technical side to them and we normie should be happy with that.",

What I expect for people like that to do which am not an exception is to fire up the interest of reading and learning much more to keep up with their rank level if after examining they find they the knowledge doesn't commensurate. More like advancing and pushing for more knowledgeable notes within the forum.",

First of all I came into the forum with zero knowledge about cryptocurrency, zero understanding of how the forum works but having spent one year already here I have been able to learn and still learning the things which I found difficult to do in the past. The first post I came across that motivated me to stick around the forum was a post made by KingsDen about some avoidable mistake of the newbies I think reading through the post I said to myself one day I will grow not just growing in rank but in knowledge too because knowledge was my main aim of coming here but today, I have got some knowledge for my trading and I have also benefited from signature campaigns which I never had in mind of getting. No regrets of being here because right now I can boldly do things I have never knew how to do in the past with the help of the forum and her members.",

Anyway, the need to me extending this to the forum is to ignite and reawakening in members that may have lost consciousness of that fact for them to examine themselves for a check and balance.Just yesterday I read some wise words from a platform that says that self advice is the most potent form of counsel. And the only way one can properly advise yourself is through self-evaluation. We should periodically check if we are really achieving our personal and organizational goals. We have to make sure we achieve both of them because achieving only personal goals may lead to less contribution to the forum and not achieving personal goals may lead to low morale or motivation. I will not say I have learned so much but I can attest that the more time I invest in the forum the wider my knowledge about bitcoin and other aspects of life. The bitcoin space is wide, complex, and dynamic so one needs to patiently keep learning and relearning. I have not regretted using my time in this forum because it has made me better skillfully, financially, politically, and so on. But as you advised, I will have to take a few house and examine my activities in the forum. Maybe listing some of the this I have learned will help me to determine if I have made some progress or not.",
