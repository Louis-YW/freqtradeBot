  "content": "Hello,I am a victim of the LocalBitcoins.com Exit scam.The behaviour is the same: the fraudulent exchanger, in this case LocalBitcoins.com, is implementing a never ending KYC request just to holding hostage the coins and keeping the bitcoin balance forever.My experience:I used this failed service, which is now closing, to deposit Bitcoins. I never bought bitcoins by bank wire or sketchy means.My identity was completely verified on December 2018, by using a Governement Identity Card and so on.I withdraw my Bitcoins on the first months of 2019: I was unable to withdraw a balance of 0.0071 BTC, because of a limit.I don't know if this was a bug. By the way, I have currently a balance of 0.0071 BTC leftover on my LocalBitcoins.com account.Now, in 2023, my bitcoin balance appreciate almost x10 and I would like to withdraw it. Moreover, LocalBitcoins.com is closing forever.Surprise: I cannot! I need to get another verification tier, including a video verification.This is crazy. Bear in mind that I never deposited a single cent in 3 years, so there's no reason to ask me for a new scrupolous verification. They said that I accepted their new policies, which is not true at all.I never accepted any new policies and even then, it's not a good reasons to refuse to refund my bitcoins.I even asked them to send back my coins to the original address, they refused.I read here and on reddit that I'm not the only victim. Beware of them, a real crappy and scammy company.",

IThe problem is that I never accepted their new policies (implemented in 2019) and I recently asked them, for weeks, for a BTC refund to my original address. That was denied and this LocalBitcoins position is unacceptable. I had an outstanding LCB profile, with positive feedback only. I only deposited BTC and never FIAT.I read about many people stuck in similar situations.",

Not in mine. In my case, back in the time, I withdraw as much as I could.I was unable to withdraw 0.0071 BTC because I got a limit error. That means that LocalBitcoins wanted an higher balance to withdraw and when I log in and tried to withdraw my 0.0071 BTC I got an insufficient balance error (more or less, I don't remember the exact error).In 2023, LCB is denying this problem. Maybe I encountered a bug, I don't know, but I assure you that I was technically unable to withdraw those funds back in 2019. Bear in mind that the 0.0071 was about 20 or 25 USD in 2019, so you understand that I was not so inspired to make a lot of complaints for 20 bucks...Quote see it as a correction and lesson, trade with decentralized p2p exchanges: https://kycnot.me/, and after you are done trading, move your funds into your self custody wallet like:Dude, I already know electrum, even the website kycnotme. Unfortunately this was not helpful because I encountered a shady Exchanger and a series of unfortunate circumstances, explained above.They are scamming me through loopholes. Trusting that I do not hire a lawyer because the hourly fees will be much higher than my current balance. Still a shady scam. I'm also wondering about all the inactive accounts that holds some balance... back in the time few bucks, now several hundred or thousands of dollars because of BTC appreciation. They are pocketing everything in a \"legal\" way in just 12 months since you have 1 year to withdraw.",

Now what everyone in this thread is telling you is that they have the right, according to their TOS to request for more verification from you, not that it is a good thing to do, but that is how centralized exchanges work, and that is what LocalBitcoins turned into when they started asking for KYC from their users. You have to comply with their verification process or they would 'steal' your funds.Quote from: localbitcoinscam on February 27, 2023, 04:46:25 PMTrusting that I do not hire a lawyer because the hourly fees will be much higher than my current balance.

Agreed, but before we had exchanges like Binance and other CEXs, p2p exchanges like LocalBitcoins were the go to place because you could easily move crypto in and out without the need of KYC but ever since centralized exchanges came in the picture, regulation found its way into these businesses and the game has never been the same.",
