I don't know how much you were earning before or exactly what work you were doing but if you enjoy posting you can get a nice bonus for doing it here.You can check out the Services section to see what's on offer and what the pay is. For Hero/Legendary $100 a week is average I would say, and if you are one of the more exceptional contributors between $200 and $250, although there are a select few who earn even more but for that you have to be in the top ten of the forum, and I would say top five.",

Can anyone tell me some trustworthy sites, where someone can work and earn reasonable amount of bitcoin?If you have been into Bitcoin for sometime then you should know that there aren't many well known freelancing sites where a user can earn Bitcoin. The only site that can help you to earn some good amount Bitcoin is this forum because in this forum anyone who contributes information and stuff and ranks up to full member or above rank member can generate some amount of Bitcoin by applying avatars or signatures on his/her profile.You can also earn some Bitcoin if you have services that you can offer on this forum. For that kind of service you'll have to go to services board and create your thread there. Sometimes there are other tasks that could also help you to earn some Bitcoin on this forum. You can also participate in contests, free raffles, games and rounds to generate some bitcoin from this forum. If you're a hard working person and you give your best to your work then this forum is the place for you.Many members of the forum are earning substantial income from the signature and avatar campaigns of this forum, but in order to avail those opportunities you will have to rank up to at least full member rank. Once again if you're hard working and at the same time you can contribute good information to the forum then surely you can reach that rank within 4 months.",

Because here you can share these thoughts over time to increase your account. At least be eligible to join in some campaigns. But it all takes sacrifice, time, energy, and thoughts that must be devoted. Even though I don't guarantee that you can easily get paid in Bitcoin. The most important thing is to enjoy the process, you will understand everything from time to time.",

First of all they are paying cents for your time and then often enough there is a minimum withdrawal which forces you to spend hours and hours so gain maybe 5$, not worth it.As everybody already said, this forum ist by far the best option, even though you have to at first invest time and effort to built some level here.I wish I found this forum earlier, not only for the signature campaign but for the many informations and nice people you can find. A good place to educate yourself, learn about news and also, make some extra cash on the side. Can't get it better.",

But if you wanted to earn in BTC, then BTT is the best place for you. Because it is filled with many services and tasks that one could do to earn BTC. There are many faucets available too, but those are for those who have a lot of followers, because in my experience, only those with a huge fan following could earn a decent amount from faucets.Well, besides faucets, you can earn by joining signature, contest, and review campaigns in the service section. You could also provide your own skills in exchange for BTC as a a payment method.PS: I do not know about any other site other than BTT.",

So its quite good to have here, if anyone could find any other place, I doubt it would be as high paying as this one, it would be quite difficult to arrange something like that because its rare to get that much attention. I remember reddit had moonbux or something like that at some point, but I am not sure if its still valid anymore.

As I have seen many members here joining just to earn money and making posts that are of no use or value, I am not criticising anyone; instead, I am just trying to shed some light on the statement that you made. If you decide to earn from signatures, then you should not take posting as a task but instead post like you talk on WhatsApp or any other social media app.Now a days, people are wasting a lot of time on Snapchat, and in my opinion, other than that, they should spend their time here because they will learn new things here, and new things always open doors to earnings.OP should take this forum as a discussion forum, join the discussions, share useful insights, and get ranked. If he is eligible for competition, he will be given a chance, but that's also not for sure. I mean, we should not just rekindle someone's hope that he will definitely earn; instead, achievements and valuable insights are also necessary. But OP could earn from bounties, but the drawback is that they do not pay in BTC but instead in shit coins. But Op could join contests or review campaigns, just like the recent campaign run by Royse, where people earned more than 90 dollars.",
