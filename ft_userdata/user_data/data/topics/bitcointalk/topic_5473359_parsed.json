Furthermore, to succeed here find areas where you are good at learning if you don't have much to offer and develop your knowledge. Take you for instance, some are good with trading just like me, while some have good knowledge about Bitcoin, and some are good when it comes to economics, politics, gambling, etc, whichever one you find easy to learn or contribute then go for it and have quality contribution in those boards, but never forget the main purpose of this forum is aimed at spreading information about Bitcoin. Â  Then after you have done that, start practicing and passing that knowledge or information to those whom you would find in your shoes in the future.I hope this little contribution can be of help to you.",

And talking about spamming and plagiarism, how do I know if the post am about to post has been posted here before?Una say as a newbie make person dey ask questions, I don ask my own o, and I hope it makes sense. I just need some help to grow.I am also a newbie mate,but talking aboutÂ  spamming, 1 of the main thing that bring about spamming the most is that you should avoid copy and paste from the internet you should be trying your possibe best to be making quotes from your head, i know that our head is not the same but still i believe you can be doing something about that,and Talking about plagiarism, for me ooo how i use to avoid plagiarism is that i use to give my sef enough time for a post that i want to reply to check page to pages to see if the reply that i am about to made as been done before that how i avoid spamming and plagiarism as a newbie.",
