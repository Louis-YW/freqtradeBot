I've not seen such prices like on your website, too expensive. I don't intend using them, but have flocked around such websites and I thought the fun of selling social media services is keeping it very cheap. Why Spam the forum? I found this same post on project development board.",

We also provide blockchain payment construction services and webshell services.@Accardo is right; these services you are posting should not be in the Bitcoin discussion. So I'm just curious, dude, if that's okay with you. Why are you selling YouTube and Twitter accounts? This means that these social media accounts of yours that I mentioned have huge numbers of subscribers and followers, right?Aren't the ones you're selling from hacked accounts, dude? Because there are other big accounts on YouTube and Twitter that we hear about being hacked, the exploiters will sell the acquired account and change the name. I hope the accounts you are selling are not like that. I didn't mean anything by what I said; I am just stating the facts.",

In addition, my account is not a black account stolen by hackers. I registered through a formal channel. Thank you for your feedback.",
