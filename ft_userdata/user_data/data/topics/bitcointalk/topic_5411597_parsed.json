      "body": "The answer is if that's creditor's choice. some may probably hold their assets and the rest may dump it instantly. Those people who have funds in mtgox have become instant millionaire. They will not be missing the opportunity to become the next millionaire. So many creditors can buy lambo for that. I guess many of them will be selling their bitcoin but that's their choice. We can't predict it for sure caused by that's personal intention.",

How long has this been going on? It will soon be 10 years.  If those bitcoins are still distributed, it would be foolish to sell them now. Many people understand that bitcoin's value grows over time, so I would hazard a guess that many investors will hold bitcoins.",

But no matter how bitcoin dump it's going to bounce back.",

The most recent ATH was 69k and now bitcoin is trading around 20k, if I get my bitcoins back during this time I won't sell them immediately and will keep holding and wait for a bull season other. We are victims of that year and we have waited almost 10 years there is no reason for us to sell as low as now. that's my prediction.",

In my opinion if those people can't be forced to hodl their assets. those bitcoins are compensations for them from the incident that happened with mtgox. I would not be surprised to see that if there will be some people selling their bitcoin until some points like getting some funds from the market to be used as their reserved funds. They may think holding bitcoin may be very volatile but not for exchanging it for cash that may hold their value. I do know that selling at the bottom price like this is so stupid caused by they can get more money by waiting for another pump",
