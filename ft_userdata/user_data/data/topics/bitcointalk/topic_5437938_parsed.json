I can't imagine myself regretting something that I could have done while it's not too late. Risking is a part of success, because that's how you're gonna find out if it's worth it or not. Trying is a part of growing, even if you failed, at least you've tried and learned something from it, rather than living all your life from what if(s).",

That's literally the opposite of what should happen in theory.He got me confused too on his analogy but by making an assumption, I think he means more people buying and selling since having a huge number of trader that doesn't care about long-term investment will surely give a negative impact on Bitcoin price once fear is already high. I think the fear of buying and panic selling is what this thread is all about which is negligible for all the investors that looking at the future price and not the zoom-in price interaction.",

So I still have the doubt of Bitcoin shooting higher  just as we are expecting in 2024.Throughout all these years with Bitcoin, I have learned one simple truth.Ask yourself one simple question before you start despairing: Would you be having such fearful thoughts if Bitcoin was currently in a bull market going over 70k+ ? I think the answer is quite simple. No you would not. So why start doubting Bitcoin during a bear market? Even if right now seems like Bitcoin was supposed to rise back up, things do not go as planned. You need to believe in the long term potential!",

I think it's better to have a rethink on bitcoin and do more research about the network to understand better how the price happens. After the research you'll have a different view of bitcoin, as your response doesn't sound right or correct, but you are a newbie, and it says a lot about the post. The market wasn't created to ignite fear on people rather to remove anxiety. Take the price of bitcoin today and don't worry about what it'll be tomorrow. Like you pointed, which is true, it's difficult to determine accurately what the market price would be, the best decision is to join the market, given time it'll be easier for you, instead of staying afraid, you'll discover that your mind would begin to work like that of the other investors who don't care much about the price before purchasing bitcoin. Fiat is already failing citizens and bitcoin is a good form of money that'll deliver people from the stress Fiat is causing them; inflation. I'd say that you should be happy that Bitcoin is here, don't be afraid. \"If you are afraid don't do it, if you are doing it don't be afraid.\"  - Ghenghis Khan.",

But yes, historically bitcoin always gets its new highest price once every 4 years or after the halving maybe you can see on Google or on YouTube about it in full how bitcoin can do that. Feelings like what you are feeling right now maybe veterans also felt the same way before ATH 2021 was created, so maybe those of you who are still unsure you can learn it again.",

Some people loose, when bitcoin's price raises and some when it falls. It depends on the used kind of trade. Taken your example, buying bitcoin and prices fall: you don't lose one penny unless you sell.I personally fear more things like hackers, scams and stealing or even losing passphrases. That's the thing we should care about when trading or investing in cryptos. I have no fear about price of bitcoin. If it falls, I buy. If it raises I sell. Just simple as that. Depressions and pain will take place, when people do not follow the wellknown basic rules of trading with cryptos. But you are right, trust is one of the most important keywords around in cryptos world.",

This has a technique, so you learn in advance how to predict the price of bitcoin going up and down and there are analysts who can see the movement of bitcoin as a whole.Starting to doubt that bitcoin can't be high anymore? Did you see the previous history of bitcoin, even every 4 years bitcoin always experiences an increase that reaches a new ATH again.Continue to ask for a lower price? This is clearly a fallacy. How is it possible that bitcoins are limited while the demand for many is lower? This doesn't make sense, so if you don't believe in bitcoin then you don't need to dig anymore because basically I believe bitcoin is an asset that will go up again.I think you should learn more about understanding bitcoin.",

For there to be up there is also the down. bitcoin investment is not all about profit-making there is a season for losses as people claim they make money from bitcoin so also people claim that the Bitcoin rake them.So we should be prepared to face the two edges sword and not only accepting one and shying away from the other.",
