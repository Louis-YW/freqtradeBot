  "content": "Following a letter to the Editor of financial express, one line quotes;Singapore's development thinker Kishore Mahbubani offered three secrets of development miracle attained by the Southeast Asian city state within a generation.The three are meritocracy, pragmatism and honesty (MPH). He insists that the best and most talented people should be appointed in all critical positions in the state affairs and governance process. In any situation, merit, not nepotism, should be given priority. Pragmatism is something that was applied best by China's Deng Xiao Peng in introducing some aspects of the market economy in Communist system. Honesty is the most important and difficult part of the process, according to Mahbubani. Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew enforced both meritocracy and honesty, while leading his country. Mahbubani strongly feels that any country in the world shine if MPH formula is adopted.Shehzada QaiyyumDhanmondi, DhakaRead more at:https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/print/mph-formula-for-development-1600608053I used Singapore as my case of study because of the rate of its development following a strongly imbibed and deep seated culture with an acronym to form M.P.H- which means meritocracy, pragmatic and honest. This entails getting the right man/leader for the job based on merits, based on his good decision prowess(your ideology doesn't matter, if it works, keep it), based on candid opinion and truth. It is irrespective of religion, race, beliefs, tribe/language, family background.We the  citizens and masses of a country or even in the businesses we run, should select leaders rightly based on these acronym and imbibe its essence into our culture and modus operandi. There is no way good  development won't overshadow corruption if this MPH formula is applied.What do you think? Let's discuss!",
