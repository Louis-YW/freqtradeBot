Don't trust, verify!I don't think there's an \"official\" source either way. The files weren't released under one's signature. Even Satoshi, back in 2009 only left his PGP key, but the binaries weren't signed. Sourceforge, web archive, bitcointrading can, therefore, all alter the files effectively.",

I don't know how they officially labeled the version since there's no \"readme\" on those old commitsso I guess the version in \"build.txt\" are for the previous release if it wasn't updated yet.BTW, someone already mentioned above that the \"Tags\" can go back to v0.1.5, if you only need the source of the releases, you can download those there.",
