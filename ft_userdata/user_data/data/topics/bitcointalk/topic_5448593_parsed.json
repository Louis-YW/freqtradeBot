I will buy a benefit of the doubt that what you told us is truth but let's say that it is like a trend, days ago I read a topic 10 years of Bitcointalk (and Bitcoin)You have two more topics which I think you can use one of them for celebration too.A word of inspiration and hint.A world of motivationYou are so lucky if you bought it 7 years ago and actually did good backup which is usable nowadays. Congratulations if you have it and can sell it above $30,000 which is not a price many people dreamed of 7 years ago.",

Back to OP, your story is really inspiring. That shows the true potential of Bitcoin, and those who have invested in Bitcoin in it's early days have earned a lot from it. I would congratulate you for holding your Bitcoin this far. I hope that you will earn even more from your investment.",

Bitcoin is not meant to be stored in a centralized exchange or a custodial wallet; store your bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet so you can have full control over your asset. If the exchange you left that coin on was dead, that means they would have made off with your coin.",

I had no idea Bitcoin's price would rise to around $70000 at the time. If I had known that, I would have surely invested. If we go back to 2016, we will feel that the price cannot go up because it is too high; it may dump, but it will not. It's the same for us now; perhaps we'll say the same thing that was said so that we don't put off investing in Bitcoin since we can keep up with the price increase because we're still in the discounted zone.Quotejust imagine that if you bought 0.9 Bitcoin and hold it till now, how will you feel? If I had invested in Bitcoin in 2016, and I still have it now, I would be very happy, but I would be disappointed that I did not sell while the price of Bitcoin was still about $60,000.

However it doesn't matter if it was here in 2015 the price of Bitcoin was very low maybe $200-300. If you've been holding onto Bitcoin ever since then you should definitely appreciate your patience. You didn't sell when Bitcoin hit a high of $69,000, so how long will you hold on like this? Currently the price of Bitcoin is $30k still if you sell you will have more than 100x profit.

And he/she's been doing this for some time, perhaps to earn enough merits and rank up and be qualified to apply for a signature campaign. OP is trying hard to rise through the ranks to perhaps earn a few bucks when finally accepted in a signature campaign. It's sad that he/she's doing this through lies. Yesterday, he/she said:Quote from: uche6215 on April 12, 2023, 08:57:30 PMGood day everyone I am here to announce that today has made me my 7th year as a Bitcoin investor, I am the happiest person today because Bitcoin has given me a lot of gains through investments. I have invested in Bitcoin since the gear 2015 and I have hold my coins for a long time I almost forgot about it because I even deleted the application I used to purchase Bitcoin...A couple of months ago, he/she shared:Quote from: uche6215 on February 03, 2023, 01:23:36 PMMy first experience about Bitcoin, I was busy saying Bitcoin is a scam for about let me say 1 year and some month not untill a friend of mine was into forex trading so I visited him and I was watching what he was doing so one day he made a big hit for about $2000 for just a night. And That's what push me more to trade Bitcoin with forex trading I didn't pay to learn.So OP's first Bitcoin experience happened recently after dismissing it as a scam for more than a year? Or if it's true that he/she's been a Bitcoin investor for 7 years now, then he/she must have already known Bitcoin since 2015 or 2014. He/she must be an early adopter?But he/she also said that:Quote from: uche6215 on March 14, 2023, 07:44:05 AMGood day everyone, I am here to share my testimony on how Bitcoin has favored me, I have been a Bitcoin investor for a couple of years now even before I joined this forum,  although I don't know much about Bitcoin I have been quite favored through bitcoin. This post gained him/her a bunch of merits, but it was just made last month. And if he/she's been \"a Bitcoin investor for a couple of years now,\" why is he/she celebrating his/her 7th anniversary as a Bitcoin investor yesterday? And if he/she knew Bitcoin many years ago, why is he/she admitting that he/she actually doesn't know much about Bitcoin?And then as to his/her first Bitcoin experience, it seems there's another one:Quote from: uche6215 on February 16, 2023, 02:48:04 PMMy belief on Bitcoin was formed when a friend of mine in the school bought a new car with he's profit, at first I didn't believe him untill I saw he's Bitcoin transactions I was like wow, at that time I was forced to learn little about Bitcoin stuff.",

No matter what kind of wallet he holds BTC in, but he still owns it until now, and he has not failed. At that time, knowledge about bitcoin was limited, and its value was not too high, so it was not their fault that they used centralized platforms to store bitcoins. By the way, not all centralized platforms are scamming you, I mean, I don't recommend people to store their bitcoins on centralized exchanges, but if you know about Coinbase, they have also existed since 2012 to present.",
