But the way the device looks and feels should be of secondary importance. You aren't going to marry the thing, you don't need it to look good, and feel expensive. But if you want that as well, you are going to have to pay for it much more than with a standard hardware wallet.  Many hardware wallets look weird. Ledgers look like USB drives. Trezors look like old remote controls for ACs minus the buttons. Foundation Devices look like cordless phones or old models of cell phones. They probably look strange and unattractive to anyone born in the smartphone era. But that doesn't matter as long as they do what they were designed to do, and that's keeping your private keys in a safe place and providing you with a security boost when signing transactions.",

It did not even list on this thread [1] which has 80+ hardware wallets so it is not a well-known hardware wallet. Ledger nano x seems to be a wise choice and I love to have it too, it has a cool design like a USB stick that has a cover on the top that protects it. But in purchasing those hardware wallets just make sure you are in a legitimate reseller posted above of this comment. Be careful because it will perhaps you will buy a tampered hardware wallet that already compromised the seed. [1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5282364.0",

Yeah, there should be plenty of time to have the package shipped to Italy. Trezor ships from the Czech Republic and Ledger sends their packages from France. Everything is within the EU, so taxes will be covered in the final price you pay. Shipping the products to a non-EU country would probably save you €10-15, but the countries customs office could require you to pay tax and customs fees. Each country has different laws. But since you are in the EU, you don't need to care about that.",
