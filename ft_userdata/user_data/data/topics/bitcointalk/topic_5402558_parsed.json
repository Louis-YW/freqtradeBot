  "content": "QuoteArguably the UK’s most notorious sports bettor, Tony Bloom, is the owner of Starlizard, a company that describes itself as a betting consultancy.Based out of Camden, London, Starlizard is also the sole adviser for Bloom’s betting syndicate, who every weekend have £1 million riding on any given football game.This makes Starlizard the biggest betting syndicate in Britain and it is believed they make roughly £100 million a year, but that would be an average year.Due to the secrecy surrounding the company, little is known about their total earnings, although it’s quite safe to assume it’s in the billions of pounds.Starlizard’s 160 employees use complex statistical models to generate football odds that are more accurate than those offered by bookmakers. They even take into account the weather forecast and the overall morale of a team!These ‘sharper’ odds are then sold to their clients so they themselves can beat the market! His much respected advice generates £13.8 million annually from customers.1Betting consultants are gurus who have cracked the secret code of increasing one's chances of beating the bookies and sportsbooks. They provide professional betting advice to clients. Betting consultants have the experience, the reputation (they have consistently generated profits for clients over time), the expertise, and the necessary information needed to make the right betting decision. They are not Jack of all trades instead, they have their specialty. Specializing in one or more but not all of the following sports - Football, Baseball, Boxing, Horse Racing, Cricket, Basketball, UFC, Golf, and Motosport at both the professional and other levels. According to ZipRecruiter, the national average salary of a Sports Betting Consultant per year in the US is $69,887. 2Just like Tony Bloom and others, it is possible that you can turn your hobby into a profitable business venture if you are confident of your skillsets. Have you ever considered a career in betting consultancy?Source1. https://www.tradematesports.com/blog/brighton-football-owner-tony-bloom-people-rich-sports-betting2. https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Jobs/Sports-Betting-Consultant",

      "body": "It seems like a tough career path since you have to prove yourself by becoming a tipster and maintain a consistent win rate throughout thousands of picks. I enjoy making picks as a gambler but I wouldn't take that career as it feels like you're carrying a heavy pressure behind your back as their money would be tied to your picks. I remember there used to be a guy here in the gambling discussion that started a thread about their betting syndicate or maybe it was similar to a betting group as they have different guys focused on a single sport and he was also sharing some free picks once in a while.",

These sets of persons make money mostly and their annual revenue is more from people who pay them for such tips. It is always better to develop the skill set than trust someone else blindly without an opinion of your own. Taking betting tips is very risky, you cannot always guarantee the betting consultant's state of mind which can easily be affected by situations.Quote from: Davidvictorson on June 14, 2022, 10:41:13 AMHave you ever considered a career in betting consultancy?For safety reasons, i wouldn't... especially when they have to pay me for it. I can give an unpaid tip which i will advice the person taking the yip to consider and not follow blindly, but i wouldn't want to take money for it, because consider a situation where someone who i collected money from for a tip and he lost a major amount to it staking with confidence, if he is the irresponsible kind, he may come after me wanting to get back his money and this may pose a danger to my life, family & close friends. So to not find myself in that situation, i cannot consider a career in betting consultancy.",

I don't see myself in this kind of career because I am not that good in prediction, I don't spend most of my time playing bets or forecasting games. I know of people that can work accurately I'm this kind of career due to their devotion and time that had been invested in gambling. I have met with few gambling consultant  but I don't think they could have this kind of success because gambling is not mostly appreciated in my region. This result is very surprising looking at the success level of Tony Bloom as a gambling consultant. It is amazing to see this king of success!",

This is not easy because we have to really understand the sport we are going to analyze, so maybe we need to learn to analyze a match and find which team or player has a chance to win. If we are used to analyzing this, we will have a good ability to analyze a match.",

In the first place reputation is the first and foremost thing you have to build up here and that's something really difficult imo without any type of big connections. After than, you're only customer base would probably come from bigshots, and seeing as they'd probably be pretty low on number compared to the number of consultants, well, it'd probably be a tight competition. I myself haven't really wanted to do it nor have I ever thought of it, but just thinking about it already gives me a headache on how to even start off with it.",

Let's say this is so (I don't believe in it), but then why would they advise someone instead of playing on behalf of many front men and earning much more money than they receive from consultations? I don't see any logic in this. I know that information providers earn money, but their earnings are understandable - their job is to provide information and the better does the analysis himself.",

However, it is possible to open consultation or rehabilitation services for those addicted to gambling and drug addiction who have government permits. Psychologist services are also one of the lucrative ones, some of my friends who are psychologists have so far managed to get a promising monthly income but of course they must first graduate as a Master of Psychology to build this licensed service.",
