If you give me a post, update about it, that is a good update/ warning/ signal, just don't over discuss about it hereI only list campaign managers and management services for campaigns paid in Bitcoin BTC. Some of them also provide bounty management, but I don't list bounty management services hereI can list or reject to list any service and manager here. Personal thread, personal choice as initially I create this thread for my personal use. If I reject to list any service here, and you still want to promote it, let's shill it else where.Being listed here does not mean that service is good. Not being listed here does not mean that service is bad. Please do your own research.For service providers who have yet create Service Announcement threads, please do it and ping me to update with relevant linksI know some managers are doing management for their own companies as official company representatives, so I don't name them here. Because they will probably not use these accounts to manage other campaignsI much appreciate community help to update this thread, but please only ping me about lively services. For inactive services, please don't ping me!Please: Don't spam and use any bumping service, require newbies in your campaign to shill your service here!Overview of Bitcointalk Services from Bitcointalk MembersServices:*||Active*||In-Active*||Retired*||Account issues trust, flag, change hands, etc. Graphic Designers List in alphabetical orders|Name|Rank|Service|ANN|Contact|Notes||Baoo*|Full member|Web Design & DEV, NFT, Banners, Stickers, ANN's, 3D, Videos|Here|PM|||bubbalex*|Sr. Member|Animated stickers, Illustration, Banner, NFT, Roadmap, Logo|Here|PM|||Heisenberg_Hunter*|Legendary|Signature, ANN, Avatar|Here|PM|||hugeblack*|Legendary|Signature|Here|PM|||icalical*|Sr. Member|Telegram Sticker, ANN, Signature, Banners, Animation|Here|PM|||jayce*|Legendary|Signature, Avatar, Logo, Banner|Here|PM|||madnessteat*|Legendary|Hat Avatar|N/A|PM|Free service||Maus0728*|Legendary|Drawings|Here|PM|||Meddzs*|Full Member|Websites, ANNs, WPs, Banners, infographics|Here|PM|||mosdesign*|Jr. Member|Website, Logo, Banner|Here|PM|||m4urow*|Newbie|Web design, graphic design, branding & identity|Here|PM|||NAVI12*|Member|Signature, ANN|Here|PM|||Necromancy*|Newbie|ANN thread, Logo, Banner, Animation|Here|PM|||notblox1*|Legendary|Making LOGOS for Bitcoin üñåÔ∏è|Here|PM|||payjoe93*|Sr. Member|Telegram Animated Stickers|Here|PM|||roslinpl*|Legendary|Signature, Logo, Banner, video clip|Here|PM|Changed hands ?||TheLead123*|Newbie|Website, Logo, Banner|Here|PM|||xhomerx10*|Legendary|Hat Avatar in Wall Observer|N/A|PM|Free service||Zwei*|Sr. Member|Signature|Here|PM||Campaign Managers List in alphabetical orders|Name|Rank|ANN|Contact|Notes||BoXXoB*|Legendary|ANN|PM|||BTC_Mouse*|Member|Here|PM|||CCMS*|Member|ANN|PM|||Coin_trader*|Hero Member|ANN|PM|||cryptofrka*|Hero Member|N/A|PM|||DroomieChikito*|Legendary|Here|PM|||Gianluca95*|Legendary|Here|PM|||Hhampuz*|Legendary|Here|PM|||icopress*|Legendary|N/A|PM|||irfan_pak10*|Legendary|Here|PM|||joeperry*|Full Member|Here|PM|||julerz12*|Hero Member|Here|PM|||Little Mouse*|Legendary|Here|PM|||Murat*|Hero Member|Here|PM|||roycilik*|Legendary|Here|PM|||Royse777*|Legendary|Here|PM|||shasan*|Hero Member|N/A|PM|||sujonali1819*|Legendary|Here|PM|||suzanne5223*|Hero Member|Here|PM|||TalkStar*|Hero Member|Here|PM|||The Cryptovator*|Legendary|Here|PM|||Torra*|Full Member|Here|PM|||notocactus*|Legendary|Here|PM|||Trofo*|Legendary|N/A|PM|||Upgrade00*|Legendary|Here|PM|||worldofcoins*|Sr. Member|ANN|PM|||wwzsocki*|Legendary|Here|PM|||yahoo62278*|Legendary|Here|PM||Lending Service List in alphabetical orders|Name|Rank|ANN|Contact|Notes||condoras*|Legendary|Here|PM|7.5 - 11%, 7-day to 20-day||DarkStar_*|Legendary|Here|PM|BTC, USDT | 2.70%-5.01% Monthly||LoyceV*|Legendary|Here|PM|Lightning Loan, 1% interest/ week||shasan*|Hero Member|Here|PM|USDT/BTC/LTC/ETH/DOGE/ETC - Flexible rates||zazarb*|Legendary|Here|PM|0-‚àû%|Telegram / Discord Community Managers in alphabetical orders|Name|Rank|ANN|Contact|Notes||Coin_trader*|Hero Member|Here|PM|||igehhh*|Legendary|Here|PM|||JanEmil*|Hero Member|Here|PM|||Royse777*|Legendary|Here|PM|||Stedsm*|Legendary|Here|PM|||notocactus*|Legendary|Here|PM|||wwzsocki*|Legendary|Here|PM||Publication Providers List in alphabetical orders|Name|Rank|ANN|Contact|Notes||igehhh*|Legendary|Here|PM|Yahoo News + 300 Premium news/ crypto sites||Royse777*|Legendary|Here|PM|||wwzsocki*|Legendary|Here|PM|All top media outlets!||wwzsocki*|Legendary|Here|PM|EmoneyMax.net - Crypto Marketing Services|ReferencesWhy reference?They are topics from which I learn and use (with or without) adjustments on table formats, abbreviation definitions, etc.They are topics from which I have ideas to create this oneThey are inactive topics (no update recent months)Let's read.Overview of Bitcointalk Signature-Ad CampaignsOverview of Bitcointalk Designers(Signature,Avatar,etc)[Translators] List of Bitcointalk Translators [LIST] List of User who offer Rental SIGNATURE/AVATAR/TEXT space[LIST] Bitcointalk's Lending Services",
