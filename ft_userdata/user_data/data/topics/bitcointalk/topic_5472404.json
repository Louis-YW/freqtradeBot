Sometimes, these errors can be specific to certain scenarios or connections, like thyemos pointed out last time (weird thing) might be causing this issue again. Just remember, even Bitcointalk needs a coffee break now and then! ðŸ˜‰Quote from: theymos on October 12, 2023, 01:10:36 PMIt was the same weird thing which caused a few hours of downtime 6-12 months ago, and I think it's what causes the few minutes of downtime people observe every few weeks. I've never been able to figure out what causes it. It looks like the network gets cut between the web server and the database for a while. It seems to always happen at around the same time, so I suppose it's probably some automated maintenance process messing something up",

I hope this gets fixed and we don't have such experiences again.It is true that we have had several of these records. But we also cannot forget that the forum is visited by thousands of people all the time, and the more people there are, the easier it is to detect these cases.@theymos has already informed that an upgrade to the server is planned at the beginning of next year. Therefore, we must try to know how to deal with this situation, until this upgrade occurs. The forum is too big to make these changes from one day to the next.",

It's difficult to diagnose, since it happens rarely, and usually when I'm sleeping.I'm planning on upgrading the main servers sometime in the next few months. (Just as part of standard maintenance: there will be no user-visible changes other than perhaps slightly improved speed.) Maybe that'll fix it just by virtue of moving things to different areas.(The few minutes of downtime just now was due to me doing something, and is unrelated.)",

So maybe something happens, as admin thought, when some program tries to start to do something. It probably tried to start at least twice today and maybe it did what it expected to do and that's why it is over so fast. Or maybe it uses so many resources that it freezes the server when overuses server resources... Both cases could look valid, but of course it would be good to know the exact reason, to not to face that one day forum will be off for days, not just minutes or hours.",
