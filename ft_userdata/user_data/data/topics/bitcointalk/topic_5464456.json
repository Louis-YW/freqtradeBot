      "body": "I have also seen these types of news stories since two days ago. And TBH, we should not develop hope for something that would discourage us from developing hope for next time. This means we should not develop that huge hope of reaching BTC at $150k. Instead, we should check the facts and not fall prey to such sentiments, which are luring more people into thinking that they will become rich in a short time.Dear Op I totally respect your post and your valuable insights, but all I am trying to say here is that we should not place our hopes on something not real but fictional, but at the same time I am also not saying that BTC cannot reach that target because that is why BTC is the most famous and favourable coin for investment opportunities because it always exceeds expectations. Still, I am sharing my ideas, which might be good to some extent, but other than that, it is everyone's decision to build hope or not.Even when I saw the news, I barely stopped myself from calculating the returns. heheh. I know that's funny, but I really stopped myself and said to myself that instead of imagining something that is yet to happen, we should work harder to get more Satoshi.",

Futures doesn't count because it's not the real thing, just an instrument for fiat users to bet on bitcoin without touching the thing. Let's not get too excited because it's been more than 5 years since people are talking about a possible ETF in the US. Also, there's already one in the EU and one in Canada if I'm not wrong and there's no positive impact on price. What makes you think these people won't short bitcoin like those that have money in that futures ETF? When it went live, the 2017 bull market ended.",

Of course, investing in ETFs at the right time might be even more lucrative.The discussion on BTC spot etf proposals and possible approvals continues, we have had so many discussions on spot etf's recently. The sec may or may not approve these proposals and i don't think it would mean that BTC price wouldn't rise as high as this after the next halving. It is true that spot etf's would attract investors who don't want to own BTC keys but want exposure in the currency, but there is enough demand from people who buy BTC's the way it should be bought; and once the supply is halfed, BTC price is expected to go very high even without the approval of the sec on spot etf's.",

I think what's going on is that huge companies like BlackRock which are waiting for their approvals right now do what they can to increase their chances of getting one. Leaking info into the media can be done to aid that goal, so that the SEC feels public pressure to give an approval. I remain sceptical about a potential ETF approval from the SEC, and this article isn't convincing to me. But if the approval actually happens, I do agree it can spark BTC rally.",

Its the biggest among the institutions so why would SEC approve a low-level institution. As of this moment, everyone is expecting it to happen.

Some entities cannot directly buy bitcoin but can hold an ETF or indirectly get some exposure through Micro Strategy.

Yeah, like when the ATH of $20k was reached and it was like impossible to be back there again.
