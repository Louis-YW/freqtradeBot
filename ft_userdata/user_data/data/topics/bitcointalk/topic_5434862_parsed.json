  "content": "Hi everyone. Got myself into the weeds. I've been working on this for about 2 days  Was trying to get mempool running with a node and instead messed up the bitcoin explorer.Im getting: No RPC ConnectionThis explorer currently is failing to connect to your Bitcoin core node.Check your connection details (host & port for Bitcoin Core) as well as your authentication details (username, password, etc).All of these parameters need to be specified in a \".env\" file or via commandline parameters. See the project homepage to review how to configure this explorer.Thanks!",

Since you're also running an Electrum server together with Bitcoin Explorer,You should consider opening your own topic with information about any other programs that you're running or one setting that fixes another may break the other.Using the .cookie file should also work but Bitcoin Explorer must know where to find it if it's not in the default directory.If you can't find env file (you must have run the program \"as-is\"), you can also use a command line option to set it.Refer to their configuration instructions in their GitHub Repo, here: github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration",

Shouldn't it run out of the box when enabled?Quote from: 9juan1 on February 26, 2024, 06:00:10 PMSince I'm running this node on a VM, I am not sure where to access the .env file. You will have to try to find such details in the documentation of myNode. As I'm not familiar with myNode, I can't tell, sorry.I run nodes with RaspiBlitz where it's fairly easy to tinker with config files for optional modules. With nodes that are setup based on RaspiBolt (doesn't need to run on a Raspi 4B or 5) you configure everything yourself (some Linux experience is of great help).My other Umbrel node has every optional module in docker containers. I didn't tinker much with my Umbrel but as far as I see, most of the config files are exposed to the docker host file system where you can apply changes. Persistant changes are another beast, i.e. changes that should survive a module update or similar. The Umbrel UI doesn't provide many options for this and I guess this is their policy (eye candy is more important than configurability options).Persistant changes in myNode could also be challenging if you don't understand how myNode is setup internally.",
