Nothing to see here.The action of broadcasting a raw transaction is not particularly interesting because they are still verified using the standard network node procedures. If the transaction is in any way invalid, all nodes and miners will reject it, and this code doesn't introduce anything new in that regard.",

But it doesn't seem useful.Quote from: krashfire on April 04, 2023, 08:58:09 AMIt somehow sends fake information to the mining pool on the amount of hashes it actually has and squat on the same network as other Bitcoin miners and takeÂ  a share too..Mining pools don't ask miners how many hashes they have.Â  They just give some work, and then wait for the participant to complete the work. You prove that you've completed the work by submitting a valid nonce for the work given. It isn't possible to find a valid nonce without generating the actual hashes.",
