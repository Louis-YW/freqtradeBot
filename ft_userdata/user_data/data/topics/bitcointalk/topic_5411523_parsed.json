ASTROSPACES was the decentralized launchpad for the token space, while it's decentralized, we opened airdrop for a while so everyone could participate. In the space you can write your wallet address and specifies if you want to be a liquidity pool provider so we transfer eligible tokens amount https://astrospaces.io/symbol/RGC/0x85Dfd0d267E364B87d58d5B1b91d3D5b8dceE15Din that poll request we want to vote if the Rage comics are really the original memes on the internet ? and is it fair and good to trade that as a meme decentralized token ?",
