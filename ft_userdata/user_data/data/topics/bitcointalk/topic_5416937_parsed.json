Biden is right in there with the weakest of them.

I don't know exactly how it works but I'm sure that disobeying an order at such a high level could land you in jail for a long time. Apart from the fact that if the enemies have dropped an atomic bomb on your country, the pressure to obey the chain of command is much greater.",

What if his intention was not to take more? My argument is about the lost of lives in the war and from your point it is not preventable knowing who Putin is and what he is up to. Let us hope this war is eventually brought to an end so that reconstruction and rehabilitation can begin. Both countries are now damaged psychologically.",
