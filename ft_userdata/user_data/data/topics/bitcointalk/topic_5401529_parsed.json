  "content": "New analysis finds consumers reported losing more than $1 billion in #cryptocurrency to scams since 2021Social media blamed for $1B in crypto scam losses in 2021What has the government doing so far to regulate social media like they are regulating exchanges, despite that people that are using social media like Facebook, Instagram and many others do not have privacy, scammers and illicit actors still make use of the same social media to scam people. From just 2021 to 2022 first quarter, people have been scammed over $1 billion on social media. Federal Trade Commission (FCT) found that Instagram (32%), Facebook (26%), Whatsapp (9%), and Telegram (7%) were the top platforms used for crypto scams. Twitter, the social media platform widely adopted by the crypto-community, was not mentioned despite being littered with spam and scam bots touting fake crypto-giveaways.The funniest to me is that scam is not new on social media, but it is becoming commoner and the scam on social media regard crypto is increasing, definitely all other scam are increasing on social media. When social media is not a place of privacy, why not require for ID documents for better KYC procedure than focusing most only on exchanges",

Social media sites can add the best scam/spam filters they want, but they won't be able to totally out the scammers as they will always have newer ways of twisting things to get through the filters. People in general simply just needs to be not careless and delusional.",

But the higher the popularity of cryptocurrencies, the more often scammers will manifest themselves. Nothing surprising.Surprisingly, people want to profit. They believe in social networks, but why are they so naive? After all, there are very few cases when someone wins or makes a big profit. But we see eccentrics who believe in a miracle from the Internet.Social media is just evil. In addition, we fully provide the authorities with information about ourselves and our relatives and allow ourselves to be deceived.These people are stupid, and their stupidity is rewarded in every piece of spam that promises wealth.",

The solution is what most of us do not want to hear, greater regulation and control of state authorities.Whatever our wishes, regulation will eventually happen, and as far as I hear the EU is already actively working to pass a law on greater regulation of the crypto industry. Yet the best defense against financial fraud is not in state regulation but in common sense",

From the way I see this, I really don't want to solely blame social media for this, victims should also share in the blame too. Greed has always been the driving force why people fall prey to scam. Scammers know this, and latch on it. What do you expect when people want to reap where they didn't sow?There is an ongoing one someone introduced a few people I know to. Though it doesn't require money (at least at this stage), they say it's mining of a phantom token called BTCS. I jeered at them and told them to jettison that idea that it was a bid to steal their identity. Those interested are asked to provide passports/national ID numbers with facial proof of ownership as verification. The token isn't even listed ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. I told those who tried talking me into it that it was an identity theft type of scam but they argued with me. Went behind me to register. The project is so shameless that it's even using BTC logo. So, tomorrow, when it becomes clear to them that it was a scam all along; is anyone supposed to blame SM for that? Nah, of course.",

Social media are full of scammers. Anyone on social media are their not to have privacy, requiring them to do KYC will be better if exchanges are to forced their customer to do it. Information is important in life, people that have knowledge about scam can say people that are scammed on social media and dating sites are foolish, they are foolish but the government can try and reduce this through KYC document requirements.Although it is truly foolish to intentionally send money to someone that you do not know and that you know he has nothing to lose if the person is gone with your money.",
