Nigeria, overs the years have moved from one bad governance to another and no one is bothered about the incessant corrupt practices that has aided in stagnating our economy.Nigeria as a country need reforms and to bring about this positive change, it is really gonna take time because corruption have eaten deep in every sector of government so for we to achieve positive results it requires building the mindset of individuals towards positivity.I think the government should bring up platforms that will lecture and educate her citizens on the need to work together as one united nation to meet positive changes.Moreover, if our government is not ready to bring medium that will propagate these reforms then I suggest the military should hijack the governance. Though during the military regime it wasn't also easy as coup where being plot against each other by military leaders but at least there will be checks in activities of each political leaders.",

One old saying talk about we as citizens doing what we can for ourselves not waiting around for government or our leaders to come do it for us. Hence why we dey advocate for more crypto involvement and introduction.No person wey never chop enough go start project to make him part of the country better currently, unless money dey involved, else any individual or group of individual wey start project to better their side go just dey look as one government official go carry news crew and social media come recieve the accolades wey him no work for or sponsor.",

Take this forum for example,  Nigerians are among the best and highest ranked in terms of Bitcoin theoretical discussion and even Bitcoin technicalities,  take Nigerians like @Charles-Tim for example despite being a Nigerian, they still, built Bitcoin technical knowledge which is one aspect that have been hard for most people,  what am I saying, in essence, is that,  Nigerians are the best if the put there focus into something both good or bad,  and we are at the forefront of Africa crypto adoption and will top the world in the coming years when we have a working government system. The current regime may be far from bringing the change that will make the lives of Nigerians better so rather Nigerians should be prepared to face a tougher time ahead and the only way to stay motivated is by making proper plans and efforts to stay above the current economic situations,  because nothing will change unless we change it,  I always tell Nigerians that the change we desire is in us and there is no need to play politics or being greedy about that,  but the current Nigeria is filled with greedy politicians who have taken governance to be business and means to get rich quick by embezzling public founds and also putting the life of the citizens and at bad condition. We thank goodness that we made up our mind to take another route which is a cryptocurrency and since we have come into contact with Bitcoin everything have changed now we can put our efforts into a more profitable thing like Bitcoin,  blockchain and other contemporary invention that are out to change the world.",

The current regime may be far from bringing the change that will make the lives of Nigerians better so rather Nigerians should be prepared to face a tougher time ahead and the only way to stay motivated is by making proper plans and efforts to stay above the current economic situations,  because nothing will change unless we change it,  I always tell Nigerians that the change we desire is in us and there is no need to play politics or being greedy about that,  but the current Nigeria is filled with greedy politicians who have taken governance to be business and means to get rich quick by embezzling public founds and also putting the life of the citizens and at bad condition.  My broda Wiwo you know one tin wey dey pain me pass for among the poor citizens wey these politicians the embezzle and misappropriate the public money wey dem supos use do infrastructural and human capital dev'ts and dey fail in their responsibility to do but rather use that money de enriched their sef and children , but na still that poor Nigerian go gather togeda the discuss and praise dis same politicians on how he just drop comon 10k for am.  And you we dey enlightened go dey wonder how much or wetin that 10k wan do for that man for dis kind rough economy wey dey only get worsen evry day. The clear picture be say this current set of politicians in powa no get vision or the dream to make Naija beta, na just self centered people wey find their way to the sit of political and economic powa by way of selection.",

A lot of the youths have turned into hype men to politicians, The worst case is, that some of them are even educated and still lack the mental capacity to design a well-thought-out pathway for themselves,  and that brings me to another scenario that plays out almost the same but in two different categories. 1: if I wonder why someone will take just 10k to risk their life for a politician and I am wondering about such a low mentality. 2: how then another Scilly scenario among the poor,  where you find out and discover that the poor people at the most waste of resources and you kind of wonder,  how can someone that is poor still be a waster,  well that is the mentality of a typical Nigeria.",

If you check well you no suppose blame all this people wey de reason am say naija no go better and nothing good fit comot for Nigeria again no matter the person wey climb that seat because for how many years now we don change president and nothing de really change and the worst part sef be say e con be like things de even worse pass as dem be before. Everytime wey new president enter seat things con de worse pass the last person time. We no fit compare Obadanjo tenure with Goodluck tenure and so we no fit compare Goodluck wey everybody de shout say him no try say him don spoil country with Buhari regime, to me Buhari was the worst of all because alot of people had faith in him they believed so much in him to make a difference but he failed us all. With the kind shege wey Nigerians don see so far you no suppose blame them when dem conclude say naija no go good again but all we can do is have hope because when we give up on the country it is like giving up on ourselves. Let’s keep trying and never lose hope, I believe God will intervene someday. Quote from: Lida93 on October 03, 2023, 10:46:00 PMa lot of tins just the make us loose focus on seeing say the beta change we dey cry and pray for e dey our hand and na only wen we Nigerians don really ready to take that change into our hands by all means necessary na then we fit start to see life for inside the Naija but till then na just so so from one level of sufa to anoda we go dey face till we decide to ready for de new beta change we de find from we gofment. We know say e de our hand to make the country better and so far we have tried our best in the best way i think we can because we don de try vote people in with our hands, people wey we de feel say go make change but no better result so far na so so promise and fail we just de see up and down but i never still understand wetin you mean by all means necessary because i never understand that part hope no be wetin i de reason you mean because i think that will be too harsh and in my opinion it’s not proper. We will do our best and elect who we feel can do better and leave everything for God to handle. na true naija youth really get power and when dem try to do something dem de give am their all and result de surely comot but Wetin you de reason because i don try reason wetin we fit do to make this change but nothing de come head maybe you fit share you idea with me make i understand properly.",

Na because our country no good like our country no follow, others wey you dey see say dem no too follow for this list na because their governments dun make the economy of their country better wey be say if their youths hustle small dem go fit dey live a better life. Immediately we humans get comfortable we begin to lose our hustling spirit and na so all those white dem dey na him make e dey be like dem no get interest in cryptocurrency because their system dey work and that's why we dey always japa go their side. You think say if the country dey work very well wey be say as you finish school, you go get better work wey dey pay you well say you for they reason this industry? We dey here because the country no follow and work no dey and our population too much and na him dey push us upward for the crypto world. QuoteNa with same energy too if we all don really ready for a new beta Nigeria inno go take 2secs we go get the results coming. Na the powa of Naija be that but plenty of us neva start to mk use of that powa wen it com for gofment and politics na why we country Neva be as we want.you sef reason am! For this side I no go talk say we never ready because we dun really ready but the kind politics wey we dey practice here no get fairness. Oya see last election wey we come out vote yet dem still steal our mandate carry give person wey we no vote for. This na how Nigeria politics dun dey and e go hard to change that way because protest self no dey too work for the country as where men gather plan, others go go behind go take handout and forget everything wey we plan to do. The youth dey hungry and the government know this one so if dem fit capture the main people wey dey organized the protest dem dun end the whole thing. See as dem shot people for lekki toll gate yet nothing the happen up to today and Nigeria strong wey be say other countries dey like comot hand for our matters.",

Thats true sha Nigerians have the mindset of always improving and trying to be better at what they know how to do best. And I noticed something about Nigerians we have plenty talented people but lack proper management of this talents have seen how a lot of people have shown interest in different areas of life. If you look at the percentage of countries that are seriously into cryptocurrency nigeria is among the top five and now i see people even advertising there  ant minners asking interested people to contact for there own installation, if its about crypto am proud of my Nigeria people serious we are doing well in that area. Has the government is not helping we go help how self. That is the spirit. Quote from: Y3shot on October 04, 2023, 07:00:30 PMWe Nigerians we be one of the most intelligent people on earth and anything wey go make our life better we dey do am with all our strength. Because of the way our currency dey lose value many of us Don gather dey build knowledge on this crypto matter so that we fit get small security financially.  We dey front this crypto matter for Africa because this matter Don become a way to elevate ourselves from hunger and stagnation that is to say, we Nigerians get the force to bring anything to the top as long as we put our mid to am. I just dey pray say the bad part of us wey be to completely use something till e go spoil no go come out onto this crypto matter. Although I wouldn't claim we are the smartest, I would say we have an excellent ability to adapt to any scenario. Nigerians are also intelligent and knowledgeable. That i know for sure. People must find alternative ways to make a living in order to maintain the country's unfavorable economic status. The currency is worthless, which has a significant impact on many market commodities. Plenty fucked up situations in the country. There are many absurd circumstances in the nation. Thank God for the chance that cryptocurrency has provided for us, at least in the short term when it comes to solving problems for many people.",

      "body": "I have to agree with the op, but honestly, sometimes, I cant help but ask what exactly should we as Nigerians do?, the country right now has gotten so bad to the extend that we as youths can no longer protest the bad deeds of the government in peace anymore, simply because even the security operatives have been bought over by the same government we voted into power, and the worst is, they wont hesitate to shoot and kill anybody who is seen to be protesting against the bad elements we now have a government.And the thing right now, no body is ready to die anymore, after all, those who were killed at Lekki tollgate, what did or has the government done about it, if not to keep dying that no human was killed, even when there are several evidence both online and offline pointing to the fact that a lot of youths were killed in the course of that endsars protest.My conclusion is, Nigeria is not worth dying for, this is what Goodluck Ebele Jonathan said during 2015 election that brought in Buhari as president of Nigeria, and i am here repeating same thing that Nigeria is not worth the blood of any youth, as i personally believe that, at the appropriate time, all will be alright.",
