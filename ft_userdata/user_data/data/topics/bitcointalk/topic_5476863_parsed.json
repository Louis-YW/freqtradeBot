If you need it for christmas money I do not think you should.We are now in a 'bull market' so it is not a good time to sell any of your coins. I do not know if you have to get the money right now but this is the only reason to sell them how market is.",

We dont know the potential market on christmas day but as you can see the market tends to go up together with other assets or stocks especially gold. I think even $3k is possible if this continue considering there is no major pull back happened.",

Should he\\she hold Ethereum?Yes, if there's an altcoin that everyone is waiting to go up then that's Ethereum. Looking at the past month's chart of it you'd be amazed because it moved like Bitcoin that time but this time it doesn't and that's normal. How big is the loss depending whether you shoud continue to hold or not but regardless, I'd still say to HODL.Quote from: hack3rcon on December 07, 2023, 06:11:38 AMIs it possible for the price to reach $2300 before Christmas?Thanks.Dude, we are at $2231 and if you're asking if it's going to be possible to reach that price before Christmas day. Definitely, it's very possible to see that price and can even be more than that. What you guys have to do is to hold if you don't want to add some anymore. That's all what you gotta do but if you have all the means to buy some more then that's an advantage and you're doing yourself a favor with that because as you hold, you add some more.",

Keep on holding and if the market keeps on staying in the green zone you would make enough profit. It is not that easy to predict the price of any cryptocurrency as there is always the factor of uncertainty in the crypto universe which can stop Ethereum from reaching the price point you are seeking. But looking at the present situation where the price of Ethereum is already above $2200 it won't be hard for it to reach $2300 before the 25th of this month.",

I think the etherium in quest will fall a little bit. Not only etherium but also Bitcoin will also be involved. Festive period is a great influence to the crypto market. Because of constant seling of coin to celebrate Xmas will definitely affect the growth of bitcoin and etherium.",

So I think this will easily grow and will go $3000+.Because many companies also filled spot ETF Ethereum too. So I hope if they will get approval so the Ethereum price can go $3000+ or even more. And if only Bitcoin will get approval then Ether can go up too. So in both cases Ethereum can go up so I will recommend if anyone is in loss so s/he should hold tight even s/he will get profit.",

Also current happening especially the bullish condition for ethereum is really promising that's why even if we lose today we can still possibly earn since there's possible bullrun that might happen for it and also for sure that the target price you are looking for is really reachable since Ethereum's price is currently at $2200+ today and maybe tomorrow if bullish state or what you called hype continue it touch at that figures. For sure many people are in profit today since we see Ethereum move so good and it can possibly reach maybe up to $2,500 on next following day or maybe on the day you have said.Hodl is best to do since there's a lot to happen and for sure you don't want to miss something especially when seeing Ethereum to reach its new milestone.",

January though seems to have a high percentage to make it happen and better, beyond that. Ethereum is one of the highest reputable projects out there and Ethereum ETF is also being applied by popular investment firms. You might want to check the recent news about them so that you will have an idea of why their value could climb up one more time and maybe it will hit the ATH again. Also, do consider that whenever Bitcoin goes up, Ethereum is also being dragged by that climb and it's in history charts.

Christmas to Chinese new year  is considered to be slow days for crypto trading. The market remains sideways or falls at this time.As Ethereum has gained a good percentage and it could go through a correction. The price rise comes in waves and we might get chance to buy it back cheaper at later time.Selling 50% and keeping the rest would save you from FOMO as well as loss. No one can guarantee the market movement, so its upto us to play safe.",

Maybe I just don't feel or want to hold it, but if I look at the fee as expected by most people, it's actually very expensive.  But let me try to guess what its price value will be before the end of this month of December. I think it will play for $2300–$2700 each. When that happens, it will be lucky for those who have holdings.",
