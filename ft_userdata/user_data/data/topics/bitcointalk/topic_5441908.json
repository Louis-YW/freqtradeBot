  "content": "I dont predict but here is the plan i follow for this plan.The btc lowest price about 15-19k price range we all ready been here the 15-19k price.Then then next price Will be 28k-31k price range. Then it Will be 70%-80% drop so price would come to 15k-19k price range then it will go to 30k then people start short the short squeeze Will be happening then 30k+15k= 45k then on the 45k price people Will start buying and long positions then long positions Will get liqutated.Then price Will fall back to 30k price range the 28-31k Will be support range. Then we calculate: 30k+15k+15= 60k ATH . then 25% correction and then bull run Will continue.Got idea....well something like this is the plan:)",

      "body": "If that's your conclusion based on your own set of factors, then so be it. Just remember that your speculation doesn't take note of some possible factors that might spoil your projected view. The market is speculative and sudden news can even shake the market overnight. Good luck though with your speculation and hope you are well-prepared for anything that can happen.",

More buying opportunities?Thats a higher low in your chart. I would blindly buy it here keeping a stoploss at 21.2k . (just beneath the previous low).Quote from: adaseb on March 03, 2023, 05:54:44 AMI had a buddy who had a trading method like this that he used to trade stocks. He called it a strategy but to me it seemed all he was doing was more or less just guessing.He was correct for a while, it was like intuition until he became bearish because he expected a double dip recession and ended up losing all his account balance shorting. You're right there. Almost every strategy involved in trading is a pure guess. I have seen many ppl come up with their strategies like the OP, and they ended up getting failed after working for a while. The key factor here is how fast can you shift your mindset with a rapid moving dynamic market. Sticking with one strategy fails in the end, need to keep changing (which is most difficult part for most of us humans).",
