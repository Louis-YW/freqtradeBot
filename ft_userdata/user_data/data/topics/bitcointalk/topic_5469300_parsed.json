They're like your online bodyguards, savvy?I donâ€™t quite understand how MetaMask shields one from scammy sites but if youâ€™re talking about this transaction security checks offered by MetaMask, i would say they donâ€™t really protect you that much but when signing transaction using the DApps they check for authenticity and display the information which also is not secure due to the data that MetaMask needs to share with this dictators. But this does not in anyway stop one from visiting scam websites either through phishing. Also as a bitcoiner, MetaMask shouldnâ€™t be your wallet because it is closed source. Store your bitcoin on open source wallets like electrum which supports only bitcoin and if you want an online open source multi coin wallet then you can make use of Unstoppable wallet.",

It's your secret sauce to Bitcoin safety.Yeah, and to enhance the security of those seed phrase, you should encrypt them using any encryption method even a easier one like cipher will do the work, as it depend on the family and friend cycle you have. For example, most of the times, we make friends and but they are not what we think they are and they have bad mind of stealing. And if your friends are techy guy then encrypt your seed phrase with some advance encryption method like AES or DES whatever you want other wise as I aforementioned Cipher is enough.

I agree that hardware wallets are is one of the best recommendations for security - but holders should also be concerned about any risks that hardware wallets may pose as well as the risk of incorrect use. The most important thing is to secure the seed or seed phrase - then don't just rely on the security of one wallet product for all your bitcoin.I always remember this warning; Don't put all your eggs in one basket. For me this is important and indeed this is the right step to diversify the risks that may exist. I mean - even though hardware wallets are safe, don't keep all your coins in just one wallet which means having several wallets, especially if you have a lot of coins.",

You should protect your device with an antivirus, it will provide comprehensive protection on your device and on the internet, not just your browser.

Nothing can be considered as completely safe so if they can diversify their bitcoin storage methods and reduce risks to lose all at once, they have good practice.Backups of their wallets should be in different forms too like on paper, metal sheet as at the end, if a backup is usable, it's good and it is not a matter it is in a paper or metal form.",
