  "content": "Today I was very surprised when I saw the spread sheet in the signature campaign bounty that I participated in, namely digicom finance.because apparently someone signed up for the spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Pka7cJMsl1vlmEwCd20PtAE7ereDuTMFB_ru2B0vHU/edit?usp=sharing) on the bounty using my information (username btt & telegram).however it uses someone else's wallet address ie0x2C8696630f0968ad492793cf3cfB20DA934AA4AaI don't know whose wallet address the scammer used.because the only wallet address I have is just this0x5751bf7f225d92C0Fe69484a70F83e962E86A522My real sphreadsheet is no. 5.And scammer who used my information on sphreadsheet no. 28I'm worried that one day someone will use my information to register for another bounty or another type of bounty.how to find out the information of the fraudster?and I see people here can trace the owner of the wallet address.can you tell me how to trace the wallet address?I am really angry with this scammer. what did I do wrong to him, until he did that.I have made a report to the digicom finance bounty manager in the telegram group. and still waiting for the manager's response. because I asked the manager to delete my data that the fraudster used in spreadsheet 28 (the fraudster).I'm afraid this scammer will also do the same to other people.",
