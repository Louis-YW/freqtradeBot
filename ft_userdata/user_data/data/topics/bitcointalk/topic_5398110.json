ThanksYeah, I can see it now too, mods probably see this thread of your and think it was a mistake from their end. Seems the possibility to retrieve deleted/removed posts and the no notification/message receive, I guess the thread wasn't deleted, just moved to some board only mods can see and retrieve (correct me if im wrong though).Now you can lock this thread since it's been solve now or wait a bit later for the mod to explain what happened to your thread.",

I think this could be the case of bot wrongly detecting your post as spam (or moderator mistake), so I would suggest that you always add some text along with uploaded images in future.You should also think about moving this kind of content in different section, because Bitcoin Discussion board is sadly full of junk currently, so maybe moving it to Gambling or something like that will get more audience for puzzles stuff like this.",

The thread would have been moved to trashcan upon which there would be no notification that the thread was deleted. Threads are moved there for this particular situation as it is possible to reinstate threads which are moved there, but only certain mods or the admin have this ability, IIRC.",

ThanksI can't understand what we're talking about? Your topic is in place. Moreover, you edited it after the creation of this topic. So what exactly is your complaint?Or I don't understand something?Op is complaining why the second thread he posted cannot be accessed to any forum user but a certain mod or admin got it back where op posted the thread. I really don't get it why you didn't understand or get what op wanted to express but I think once you re-read the op then you'll finally get it. You can check the links that op provided and you'll see that you can open it right now but before that op can't even open it even though op did post that, it is why op ask if it's deleted since op didn't receive any message if it's deleted or not.Quote from: dkbit98 on May 11, 2022, 01:23:52 PMI think this could be the case of bot wrongly detecting your post as spam (or moderator mistake), so I would suggest that you always add some text along with uploaded images in future.You should also think about moving this kind of content in different section, because Bitcoin Discussion board is sadly full of junk currently, so maybe moving it to Gambling or something like that will get more audience for puzzles stuff like this.or it could be moved to Beginners and Help since there are threads there about puzzles but not rewarding BTC but for merit but it still a puzzle.",
