      "body": "I filled the survey since it's not required logged in to google account. Anyway, i have few thought and question1. About question \"For what purposes mainly are you dealing with crypto?\", it'd be great if people can choose more than option. I expect there are some people who use cryptocurrency as both investment and purchase (if they use service which accept cryptocurrency).2. Is this your first research? If no, do you mind share link to your past research?",

      "body": "I completed your survey. I hope it helps in the research you are conducting. I prefer mempool.space. I used to navigate to Blockchair and Blockstream in the past, but I find mempool.space much faster and more lightweight. And there are no ads and other nonsense. When it comes to use cases, most people use block explorers to check the status of a sent/received transaction. It's not the most recommended method to do it, especially over the clearnet. Blockchain explorers are great honeypots that hold data on who searches and looks for what, since most of the times people are looking at their own addresses. At least when you use one, you can pick a site that works over TOR. Or just check the status of your transactions in your native wallet app and don't lookup your own addresses over blockchain explorers at all. It's hard to stick to it though.",

For now I have a very basic set of questions to uncover main trends of usage and may be not very obvious ones. Although, I've thought on this topic and it should be touched separately.",
