Nobody should fall for these tactics even if it sounds too interesting, paypal might chargeback in these cases and you'll loose.",

PayPal is a reversible method of payment, one should definitely be very careful here. OP, I suggest you go on the Currency exchange board and place your offer there. over time, when you gain trust, I believe you will not have a problem doing the exchange without a middleman.you can also look at Bestchange (you have a link in my signature), I found two exchangers with them that offer conversion services from PP to Bitcoin. I think their fee is somewhat lower than the one you are ready to offer.",

He doesn't have to ask someone for their paypal account and that's why, it's sketchy.Quote from: examplens on December 20, 2022, 10:04:01 AMQuote from: boyptc on December 20, 2022, 08:59:43 AMThat's an intriguing percentage.But folks, I think I've seen this type of offer before and you'll never like it.

PayPal is a reversible method of payment, one should definitely be very careful here. Or else, if someone is careless and just contacts him and did the transaction. Well, he's going to face the consequences that PayPal might impose on his/her account and that's a no-warning ban.Quote from: fortunecrypto on December 20, 2022, 12:08:25 PMQuote from: boyptc on December 20, 2022, 08:59:43 AMThat's an intriguing percentage.But folks, I think I've seen this type of offer before and you'll never like it.

They'll use your account for a gateway to money laundering and even worse, they wouldn't care if your account will be banned afterwards as long as they've used your account and went through.",

I do not know of you though  and if I may ask can you not open a PayPal account for yourself to carrying out such transaction directly to your account or you are afraid of identity trace? Secondly, the source of he inflow is not known which you did not state here for us to know where is coming from as many have had the experience of their accounts been flagged as a result of some transaction been unclear as to where it was coming from and lastly I hope you know PayPal transaction can be reversed at anytime irrespective of the payment volume.So I would advise you register an account and do it yourself.Account activity.
