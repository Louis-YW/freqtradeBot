  "content": "Bitcoin seems to be every where. I recently came across a novel application of bitcoin that is use of bitcoin blockchain for publication industry.Here is the link.https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00447-9tamper-proof records have obvious uses in science for safe error free and smooth data management. Researchers are now trying to create such systems using blockchains.Himmelstein a researcher developed Manubot, a software  automates the process of collating, formatting and publishing  the  scientific paper. Each time an author creates a version of the manuscript, the software logs that event on the Bitcoin blockchain. Manubot uses OpenTimestamp, a free-to-use, open-source service that records time stamps in batches in Bitcoin transactions.Another interesting service is ScienceMatters .. this is the first publication service which actually pay reviewers for their work on meticulously reviewing manuscripts.That too in form of crypto currency.Artifacts is another very useful platform where researchers can share their researches, or anything else in a way that each file logged to a blockchain. Users can set permissions so that their uploads are private, public or available to collaborators.Such knowledge sharing modules will help making research more accessible, more collaborative and more rewarding and also faster and easier to publish.. Another interesting  thing i read is how blockchain technology can reduce the cost of medical research.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/12/how-blockchain-can-cut-the-cost-of-new-medicine/estimated average cost-per-day of a delayed clinical trial is $300,000, as based on Tufts and ACRPNet studies.There is gigabytes of data. Health background genomics data and more.There are 20-30 odd institutions working together around the globe. Different population groups, and huge cache of data to collect and evaluate.Also there is need for a system to securely share and access sensitive patient dataSo  there is so much at risk. We need a transparent fast and systematic data collection and evaluation system.This is where Blockchain fits in for creating tamper-proof records. Providing  efficient and fast system for data management and  manage collaborations.Blockchains could save upto 150-200 million dollars for pharmaceutical industries...and possible this saving could translate to lower costs of medicines for patients as well..",

The key point here is that the blockchains used are tailored to a specific purpose and none of them have anything to do with BTC.",

      "body": "@OP You are almost talking about 3 different things at the same time, base on your thread created for knowledge about Bitcoin .The suggestion given you should know the different between Blockchain, Bitcoin in general. Concerning the involvement of Blockchain technology in the clinical trials, their is an already existing project which have an existing clinical software which helps researcher in research and it's development. You can check them out here Triall",

The key point here is that the blockchains used are tailored to a specific purpose and none of them have anything to do with BTC.Why is bitcoin popular? Because of block chain technology. This technology can be used in any kind of application, like the banking sector, government departments, business, land departments etc. It can assure safety and security for any data. Whenever new technology is invented we should utilise the maximum possible way.",

Bitcoin however, can be used for payment and other means of settlement while blockchain keeps track record of transactions and activities onchain.Blockchain technology goes beyond just transactions; it can be incredibly useful in the healthcare industry as a pool for storing health data. The current issue lies in the multitude of places where healthcare data is stored by different doctors, leading to incomplete pools of information.In fact, a rewarding system should be implemented when applying blockchain technology in the healthcare world, as good health is something more valuable than anything else. By gaining access to a centralized health data bank, all doctors would be able to access a plethora of medical knowledge.While Bitcoin may have limited capabilities, blockchain can become the core technology.",
