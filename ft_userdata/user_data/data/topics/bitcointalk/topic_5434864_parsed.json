  "content": "This for me is a complete robbery on the part of the casino, when one registers at no time do they tell you that they are going to block what you win either by participating in the events that they carry out either in the forum or in the online casino, this month I deposited more than $200 and I am going to withdraw $152 and it does not allow me to withdraw because I am blockedhttps://prnt.sc/WviVojt2OyGII show an image of my deposits this monthhttps://prnt.sc/MbsQwoQgyXlVI want to show the message that supports my case, what they are asking for is a complete scamhttps://prnt.sc/xGe9i-dS8XlyI want the administrator to take action on the matter because what I deposit this month later I will not be able to withdraw and they have the nerve to tell me that because of the abuse of the bonuses, if for that reason they do not give more bonuses, do not deceive the users by giving them a bonus that later they will not want to give it to you. I want my money that I earn doing challenges, doing sports challenges, stop being a scam* I want to show why I'm withdrawing that, it's not for bonuses or anything, it's because I earned it in sports and forum challengeshttps://prnt.sc/g8gTevbaiUmchttps://prnt.sc/L-icemKnX6-Vhttps://prnt.sc/w3Djvlx8A-13everything I earn since I participate daily in the forum challengeshttps://prnt.sc/6O9fXIpamJz7ADMINISTRATOR, tell me if these are the bonuses you give, I won this in a WEEK, I am showing you with images what I have won, without showing you what I have won in the challenges they carry out on Telegram. I want to be PAID. I want the ADMINISTRATOR to show me the face of what I DEPOSITED and WON stop being thieves for when one WINS them.",
