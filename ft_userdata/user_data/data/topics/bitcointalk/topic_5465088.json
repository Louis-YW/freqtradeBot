Hydro miners has some slight additional cost as a radiator. There is no air cooled miner which can reach that performance released yet.I really don't care about the profitability, the most i care fastest ROI For some people with free power it would be something like S19-90ths which is only 7-8usd pet ths.S21 will be at least 20-30usd per ths.",

Hydro cooling is more efficient, but any non-factory solution requires great care in installation and use, because the principle is the same. And the repair of such equipment is more expensive.If we discuss free electricity, then I don’t think that anyone has large limits for free electricity, not 1-5 kilowatts per hour, but 20-50 kilowatts per hour.",

With a daily production of 210T, you can earn approximately 0.00046200 at the current difficulty level. As a result, the break-even price would be $13,680. However, the S19XP's break-even price is higher at $21,080. If Bitcoin were to drop back into the $20,000 range, your profitability would be compromised, but the S21 would remain a profitable option.",
