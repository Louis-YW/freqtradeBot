      "body": "OP, Can you please write in detail? I don't see anything suspicious. You just posted two bet IDs; I've checked those are lost bets. What else do you have to prove your claims? The verification says the game result should be 1.04x and 1.82x. I am curious what was your target bet on those specific rounds? I don't know how their crash game works! So, explaining the details would help others to understand why you think the results are unfair. I want to ask, did you contact their support and ask if they have any explanation about it? BC Games is well known, established online casino. They are unlikely to ruin their reputation bu tempering the games. However, anything could happen in online. Did you contact them within the forum or outside of the forum? If you did not knock them yet, Consider sending them a PM to this account https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2503677 and let them know about existence of this topic.",

We all know in our hearts that they are in complete control. The proof of results It comes down to what these casinos set out. We all know we are being taken advantage of but we still play. That means we accept their rules. They do not force.So I play for fun. and what I want to convey is These casinos do not Are you ashamed? that is still the word fair...And one more thing I leave you to think. For optimistic people if it is random Even though I'm a person who's not good at math. But I'm not a buffalo in each game, like baby turtles, if it's really random. The reason for chasing the loss will never happen Or if it happened, it would be like winning the lottery. The 1st prize depends on each person's beliefs. What I'm saying is what every player knows in their hearts If we do not deceive ourselves Casinos are not foundations for donation...

This is the first time I have seen someone accuse a casino of manipulating the seed and hash also known as the Secure Hash Algorithm if possible in first place. Everything appears normal to me from what you shared in the OP except for the screenshots you shared now which differs from what is currently visible on the GitHub script.It will be difficult for anyone to believe your accusation without actual evidence. It would be more convincing if you could provide an archived version of the link using [1] instead of relying on a screenshot that can be easily edited.From a logical standpoint BC is a reliable casino as i know and it is unlikely that they would risk their reputation for such actions. Beside that Im not sure if they have the capability to manipulate that system in that way just to make some players lose while they can set low returns instead of that and make it less suspicious.[1] : https://archive.is/",
