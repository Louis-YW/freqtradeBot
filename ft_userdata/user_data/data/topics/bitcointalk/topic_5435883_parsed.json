It's also important to remember that not everyone may be interested in the same things or have the same communication style as you, and that's okay.

I think it's an option that should only be used in very extreme cases.Well for many users including me. A simple single click on ignore button is much easier rather than skipping intentionally a post from a user that you didn't like. Let's say you are following a certain thread and reading all the posts then you accidentally read the post of your ignored person. I'm sure that your opinion about his statement will be biased since you hate the guy personally. Ignore button helps you to avoid accidental drama and create a peaceful forum experience away from people that you didn't like.",

He was basically ignoring merit hunters and spammers. We evolve, and these days the ignore list we see are most out of personal conflicts and dis-likeness. Some feel superior when they announce they are ignoring the person they do not like.

I was answering in the general sense.In general sense, you are right!Public Ignore list is like Public Trust list of forum users. By default, it is private lists (Ignore and Trust lists) but there are some third party sites make it public (Trust list) like BPIP, Loyceclub and people looked at it to find who distrust them and it is one of reasons for drama.I don't imply that drama won't occur if Trust lists are not publicly seen.From Trust list and drama, no convincing reason to have public ignore lists by the forum, except some members personally want to show theirs.In some cases, users try to use trust feedback is their tool for their personal notes (I don't want to judge it as personal attacks but it is likely) and I disagree with this use. Even a trust feedback is neutral, if it is unnecessary, it should not exist and should not be abused.",

Even a trust feedback is neutral, if it is unnecessary, it should not exist and should not be abused.  Those who do, it's personal that I came to know lately. It was not the same before. Example: Actmyname.TryNinja's personal note extension is a great tool to avoid the drama. But they will not use it.Like how many neutral these days you see not inspired with negative value? The sender can not send a red feedback because it will directly question their trustworthiness so they use the loophole.Quote from: tranthidung on January 18, 2023, 03:13:33 PMPublic Ignore list is like Public Trust list of forum users.

But ignoring someone was never meant to be public that's why in the system you do not see others ignore list. For the same reason Bot and TryNinja or BPIP can not scrape the data of someone's ignore list.",
