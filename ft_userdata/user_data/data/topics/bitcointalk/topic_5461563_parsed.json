Everything else (binaries, website, explorer, discord, etc.) comes after. Being open-source is one of the important concepts of cryptocurrencies.Your binary contains Remcos, which is a serious malware. Even if the malware comes from your third party components (and not from you), you should not release the binaries. If this project is legit (and not a scam), then your first priority now should be to take down all download links to the binaries, remove the malicious third party components, and then provide the source code and new binaries.If you don't do this, then this project is an obvious scam and nobody should download the wallet.",

Main goal of the project is to help start-up projects that aim to achieve anonymity and privacy. At the end of each month, for 12 months, we will fund these projects from our budget.The funding comes from transfer fees on our blockchain.The choice of the project to be funded will be left to our community.The more projects we fund, the more publicity our project will get.The more publicity we get, the higher the funding for other projects.Increased funding is offered through increased number of transfers - thus a higher number of commissions.It is important to realize that the funding will cover only part of the objectives of these projects. But even so, together we can strengthen the nodes of projects that use privacy and untraceable payments as their basis.At the moment we are busy fixing the wallet. The project will be updated soon",
