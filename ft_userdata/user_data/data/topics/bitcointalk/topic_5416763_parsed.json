There are forum limits against newbies in terms of posting and messaging, for example. But outside of that, I don't think newbies should feel inferior. After all, ranks do not necessarily signify Bitcoin or crypto knowledge, experience, determination, and so on. Although, of course, in terms of how the forum works, newbies should better observe, explore, and read the rules first.",

No one will blame you for a legitimate question, but if you open a thread with the question \"Who is Satoshi\" or \"Why are there only 21 million BTC\" it is definitely considered a low-value topic and will be deleted by the moderators.What others want to tell you is that you still have to learn something in order to be able to participate constructively in discussions, and you will achieve this by reading what other more experienced members write. This is just a forum, there is no pressure to do this or that - read, write, be more aware of some things every day than the day before.",

Am just but also learning.why not, newbies can create new topics related to crypto or a question that doesn't exist and has not been discussed much, but don't create topics that have been discussed a lot. Before creating a topic you must first check whether the forum already exists or not. and commenting on threads is something you should do as a newbie, to be more active and able to provide feedback on the issues being discussed, and don't occasionally spam comments that will only get you ignored.Choosing a Board also needs to be considered, usually things like this are overlooked by Newbie knowledge. Newbies must know a place that matches the content of the topic, the term is not to enter the wrong room. Do not let topics that lead to Altcoin discussions be posted on the Bitcoin discussion board and vice versa, this also needs to be considered so as not to violate the restrictions on the forum.",

This is the best method to avoid being scam by scammer here since you have less knowledge. Do your own research by browsing on useful threads hre in the forum before you interact with someone for discussion.During my newbie days, I didn't trust anyone despite I‚Äôm doing a p2p trading of altcoins here inthe marketplace section. I use escrow or transact with small amount only to those user that I think as high risk. I grow my knowledge slowly by trading on many user here. There are times that I experienced being scam with small amount but I take that lesson to become more cautious on my next transaction. My experience is much riskier than newbie nowadays since Centralized exchange is now reputable compared to my newbie days.You can use the link I attached for list of good threads here related for security and privacy.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5239098.msg54186093#msg54186093Trust no one until am more familiar here. Quote from: Upgrade00 on October 09, 2022, 12:38:24 PMScammers don't rush on newbies, they would attempt to rip off literally anyone, the only difference is some users are more easily accessible, cause they leave details about themselves all around.‚Ä¢ Email addresses while signing up for airdrops,‚Ä¢ Phone number and KYC information when using exchanges,‚Ä¢ Social profiles when joining bounty projects etc.All these can be used to access and create a personalized scam, targeted against a user.You avoid this by staying private, as much as is possible, and also being cautious; everything is a scan until proven otherwise.I must keep my information private¬†From Newbies - Read before posting, I got a great warning about Altcoins; QuoteA warning about Alt-Coins: Almost all of the alt-coins out there are going to be a waste of time. They're being created to take advantage of people who get super excited about different things and then get pumped and dumped. Be careful about wasting time with too many alt coins. Be careful about downloading files, seems like there's plenty of wallet stealers around hidden as alt coin miners.Since there's no special way of welcoming newbie, I hope am already welcome. Can the three Quotes above guide me as a newbie? I want to learn about Bitcoin and tech and also teach others who are eager to learn too. I know am new but I believe one day I shall contribute just like some legendary memebers I admire their productive knowledge in the forum.",
