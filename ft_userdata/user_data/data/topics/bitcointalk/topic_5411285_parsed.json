  "content": "Nearly half of US adults say their crypto punts are worse than expected: SurveyQuoteIt's too bad, as a majority of the crypto investors surveyed said they became interested in crypto as they thought it was a good way to make money.Amid the ongoing crypto winter, new data from a Pew Research Centre survey has shown that 46% of adult crypto users in the United States are seeing lower than expected returns on their crypto investments.The survey gathered responses from over 6,000 randomly-selected adults across the United States, with panelists participating in self-administered web surveys.Conducted from July 5 to 22 of this year, the majority of respondents who said they had invested in crypto said they saw lower than expected returns than expected while only 15% of people surveyed said their crypto investments had done better than expected. Meanwhile, around 31% said it was \"about the same as they expected.\"To read the news in details, you can follow the above link.The mistakes people make is because they are investing in altcoins, could you believe that altcoins are more volatile but many of them do not make it to all-time-high in 2020/2021. If an holder bought at high price, they may not want to wait again and sell in losses after coins like bitcoin has already reached all-tim-high. Some people that invested at low price can gain but altcoins are more risky.Bitcoin has always reach all-time-high. Many people that complained before the present all-time-high with unrealized losses (people that did not sell when they were losing) later gained and were all happy, bitcoin increased from $19500 all-time-high in 2017 to $69000 all-time-high in 2021.  Bitcoin market has been unfavorable this year but which people that know about bitcoin are not surprised about, they have predicted this bear market before it happened. If bitcoin is presently at $21000 by now, they should know that the market is healthy, that they should not sell in loss. If they hold bitcoin, all-time-high is coming, I am predicting the next bitcoin all-time-high to reach over $100k.",

Quote from: _act_ on August 26, 2022, 08:47:12 AM If an holder bought at high price, they may not want to wait again and sell in losses after coins like bitcoin has already reached all-tim-high. Some people that invested at low price can gain but altcoins are more risky.since bitcoin is the king of cryptocurrency, anyone interested to invest should at least start with bitcoin, gather momentum and experience for two years or more, understand how to speculate price and buying techniques because giving altcoin an attempt, but because most people wanted to treat altcoins as ponzi where they can amass wealth within a short time they got stuck along the way, that's why bitcoin set the pace for other cryptocurrencies, buy bitcoin when dip and sell when high, but this doesn't actually work with many altcoins that way.Quote from: _act_ on August 26, 2022, 08:47:12 AMI am predicting the next bitcoin all-time-high to reach over $100k.it is possible but we have to get close to 2024 halving or right immediately after the halving, a new ATH will definitely set in, those that have invested during dip will have lot reasons to smile.",

Long story short, they end up as bagholders.It goes without saying that people that want fast money also invest in bitcoin, still without examining, so they feel their returns can come as quickly as they want, they do not know they have to hold for the long period. Long story short, they sell early and lose. The genesis of the problem people have with crypto generally is they don't examine or study before investing, so their expectations cannot be achieved.",

So I guess any of them weren't really losing anything nor have they really made any wrong general investment decisions since they still ultimately profited. It is kind of weird how they expected or thought of crypto as an easy way to make money, it may have been true foe the early days but I don't think it applies to recent times now, not to mention it also requires a lot of know-how on what to do to exactly profit.",

This is a mistake, because right now the best prices to buy, perhaps we will not see the lowest price any more, and after accumulation we will see an increase, but then it will be too late to buy, since the best time with the lowest price will already be lost. I buy bitcoin every time I have the opportunity to do so, and I have confidence that my investment will bring me good returns, I buy for the long term and therefore do not try to catch the lowest price, I just buy when I have the opportunity.",

Investing is not easy so when you look at the number of altcoins today, it depends on how they put their money into long-term investments. Based on the article you shared, I didn't find any specifications about what percentage they share in crypto, especially allocating to Bitcoin and altcoins. If you take stock of the market ups and downs that have occurred this year, it's fair to say you're only getting lower returns.The question is quite a phenomenon that needs to be asked of them about how long they search for information before investing in crypto and how mentally prepared they are for the market conditions this year. Therefore, the DCA method must often be emphasized, even if they need to make the method one of the investment styles. If you do it all in it is difficult to get high returns.",

So if you could investigate vividly, you will only get to know that majority of those who complain about losing money to crypto were those who ventured into it without the basics, knowing it's volatile and can rise or fall anytime, but with a long run investment one could make a reasonable profit.",

So if people don't have enough patience they can't make a profit. I can say they just come on the crypto just to become a millionaire or something like that. They just jump into crypto to get a profit but they don't know how to make a profit from crypto.
