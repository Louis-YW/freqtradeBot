  "content": "Good day, fellow members. After a quick scan of this community, I saw numerous threads discussing health-related problems and potential risk. These threads drove me to share my own knowledge to show that aside from bitcoin knowledge, you should have other health knowledge to live more healthy because you don’t only look for money and forget about your health.I will like to discuss THE HEALTH ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF COMPUTER. The reason I chose to discuss this topic is that we use computers on a daily basis to make money, which also has an effect on our health. If we can know the issues and the solutions to those issues, I think we will be healthy and also stay safe. This issue will be as follows: 1. Muscle or joint problem: there are various ways of using computers, but the most common way that people use them is to sit on the chair and face the screen (monitor). According to research, regular computer users complain of muscle soreness, shoulder pain, joint pain, chest pain, and arm pain. 2. Vision problem: Too much focus on a computer or screen is bad for the eyes. According to research, prolonged exposure to a computer, tablet, or smartphone causes computer vision problems. 3. Headache: Too much sitting on a computer can also cause headaches and migraines. Some reasons that can cause headaches when using a computer may include illumination,patterns , images, etc. 4. Stress: prolonged computer use also increases the risk of people experiencing stress. The stress can also lead to poor concentration and constant headaches. If the person can’t tolerate stress, it may lead to depression and other serious mental disorders. 5. Radiation: most computer screens have cathode ray tubes (CRT), which emit X-ray radiation that is extremely bad for the health. Being exposed to radiation can increase one’s risk of cancer, migraines, and tumors. It can also lead to miscarriage or birth defects in pregnant women. PREVENTION 1. Sit on an adjustable desk (chair) specially designed for the use of a computer to manage stress and other muscle problems. 2. Take frequent short breaks and go for a walk or engage in exercise in your daily3. Make sure your source of light (the window) is not shining directly on your face or on your computer screen. 4. Tile the computer screen slightly to avoid reflection.5. Having regular medical examinations for headaches and other associated problems that are caused by the frequent use of computersWith this short health knowledge, we can also stay healthy and live long, and we can also increase our knowledge of using computers. This will not only help members of this community, but we can also educate others.",

While I was learning to use a computer at a computer center, I had all those issues you mentioned but I didn't notice where they were coming from first, but later did I know, arms pains are the number one pains that a new computer literate feels, but after a period of time your body might have been used to it then it will stop (but you will still massage it to stop).Some people only think of money and forget their health, but that is not the way it should be, because life is what matters and we have just 1. Imagine after getting the money and you can't spend it, others will be spending it lavishly for you. Maybe by then you might have been in the hospital lol.So anything you do, we should consider our health. I feel pity for those who are selling things by the roadside to people who are traveling. They will stand and sell in the rain under the sun and still run chasing a vehicle just for a little money.Anyway, you did well to bring this discussion to us I believe a lot of us have learned.",

It is good one take precautionary measures to maintain their health as they work with their computers.Let me just add some few tips to OPs own1. Do well to use anti blue rays computer glasses to reduce the direct sharp contact of your computer light to your eyes.2. Do well to stay hydrated when ever your are working with your computer.

I spend most of my time on computers and I can truly confirm it comes with several challenges. Well, your recommendations are not out of place and one thing I will also add, base on the trainings I have received, is to always ensure there is good illumination when using the computer as the screen light is not enough when working with the computer in a dark place. Furthermore, siting position is also important as many people sit with their backbones folded. Sitting in such a way that the backbones are straight will make the weight distributed thereby reducing chances of back pain that is common with those who sit for extended hours.Finally, regular exercise, good sleep and healthy eating habits are also important. In all, thanks for sharing this post.",

It can also cause poor postural defect, poor circulation of blood to the entire body thereby causing swelling in the affected area e.g the leg. People who use pain relief as prescribed by their physician or doctor can feel relax and happy but also experience drowsiness, confusion, nausea, constipation and even slow breathing. By taking too much of this medicine can lead to liver damage, stomach bleeding and kidney disease. Though pain relief pills as it advantages but also has its disadvantages too. Exercising is a very important remedy. Cause it helps the flow of blood to the body. So the need to exercise every morning is very necessary and essential to tackle over sitting. I agree to the walk every hour of sitting. Yes it helps your metabolism and sometimes remove boredom after long steering at the computer and even help better re-strategies or brainstorm ways of getting the best out put in a task.",

And again I suggest the use of eye glasses if one must stay longer while using these gadgets.",

The hardship of today make many of us to stay glued to our screens all in the name of hustle and forget that a healthy mind is a wealthy mind. Although our OP didn't really highlight the importance of adequate rest, it is to note that working after proper rest both refreshes the mind and body and enhances productivity. It's good to also use devices that auto adjust our screen display to fit the light source in our office or living space, so as we save our vision and avoid headaches from too much eye straining.",

Radiation: most computer screens have cathode ray tubes (CRT), which emit X-ray radiation that is extremely bad for the health. Being exposed to radiation can increase one’s risk of cancer, migraines, and tumors. It can also lead to miscarriage or birth defects in pregnant women.This radiation part, aside just the rays that are being emitted by the CRT, computers also emits electro magnetic wave, that are also harmful to the body system. That is why we are advised to try as much as possible to keep our phone further away from our heads as possible. Even when you want to make a phone call, it's better you use a Bluetooth or a headphone. And there is something I observed while using my old PC, I plugged it to light and I also plug those cheap earpiece that has one silver design on the ear part. While I was using it, I was feeling some electric shock, by right earpiece supposed to be using milliamps of current while using a voltage range from 3volt and below which shouldn't be able to cause any electrical sensation. Hence, it's unsafe to use your direct earpiece when your device is plugged on to light.",
