Obviously buying upvotes so you can post on all forums would be another essential service. I also have to buy Google accounts because they don't accept my perfectly good phone number for no reason. The whole internet is such a stupid game these days. Google now gives results they wanted you to type in instead of what you actually searched for even if there is a word-for-word exact match forget about finding it.",

      "body": "These votes would show up for a while but Reddit has automated systems for detecting vote manipulation and their system catches on. And later those upvotes will be deleted from the system. This will end up hurting the posters when they are connected to the vote manipulation ring.Every bot or user that's caught on brigading and vote manipulation will be either automatically directly warned or shadowbanned and those accounts are rendered useless later on.So just to be warned, if you buy these services, it's only hurting you in a long run. It doesn't even matter if OP is using several different IPs each bot. Reddit's detecting system is getting quite sophisticated with help of AI tech. As someone who has several old accounts with 200k+ karma in reddit, and who is admin of several huge subreddits, i am quite familiar with their system.Not to mention how unethical it is to support something that's constantly used by troll farms and in cyber warfare.",

While you are being transparent about the upvotes being bots, I feel that this type of thing just perpetuates everything that is wrong with content creation these days. If a post, article, website or other media is not engaging enough to have natural upvotes or views, it doesn't need to be falsely liftedâ€¦ I've always had issues with this type of thing, but I won't blame OP for the hustle. Big dog gotta eat, I guess.",
