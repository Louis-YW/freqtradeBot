I want to access this feature because i still have pending transaction 3 days ago while using the fastest option for the transaction speed of the BlueWallet app. I want to avoid this issue by setting a custom fee as my default transaction fee.Maybe I’m missing something.",

Just tap that and it'll give you the options: Fast, Medium, Slow and also Custom which opens a new dialog for you to write, but that's not going to save them, you have to set them each time you send, which makes sense, considering that the mempool's state changes.As for your current transaction, then you can always bump the fee: https://bluewallet.io/high-fees-and-transactions-pending-what-to-do/",

      "body": "Thanks everyone for the help, The fee estimates seems like not clickable on my first look on it. I’m just relying on the fees available on the next part after filling up the details. @Omegastarscream, Thanks for the tutorial link for the bump fee feature. i'm sure that I can use it in the future but not on my existing pending transaction since it's a casino deposit. Bumping fee will create different TXID that might flag my account for double spend. I'm happy now on the customization on the fee.",

There’s no bump fee option on the bottom part to edit my fee use like what the video tutorial showing.I’m using the latest version of the app and I tried both android and ios but gives me the same result. I’m wondering if I can use the RBF feature of electrum in case I import my private key from bluewallet to electrum even though I create the transaction on bluewallet?",

I’m wondering if I can use the RBF feature of electrum in case I import my private key from bluewallet to electrum even though I create the transaction on bluewallet?If the transaction do not support RBF, you can not use Electrum to pump the fee. Check if the transaction support RBF or not.If you generate the seed phrase on Bluewallet, you should be able to pump the fee using RBF. If it is a BIP39 seed phrase but the transaction is made on a wallet that do not support RBF, you will not be able to pump the fee, even if the seed phrase is imported on a wallet that support RBF.Another issue that can occur is if you generate the seed phrase on Electrum (I mean Electrum seed phrase). You will not be able to pump the fee if you import the seed phrase on Bluewallet to make transaction. Like this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5422456.msg62055308#msg62055308",

I’m sure that RBF is available when I’m using this wallet on my electrum wallet.Is RBF feature removed if I use the private key of my specific wallet address instead of importing the seedphrase that containing multiple wallet address?",

(irrespective of the wallet you generate it), instead of BIP39 seed phrase. This is also new to me, but that is just the reason. Electrum has not disappointed like this, but I have learned not to use more than BIP39 seed phrase on Bluewallet if I want to be able to use RBF to pump the fee. Likey also you will not be able to use CPFP also to pump the fee if you are the recipient.",

I confirm this issue by creating new wallet on Bluewallet and send transaction with low fee. The bump fee is available on my recent transaction. So I guess I have no choice here than to wait for my deposit to confirmed. I just hope that it will just drop on the purging range so that I can just send it again for a higher fee.Thanks everyone.",
