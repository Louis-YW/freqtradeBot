OP, you must have read motivational books like \"How to attract users to your topic, make a discouraging title\"?A little advice, especially since you care so much that everyone is mutually polite, is to read this thread. I think you will follow the ethics of the forum and heed the advice.Quote from: theymos on August 24, 2012, 07:31:55 AMInclude enough info in the title so that readers can mostly guess what your topic is about. Try to condense your topic's main idea into a few sentences. Ideally, people should be able to write useful, on-topic replies by just reading the title (though this sometimes isn't possible).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5182260.0",

But anyways, a lot of factors could lead to its value and not just the decentralized system but also it has history of many things in the past that makes it valuable today and could be more in the future. One thing is for sure though, adoption of bitcoin will expand more and more as people realizing how good blockchain in terms of store of value.",

Which is scarcity and decentralization of it. I could extend it to other factors too but you specifically mentioned these two so i am going to make it on these two factors only.1. Scarcity: means limited supply which means, BTC in compared to Gold has limited supply which means with time the demand of the BTC will exceed supply thus Price of BTC will increase. 2. Decentralization: Unlike Gold, BTC is not controlled by some or group of entities. You must be thinking how gold is managed by single entity. It's not but tracked, processed by single or group of governments. Point is, Gold's supply could be restricted but BTC shops will be open always.When the value will increase due to scarcity and demand will increase due to decentralization factor, The price will be increasing too. Not to mentioned halving process which is the main player of whole game. Which assure the price to move up with time.",

Bitcoin is a store of value which is what investors are attracted to investing in Bitcoin. The scarcity of bitcoin (limiting the supply to just 21 million coins that can ever be minted) means that inflation won't be a problem for Bitcoin and the value of your investment can always intact. The decentralized nature contribute to its value proposition because Bitcoin is different from other currency as they are all centralized but since Bitcoin is different it give those interested in it an alternative to the fiat (centralized) system and a different means of exchange. If bitcoin wasn't decentralized, it won't have been any different from the numerous fiats solution that we already have but because it is different and has a fixed supply it's the better alternative to fiat transactions.",
