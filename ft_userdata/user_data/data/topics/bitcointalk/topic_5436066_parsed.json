  "content": "Filecoin will soon release FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine), bringing smart contracts (actors) to the ecosystem.Along with this comes a new era for decentralized applications, whose smart contracts can interact directly with Filecoin's decentralized storage.Mark3d team sees a large and unprecedented market for new IT solutions based on a new protocol that will eventually replace http.Today we present our solution for decentralized storage of encrypted files of all sizes and formats in the form of NFT.The fundamental disadvantages of NFT are the possibility of loss of attached data and unauthorized copying (right-click and save).The first problem is solved by Filecoin itself. And we solve the second problem with our new standard for NFT - Encrypted FileToken (EFT).Based on this solution, now anyone can mint NFT, attach any file to it, which will be uploaded to IPFS and Filecoin and will be encrypted. Now only the owner of NFT can download this file. And when you transfer or sell it, along with it will be transferred the decryption key of the file.This opens up a new market for file tokenization and presents monetization opportunities to the widest range of audiences.We wrote an article about this solution and we will be glad to get feedback from the community.Here's a link to it: https://medium.com/mark3d-xyz/how-to-attach-an-encrypted-file-to-your-nft-7d6232fd6d34",
