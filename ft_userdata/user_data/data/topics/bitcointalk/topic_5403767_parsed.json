Are they the same with MSI and others?.If the seller offers you an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) offer, then the price cannot be very cheap and you will receive a product with a lower warranty period.But sometimes the supplier can sell you a video card that is assembled from used components. That's the only reason the price can be lower. Not necessarily that this video card will be worse.But for example, in a month you will be able to buy a used video card from a well-known brand for the same price as the so-called OEM now. You need to take a test batch and check the quality if the price is favorable.",

You might get a loud cooler blower fan instead of a quieter higher quality copper heatsink with multiple fans but the build quality is very good and they rarely get any issues.",

Some 3rd party boards have better coolers some don't. Even within a brand there are differentqualities of fans on different models. Fans are just used as a marketing tool because there's nothing else to distinguish among different brands. Nvidia branded GPUs tend to use blower fans which are preferable is some instances because theyblow the hot air out the back instsead of inside the case. There's no good reason to avoid them.",

Nvidia branded GPUs tend to use blower fans which are preferable is some instances because theyblow the hot air out the back instsead of inside the case. There's no good reason to avoid them.But there is, a blower fan as you say good to blow the hot air out of the PC case. For most OEM PC cases, there is zero of airflow in their PC case which is also why they rather dump the hot air outside instead of the open-style fan dumping hot air everywhere in the PC case. Still, this makes a lot of OEM video cards with blower fan style usually operate in a very hot condition unless they have low power consumption and why they are only used for display output or office work (word, excel,...). Meaning they could have been degraded in the performance or have a low life on the components. So yes, there is a good reason why video cards that come with blower fans are ranked in the low tier. OP, you should reconsider to see if the cost to replace the new cooler and fan is worth the price along with the bad state of the cards.",

Some manufacturers use used video chips that they buy at sales of broken equipment. For example, for sale in your country, there will be more demand for a video card from the famous ASUS brand than for a video card from the Yeston or SOYO brand, which many people have not even heard of.",

These fans work well with an AIB because the exhaust fan is much larger than the small space found on the blower GPU backplate.So you basically get more airflow and a quieter system. With the blower fan you don’t have much room to work with so the fan needs to run very fast and it’s very nosy.",

With the blower fan you don’t have much room to work with so the fan needs to run very fast and it’s very nosy. You get more air blowing in all directions, I call that turbulance, not flow.My take is the blower is more professional. It blows air in 1 direction providing better options for additional cooling like external fans and ducting.It also allows cards to be placed closer together and doesn't blow hot air on other components. Noise is not a consideration.AIBs are easier to get and usually cheaper otherwise I'd probably have more blowers.",
