It's amazing to know that Adam back told Satoshi about B-money, which is kind of a strange thing. I guess, those e-mail conversations could give a clue to many people that who Satoshi can be, but they still won't be able to find the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. I'm sure they'll try their best to force Adam to know more details about Satoshi based on those e-mails.",

      "body": "This isn't entirely new. At least we've already known prior to this that Adam Back had correspondence with Satoshi Nakamoto. But I'm a little bit surprised that Satoshi was already ready for Bitcoin's whitepaper release when he/she/they learned of Wei Dei's B-money. I thought Wei Dei's early work played a vital role early on while Satoshi was still conceiving Bitcoin. If not for Adam Back, Bitcoin would have been created entirely oblivious of B-money. I have this suspicion that Satoshi wasn't well-connected with the rest of the gang. Of course, there wasn't only The Cryptography Mailing List, that Satoshi was part of, where the development of an electronic cash is abundantly discussed. There were several other lists. Satoshi might not be part of many of those.

While they're strong advocates of privacy, they're not actually hiding or working in the shadows. The likes of Adam Back, Wei Dei, Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, and others are public. Even the Cypherpunk's Manifesto was written by Eric Hughes. Eric's co-founders of the Cypherpunk movement, Timothy May and John Gilmore, are also personally known. And they're also not just communicating online and anonymously. They also had face-to-face meetings. I wonder if Satoshi, albeit unknown, turned up even once. Of perhaps one of them is indeed Satoshi.",

Well, they can reveal their own identity but I don't see any of them revealing other people's identity plus they probably won't mind revealing themselves as they probably think that they could get their message across much more effective if they reveal themselves to the public plus these personalities that revealed their identity and have considered themselves as cypherpunks are probably just scratching the surface behind the advocacy towards a more private living and interaction on the online space. Satoshi probably attended and he probably used a different identity, that's the only logical explanation here, at least for me.",

I was talking about those people who are interested to find out the guy who has created Bitcoin and I believe you know who those guys are. Those conversations gave them a clue that Satoshi might be a known person to Adam Back and that's why from now on they might try their best to gain as much information about Satoshi from that cypherpunk as they possibly could. I'm sure they will try to investigate about him in a passive way not an active way, they might use various social engineering tactics to gather information about Satoshi from Adam back.",
