I think BNB will have a future as long as the exchange Binance,the entity behind that coin will be in service to the people.However you can never go wrong if you opt to exchange whatever coin you have in Bitcoin as in the long term that is a reassuring trade,you will reap the benefits of such move in the next all time high,although even 2023 has started with the positive notes on crypto,as we are seeing an increase today.Another bold move would be to split that amount equally to really low value coins with a good team behind their project,like Raptoreum for example but the best to do for stability is to convert it to Bitcoin.",

BNB has cheap price recent months and you can hold your BNB.You did wisely converted NFT tokens to BNB but in future, don't convert your BNB token to other NFT tokens. Holding BNB is better because most of NFT projects are not too good. Their tokens can be dumped by gamers, by their scam teams and you will have more risk to lose with NFT tokens.BNB is backed by Binance that are strong and their buy back and burn events can help BNB not only to maintain its price in bear market but also will create hype in bull market.Convert BNB to BTC is another good idea but in bull market, BNB will give you better profit than BTC.",

Then your friend was so stupid. your friend must be so blindly. So, what things that makes him said that? you shall ask him about this. I think that holding BNB is far better rather than bitcoin if you are only having small amounts of money. You shall not feel worry about that. You can try to decide which the best decision for your money. I think that do your own reseach is far better rather than blatantly believing in your friend. I meant you can conver your BNB to the stable token if you are thinking BNB was not safe enough. You shall understand about BNB. BNB has so many products and these products were fully successful compared with any other tokens in the market. It looks so stupid to call BNB has no future.",

Also, net profit growth is something to look at before you plan a strategy and implement it.but I think BNB is a good coin to own especially long term you should take a look at the CMC chart you can see that BNB has quite a promising trend and also a good trail and currently BNB is 4th in CMC that should be able to judge it. And if I were in your shoes, I would still choose BNB and for the long haul.",

If it is then I would probably convert at least half of it to bitcoin and then keep the rest on BNB, just as a safety measure in case something happened to the binance exchange, however if that is only part of the whole value of your portfolio then I will say that keeping the BNB is not bad idea, I know there has been a lot of FUD recently against exchanges and binance in particular, but BNB seems like a good coin to keep for the short term.",

We can't really say if BNB doesn't have a future anymore, because Binance is still the most powerful exchange in the world and it can be just a temporary lack of trust from investors, being possible to be reverted futurely.But just as a guarantee, I would totally swap those BNB into Bitcoin right now and keep it stored safely. That is the best alternative, I suppose, since stablecoins are also considered a risky deal, as they are managed by centralized companies which aren't trusted by investors as well, and have similar modus operandi of crypto exchanges.",

I am definitely not a Binance shill because i don't own any BNB myself and i am also pretty critical regarding Binance in general because they are just becoming to big with the buying of coinmarketcap and other things and in my opinion it is never a good thing if one company is becoming to pick within a certain space of an industry.Even i have to say though that i think that the statement \"binance has no future anymore\" is a pretty stupid one. Yes at the moment it seems like that centralized exchanges have took a pretty big hit with all the stuff that happened to FTX, but if Binance has no future anymore, then we would experience a bear market that would be 10x harder than the one we are in right now.",

Nothing to fear IMO, I would certainly try my trading skill if this is mine. Buy BTC with it and trade on BTC/USD.Since the market is becoming bullish, it will be good to keep it a little longer to make a profit. BNB is still a good token for the long term. BNB has use cases like transaction fees in the network or fees in Binance which means this token has demand. It's up to OP to keep it or sell it.",
