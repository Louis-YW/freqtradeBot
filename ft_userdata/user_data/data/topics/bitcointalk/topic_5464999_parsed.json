If you use low leverage or 1x, you will be able to make profit from it. But it is good sometimes to gain and close your position as early as possible because the market that you think is overbought might not later reduce much and later people may buy it more. If bitcoin is not yet $30000, my mind will not be at rest and  bitcoin and other coins may go up higher.",

That means that it's not effective to you. But if you've got some strategy that you feel is gonna work for you, feel free to follow it until you see the effect of it being better.Anyway, my tip to you being a newbie. Avoid futures.",

Price 17.065$ on binance i think good entry for short with this price now.Enjoy  hope you like it let me know ur toughts aswell , thnx I think your trading method in the futures market is too risky. But as long as you can still have a good strategy. And have risk management in trading so you will stay safe. Each sets a profit target and sets a stop loss target. So that when the market changes or suddenly, you don't worry that you will experience a lot of losses because we have set a stop loss. For trading on pumped coins sometimes it brings big profits. As long as we can have the courage to enter. The method used in this type is fast trading (Scalping).I personally do not like to take risks that are too high. I prefer to patiently monitor the market and jump in when it's worth entering. Well I am also a day trader. And scalping has also become my daily routine. On coins that do not have any news and events, technical analysis is needed and the level of accuracy is quite high. But for coins that have events and news, we only have to follow market trends and estimate the response or market sentiment to the events and news that appear. So that sentimental analysis, fundamentals are prioritized and then make technical analysis before taking positions. and to determine to what extent the target increase and take profits.",

In the past, the strength of supply and demand moved the price strongly in a certain direction, and it is difficult to reverse that direction within a period of 10 minutes to 30 minutes. there was an opportunity to catch up with some currencies that suddenly rise and achieve increases of 2% to 6% from them, but the matter is completely different now and the upward trend can turn rapidly, which makes the option to sell when the price rises is done by market order, which often means selling at a loss or at a profit little.This strategy is not always effective in the psychoanalytic levels of Bitcoin but it is difficult to predict the next direction.",
