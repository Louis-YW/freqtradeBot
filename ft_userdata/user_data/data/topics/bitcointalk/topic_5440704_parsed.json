This is what I am going to ask from @theymos. From my perspective, the major concern is not merits but user engagement on the Indian local board.Our priority is to keep the discussions active. Getting merits on posts should not be our priority and  that's why asking merit source to support won't do us any good.If at all we want the Indian board to be alive and active then we will have to bring in more people and keep them engaged with discussions.As we all have previously discussed, the issue here is the language. Since India has so many languages there is no one language that can be used through the board.Most people prefer English but then that is the global language used in the forum which again keeps people from posting in this board.They prefer posting in other boards which are less spammy and more engaging. I guess there's no solution to this after all.",

I also think a little bit of help from the source can uplift the morale of those who have been actively creating topics. Not all topics are good and not all of them are bad.You cannot expect a good amount of activity or engagement on the Indian local board due to the uncertainty created by the government of India. Still, a handful are trying to revive it and they should be encouraged That was the only reason I created this topic.",

I think a few members like me are active on this board and are still creating topics but not getting the required response from Indian members on BTT.

I am frustrated and more over now I feel this board is a waste of my time and everyone who post here as none of the Merit sources are either active or have any intention to support us.I totally agree that those who are Merit sources are either sleeping or not interested anymore here. As per my understanding, almost everyone who is either a legendary or a Hero Member on this board got those ranks as they were here before 2018. As of now, it is difficult to get merits in order to rank up. If you visit other local boards you would see how those responsible to give merits are encouraging activities by giving merits to those topics that make a difference and are unique. I have created a few topics on this board and except for the OP and @Bitcoin Smith I do not see anyone encouraging newbies like us. I have also seen many senior members busy earning Bitcoin with the signature campaign and regularly posting on other boards and threads. They are least bothered to come and comment on our local boards. They were born in India, and got everything from the country but still discourage fellow Indians to advance. BTW!",

That's a very bold statement. I don't think anyone on this board has ever \"discouraged\" anyone to advance.In fact people have only encouraged others to keep the discussions active.It's a harsh reality that we being the world's most populated country still don't have enough members to keep the board active.We cant blame anyone because we have tried multiple times to revive the board yet very few people joined hands.This is one of the reasons why you see people being active on other boards and posting regularly while not posting on this board.I do hope things get changed here onwards and we do see some activities on this board going forward.",

You commented and others are commenting or trying to create topic relevant to this board. In my opinion it is enough!The big issue with Indians is that they get an opportunity and then they blow it. For me if I see five guys participating without any raffle or offers on this board. I would support each one of them. My opinion for support is to encourage them with Merits and in turn they would come up with topics. That is all that matters to me. I am least bothered to think about language issue or anything. English is the most common language in India after Hindi. There is nothing like a language barrier. If you are not good in English then use Hinglish. The only issue is that we don't have any leader to guide this board. Those who were chosen have left it and now it all depends on us how to get it functional.",

I should have continued the initiatives to improve the board but with government trying their best to suppress the use of bitcoin or crypto in general I don't see new people joining this board anytime soon. @eaLiTy was the most active member in trashing/reporting spams and if they are still active, we can make him a moderator but theymos would request for sufficient activity in our board before appointing anyone to the role.The raffle should have been restarted back during the Republic Day but it was postponed again. So, this time let's not delay this and rework together to start them tomorrow!Thoughts @pakhitheboss @pawanjain @elevates",

After creating this topic everyone waited here for your response and in the end, I took the initiative to write about it.I hope I have not offended you in any form as you are one of the Legendary members who in the past has made a lot of contributions and changes in order to keep this board afloat. It would be great if you continue to stay active on this board and not leave those who are trying to revive it. We all are facing the same government issue as you said since most of us are based in India. We can only hope that the perspective of this government about cryptocurrency changes in the future.",

I personally have been away for a while due to certain commitments and let things slide a bit.Before that, Heisenberg and I had tried quite a bit to revive the board here. We even petitioned for a new Mod (I am not aware whats the status right now, Did Theymos respond or not.) That aside, its still a privilege that we have this sub. We need more people to engage in a productive manner and contribute what they can to crypto and the forum. Here is an old post I created for some suggestions about merit.I also encourage newbies to introduce themselves on the pinned introduction post. I have time on hand and will be putting in sometime at the forum. Those of you who have made india-centric posts and want me to take a look, please share your profiles on the post that I shared above.If anything else, send me a PM and lets see what we can do for a revival.Cheers!",

For the better part of last year, I was seriously involved in overseeing the translation of \"Bitcoin Whitepaper\" in Tamil and after so many rigorous attempts I was able to find a software engineer who had the right blend of excellent language skills and technical expertise. So with the help of him, I was able to submit the final completely translated paper to bitcoin.org team but to the contrary I have never heard about the advancements in hosting the paper to the site. Well, this contributed to a partial inactivity and a few other personal commitments to various crypto projects & moderation of r/BitcoinIndia prevented me from allocating additional time to the forum.But right now, with really good support & revival of interest from the Indian members I think we need to work together in bringing back not only this local board but create a positive impact in the Indian Bitcoin society by researching various pathways to push the narrative and shed light on the suppression created by the government.Now, let us start the revival attempt with a good raffle today.",
