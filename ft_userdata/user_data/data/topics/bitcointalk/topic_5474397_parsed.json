Any help or advice will help me out for sure , looking for buyers preferably private buyers that are ready to buy, let me know what you guys think So if I understand correctly what you're asking - you want tips on the best way to sell off your stash of 200 bitcoins you've got, right? You're even willing to offer a discount to move them quick.  I seriously doubt you actually have that much BTC.  But hey, on the off chance you do probably the first thing I'd try is making a post over on the Currency exchange board in the marketplace section here.  Could find somebody interested in doing an in-person swap for cash depending where you're located.  I'd say split it up into smaller chunks too when selling, instead of trying to unload it all at once.  And be extra careful avoiding scammers attracted to a big score like that and  maybe even consider using an escrow service to make sure you actually get paid if dealing with an online buyer.",

Any help or advice will help me out for sure , looking for buyers preferably private buyers that are ready to buy, let me know what you guys think If your BTC were acquired in a legal way and it is not a problem for you to register on a centralized crypto exchange and do KYC, then that would be the simplest way to sell them. However, it seems to me that this is not the case with you, because you don't just want to sell a few hundred BTC, but you even give a discount, which means that you want to get rid of them as soon as possible.If your BTC are part of some dirty business (hacking) then not only can you get yourself into trouble, but also those who buy from you can have problems. Therefore, I will not advise you how to proceed, until you tell where you got the 200 BTC from.",

Hmm, makes me wonder if theres some shady business going on here and  you wouldn't happen to be trying to dump some questionable funds would ya? Probably ain't my place to pry, but details sure would be nice.  A deal like this seems... well... sketchy.",

Total loss ~$12.5m.It seems to me that this story makes no sense at all - because why would someone go to the trouble of organizing such a robbery, and then allow someone to freeze the stolen funds? Either the thieves are dumb idiots who didn't know it was possible, or it's just another \"we are a good and honest company\" story. I mean, most of what was stolen was frozen, so the OP is definitely not the hacker Quote from: https://dailyhodl.com/2023/11/12/binance-ceo-says-executives-from-a-client-were-lured-into-massive-12500000-crypto-robbery-setup/“We investigated the on-chain activities and reached out to our partners earlier today to have the wallet frozen, as all of the funds were taken in USDT and transferred to a Tron wallet. We managed to freeze about $11.8m of the $12.5m stolen.”",

The thing to do here is to divide your coins into smaller amounts and sell them in an exchange. If i were you i'd be wary of private messages i would receive after this post, and to the community, sending OP a private message might also be risky, cause they seem suspicious.",

If someone says they can't figure out how to sell off 200 BTC, they're probably full of shit and lying or running some kind of scam.  Id love it if someone could prove me I'm wrong about this.  But if you tell me you don't know how to cash out 200 BTC, I'm just not buying it.",

If you have 200 bitcoins, you must have bought them from somewhere and you can sell them from where you bought them. Anyone who has such a large amount of bitcoins must know about the cryptocurrency market and buying and selling bitcoins. Bitcoin is not something to be offered for sale at a discount, but Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is always improving. It is natural that anyone who invests or buys anything, knows everything about its buying and selling. Why do you need private buyers? You can sell on any exchange whenever you want. Do you have stolen property, looking for private buyers?",

It just surprises me that you are asking for help even after owning a large amount of Bitcoin in your portfolio. Maybe you must have inherited it and know nothing about bitcoin to be asking such questions, but it’s fine. 200BTC is not a small amount of bitcoin, even getting it into an exchange where you can get a buyer easily will be very difficult to move them out all at once, because of the worth of it and you’ll be registering with them as an individual without any financial track record to your name and you’re not also registering as a company. Take it slow and lay them off gradually. People are very smart and will like to take advantage of your lack of much knowledge in the crypto space to steal or rob you off your bitcoin. You will get a buyer but just don’t be in a rush and you’ll get people also coming to you to connect you to the private buyers, be careful when trading with them, they could be the scammer and the private buyer at the same time. No what and what not to disclose to them when conversing with them. They are smarter than you can ever think, so be careful so that you don’t lose everything in a rush.",

If yes why would you want to sell your own earned Bitcoin with a discount it's really suspicious but well it's still your choice.Although I would suggest you sell of on an exchange, it would be really risky to sell such amount of Bitcoin through peer to peer the amount is huge but using an excrow can reduce the risk.You can either use the decentralized exchange with is my preferred choice since the amount is huge protecting your privacy is wise, also you can use the centralized exchange too.Below is a good list of decentralized exchange and centralized exchange you can choose from.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2906237.msg29885570#msg29885570",

Why do you want to sell your bitcoin and you are offering discounts? And why are you looking for private buyers? Don't you know you can end up being scammed? Selling that amount of bitcoin is kind of risky, so you have to be very careful. I don't know if you really have that amount of bitcoin to sell, but you have to be very careful. Don't trust anyone who contacts you privately that they want to buy, they are likely scammers who will want to scam you. What I will recommend you do is get an exchange and sell your bitcoin on a reputable exchange. I think that's just the safest place. But if I may ask, how did you accumulate that amount of bitcoin? Is it through an exchange or a private seller?Quote from: ImThour on November 17, 2023, 02:04:28 PMIf this story of yours is real and you still HODL 200BTC which is almost 7 Million dollars, congratulations.

Do not try to rush with such a big amount, there will be so many scammers around to get you indulge in a deal with them.Do you truly believe the story? I can't really say because if the OP can accumulate that amount of bitcoin, am sure the OP will know the right channel to follow when selling it. The OP won't have to come here seeking for help on how to sell, and I don't think someone new to cryptocurrency will be holding that amount of bitcoin, maybe the Op should show evidence that he is really holding the bitcoin, no one will believe him without any evidence.Also, if the Op is trying to make use of private buyer's, the OP should be very careful. Scammers are everywhere looking for people to scam. Even if the OP will be selling the bitcoin gradually, the OP have to be careful, and the OP shouldn't trust anyone. Just assume everyone you meet on the internet is a scammer. Treat everyone as a suspect. The Op will be receiving messages from different people right now claiming to be interested in buying the bitcoin, but the OP has to be smart.",
