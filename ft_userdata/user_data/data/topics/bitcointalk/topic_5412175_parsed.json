  "content": "Especially after the pandemic, flexible working schedules keep popping up, either through working from distance, or less hours. Only a few countries have embraced working 4 days a week, instead of 5 or 6, and case studies have shown positive results. Some of them include, the UK, which has recently begun one of the largest trials of the 4-day working week, Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Japan, Spain and the UAE. The 5-day a week is one of the most common ones, however, with the evolution of technology, longer hours don't necessarily guarantee a higher productivity, most likely the opposite.Some of the benefits 4-day work week include:Reduced costs on both ends, employees will have one less day to commute to work, while avoiding paying extra money for lunch, coffees etc. The employers on the other hand, will have the office closed for one more day, reducing running costs. Happier employees and better mental health. Having more free time increase overall happiness and improves work-life balance, which can result into lower levels of stress and a generally better mental health, something which is suffering in our day and age.And most importantly, increase in productivity levels. Overworked and stressed employees are actually less productive than those working a normal or reduced working week.My case - Example to avoidBy law, in Greece (and most of Europe to be honest) the typical working week comprises of 40 working hours. However, this rarely happens in the private sector, where in most cases you're working up to 48 hours/week, with one day off in a week. In the tourism sector, it's actually a lot worse. Employees are working 7 days/week, up to 8-10 hours per day and not usually not being paid good enough. Personally, in May, I started working at a known supermarket chain for 20 hours/week (part-time). I wanted to take a little time off, after working for 4 years full-time with only one day off per week. My plan backfired though, the money wasn't enough to keep up with the increasing living costs and started working at a hotel's restaurant, another 24 hours/week. Recently, I was proposed to work the night shift at the hotel's reception, because the former employee had some family business to attend to and had to leave. Me, wanting to make some extra money due to having upcoming expenses, accepted. Now, I'm working 16 hours per day, except Sunday and Monday which are my days off from the supermarket, which equal to 100 hours/week (a week is comprised of 168 hours). Of course, I will only be doing that for September, and here I am, writing this post during the graveyard shift.How many hours/week is the typical in your country? How many hours are you actually working and how does a 4 day work week sound?",

From Mondays to Fridays, the idea of 4 days is not in my country. Then some private sectors work for 6days and some work on Sundays making it 7days.  Some private workers work for 10 to 12 hrs a day. While some works on shift, it depends on what you like.But someone I worked with believes in working at your own pace. Infact he recommends we work from home and give us task to accomplish within a period of time. I advice we learn to work smart and get good skills so that we could chose or reject jobs that come our ways.",

During the pandemic, lots of businesses and companies were being shut down, and lucky if some of these institutions decided to just cut the number of their employees instead of totally shutting down the business to save the cost of operation. Because of that incident, most people found it a blessing if they found work these days that's why regardless of the working hours they are fine working that long.As a quote says, \"no one got rich from working 8 hours\", it might make sense but it's hard for most people to solve that. That's the reality.",

What would those choices look like?The majority seem content to parrot media talking points. Blindly supporting whatever random proposal is put on the table. I think for a four day work week to become reality. People would have to invest more time and energy into learning basic facts and basic science. Being more informed. And not being so enthusiastic to support random things.The choices we make and things we support have an enormous impact upon our society and standard of living. Most of the things people dislike about the current day world. Are things they supported. We have the power to change things. Its only a matter of adjusting the way we think. Making better decisions and supporting better options. Most do not want to change. They want politicians to change. The world to change. Everything to change, except for them.But if we're being honest. The place where the biggest gains and improvements can be made. Is by people making an effort to change and better themselves on an individual level.",

This is basically what happens at my country as well with the difference that even huge corporations will not pay you for overtime, personally I think this is one of those things that in theory sounds good but that are going to be almost impossible to implement correctly, after all a business is not going to want to pay the salary of more employees which are working less than in the past, so if anything this will create a black market in which people are still going to have to work for the same amount of time but they will have to keep quiet about it or they could be fired, so instead of helping them a policy like that could play against employees.",

Someone who does a physical job that they are not passionate about will always want to work less.",

I.e. 12hours for two mornings and 12hours for two nights, sums up to 4 days, then we go on 4 days off. During those off days, however, catching up on sleep and trying hands-on other passive income projects suffices. Although I felt the changes in my body system, my pain was that the same job could be done from a remote location, but management ensured we had to turn up to the office once it is ones shift turn.Most other private sectors work 6 days and only on Sundays do they go off. I do believe the working hours depend on the kind of service an organization or company offers. If one can do the hours, then you got a job and vice versa. Am a strong believer in one knowing what one wants before going after it because we have choices. Don't like a working schedule, or the work hours is too demanding, or maybe a company is too stiff and you don't like it, please change it. It is not always about the money most times. One has got to stay healthy to get wealthy in the long run.",

How many hours are you actually working and how does a 4 day work week sound?In our country, government employees tend to work at least 40 hours per week and there is no additional payment in overtime which is quite unfortunate. It's base on my experience and what I heard to my friends that are government employee as well. I've been a government employee for 8 months only (because I can't handle the stress) and I don't see myself working with a boss for a long time that's why I didn't even work there for a year.Now with regards to 4-day work week, it has been proposed here 2 years ago at the middle of the pandemic but unfortunately only a few private companies approved it. I think we will all agree with a 4 day work week right? I mean I don't see any disadvantages to us employees but all positive. More time with the family and lesser stress and lesser stress equals to more happiness and happiness will be spread to all of the people around you. Unfortunately, there are some people who still working more than 4 days because of the increasing prices of commodities and foods. There are some who are working at day and at the same time working at night just to have money to be used to pay expenses and foods. On the other hand, there are some people who knows how to use a computer that are just working on their home as a freelancer. They are very flexible and they will work whenever they want to.",

I was never asked to come to work early, nor asked to stay for a lot longer than necessary. But back when I was still waiting tables and work as a utility guy for a restaurant, we were always expected to come in to work 2 hours before our actual shift and spend another hour or so after shift to help with the transition. Pay is awful and the work is extremely hard but hey, it's where I learned how to be extremely patient anyways. Typically in my country, we have 40 hours/week too, but usually that hours is just a guideline as a lot of employers here in the Philippines are extremely stingy when it comes to paying their workers right. They'd be expecting an employee to work close to 60 hours/week and that extra 20 hours will just be paid with a 'thank you' which sucks.",

The format of office work from 8 am to 17 with a lunch break is quite comfortable if you are lucky with your superiors and have an interest in the subject area. And if you live within walking distance from the office, without spending a lot of time on the road.2. The format of work from 8 to 23 you work for two days and rest for two days is tiring, the weekly life cycle gets lost and you live half your life at work, if it’s interesting, then not for long and only as an experiment.3. The format of a flexible free schedule is the most optimal if you are a professional in your field with an expensive hourly rate and can adjust your schedule yourself in a wide range. This path places high demands on hard and soft skills, including the ability to self-organize, but this is exactly what, in my opinion, everyone should strive for in life.4. I think that machines and mechanisms should work, the whole routine should and will be automated over time. This is not a reason to completely refuse to work right now, at present people work less than a century and a half ago - and in another century and a half, perhaps not 40, but say 16, 8 or even 4 working hours per week will become the new standard.
