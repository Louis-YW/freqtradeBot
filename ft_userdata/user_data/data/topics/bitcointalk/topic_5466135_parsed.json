They stole from 1 to 4 billion dollars, the exact amount cannot be determined, because officials and other government employees will not report losses, otherwise they will be fired from their jobs and the tax authorities will check their income.So, the maximum criminal liability for such a crime in Russia is 10 years in prison. article in Russianhttps://forklog.com/news/piramida-finiko-priostanovila-vyplaty-i-potrebovala-personalnye-dannye-polzovatelej",

I haven't witnessed the swap of someone who was supposed to die by life imprisonment or capital punishment, but I have watched in movies as it happened.

I understand your point mate, even here in our country wherein there are corrupt politicians, who just got a lighter sentence and then steal billions of dollars. But for me you can't compare the two.I mean in this case maybe Faruk really took all the money and leave the country and thinks that he is scoot free and live a lavish lifestyle outside of Turkey with the money of his customers.But we will see if there is reduce sentence here, it's too early to call and who knows that the next move of Faruk.What do you expect to be the next move?Some assets were frozen in banks when the exchange stopped making withdrawals of user funds.The fraudster had to spend some of the stolen money on bribes in other countries to ensure security.The remaining cryptocurrencies should be confiscated by the Turkish government.Probably the usual filing after he was found guilty, maybe more documents to show that he didn't intentionally run and play with the millions of money or his customers. But it's moot already, I don't think that the sentencing will chance.@Lucius - probably it's just a way by the court that he will die in the jail already as there are no death sentence in Turkey if I'm not mistaken. And it's likely that Turkey could have one of the toughest law for defrauding investors and laundering assets.",

Depending on the jurisdiction in which the case is tried, a defendant receiving a life sentence may become eligible for parole after serving a minimum length of time, on the order of 15–25 years. If a back-to-back penalty is imposed, the defendant must serve that minimum for every life sentence before parole can be granted. Such a penalty also ensures that even if some of the murder convictions are overturned on appeal, the defendant must still serve the sentences for the ones left standing. I don't think it's wrong that Turkey is being harsh on these people, they deserve it with the amount of damage they caused to many people.",
