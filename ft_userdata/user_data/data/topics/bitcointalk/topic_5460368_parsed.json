  "content": "Adopting an airdrop method to scam airdrop hunters is one of the oldest methods which is still in use by various scammers. They allow you claim their tokens with malicious contract address in airdrops which gives them access to steal your funds when you interact with their contract. Another of such airdrop is the ongoing AI Tokens airdrop. They have distributed their token through telegram bots to participants but the token locked. They currently have close to 1M holders who probably got the token through airdrop. The suspicion about them starts few weeks ago when they asked their holders to verify their addresses by interacting with a dapp which is suspected to be a means of phishing their target wallets and steal from them.Crypto communities most especially newbies have to be careful about such airdrop in other not to fall a cheap victim to scam.",

After they claim it, they're now about to take it through sending it and that's why they need to deposit a little amount for the gas fee. And they're not aware of it that by some smart contract, any amount that's deposited to that address the airdroppers will provide upon connecting it to their wallet and website, it will automatically suck the deposited amount for the fee.",

I mean this has been prevalent at the start of 2018 wherein airdrops is very hot that time and it gives higher dividends and everyone is receiving it in their wallet without any attachments, and the project that are giving are real and genuine.But after that hype, many projects turns out to be a scam or using airdrop as one method to steal money. So again, be very careful, if the projects is asking you to deposit some eth or any other crypto to received the airdrop then it's a scam and stay away from it.",

There is this I often says airdrops are trapped set for newbies especially those who are desperate to make cheap money without working for it are people who could like fall victim of the incident, so the best is to avoid whatever called airdrops despite any amount they are paying. Except In some cases where some trusted project wants to launch airdrop just as bestchange team do launched their loyalty rewards of 16th anniversary BC16 NFTs to their supporters and to those who had one way contributed to their platform or even having to traded on their platform, at this point I can say such drops are trusted ones.",

This kind of scam has been around for some time so people do not really have an excuse to keep falling for it, scammers know very well that many people more than anything are looking for a way to make a lot of profits without taking the effort necessary to reach their goal.So by offering exactly that they know they will get a lot of desperate people willing to do anything to get the profits they are looking for, and this is how we end up with coins like this one, which offer an airdrop but such an airdrop is nothing more but a trap to see who is dumb enough to interact with those tokens from a wallet that has some funds.",
