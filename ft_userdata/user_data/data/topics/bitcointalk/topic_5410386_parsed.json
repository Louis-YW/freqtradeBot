      "body": "Ethereum with Ethash's still the most profitable algo to mine with, but only one more month to mine ETH.If you already have a rig of Vega cards, it's worth to turn on and mine until POS.Another alternative is Autolykos (ERGO), profitable too.I'll give a suggestion to help you, install Nicehash app and let run all the benchmarks to help you know which algo is profitable at the moment.Possibly you can find another coins to mine, but both above are more stable to mine and sell in profit.",

I see that this graphic card is a but profitable with Super Zero coin because of power consumption (141watts) and on ethereum it takes 165watts.With the right setup of the card they can do pretty well in Ethereum mining and once this finishes as many expect in September you can continue with that card to mine Ethereum Classic or any other related coin.For mining that is a good card and if you already have some of them it is not a good choice to keep them turned off because they can make good money in the long run.You can also mine other coins with this card.It remains one of the best old cards for mining,however if you are planning to buy these,do so only if you find them cheap enough,otherwise it is better to start a rig with newer generation of cards like Rtx 3060 or Rtx 3060 ti which lately are down in price.",

You also get to avoid all the hassles that come with mining ETH directly, which for impatient folks can be a lot to deal with. Ethereum can rise in price many times more than bitcoin. Nicehash has a high payout threshold for a small number of video cards. Ethereum can be received in the Polygon blockchain on some pools with a minimum commission and a minimum payout threshold.",

Broken fans are not so bad and can be easily replaced with cheap 80x80 fans from the store.But these graphics cards have problems with copper tubes when gas comes out. Such video cards work for me at a temperature of 90 degrees in the summer. In winter, the situation is better, but I don’t want to buy this anymore.",
