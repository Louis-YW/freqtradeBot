It ie not everyone who cares much about luxuries, some people prefer to invest instead of spending money on luxuries. But I'm very sure everyone's care about bitcoin, even those who don't have bitcoin wish to have it.When you think of bitcoin you should be thinking about value. Luxuries don't give value in the future instead they lose value as time counts .",

Expensive fashion is mainly for showing off, it's for public display more or less. On the contrary, at least as far as my experience is concerned, Bitcoin is the opposite. I'm hiding it as much as possible. I won't even open to other people that I have Bitcoin.

Until 2140, Bitcoin is inflationary but its inflationary is coded to be halved every four years and you will not have anything like this in the world.

Bitcoin is better than all of those and offers much more:* you can get it with you anywhere effortlessly and it holds great value* you can hold it without anybody knowing it about it, without anybody having any chance to get it away from you (you may need to be a bit careful for that though)* bitcoin contains smarter technology than a Rolex imho* Bitcoin cannot be counterfeit - unlike a Rolex, fashion and so on (of course, you have to pay a little attention what blockchain you use, since forks or wrapped coins do exist)* Bitcoin is imho much more future proof than any of your examples",

Bitcoin really does carry that luxury vibe, much like high end brands. Just like a limited edition Rolex or a designer handbag, Bitcoin's scarcity and prestige make it appealing to many. It's not just about the investment; it’s also about status and identity. Owning Bitcoin can feel like being part of an exclusive club, and that allure is definitely part of its charm. Plus, the way it’s marketed and perceived in the culture adds to that \"luxury brand\" image. What do you think drives that desire for people to associate with it",

Although one of the factors is the limited amount available which makes bitcoin look more expensive, there are other issues that also affect it.The comparison may be similar but it has no similarity to the journey of bitcoin and I consider it something a little different. But in any case, Bitcoin is much more reliable for hedging purposes, even though the products you mentioned also have similarities that are not much different in terms of scarcity and price.",

Bitcoin fees skyrocket only when the network is congested, Just like commercial banks also experiencing network hitches sometimes. Bitcoin can be treated as money because it can be used as currency for payment and it is not meant for the rich because it whole is expensive but rather you can simply have it in units even uptill cents valuations. So even the poor can own units of bitcoin. People compare the scalability of bitcoin to XRP and sol because they are fast in transactions but my argument has always been do they have the large volume of transactions that the bitcoin network has?",

Bitcoin is available for all to buy because the price can be affordable by the poor and you can buy in unit.
