  "content": "I've had situations when I had a token on Ethereum that I wanted to trade but didn't have ETH to pay for gas fees, and during times when ETH was at 3-4K USD and network congested, it was hassle to get ETH since if you'd try to convert from other coin/token to ETH, you were paying hefty fees on instant exchanges since the receiving chain was ETH. Even to withdraw from cexes the withdrawal fees used to be 0.01 ETH, even at current prices that's $17.Albeit Ethereum gas prices are much low now and no congestion either, but I'm sure this will turn out much useful during congestion times and when ETH booms again. Although this is limited to certain tokens, you can see the list here, I still found it useful, may be you will too.
