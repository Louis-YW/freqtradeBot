Maybe their rituals were drawing in the lightning strikes?? OK, ya'll can mock me if you'd like, but there's some weird shit going on out there.

So I have 3 very high quality air filters.2 of these at 900 each https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VXDCHW/ref=dp_iou_view_item?1 of these at 1400https://www.amazon.com/IQAir-MultiGas-Purifier-Medical-Grade-HyperHEPA/dp/B00069EGA0/ref=asc_df_B00069EGA0/?I have this meterhttps://www.pce-instruments.com/us/measuring-instruments/test-meters/air-quality-meter-pce-instruments-air-quality-meter-pce-rcm-11-det_5858892.htmNormalwith my 3 air filters set to speeds 2 and 3My PM 2.5 reads 0My PM 10.0 reads 0 for indoor airoutdoorPM2.5 reads 7-10PM 10.0 reads 9-15Todaywith my three air filters set to 6I getPM 2.5 is 35-40PM 10.0 is 45-50 note all of the above are indoor numbers.If I bring the meter outdoorsPM 2.5 Â ranges 340 to 440PM 10.0 ranges 540 to 750these are really fucking bad numbers.If I had no air filters I would be in the emergency room right now.I have 2 other air filters and the whole house ac filter.So over 5,000 Usd worth of filtersto be at pm2.5 Â 35 vs Â pm2.5 Â 340although I would think Â with zero filters but indoors I may be more like 130 to 150. Â The house would block some smoke as would running the ac. Not going to shut the filters off to test it.",

Numbers around here are hitting the 200's (based on gov. numbers), and I'm feeling it outside, we're in a bit of a valley ourselves but I have no meter so I'm just finding a new use for my left over N95 masks if I need to go out, inside is good to go though, I think. Â Quote from: philipma1957 on June 07, 2023, 08:09:26 PMMaybe they were set by wickens. I was going with terrorists.Partially joking on the wickens front, not that it couldn't have happened, as it seems 50% of Canada's fires are typically caused by humans each year.. I just don't know if there are enough wickens in Canada to set this many fires! Â But who knows, at this point nothing surprises me.. maybe those joyriding surveillance balloons were finding good tinder spots.",
