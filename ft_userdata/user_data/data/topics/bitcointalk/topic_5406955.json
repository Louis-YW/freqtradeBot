  "content": "Hello,I would be interested to know which cryptoyoutuber is honest:Which crypto youtuber called the top at 69k and also said on his channel that he is now selling his bitcoin position?Most crypto Youtuber were hopium dealers after all and not really honest. They used us to pump their bags and secretly sold Bitcoin at 60-69k without us telling it.I know the \"Blockchain Backer\" called the top and said on his channel that he is now selling bitcoin at 65k.What other crypto Youtuber has done that too?",

      "body": "I'm not sure who's who on the Youtube as far as bitcoin goes, so for me, it doesn't matter who sells at the top, secretly or saying it on their channel. Besides, just like you and me, this so called influencers and \"experts\" are just like you and me, making wild and educated guess and if they hit it, then good for not.Just remember PlanB's $100k++ prediction at the end of last year, everything was perfect until it failed in December. Do you think he sold his stash or not? nobody knows and doesn't matter to us. We all have our own plan and strategy to sell, in my opinion.",

      "body": "None of them AFAIK, apart from Blockchain Backer, of whom I had never heard. I don't think many people were expecting the price to behave like this. We had all taken it for granted that this cycle was going to be a repeat of the previous ones and that, therefore, the price was going to go much higher than $70,000. The youtubers also make more money in bull markets than in bear markets and I think that a mixture of desire and reality prevented them, if there was anyone who smelled what was coming, from making a downward prediction and unwinding positions.Plus imagine if a famous youtuber had made such a prediction and announced he was selling, and he was wrong, that the price had gone to $200,000 or thereabouts. He would have made a fool of himself.",

You don't trust these guys same for those who promote shitcoins because they are investors themselves and it is just commonsense that they will talk good about the coins they are currently holding. In other words, they are just simply sales talking and you on the other hand will be lured if you believe his rubbish.",

There are some good guys (like Andreas Antonopoulos) who are talking about Bitcoin and/or blockchain purely for educational purposes, so they try to rely on facts and provide analysis based on their knowledge. Normally, that doesn't involve predicting the prices or giving financial advice. As for those reviewing various cryptos, keep in mind they're very likely to get paid for promoting the projects they review. And regarding the price of Bitcoin and predicting it, there's no science behind these actions, so even a decent person (the one who doesn't lie on purpose) can make mistakes.",

Basically, it's pure speculation, and anyone claiming to have got it right once, has probably predicted it a million times before that. There's a common saying of throwing enough shit on the wall before some of it sticks, and that rings true here. The thing is no one remembers the person who predicted wrong, but everyone remembers when someone gets it right. That's the nature of the business, and any speculators should be taken with a pinch of salt. Ultimately, they're just like you, and I. I actually believe Bitcoin is more unpredictable than other investments out there.",

With this unpredictable market then i could say both because people could make use of indicators which they can really foreseen if this market is alreadyoverbought basing with indicators and tools which they could presume that it was already the peak and made out decisions for them to sell which it is a nice call that had been made of.",

Most of them told everyone to hodl from $69K down to $20K. It's true most thought price was going to $10K, $12K or $14K, because they didn't see resistance levels being broken. So in defence of the overly bearish sentiment of crypto twitter or crypto youtubers, at least they can change their analysis when price changes and does the opposite of what they thought. The fact that most didn't think the bottom was in around $17.6K is personally what gave me hope, knowing that most of these influences get it wrong.",

Yeah, if they might have shared the exact link of that video with minutes and seconds where that youtuber predicted the top of bitcoin market's peak levels of current cycle then I might have approach to this topic. These days all social media infulencers are innovating new clickbait tricks for getting views and likes and this could be one of them.I am sure more than 50% of readers of this topic might go searching of the mentioned youtuber and their channel. (Moreover, I am not sure about available data on tracking publishing date of a video and editing details on the content of a published video).Just calling a top without any supporting analysis is mere fluke. I do follow many analysts who are stronger with their technical parts still they manage only 80% accuracy. Yeah, FOMO and FUDs do not follow any TA or FA hence calling a top or bottom all the times is not possible for anyone.",
