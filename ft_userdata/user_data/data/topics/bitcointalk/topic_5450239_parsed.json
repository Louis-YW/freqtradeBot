Just as other members have suggested, it will really be nice for you to get some exposure here on the forum by contacting any of the aforementioned managers. With the help of their expertise, they will definitely give you something great.Since you are out for crypto gamblers, I will suggest you also implement a Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal option. A lot of people (me in particular) will really prefer Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal over other altcoins.Quote from: MainIbem on April 26, 2023, 11:24:02 AMEdit..How secure is your site to people who are connecting their wallet to gamble with your platform?Won't there be a hack or a wallet compromisation that would lead swiping out someone funds if eventually connected to your site?It's always advisable for you to use a totally different wallet when entering a new site with zero reputation. If after testing you can move ahead to connect your main wallet, which is also not highly advisable, one should have different wallets for different purposes. Just to avoid some kind of complication.",

      "body": "welcome to the forum, well I went to read your TOS and it seems to me that your casino does not have a license from curacao, am I wrong? if your casino does not have a license from curacao then you are operating an illegal casino which is a crime the governments can close your casino any day and along with closing all customer funds that are in your casino at the time the government closes yours casino will be taken by the government and obviously the government never refunds money to injured customers. another point is that your casino does not ask for KYC which could also be the reason for one day the governments to close your casino and they will claim that your casino is money laundering, I am not suggesting that you keep charging KYC as soon as customers create an account on your casinobecause from what I can understand from money laundering laws, what the governments want is that all service providers that involve money know their customers, so even a basic KYC is already something that will make the governments not close your casino claiming that you are a promoter of money laundering, for example if when creating an account all your customers have to put their full names, place of residence, country and city, age and gender, telephone number, that is already a big step and with this basic KYC you are protected against the persecution that the governments have been doing and you will not run the risk of being closed and arrestedanother thing that I find very strange and I don't understand is why in your TOS you are not going to notify your customers in advance in case of complete or partial change in the TOS, in the real world this would never have legal coverage in a court, but from what I see in many casinos You've been putting things in the TOS that don't seem to have much sense of the law, anyway good luck with your casino and I wish you all the best on your journey",

Use just little amount of money first until the site has an excellent reputation and use secure means. That is right because most of the so-called smart contract decentralized platforms are most likely to steal your coins as you have already granted them full access to your wallet, same with the recent web3 hypes that have led many players into losing the funds once they connect to the site and grant them access. Ops please don't get it twisted and we are not saying that your platform is going to scam users but then that has been the recent happening with wallet connect and web3 casino development.",

I noticed you have not been able to respond to any of the questions asked and you have not been online since you made this post which is not a good sign of a new casino looking for participants. If we are to go by this then it will mean that there would be lapses in your customer care service in time to come because from your actions we could tell how it is going to be. For you to ignore your business here for this time interval without checking then it means you do not value our time making comments, reviews and contributions which is of more value to your organization. Let me remind you here that constant activeness here tells us how serious you are with your business here. If you take the platform serious, the platform would take your business serious but if you ignore then it will be a vice versa thing. I will advise you to be constantly checking on your thread as I see this thread to be your official announcement thread OP.Lastly, as mentioned in other replies, there are some managers mentioned that you could contact for yourÂ  campaign management. They are of good reputation here and have years of experience working here for successful casino projects. You can contact any of them for your casino promotion as you will have big names already existing here to contend with.",

Can't seem to feel the difference of a gambling site that runs in Arbitrum versus the common one but I only get a slow loading when I open the website. It's either many people are visiting them at the same time or Arbitrum is still very new and still have some bugs but Arbitrum is so trendy lately and maybe that is another cause of the slowdown.Decentralized casinos are not new but many of them have only come and go. There are some left but they are not popular as their centralized counterpart. I noticed the same thing when it comes to exchanges, and other services. Hhmm but why? Maybe because they are more buggy, less secure and prone to hacks?",

We'll definitely keep that in mind!Now, to address your concerns about security on our decentralized casino platform. We've gone above and beyond to establish a safe haven for our users and their assets:Our primary focus is ensuring the utmost security for our players, and to achieve this, we've removed the option for users to whitelist our casino within web3 compatible wallets such as Metamask, Wallet Connect, and Coinbase Wallet Extension. This approach does slow down the betting process a bit, but it guarantees that each bet is individually authorized by the player, providing unparalleled safety. We will be putting out updates to improve the user experience only after thorough penetration testing and bug hunting has been performed.We've chosen to use straightforward, reliable smart contracts to maintain transparency and dependability on our platform. This approach instills a sense of trust and assurance in our users that their transactions are in safe hands.In our quest to champion user privacy, we've eliminated the need for sign-up or registration. All it takes is connecting an anonymous wallet address, and you're ready to roll the dice, knowing your privacy is protected.Our decentralized casino is currently powered by the Ethereum blockchain as well as BSC, and Polygon networks. We're also actively researching both layer 1 and layer 2 solutions to further enhance the user experience without compromising on security.Though it's impossible to eliminate all risks when dealing with cutting-edge technology, we're dedicated to mitigating any potential threats on our platform. If we detect unusual or suspicious activity, we have the ability to temporarily halt access to our platform while we conduct a thorough investigation and resolve the issue.Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions on how we can improve our site.",

Iâm not expert too but if the casino is completely decentralized and doesnât have fiat. I think they are not obligated to get a license since not all country has crypto regulations.
