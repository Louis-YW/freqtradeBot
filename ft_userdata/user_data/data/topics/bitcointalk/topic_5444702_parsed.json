I think you don't need to install it you just need to download and configure the bat file and then run it.If you are planning to mine with CPU it won't work.Kano has a guide on how to run this if you have USB miner or erupter then follow this guide below- https://kano.is/gekko.php",

      "body": "One possible 'gotcha' is that Windows requires using the Zadig USB driver.It also needs to be mentioned that -ck's version of cgminer is rather old as -ck stopped supporting it long ago. Unless you have a specific reason for using that old version (eg cpu/gpu mining) it is highly suggested that you use Kano's much updated version which is currently at r4.12.1Â which can be found here",
