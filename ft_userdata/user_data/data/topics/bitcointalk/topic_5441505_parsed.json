You’d have to go to Putin or Biden for that but I don’t think either of them would start a nuclear war over a crypto scammer. The world went crazy without a doubt, I agree with that but still, we are not that crazy, yet.I am sorry. Nobody’s nuking anybody here.",

There are actually a whole lot of things I need to know that I've been missing out and nuking is definitely one of them.It seems I get to learn something new almost every day of my stay on the forum and it's becoming more of fun over here as there are always something new to learn.@Op why are you asking moderator nuke the newbie userI really need to know because it seems I've got a whole lot of works to do over here and I need to get to work to getting the community clean.",

If you've found him plagiarizing, for example, and you can prove that, he's as good as gone.But just by asking nicely, you won't obtain anything. Even more, if it's a case of scam, that's not moderated, so your actual choice is to make (in Scam Accusations, see the reporting format there) a new topic proving his scam, to make people tag him. It won't nuke him, but the trust feedback will be visible and people will start avoiding him.Quote from: UchihaSarada on February 28, 2023, 08:09:01 AMDuplicate topics in two boards.That's not enough. Duplicated posts are reported and removed. But nothing more.",

Any hacking or malware tool detected posts were eventually be deleted and hammered, nuking an account is not that simply because they create a 1 or 2 post containing some \"scam tool\" unless it contains malware.",
