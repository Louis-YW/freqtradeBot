      "body": "So, only part of the stolen amount was recovered, which means they spent millions before getting caught. But here’s the question: why would the government keep the recovered Bitcoin? Shouldn’t it be returned to Bitfinex?Bitfinex is still one of the largest crypto exchanges, not top 10 anymore, but it still handles a significant volume. This exchange has been hacked twice, and the last one was the biggest. The 94,000 Bitcoin recovered in 2022 was valued at $3.6 billion back then, and at today’s price, it’s over $8 billion, massive! Out of the 120,000 stolen, that leaves 26,000 Bitcoin unaccounted for. Let’s say they spent 20,000 and stashed the remaining 6,000 in an untraceable wallet...that’s still over $500 million.Honestly, serving 5 years in prison might not seem so bad for them, knowing they’ve got half a billion waiting.",

He has helped the government in some of criminal cases since he was caught. The prosecutors hope to help him get to a rehabilitation and instead use his skills for the better. There are many geniuses out there but unfortunately, they decide to use it for things like this. I do not know what the government is thinking though. I would be uneasy to let a convicted criminal run my criminal cases just because he is good. For all we know, he can just fool the authorities and suddenly escape. But then again, if he were smart enough, he will see that 5 years serving time is a lot better than a life where you need to keep hiding and running away. Risky move from the government but if it meant that they now have a very skilled individual helping them then I guess it pays off.",

The sentence seems to be light, in your opinion, but I think it's logic because the sentence can not be made as it is a hack of $4.5B with prices of Bitcoin in 2024. If the judge does it, it is terrible because you can not say spending 1 bitcoin in 2017 with price is about $1,000 (early of 2017) is the same as spending 1 bitcoin in late of 2024 with price of 1 bitcoin is above $90,000.Hacked Exchanges since 2011.Report on Cryptocurrency exchange hacks.",

Such people will end up working for the government assisting them in tracking down criminals. My concern is the people who lost money during the hacks.

That’s an insane amount of money... A significant portion of the stolen Bitcoin was seized by the U.S. government, marking the largest financial seizure in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice.And what do you propose? With the increase in the cost of bitcoin, increase the prison term for all criminals punished under articles related to cryptocurrencies? So, how much bitcoin was left in this hacker's storage (not seized by the government)?Quote from: stadus on November 15, 2024, 03:49:09 AMIt’s crazy how much Bitcoin they managed to hack, but we know when the government gets involved, it’s tough to escape. Still, the sentence of just 5 years in prison seems pretty light. If that’s the case, some might see it as worth the risk, imagine hacking $100 million and spending only 5 years in jail. That’s like earning $20 million a year behind bars!  Your math is wrong. In 5 years, these $100 million will be several times more expensive. So, the profit for each conditional year will be higher. Also, the advantage of this wonderful scheme is that you are guaranteed a 100% HODL, because you will be deprived of the opportunity (as well as the temptation) to sell your bitcoins and, even more so, spend it on various junk, like a Lambo and an island in the Caribbean. In theory, in a fair and lawful society, all stolen bitcoins should be confiscated. And most importantly, the confiscated bitcoins (like any money) in such cases should be returned to the victims, and not remain at the disposal of the government, which in such circumstances acts no better than the same hackers. The former steal, and the latter take it by force. Aren't they bandits?",

Not all of the stolen coins were recovered, but a significant portion was. I agree that a 5-year sentence seems light, but according to reports, his cooperation played a big role in reducing his sentence... It’s likely that without his help the authorities won't be able to recover 96% of the amount stolen. https://apnews.com/article/ilya-lichtenstein-bitcoin-hack-bitfinex-razzlekhan-bb592f0f06cdd8c2854a1a2259660c70Significant amount is still huge and like he said, that would be the reason why the sentence have only run for five years. But even if it was only like that (five years), I think that is still long, especially if you are inside and you are only facing four walls.There are criminals like that who cooperate because they also think that this can lessen their sentence and maybe they are being told so, but there are who are seem tough. I guess they are not scared at all to get hurt to death or even spend their whole life inside the cell. 120k of BTC seems a lot of money even before and that would be the reason on why the suspect can't spend all or most of it.",
