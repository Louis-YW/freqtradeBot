  "content": "NFL Week 10Week 10 of the NFL season starts and there’s only one team running away with their division and that’s the Minnesota Vikings at 7-1. In 2nd in the NFC North there’s a tie between the Packers and Bears at 3-6. All other divisions are up for grabs and today I’ll post my top 3 games for the week ATS.Dallas @ Green Bay – The Dallas Cowboys are 6-2 SU and 6-2 ATS The Packers are 3-6 SU and 3-6 ATS losing their last 5 games This is an awful matchup for the injured Packers While the Packers have the 2nd lowest scoring team in the NFC, the Cowboys defense allows the second least amount of points in the NFC Rodgers seems disinterested and I don’t see the Packers keeping this one close.Dallas -4Minnesota @ Buffalo – The Vikings are 7-1 SU and 3-4-1 ATS The Bills are 6-2 SU and 4-3-1 ATS Earlier I said that the Vikings were the best team in the NFC North but the Bills are the best team in the NFL Josh Allen’s injury isn’t as serious as what was once thought and is now being called a sprained right elbow Allen most likely will sit the game while 34 year old Case Keenum gets the start Keenum has started 64 games in the NFL and is one of the better backups in the league While Minnesota has a potent offense, Buffalo has the best defense in the league. No team has scored more than 21 points vs the Bill I like the Bills -3.5 with Keenum and I’m playing that now If Allen gets the start, the line will jump to at least 7.Buffalo -3.5Arizona @ LA Rams – The Rams are 3-5 SU and 2-5-1 ATS The Cardinals are 3-6 SU and 4-5 ATS Both teams are underachieving this year The Cardinals offense has been pretty good this year but their defense has been just awful Fortunately they are playing the Rams who have only scored 16.4 points per game and Stafford is in concussion protocol Not only is it likely that Stafford will miss the game but many other starters will be missing for the Rams John Wolford steps in at QB WIlford has only started one game in the NFL and that was back in 2020 The Rams will have troubles on offense and I see the Cardinals winning.Arizona +1.5https://cryptogamingrevu.com/nfl/",
