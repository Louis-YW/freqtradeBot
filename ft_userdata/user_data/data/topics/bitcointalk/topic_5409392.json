When u doing the 2022 goldies?The oversized 39mm coins are a free gift with the purchase of a Special Edition (Red) Roll. Only 12 were minted in total, so they're pretty rare. We did the same thing last year too. Seems to be a big (no pun intended) hit with the BP collectors. And the golds are coming in a few short months along with a few other suprises. Stay tuned!Regards,Chris@TBPCo.",

It's been almost a month since my order was placed. Is anyone else having the same issue? I'm in the US, btw. Thanks. Thanks for posting this reply, Abiky. I'm just a little one-man shop that has accidentally grown too large over the last couple years for my limited skill set and time availability. I still do most of everything all by myself, so I often fall behind on some things — website updates, product photography, bookkeeping, emails, and (unfortunately) shipping. (Sadly, I don't make enough money to hire another employee, but I'm working on that now.) I appreciate that you've made your concern public. That gives me the swift kick in the butt that I sometimes need to get my priorities back on the right track. After all, customer service is EVERYTHING, and I've undoubtedly slipped a bit lately. I apologize for that.However, I have good news, my friend. All paid orders, including yours, were shipped out yesterday. I'll send the individual tracking numbers shortly via PM.In the meantime, please rest assured that your goodies are on the way. Thanks again for the much-needed recalibration, Abiky!Regards,Chris",

Never thought this was a one-man operation, so my apologies for being a little intrusive with many PMs. I'm glad to know you'll be looking for someone else to speed things up a bit. That said, I'd like to thank you for taking your time and attention in helping me solve my issue. I've got your PM with the tracking number. This definitely won't be my last purchase with the TBPCo.

This is all on ME, my friend, not you. It's that simple. You're the perfect customer! And I appreciate you too. Regards,Chris",
