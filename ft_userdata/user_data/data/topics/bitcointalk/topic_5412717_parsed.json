      "body": "Potential is high. This project was created before the pandemic and that may have a lot to do about the value going down in the next few years on lockdown. Before, I even had the idea to buy a node but it's too expensive (at that time). It was $0.5 when I sold some of my funds and honestly, I am part of those who dumped it. After that, I bought it back at a cheaper price because I know about their potential, and I can't just let it go. It's a biased review since I am also an investor. Let's wait what others would say.",

      "body": "The potential was so big. I heard that gala has been planned to develop various products. This will be a very good thing for gala holders. As far as i know some products like gala music and many more have been prepared by the developers. The bearish trend that happened with bitcoin has been ruining everything like the price of gala as well. This coin can increase easily once the bullish market will be coming. It's not only with gale but all of coins in the market will be also performing the same thing like gala. The potential is still very big at this moment. Investing some money on this thing may worth something in the future",

Fast growth and fast dump.You need to understand that there is very strong competition in the gaming industry and there may not be a repetition of a price increase of 100 times.Sometimes it's easier not to think, but to invest a few hundred dollars in such projects and forget about them until the next bull market. There will probably be a profit.",

It has plan to shift from Ethereum block chain to its own Gala chain due to high fee rate among the other reasons.It has also well-designed tokenomics, active community and a solid team behind it.But Gala is like all other cryptocurrencies, not free from risk.",

It's true that there's a lot of room for its growth and if we're going to look at its market cap and supply, it's very likely that it can reach a billion market cap soon. And that will reflect in its price as soon as it reaches there. If it's one of your biggest holds, I guess that you also have that big stash for bitcoin as you hold and as much as you have gala.",

I don't hold any Gala and at this point I can't buy any. but if I get a chance to buy some GALA while it is still cheap. I would definately do that. because the project itself is very promising and the team working tirelessly.  pluse they are capturing Gaming Industry which is a huge industry and future of gaming specially Crypto Gaming is very bright. don't take my post as a financial advice, but GALA sure worth a look.",

Actually, there are lots of projects that has a potential but here in crypto, nothing can withstand the wrath of Bitcoin once it on bearish status.Just follow GALA as much as you can and see how they were able to keep their momentum amid any market trend. Take note of their developments, current or future, if were properly done. Engage also on their community to see how they good they are communicating at their believers and see the opinions of other users there as well.Make your own analysis about that \"potential\". We have different preferences and approach that's why our output won't be the same as yours.",

The Gala project is based on the field of games and NFTs. What makes Gala coin unique is that it gives priority to players to play with the adoption of modern blockchain technology, so its project aims to develop a group of A large number of games related to the Blockchain, and this will constitute a great addition to the games industry and to crypto, And I see that it is really a good coin for investment in the long term, and I believe that it will achieve a new ATH in the coming years with the increase in its holders.",

Considering the fact that most of the supply is present in the market, the project has already attracted a large amount of finance and it is already listed on all major exchanges, you should not expect anything supernatural from it. As potential altcoin gems, it is worth to pay attention to projects which are not yet widespread on major exchanges, have a small supply and small capitalization, up to 15 million. Gala is definitely not one of those projects, investments in which will bring you tens of X's of profit.",

That should be the word that you should have used instead of only but £300m is still a lot and gala does have room to grow maybe some improvements or expand. After all, gala has attracted many people with their gaming platform where people get incentive by playing games and at the same time earning. About games, they do have different games to choose either for mobile or PC.",
