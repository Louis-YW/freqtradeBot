One thing is certain: those in debt would likely benefit, especially in times of economic hardship.That is something new to me, I was not aware of it, I mean, that's a trap from banks, why would they do it, and why did the people of Argentina bore it, why did they not protest, why it still implemented after protests? This really sucks. I mean, they even set the withdrawal limit to $250 per week. Useless policies for the customers but not for the banks. Where did the profit go? Which they made out of this. I believe this is the 2nd best example I have found to teach someone or give an example of why BTC is better than Banks, in terms of holding. Like, those if they were had holdings in BTC, would be saved now, but they trusted banks and banks fucked them. (sorry for the lingu). We don't have the facility to store dollars in Banks, even if we have, (of which I am not aware of), I don't think if anyone would care to save their dollars in the local or national banks. People prefer to hold them in person, and recently in an operation more than 900 million dollars were caught, which was not in the books of our governments, which means they were smuggled into the country without paying tax.",

I haven't heard of this before, but I don't have debt, so I don't think I'd benefit from such a measure. What I find lacking from the article is the information about broad effects of the measure. Did that help stabilize the national currency, did that contribute to improvement of any economical features? Is it, in hindsight, considered a mistake or an effective move? Who lost the most from this practice, and what was it meant to achieve in the first place?",

They only made a \"profit\" in the long term, because this drastic measure did not help the peso.What do I think about this? This is nothing new. When the mark collapsed in the Weimar Republic (Germany after WW1), citizens were forced to use the local currency to such an extent that the police went to pubs and looked into people's wallets to check whether they only had marks. Foreign currencies were confiscated. And both in the Weimar Republic and in Argentina, such efforts did not achieve anything, because it is impossible to force people to use and take seriously a currency that loses most of its value within one year.",

One thing is certain: those in debt would likely benefit, especially in times of economic hardship.Perhaps one of the most idiotic ideas to \"save the economy\" is to take away people's PERSONAL savings in the currency that stabilized the economy....Instead of a thousand words, history and facts: In the early 1990s, the government pegged the national currency to the U.S. dollar, which kept inflation in check. Many state-owned enterprises were transferred to private ownership, and privatization proceeds were partially used to pay off the national debt. And then began experiments, which, although they gave temporary relief, because a huge amount of private funds was withdrawn, and they were able to temporarily \"plug the hole in the budget\", but it did not solve the essence of the problem, and now we see what we see.... Private property - be it savings, cars, real estate, or other - is INCREDIBLE! This is what the entire Western, developed world is built on. Yes, there are exceptions - illegally or criminally earned assets, but this is a separate topic",

It would be a major topic of conversation, and many of us would be pretty worried about what the future holds financially. I also doubt that the capitalists in our country will allow this to happen haha capitalists and big investors wouldn't be happy at all if something like this happened. They would probably do everything they could to stop it like talking to politicians using their influence and maybe even moving their money elsewhere if things got really bad.",

Being in debt during hard times is still super stressful. Job uncertainty and financial instability make it tough, even with these potential benefits.

The government basically tries to steal the stable currency from the people and gives them shitty national currency in return. This is done only for the sake stabilizing the national currency, which totally failed and the people's savings in Argentinian pesos were destroyed by inflation. This is government theft and it will ruin the economy of any country. I don't know what's wrong with the politicians in Argentina. Most of them don't understand basic stuff about economics and finance and most of them support stupid experiments with the economy.",

Even in the Argentina, the Corralón era was actually a difficult time for many people in Argentina. The forced conversion of dollar deposits and debts into local currency at an unfavorable rate left many people feeling like they had lost their savings. The bank run and economic turmoil caused a lot of stress and hardship. The Corralón had some negative consequences for Argentina including a rise in inflation and economic instability. It's hard to say for sure what the consequences would be if my government implemented a similar policy but there's no doubt that it could potentially lead to similar economic problems. I think it's better to consider all of the potential impacts before implementing any major policy changes like that of Argentina.",

One thing is certain: those in debt would likely benefit, especially in times of economic hardship.Limited sources mean that I can't fully understand Corralón. But in simple terms, if we look at Argentina's economic growth, has it experienced a good cycle and been able to overcome economic problems in the long term? If not, it means that there are still many things that are not suitable to be implemented, because if one method is not correlated with the financial condition of the country, especially the economic markets of developing countries, in which case the sources of income are diverse, it will make implementation difficult.Because this is being implemented in Argentina, it means we will make a concrete example of the country's economic conditions 20 years ago. And based on my search, the results were quite surprising, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, when high inflation was hit by global economic turmoil, Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

Politicians are very fickle characters who often only have fairly short careers in the highest positions of government. They might rightly try to enact policies that seek to arrest the decline of a countries economy, but they often take the wrong choices because they can be guided by popular opinion which seeks an easy route out as opposed to a harder route which uses fact based evidence. The idea seems to have been to seize US dollars and force the local currency to be used as well, maybe entwined with a claim that US dollars have lost value - but the Argentine peso has done a lot worse in comparison, so it's misguided from that perception.",

The rich and upper-class people do not store their funds in local banks because they know local banks are only for making trades if they are making any deals, buying groceries, or when they need local currency.Other than this, they try to hold their assets in deflationary things, which could provide a hedge against inflation. BTC is the first thing that came to mind in terms of a hedge against inflation, but those who don't prefer it go after gold or US dollars. So they don't have to be afraid of such acts.To my knowledge, not a single act has been reported in my country till now. But let's just hope things don't go dirty like they did in Argentina.
