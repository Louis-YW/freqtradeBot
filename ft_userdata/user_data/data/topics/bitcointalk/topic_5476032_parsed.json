I will just assume this is a prior notice to your launch time mate and I will also advise you lock this thread till you fully launch your casino because there is nothing to talk about it as at when I accessed your website last.",

Maybe its best to lock this thread and comeback to open a new one in January once they take all in right place and their casino is fully launched.",

However, we want to see that everything is setup, so that gamblers can register if they are interested specially that you have a catchy name. But as someone pointed out, there is nothing to see and nothing to discuss as it is empty. Take this criticism as constructive, make a good first impression here, get someone to design your Announcement thread, and get a copper membership if you want to display image. And after that, maybe we can talk about your new platform in January. So best of luck, and welcome to the community and hopefully you will be active here or even have a good signature campaign to promote your gaming platform.",
