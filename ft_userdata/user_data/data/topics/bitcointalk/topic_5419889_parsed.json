It is currently a BNB token but not even on pancakeswap yet. They will release the litho blockchain next year.Mark my words - litho will hit $1 / 1 billion dollar marketcapIf any high risk coin under 1 mil MC is worth a bet, this is it.They have proposed cutting the supply of 1 bil litho in half.Origins from the Bahamas-Miami-Florida area along with official locations at Seattle, Washington USAThe risk vs reward is high, being that it isn't some project already at 10-100+ mil market cap.Just a 1 bil mc = over 1000x your money.Worth throwing $100-$1000 at it for sure.GL<3",
