  "content": "The idea of hosting a full node, or maybe even more then one has been in my head for a few months, I like the idea of running a Bitcoin node or two, and possibly an Electrum node along side those. Laying out the plan I devised would most likely be the best way to get feedback, so here it is.Each node will be hosted on a laptop connected to one or more external hard-drives, they'll all sit on a rack made to hold miners. They all will have ethernet connection, and will all run simultaneously. That's where the anonymity issue comes into play, I want to run a node but I also don't want my ISP knowing and shutting off my service. I opted to use the WireGuard servers on Mullvad VPN. I'm aware I have to put my trust into them, but this seemed to be the cheapest plan to get past my ISP and privacy issues, other VPN providers are known to share data with Federals, and anyone who subpoenas them.Did I miss anything in this plan? If so please let me know  Edit: They will all constantly be plugged in to a surge protector.",

      "body": "You could also use tor instead of a VPN. Not knowing where you are it's tough to say which would be better. For the most part the issue with a VPN is you can't connect back to your node from the outside world, since most (all?) VPN providers don't allow you to run services on them.With tor you can always connect to your node / Electrum using your onion address.However, tor may require a bit more to configure then just clicking an exe file.-Dave",

Not even ProtonVPN (my VPN client whose company I dumped over 500 euros into, and which has recommendations from a lot of other people much smarter than me) can guarantee total security, or privacy for that matter, because they are centralized and have a single point of failure.If I use a VPN it's only for censorship circumvention. Tor, and alternative distributed networks such as I2P and Freenet, are the only truly anonymizing services.",

I believe NeuroticFish was referring to the upload usage that would be coming from my network, this would indeed be different from other users on that ISP, but I don't believe it would be enough to cause much attention to be brought onto me.",

Add in the number of people who are streaming things out of their homes to the internet these days it adds even more people to the heave bandwidth users. A few years ago that amount of bandwidth would have been noticed, today not so much.Now, the flip side of that is that the above statement depend on where you are. If you are in an area where the providers are a bit more limited, then they might care and notice. But them they tend to target the to 1% or 2% of users does not matter what you are doing it's just looking at a chart and saying these people use the most.-Dave",
