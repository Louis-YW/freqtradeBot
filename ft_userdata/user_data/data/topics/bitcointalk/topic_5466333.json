  "content": "Bitcoin's price seems to be caught in a limbo between bull and bear market. Even if we're still 60% above the November 2022 heights, there is again some fear lurking around. I think thus, it's time to remember why Bitcoin could be a much bigger success than it currently is.Some will know the blog article The Bullish Case for Bitcoin by Vijay Boyapati, which has been transformed into a general introductory book about Bitcoin.I agree with many of the ideas displayed in the article, but I get the impression that the linear \"adoption timeline\" the author pleads for, needs an update.Basically the author argues that Bitcoin adoption will have four stages:1. Collectible: A thing some people like to collect, even if its value is still undetermined.2. Store of value: An asset used to store an abstract \"value\", for example to invest money in it and get the same or more value/money in the future.3. Medium of exchange: A currency used to purchase goods and services.4. Unit of account: A currency which can be used as a base to calculate prices.We've successfully moved away somewhat from Phase 1. But I've got the impression that Bitcoin is currently caught in an intermediate \"limbo\" with characteristics of the first three stages, but without progress to evolve into the fourth (unit of account) stage. Even more: it seems that people's hopes currently are linked to the store of value concept, and usage as a medium of exchange was already more popular a few years ago. And as a store of value, it's only useful considering very long timespans (>2-3 years) due to harsh volatility.My theory is that the order for Bitcoin's \"bullish case\" has to be updated. For me the stages are:1. Collectible2. Medium of exchange3. Store of value4. Unit of accountWhy? There are basically two reasons.1) The first one is liquidity and demand. Bitcoin's liquidity is better than 10 years ago, but hasn't made significant progress in the last 2-3 years. This makes its market still vulnerable to panic, FOMO, manipulation and other plagues which lead to its erratic price behavior.If Bitcoin was used more as a medium of exchange, it would have significantly higher liquidity. Because each time you buy and sell something for Bitcoin it's a market operation where you're establishing its value. Even more important: Each time somebody agrees to sell something for Bitcoin, this can be considered a buy offer in the order book.Thus, with more usage as medium of exchange and \"boosted\" liquidity, Bitcoin's volatility would probably lower, and it would become a safer store of value. Imagine you wouldn't have to fear an 70-85% depreciation in a bear market cycle but only 30% in the worst case. Would you invest more in it than now?People also seem to misunderstand the concept of \"scarcity\". Scarcity is not equal to \"limited supply\". Scarcity exists when there is more demand than supply. A limited supply helps, but it does not mean something is really scarce. Many altcoins have a more limited supply than Bitcoin but have dramatically failed. Demand is crucial. If demand is erratic and only depends on FOMO cycles, then no reliable store of value can be achieved.While if there is an explosion of merchants and everyday people accepting Bitcoin, then this means that there's also an explosion of demand. Again: Each of these offers is an offer in an imaginary orderbook where Bitcoin is traded against \"real value\".Of course if volatility lowers then the bull runs will become less steep too. But that isn't a problem because Bitcoin has anyway the potential for values largely above $100,000. And that leads us to the second issue:2) Many people forgot why Bitcoin is such a big innovation. It is the first digital value exchange medium which lacks central intermediaries completely and thus has its known advantages like censorship resistance. All previous attempts needed some kind of \"bank\" controlling the system.This is Bitcoin's USP. Bitcoin can be used by anyone, anywhere (where there is Internet access) and anytime, without the need that someone \"allows\" you to do so. And this characteristic is most useful for a currency, not so much for a store of value. The internet (and this forum) is full of complaints about banks having closed accounts of people and made your life a pain. Bitcoin fixes this (And no, Ethereum and other centralized coins do not really fix it, as their censorship resistances is much lower).In my opinion, Bitcoin's big advantages all really shine when it's used as a currency. And thus long term success in the future depends if it's used as a medium of exchange or not.Once a path to currency usage becomes clear, Bitcoin will thus become a reliable store of value. Not before - before it will be subject to the same wild swings we've seen in the past years.I would even say: There'll be no $200,000+ (\"digital gold\") Bitcoin without usage as a currency.(And if you are worried about scalability: There's LN, there's even progress with sidechains, like projects like Stacks or Nomic and rollups show. It's nothing unsolvable.)",

However, not all people have that much time. But much more important: There is no guarantee that this long term bull market will continue. S2F and similar theories assume an \"automatic growth\", but I have severe doubts if demand can be sustained that high ... without the \"usage as a currency\".Quote from: hatshepsut93 on September 10, 2023, 07:33:49 PMPeople who encounter problem write a negative review or share their story on social media, while those who don't have any problems have no reason to voice their opinion. I've been using online banking and credit cards for years and haven't encountered any restrictions not even once. All the people that I know in real life also never encountered anything like that.That is highly dependant on where you live. In my country for example it's mandatory for people to show an address proof to get a bank account. For example, many students which do not live in an own appartment (most do not) often fail to meet this requirement and stay unbanked or depend on their parents opening an account for them. (Situation has however improved a bit with online wallet providers which do not require address proof, but may be unreliable). I have also heard personally from people getting their account closed, although it isn't very frequent.And: Even if the risk to get your account closed is small, it is not non-existant and if it happens it can be an extremely big hassle for your personal finances, and in the case of Bitcoin it \"is 100% solved\". The censorship problem, above all if you're any kind of \"dissident\", is even bigger.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on September 10, 2023, 07:33:49 PMIf most people don't run into problems with banks, they have no reasons to look at Bitcoin, especially if you consider just how many trade-offs Bitcoin has.It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Bitcoin will have less tradeoffs if its use is already more established, i.e. if solutions like Lightning are reliable and widely accepted by merchants. As a solution to the problem, what I'm advocating for is that current Bitcoin users should try to use Bitcoin more to pay for goods and services if possible. For example, if one wants to take profits in a bull market or cut losses in a bear market, this can be done buying some goods instead of selling the coins at an exchange.",

Last bull season it literally took us 10 months before bitcoin was even able to recover and that was even past the halving period mind you. So for bitcoin to be in this state of limbo at a very healthy price point, I don't think there's a massive cause for concern here. Sure it could be better, we could be getting 40k now considering we're almost at the end of the year and the halving is just around the corner, but bitcoin doesn't have a general timeline that it follows to a T. So I say we keep at it with the information campaigns and all that awesome stuff to clear out all the confusions and negative connotations that bitcoin received in the past, but not so much as to do it because we're worried that bitcoin is going to fall in value real soon.",

Maybe in the future someone will release a more idiot-proof wallet software for mass use, but for some reason no one made such wallet in all these years.Volatility also won't be gone completely with mainstream adoption. The biggest factor of Bitcoin volatility is that there's no mathematical formula for estimating Bitcon's \"objective\" value, so it's all just based on pure guess of traders.",

Your thoughtful insight about factors those can potentially influence the future of Bitcoin's price is indeed valuable. In particular, when assessing the Bitcoin price trajectory within the historical context of halving event and its consequent impact on Bitcoin market. It is important to acknowledge the prevailing economic conditions worldwide. Factors such as, high inflation and interest rates, declining GDP across major economies, tensions among USA, Russia and China, are creating unfavorable environment for investment in risky assets. Therefor despite the historical role of halving event to act as catalyst for price surge, it is possible that substantial increase in Bitcoin price in 2024 may not materialize, what most of Bitcoin enthusiasts are expecting.",

Spreading your time worrying about which market Bitcoin is either bull or bear can be extremely frustrating.  I am agree with your status that lots of people are unaware of bear and bull market because when the price reduces 5 percent then they consider that time as a bear market but they don't remember the time when bitcoin price was 12k$ or 15k$.It will be good if investors don't think about bull and bear market because they cannot understand it. Without considering ups and downs just focus on your profit that if investors can manage investment at a specific price then they should do and wait until it increases in value.",

In other words, I am bullish on Bitcoin in the long term, but not for the reasons mentioned above, and I don't see this transition between currency and store of value, in whatever order, to end up as a unit of account. Today it has a certain use as a currency but I think it will lose meaning over time.I think it will remain a store of value like gold, but as a digital asset.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on September 10, 2023, 07:33:49 PMThis is just survivorship bias. People who encounter problem write a negative review or share their story on social media, while those who don't have any problems have no reason to voice their opinion. I've been using online banking and credit cards for years and haven't encountered any restrictions not even once. All the people that I know in real life also never encountered anything like that. If bank account freezes were a major problem, I would have likely encountered it by now. If most people don't run into problems with banks, they have no reasons to look at Bitcoin, especially if you consider just how many trade-offs Bitcoin has.It's just like that. I've never had any problem either.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on September 11, 2023, 01:26:32 AMThe difficulties of being your own bank - key management and irreversibility of transactions are not correlated with the levels of adoption. Maybe in the future someone will release a more idiot-proof wallet software for mass use, but for some reason no one made such wallet in all these years.Volatility also won't be gone completely with mainstream adoption. The biggest factor of Bitcoin volatility is that there's no mathematical formula for estimating Bitcon's \"objective\" value, so it's all just based on pure guess of traders. I totally agree with your view which I understand to be more pragmatic, and in my opinion realistic.",
