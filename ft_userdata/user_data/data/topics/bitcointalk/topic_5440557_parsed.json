  "content": "There is one article I came across which states how Blockchain.com is playing with their money and buying unwanted assets within the company and on the other hand they are also selling off their company's assets slowly but not doing it officially!The plot is, company's official members are selling some sections of the blockchain.com to other cryptocurrency based companies. The company also lost around $270 million dollars in the stake selling by PolySign who was working on the infra sector of the blockchain. In the response of this Blockchain removed around 150 employees from the firm.Surprisingly this headcount was reduced to overcome the burden of loan repayments!! They had to remove more employees later and in total 28% of the company's workforce was gone. This was something evil that happened due to company's misconduct procedures of managing asset. Is blockchain.com is in wrong management right now? Do they need a leader who can take it to the next level? QuoteBetween the months of December and January, officials of the company are said to have explored the possibility of selling sections of its business to other cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, according to publications that cite anonymous persons as their sources. In response to the reports, Blockchain.com issued the following statement: \"No Blockchain.com firms are for sale.\" Blockchain.com is not a vendor of assets but rather a buyer of them.However, from October 2022, the firm has been making efforts to raise more funding for its operations. This is being done even at a large discount to earlier values of the company's stock. According to a report by Bloomberg, at the time of the round, it was anticipated that the company would be valued at between $3 billion and $4 billion. The prospective round would assist Blockchain.com in navigating the weak market for cryptocurrencies more effectively.The attempts to acquire funds are not denied by Blockchain.com, but the company rejects the assertions that assets are being sold. PolySign is a business that is working on infrastructure for financial institutions. Just recently, the firm's venture arm sold its 80% stake in the company.Just a few short months after the company reduced its headcount by 150 in July 2022 in response to a loss of $270 million on loans made to the defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, Blockchain.com terminated the employment of approximately 110 of its workers in January, representing 28% of the company's total workforce (3AC).Blockchain.com claims that it has more than 37 million verified customers who use 86 million wallets and that it has a presence in 200 countries. Following the acquisition of fresh financing in March 2022, which was headed by the global venture capital firm Lightspeed Ventures and the investment management firm Baillie Gifford & Co, the company's value increased to $14 billion, up from $5.2 billion before.Previous investment included a $300 million Series C round that took place in March 2021 and was headed by DST Global Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and VY Capital, as well as $120 million from a broad variety of venture capital organizations.Blockchain.com is refute rumors that they are selling assets",

It means that their liquidity is much smaller than that.As soon as any company requires firing their staff to keep them above water is a warning sign imo. I know they have a wallet but hopefully a lot of members have realized the risk and have got their money out of the web wallet which might be a reason why they are feeling the economical crisis more. I know that they have a block explorer and was 1 of the original but I have moved on from using their explorer because it has not changed and requires many clicks before you can get into their explorer and I think other people have moved on because of its interface too. I am not surprised they are struggling and I would urge any one that has money stored on blockchain.com wallet to move them out asap.",

The reduction of staff during this bear season is no longer a strange thing for companies in the industry, only Binance is the only company that has not laid off employees and is promoting recruitment to expand the market.",

Will that be from the users’ money or from the platform’s capital treasury?",

Companies don't just hold money. They don't just keep them sleeping and unproductive and being slowly killed by inflation. Perhaps the question is whether the company is playing with customers' money and not their own. That would be questionable. That would be risky to the point that they might face insolvency.

As I see it, crypto companies have a habit, when the bull season comes, they hire a lot, but when the down season comes, they lay off a lot, this shows the recruitment in the crypto industry is not too difficult.It still exists to this day, proving that a lot of people still use it. And as far as I know, blockchain.com and coinabse are one of the oldest centralized web wallets and exchanges to date, FTX cannot compare with them. I don't store my assets on coinbase, but I still use it on some occasions and since 2014, I have had no problems with it. I don't recommend people use it, but we shouldn't attribute all centralized exchanges to be the same, just because of the crash of FTX.",
