      "body": "Thanks guys. I already found a guide. But just trying to find some more info on it. It's not exactly a press download and install and now you run your S9 and enter the testnet btc address. What I was looking for is more of a comprehensive guide on how to mine testnet btc. Most stuff I found tend to offer you a general idea on how to do it. But general idea don't show you how to set up a bitcoin testnet full node and then setup a testnet pool interface to direct your miner to. The mining with say an S9 or renting it or using testnet wallet address, I already have them. So I'm just trying to search for a better option to run a testnet full node. I do have a full node for mainnet but I can't redirect it to testnet because I need it for mainnet. So right now I'm using a server to try to run a testnet full node and then set up a pool interface to direct the miner to it.Quote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on September 30, 2023, 12:42:41 AMQuote from: decryptit on September 29, 2023, 10:20:36 PMHi all,Does anyone have a guide to mining testnet btc?

However, if you can set up a pool I think you can able to mine on testnet with an S9 miner.I couldn't find any comprehensive guide but check the open-source pool below- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=790323.0Or check the Yiimp open source pool you can follow this video guide below.- https://youtu.be/MKb9YKIAltE?si=BwT-bmMOOdmLQ3lu",

      "body": "To mitigate any potential risks or mishandling, I prefer to not mix up the wallet between testnet and mainnet. But I was able to install a Bitcoin Core and run it as testnet on another computer. Although I had to prune the data. I'm assuming, pruning the data to two months out shouldn't affect the ability to mine a block. I did find a guide that shows you how to set up a pool and mine with an S9 or S17. But I will definitely keep it in mind in the event that things don't pan out and maybe it's simpler for me to just use the builtin GPU on a computer to try to solo testnet blocks. Thanks for your help. Also, any idea on how to configure the rpc server? The UI has an option to check it in the setting. But do I need to configure it maybe via CLI?

Probably would need to open a port?By adding server=1 into bitcoin.conf it should enable the RPC to accept RPC commands.The default RPC port is 8332 you can edit it and change to other port by adding this parameter rpcport=8332 to bitcoin.conf.According to the documentation enabling the RPC port to host outside your trusted local network is not recommended because the RPC password is transmitted to the network unencrypted.The guide can be found from the link below including this note.- bitcoin.conf exampleIt was removed from Bitcoin Core because they added a new dev tool called gen-bitcoin-conf.sh so the link that I provided above is from the commits.",

      "body": "Hi. Again thanks for your response. I was able to run another bitcoin-core as a testnet full node. The data is pruned to two months out. I insert the rpc info into the bitcoin.conf. I did open a port. But currently, was trying to follow the cgminer guide per your post and basically stuck here. My computer has a builtin GPU and I'm trying to mine tBTC with it. But the cgminer is saying that the config has error. Not quite sure what I need to specifically change in the cgminer config to make it work.It basically says, \"invalid config\". \"Invalid parameters to set_kernel\"I think I may need to revisit this a later time. I'll move on with trying to mine with asic instead.On another node, bitnodes has an easy script to install a bitcoin full node with a one line command. I just haven't figured out the right config to run it on testnet. I keep getting error when changing the bitcoin.conf to testnet=1.",
