  "content": "Hey there,I was doing my research on hacks so far in 2022 and I had a thought in my mind.Why are hacks on smart contracts on smart contracts seen as illegal? Why stealing btc from someone's private key is seen as malicious?Don't get me wrong here: but your keys, your crypto. I don't think someone can't say the other way arround, right? Ownership can be proven only by having the private key to your coins.And about smart contracts, the moment someone is using a smart contract he agrees with the code of the smart contract. As a decentralysed network, if someone abuses of that code that is an issue of the code developer or of the owners of the specific contract(holders) as much. There was a specific hack this year, I won't name it, and on slack the owner received a simple question: \"You have paid for an audit, how's possible they didn't notice such a obvious breach?\" and he answered: \"Because it costed only 69k$\". Take the crema hack for example..So what are your opinions? Should hacks on decentralysed networks to be not judged? local rule: any spam signature post will be deleted",

Yes you may find other belonging, but it is up to you whether to claim it as yours--since you found it-- or return it to the true owner. In another sense, it's up to your moral standard.Quote from: saxydev on September 01, 2022, 05:49:59 PMAnd about smart contracts, the moment someone is using a smart contract he agrees with the code of the smart contract.~Should hacks on decentralysed networks to be not judged? They might agree but that doesn't mean they have the comprehension. How many of the smart contract users understand software engineering? It is actually like a regular internet user, how many people do they read the terms of service and privacy policy, it is almost non-existent. ToS and Privacy policy likely contain legal and technical language, a word that may regular Joe don't grasp fully. And here we are dealing with smart contracts.Back to the question, if the network is truly decentralized, then the participant is inherently judging.",
