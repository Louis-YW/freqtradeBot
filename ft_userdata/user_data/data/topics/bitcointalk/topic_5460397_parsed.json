I have been using this tool (https://sha256algorithm.com/) to better understand how it works at a more technical level but it takes time. This tool enables you to hash anything and walk through each and every step to fully understand what happens at each and every step. I have also been lucky enough to have one of the cryptographers at a local meetup help me to understand things but it's an uphill battle.",
