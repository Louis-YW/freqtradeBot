These have an HD key by default, so Core is blocking you from exporting the private keys made by it.Docs say you should use backupwallet with the -rpcwallet command-line switch (to select the wallet) to make a backup copy of the wallet in a location you choose, which from my point of view is ridiculous since you could just make a copy of the wallet manually.It is always possible to open up the database wallet file and perform surgery on it to get its encrypted private keys though.",

(your address' should be \"wpkh\")But there'll be at least two desc with that script type, so based from your address' \"ischange\" value of 'true' or 'false', pick the descriptor with \"internal\" of the same value.From the correct descriptor, copy it's master private key which is the long \"xprv\" key. Do not include the script type and '(' before and '/' after it.Now open your iancoleman's BIP39 tool in an offline machine and paste your xprv key in \"BIP32 Root Key\".Scroll down a bit and select the correct script type: BIP44 for legacy, BIP49 for Nested-SegWit and BIP84 for Native Segwit.The default should be already correct for receiving addresses (internal: false), else, change the internal/external path from '0' to '1'.Scroll-down to the derived addresses and it should be there along with its private key.If your address' \"address_index\" is more than 20, you should derive more addresses in BIP39 tool by using the button: \"Show ___ more rows\" below the address list for it to show.",

If you're expecting to get a substantial amount of Bitcoin, it's safer to store the majority in a safer way.Cannot stress this enough if there is a 'real' amount of funds involved. If you are talking about going out to dinner money that's one thing. But treat any funds on your phone as cash and be prepared to loose it at any time. Not to mention, if something does happen, now you have to figure out is it the desktop PC or the phone that caused the funds loss. Who had access to what and when, and so on.Better off keeping them separate.-Dave-",

I have at least had success with a paper wallet (bitaddress.org.html running locally from the GitHub repository (gh repo clone pointbiz/bitaddress.org)).Since bitaddress defaults to 'Legacy' address and your address from Bitcoin Core is 'Native SegWit',I think it's because of the wallet in your IPhone is defaulting imports into legacy addresses.For your export, based from your replies, it seems like you've created a new wallet from the mnemonic phrase that you've created.-edit-typo-",

I haven't tested sending funds with bitcoin-cli yet, but if sendtoaddress works (https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/24.0.0/rpc/wallet/sendtoaddress/) I'm golden.BlueWallet also works with the paper wallet generator earlier in this thread. I can set it up for receive only or use the private key to make it a hot wallet. It defeats the point of paper wallets, but it's nice to have options.
