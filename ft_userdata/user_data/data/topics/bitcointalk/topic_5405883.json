I suggest you create a good thread if you want to attract customers2 - your casino has a little flashy design, it is very different from any casino I have ever seen. I doubt that you will also get many customers if you don't improve your casino's design3 - in your casino in the part about TOS there is no mention about deposits and withdrawals, you should add something there to make it clear to anyone",

I have checked the sportsbookie and I find your site offer better odds especially the favorited player/club among other sportsbookie.Quote from: Raflesia on July 11, 2022, 02:15:29 PMSo if you make a withdrawal above $1000, you will be asked for an identification procedure (KYC).Is this only for fiat withdrawals or will crypto also be asked for like this?Quote8.4 If the requested amount is over one thousand US dollars (USD (USD 1.000) , the Bookmaker has the right to carry out an identification procedure.Another thing that need to be clarify is the $1K withdrawal only counted on single withdraw, so anyone can take advantages to withdraw below $1K multiple times without submitting their KYC or the $1K amount is an aggregate amount.",

What is your relationship with Olimp.com casino.2. Please explain to us about the Olimp.com casino gambling site review.Bad review.• olimp-casino-review• olimp-casino-reviewQuoteOlimp Casino ReviewWe've thoroughly reviewed Olimp Casino and gave it a bad reputation rating. It's a bad online casino and we advise you to stay away from it. In our review, we've considered the casino's player complaints, estimated revenues, license, games genuineness, customer support quality, fairness of terms and conditions, withdrawal and win limits, and other factors. Read the full review below and learn more about this casino.Warning: Olimp Casino uses fake games. These games might have been modified to have a higher house edge and therefore give the casino a bigger advantage than the developers of the original games intended. Please note that not all games available at this casino are necessarily fake, however, it's a very serious issue nevertheless. We strongly advise you to stay away from this casino.According to our research and estimates,Olimp Casino is a smaller online casino revenue-wise. The revenue of a casino is an important factor, as bigger casinos shouldn't have any issues paying out big wins, while smaller casinos could potentially struggle if you manage to win really big.Olimp Casino is operating without a valid license.We have found no relevant complaints about this casino.Warning: Olimp Casino has certain sections of Terms and Conditions that we consider to be unfair to the casino's players. Because of this, we advise you to look for a casino with fair rules or at least pay special attention to this casino's Terms and Conditions if you decide to play at it.Olimp Casino appears on only one blacklist, which hasn't influenced our rating of this casino. We've chosen to ignore it either because it's related to the casino's previous owner, or because of some other applicable reason.As you can see from all of the information in our review, Olimp Casino is a bad online casino. We don't recommend playing at it and strongly advise you to stay away from it.I've heard about Olimp.com casino, but I never signed up and played in that casino, for me Olimp.com casino is dubious, Of course I'm not accusing the Olimp.com casino of a scam, the two reviews I found did point that way, must be questioned, before the disaster occurred.So, I think the risks outweigh the gains, to gamble money at Olimp.com casino.",

      "body": "Hello everyone,Thank you for your feedbacks.I will try to reply to your questions, if any are missed just let me know.First of all, Olimp.com is an old bookmaker website with almost 15 years of operating history. Casino products we have for a couple of years. For answering questions I will try to sort them one by one.1) Website Design. We do have a classic design because our bookmaking website exist for over 10 years and our old players feel comfortable to it. 2) Deposits/Withdrawals terms can be found in our Terms & Conditions page.3) Withdrawal above $1000. KYC are asked for suspicious players. I can guarantee a withdrawals for players which are not trying to scam a bookmaker. All cases can be discussed here and I will personally take care of each of them.4) Fake slots. This is false statement. We have contracts with all casino game providers and I guarantee that no games are faked. 5) No license. This is false statement. We do have a Curacao license and information about it can be found on our website.6) Bad or small amount of reviews. Our main markets are CIS countries thats why reviews on english resources won't be a lot. But we are welcome players from other markets.7) Suspicious with 5% bonus without any additional wagering. As I was writing above we are over 10 years old bookmaker company. We have started to offer and actively promote crypto payments on our website for a few months only. That's why as a part of aggressive promotion we do offer a 5% bonus without any additional terms, in order to move our current players to use crypto instead of other payments methods. I am welcome each and everyone to join Olimp.com, give it a try with a 5% bonus and leave a reply here about your feelings and experience. Thank you for your interest once again.",
