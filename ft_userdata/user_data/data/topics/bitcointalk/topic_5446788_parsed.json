No matter what amount I am buying always the same message. Is that a message from all the sellers you deal with?Is it an automated message from the system reflected on the seller's account?Quote from: TomNick on March 29, 2023, 03:19:10 PMThen the seller wants me to cancel the trade to correct the amount which I did not do. Is this a rip off? Any experience ? Thanks for some inputIf you have made a payment, then don't click cancel because it will make it difficult for you to claim a refund. The best advice is to contact paxful support to identify the error.",

No big deal.On Paxful, when you trade, you should use video recorder to record process of the trade. Later you might need it as proof for your dispute.QuoteIs this a rip off?I don't think it is rip off if you cancel a trade. Just remember if your trade partner tries to create pressure on you to release your coin for him, don't do this. Only release your coins if you receive payments wellIf you already made payment, mark it as Paid and wait for your trade partner to complete the trade. Else, start a dispute and wait for moderator to join and handle it for you.",

Thanks for some inputDid you send the payment proof in the trading screen? And if it's same as the actual trade amount or even a round off still you done everything needed so don't cancel the trade here because once you cancelled it then you can't clsim anything, just go with the dispute if the seller is not releasing even after the payment made then the support team will investigate and release or cancel according to the given proof.",

Especially, if the concern relates to a likely scam attempt on their user and they won't allow any scam to happen on their platform. I guess that's a matter of urgency if they're able to understand the concern so fast that there are some users of theirs that are trying to use their platform getting engaged into that activity.",
