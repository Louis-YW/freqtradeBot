  "content": "https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap141.htm\"Stablecoins are a subcategory of cryptoassets that aim (or claim) to maintain a stable value relative to a specified peg. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the stablecoin market over the past decade and examines whether stablecoins have stayed true to their name in terms of being \"stable\". We study 68 stablecoins and show that not one of them has been able to maintain parity with its peg at all times. This is irrespective of their size or type of backing. Moreover, we argue that there is currently no guarantee that stablecoin issuers could redeem users' stablecoins in full and on demand. For these reasons, we conclude that the stablecoins in circulation today do not meet the key criteria for being a safe store of value and a trustworthy means of payment in the real economy. This paper also highlights some significant data gaps. Without further data on the uses and users of stablecoins, it is difficult to ascertain the risks of stablecoins to the smooth functioning of payment systems and financial stability more broadly.\"___Those who read my posts know how negatively I relate to such organizations as BIS and the IMF; even the devil sometimes speaks the truth.",

Why are you going to have a stablecoin that has a hard time maintaining parity with the dollar or euro all the time if you are going to be able to have dollar or euro CBDCs?.

Centralized stablecoins USDT and USDC and other stablecoins are not very different in principle from CBDC.At the same time, USDT and USDC and others even help the police and other intelligence agencies of different countries find criminals and track the movement of capital, because criminals refuse cash and use stablecoins.",

That's why I figure there's gonna be unofficial and independent (somewhat) stable digital money, to some extent anyway.In my country in Russia, CBDC will work through the applications of partner banks. The main advantage of CBDC will be that if the bank goes bankrupt or is closed, then I can dispose of my CBDC through the applications of another partner bank.According to my logic, CBDC should work on its own application and be less dependent on banks, but a bank employee told me that then the central bank would have to hire thousands of technical support staff and maintain this system independently.And in countries with high inflation and poor banking services, stablecoins will always be popular.",

Unfortunately, although they always lie, it has become known to everyone that currencies that call themselves “stable” are in fact similar to CBDC and perhaps worse.But despite this, they are still lying and hypocritical. Today, by chance, I was reading this thread in the Bitcoin section: ~85% of money doesn't exist If you read the topic, you will find that, according to the report, 85% of paper currencies such as the euro and the dollar do not exist on the ground, but are only numbers in banks.Isn't this the same argument they use to accuse \"stablecoins\"??!!! This is a real farce !!",

This is a real farce !!They would argue that they have gold and other underlying assets to back it up. Basically the same thing Tether or others did, so yeah it is a bit hypocritical although there is a difference between who did it. Personally, I don't trust both of them but it is impossible to stick to crypto only as of now since the adoption rate around my area is not that high.",
