      "body": "Short Description about bot : To use this script, you only need to replace \"Your_Faucet_Address\" with your actual faucet address. The script sends a GET request to the Allcoins.pw faucet URL and extracts the claim status message using the BeautifulSoup library. It then prints the claim status message and waits for the specified claim interval before attempting to claim again.You can save this script as a .py file and run it using a Python interpreter, or you can run it directly in the terminal using the command python script_name.py. Make sure you have the necessary modules installed (requests and BeautifulSoup) before running the script.",
