But you are free to do that for a long-term investor, whether it's cheap or expensive, transaction fees don't care about it, but when I have bought more bitcoins, I have to be willing to pay those expensive fees.",

Many people are trying to enter and leave the market with the volatility of Bitcoin, so these fee still have an impact to one of the reasons why people would prefer to hodl their BTC.

Surely you can't stop people from using BTC the way they like, that will amount to censoring, and BTC is censorship resistant and permissionless, the only thing that should be stopped is an \"attack\" on the network, though i don't think the issue of ordinals can be called an \"attack\" on the blockchain, maybe spam feels like the right word. Op is saying high TX fees makes him want to hold his BTC, forgetting that it also stops other people from spending their BTC, and BTC is a currency, normal TX fees allows everyone to do what they want with their BTC and we should get that back soon.",

You should wish to have a low transaction since you will purchase more if your goal is really long-term. It's useless to view this way because it only means that your real goal is not long-term since you tend to sell your holdings if the transaction the fee is cheap. My opinion is you should not look on this attack positively because it reflects negatively to the asset that you are currently invested.",

Long-term hodler might not problem with these high fees. But don't forget that there might be an emergency that wants to warrant you sell your coin. But the best option now is to seek other means of cheap Bitcoin transaction channels.Quote from: Z-tight on May 10, 2023, 12:57:26 PMI don't see TX fees this high as an advantage or a positive, BTC is a 'free' currency that should be used anyhow the owner wants it.

BTC is not only an investment option, and your post makes it feel as if it is only good for that.That's my main challenge with this transaction price issue. People should be motivated and free to use Bitcoin the way they want, it could be as a currency or investment, or both. Bitcoin daily users are not finding this high transaction fee funny. This issue is now making altcoin transactions more attractive. So many businesses that depend on Bitcoin to buy or sell products are having a very bad time.",

      "body": "I wonder how you are so comfortable with the high fee, but if you are speaking for yourself alone, how about others? In some countries, their income is very low, and their local currency has a low value even compared to the dollar, so if people in such countries have an interest in purchasing or investing in Bitcoin, they would consider how much they want to spend for fee and might just give up. Let me explain further. Imagine I want to buy $10 worth of Bitcoin but am not willing to spend $15 on a transaction fee. So possibly I will need $25 so I can purchase with $10 and use the rest for fees, which is still very unfavorable. I see the situation as what will make some people not be in a haste to invest; some will just decide to hold on with their investment, and from there they may develop interest in some other ponzi schemes. The Bitcoin transaction fee just need to normalize so that it can favor everyone, both common and uncommon investors.",

Not very positive, right?Your arguments are strange. In my opinion, the reason for long-term holding is the desire to get more profit later than now, and not the desire to save on transactions. People wishing to keep would do so regardless of the cost of commissions. Therefore, the current situation for the holders has nothing to do at all, and for those who want to use bitcoin now, it interferes.",
