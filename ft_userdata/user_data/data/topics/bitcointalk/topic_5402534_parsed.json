While for Cardano, it's $3. Although supply-wise, ADA 33B of supply but I think reaching back to $3 is manageable. Whilst for AVAX, I think it will have a hard time reaching back to $100+ as it's past ATH. Don't you have any other option, honestly I'll just take any of the two or both bitcoin and ethereum.",

If I were you then I would invest more than 70% into avalanche and then rest of the money into cardano. But this percentage is in relation with the two pair which you told me. I would always go with bitcoin 50% investment and then rest of the 50% will be divided into my left over coins and in the above case it’s AVAX followed by Cardano. Moreover, you don’t have to worry about current drop in the AVAX, it’s for every coin out there and whole market is suffering.",

It's only a connection anyway but it does not mean that they will have the same plan. You can just ignore this fact and continue investing in avax. Avax did not show any shady acts lately, right? So, it's fall in its price can be natural only and is caused by the bear market.The two coins are close to being a top coin but I don't consider the two as a safe haven, sorry. For me there is only one safe haven and that is bitcoin but no worries as I would still invest on the two coins here only for the sake of diversification. They are still a better pick than the coins that I don't totally know.",

The two are actually good projects, but AVAX has ATH that is more than $146. If we are buying this coin right now and holding them for the long term until the bullish era, hopefully, the price at least can come back stringer. If the price can be back at least $100, it will be worthier, right?  I know that the rank of ADA is higher than AVAX, but in this case, it may be about the profits that we may gain. However, all choice is in our hand and each choice will require risks. Actually, I have ADA also and still holding for long term because no need to sell them right now at the very dropped rate.",

The connection is harming AVAX they are crashing just seven days ago they made a huge drop of -39.05 just when the market is dipping and it continues to go down, I have Avax and I continue to hold and in fact, add a little more, I checked the positive and negative feedbacks on Avax's performance in the next 12 months onwards and so far there is still a lot of positive feedback coming from seasoned traders and signal makers like this article.QuoteHowever, Avalanche’s ecosystem is fundamentally strong, as it has the third most total value locked (TVL) at $4.49bn, as of 12 May, after Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain, according to data from DeFiLlama.https://capital.com/avalanche-avax-price-prediction",

Apart from these, if the decreases I expect occur, I will divide all my investments by investing in bitcoin and ethereum, especially ethereum.",

Avalanche for me is also a good buy during this dump, as long as Ethereum will still have some problems with scalability Avalanche is still good to buy during this sale.",
