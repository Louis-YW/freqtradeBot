And I have read that either the miners or the node operators could do it.miners is the first point. Â as they collate data into blocks in the first place which means that they have to mould themselves to what full nodes should store as validdoing it as a lame user pruning thing just makes two levels of usernodes.. full nodes that keep full data and a subset that prune off data (which can cause many other issues within the network)the idea is if mining pools agree and consent then no harm, user nodes dont have to reject certain blocks or set themselves apart as different levels. because mining pools wont be putting any crap into a block in the first placehowever merchant nodes(economic nodes) can say they will reject blocks containing such crap data which would make mining nodes comply if they want to have their rewards recognised and seen rather than rejected and unable to be spent with the majority of merchant services(exchanges)yep.. its using the same 2017 tactics which core loved using. to undo a flaw core allowed in.. they cant really justify now saying its a bad idea. seeing as they invented the method to push rule changes in",

In fact, it doesn't matter at all what someone thinks about ordinals, because it's a passing thing that some people are trying to profit from, and these are the same ones who have already gotten rich promoting NTF as the next big thing.",
