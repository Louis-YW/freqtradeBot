      "body": "Imagine a newbie using multiple accounts to ask for a loan. Even if 1% of his attempts were successful it would encourage him to keep going.If he was a genuine member looking for a loan he would have made some effort with regards to collateral and asked for a small loan in the beginning. He first asked for 12500€ before trying again with a much more manageable 65€ but it was too late as he had already been marked therefore the thread should be locked.Quote from: Gideon66 on October 22, 2023, 01:02:40 PMThis is not acceptable here everyone is aware of scams and your account is even a newbie",
