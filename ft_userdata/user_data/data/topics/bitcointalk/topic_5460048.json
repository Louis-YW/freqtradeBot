Any one (or sometimes a combination) of the following things may help (or not, depending on the phase of the moon):(*) If you get stuck in a \"verification loop\", sometimes you can break out of it by navigating to https://www.bitcointalk.org (i.e. adding the www subdomain to the URL).(*) If it says you've been \"blocked\", sometimes you can get past that by first navigating to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php and then going back to whatever page you were on.(*) If it says you're being \"rate limited\" or have been \"temporarily banned\" (like in the OP), then try Ctrl+Shift+L (New Circuit for this Site). There's a button for this, but occasionally it'll disappear, so knowing the keyboard shortcut is worthwhile.There are also some other little tricks (I can't remember them all, they're muscle memory at this point) that sometimes work and sometimes don't, like clicking on the address bar and hitting enter to refresh the page instead of clicking the refresh button (I use the numpad enter with my thumb, because it's right next to my mouse).I've used nothing but Tor Browser to access the forum for over a year, and it definitely feels like Cloudflare is slowly trying to make it harder and harder for people to keep doing that...",
