      "body": "UTXO are stored in chainstate subdirectory, which is a LevelDB database, currently ~4.8GB.One could control how much of it is cached by the command line parameter \"-dbcache\". It might be useful to make it high enough during IBD (initial block download). Note that high dbcache leads to slow shutdown of Bitcoin Core. Other than during IBD, AFAIK, high dbcache is useless.There are no private keys in UTXO. Or if there ever were, it's all gone.",
