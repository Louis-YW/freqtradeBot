      "body": "Update: I wouldn't recommend anyone to work with them. They are extremely unprofessional. So the money they were offering wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. When I contacted them, I recommend to use escrow and to their credit they said yes. But then I thought about it, and the sum was small enough that escrow would have taken a decent chunk of it I believe. So I just said to them let's divide it in two milestones. First was the installation of the script, second was after changes. Nothing upfront and they agreed. And I started.Their script didn't have proper docs, so I found another script which had docs. I set it up on my computer locally and was successful. They were happy with this new script too. It ran pretty good. Now it was time to run it on their server. I installed the dependencies and all that, It went well. Now it was time to move the actual script files to their script and this is where the real bullshit starts. The file was a .zip and was around 30mb. When I started uploading it, it was just stuck. I tried multiple methods including FTP and SCP. The server was just crappy, I have pretty good internet and use these protocols on other servers all the time. I told them this, recommended a new server. I don't think I ever got a proper answer, it was yes no from them. A lot of time was wasted on this.Then they contacted support, I told them that I can upload the file on a cloud and support can upload it to the server. Guess what, support wasn't even able to download the file (all it took was one click on the download button). I don't whether they were lying or not. I told them that I have wasted a lot of time on this, and this is honestly not my problem. You should get a better server. Then they literally started blaming me. That its my own inability to upload, and said stuff literally like 'patience is a virtue of saints' and 'See beyond that. Sometimes, it takes a visionary to see great future. Stop looking at the [agreed money amount]. It's nothing. Think about future'. I couldn't do anything about this situation and I was being faulted for this. It was entirely on them. Even their 'professional' support wasn't able to upload the file.At this stage I was repeatedly asking for the funds for the first milestone. I had wasted time for something that's not on me and P.S they are not even doing anything to fix it. I gave an ultimatum that get better hosting and to use escrow. They ignored it. So that makes me wonder if they were not even going to pay me if it did work somehow.In the end they said that I was very unprofessional. Pretty ironic, I won't recommend working with them.",

      "body": "Here's exactly what transpired. Â We agreed on a price for the service and suggested using Escrow. In fact, I asked him to suggest any MM we can use. However, he was reasonably enough to suggest that since the amount is small, that using escrow won't worth it. So we agreed on part payment after installation, while the balance will be paid after customization. Then, I gave him complete access to the Root server and login to my Github repository to get the script. After about few hours back and forth with the server, he said the he's unable to upload the script. That the script is not good, that it was throwing errors, etc. Meanwhile, this script is installed elsewhere and working fine. Then he suggested another script and vowed that he will get that installed if I accept it. Then I accepted and asked him to go ahead and install that.3 hours down the line, he was still battling with uploading it to the server. He started blaming the server and saying the server is shit, and started recommending other servers. I said no and insisted with must continue with my server. I suggested we get the server support team to help upload the scripts. The moment I suggested that, he started demanding for payment. I said, how can I pay you when you haven't even uploaded the script to my server? What would I be paying for? He started saying that I have wasted his time with my shit server. As he was demanding for payment, Â I was chatting the hosting company to help us upload the script , and at the same time begging him to be patient. This guy kept on ranting how people pay him $7,000 for job and they don't make noise. I just kept quest and waiting for the host to upload the script. Few minutes later, the script was uploaded. Something that he couldn't do for hours.Then I informed him that the script has been uploaded, that he should continue with installation. He said no, that he won't until I pay him. Before we could say jack Â he ran to this place and made this post ðŸ¤£Right now, the script is sitting on my server Uninstalled and he want me to pay him for a job that he didn't do.First, he said my script was not good. Later he said server was not good. How do you trust such developer? Meanwhile, the server is a highend VPS. I believe he doesn't know jack and just wanted to waste my time and collect money. I'm still ready to pay him ifÂ  he can at least get the script installed.",

Then I accepted and asked him to go ahead and install that.You have no proof that your script is working fine, your script is not original. You got it from a guy who was 'apparently' reselling it. You were pretty happy accepting the other script.Quote3 hours down the line, he was still battling with uploading it to the server.

I said, how can I pay you when you haven't even uploaded the script to my server? What would I be paying for? Of course if your server is shit, I can't do anything. No matter my skill level. Also you didn't say no, you said give me recommendation multiple times and then just doubled down. I was still being patient with you and wanted to work with you. I tried to reason you, but if a support professional has to ask me three times on how to download a file by clicking a large button, I am going to get frustrated. This is your problem, not mine. You are responsible for the resources you provide me. And they are unworkable.QuoteHe started saying that I have wasted his time with my shit server.

Something that he couldn't do for hours.Thanks for reminding me! I wasn't able to mention this before here. So like I said on our chat, I will be as patient as you like if you pay me for my additional time. I think you forgot to reply? Can you please answer that?. The script wasn't upload few moments later, don't lie my friend. It took them 3 messages to just learn how to download a simple file! Again, I mean this is so so dumb. I have explained multiple times why I couldn't upload it but you just come up with the same thing. And yes, its true high paying clients are more understanding in reasonable in my opinion. While I have seen some visionaries like you. I didn't rant, I just gave that example for one one time.QuoteThen I informed him that the script has been uploaded, that he should continue with installation.

Sometimes, it takes a visionary to see great future. Stop looking at the [agreed money amount]. It's nothing. Think about future.\". This sounds so arrogant, I think I was at my limit then and just had to come terms with this stupidity. P.S you never said the script was uploaded or not, Even if its uploaded. I don't care! I lost so much hours because of this joke of a gig. And for something that's entirely on you.QuoteRight now, the script is sitting on my server Uninstalled and he want me to pay him for a job that he didn't do.I don't want to get this into it again. I think I deserved to be paid first because you wasted my time. Even if I worked with you, I think we would spend another 35 hours (unpaid) on your vision.QuoteFirst, he said my script was not good.

I'm still ready to pay him if Â he can at least get the script installed. Â Yes because it isn't, your script is unoriginal (which you didn't tell me at start btw). Has a lot of errors when I run the app. Your server is pretty bad too as explained above. Your server is not a highend VPS. It has just 1gb of ram with a 1 core CPU. Do you really think I want to work with you anymore, your vision is too much for me. No thanks!Ironically if we did use escrow. I am pretty sure the middle man would have told you to hurry up and solve the issue on your end. Otherwise they would have just compensated me.",
