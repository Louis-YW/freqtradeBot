Always make sure that you are not sending to the wrong address. There seed phrase and keys do not leave the hardware wallet.Quote from: jtx71 on November 24, 2023, 07:42:11 PMYes. I mean open source wallets. There are Bitcoin only and multi coin. I know that nothing can be written in the device, but can it be read in any way?Do you mean the seed phrase? It can not be read.But a physical attack on Trezor Model One and Trezor Model T can reveal its seed phrase to the attacker. That is the reason it is good to use passphrase with such wallet, to generate different keys and addresses. But if you lost your passphrase backup, just like seed phrase backup you will lose your coins.",

You can find a solid overview of pretty much all the hardware wallets out there on this site: https://thebitcoinhole.com/hardware-wallets",

In the face of great temptation, it is not enough to just talk about trust. So we don't use closed-source hardware wallets, like Ledger. It is not better than the Binance exchange. Some wallet companies release many firmware updates every year, such as OneKey and Keystone. Especially for hardware wallets with a small user base (10k+), lack of supervision and attention, are there any mechanisms to ensure that these firmware absolutely do not have backdoors?",

In general, there are millions of users of non-air-gapped HW's in the world and so far no one has lost their savings from these devices (unless he himself did something stupid). Even from hardware wallets that are closed source, despite the community's reliability concerns about this type of devices. Therefore, we can say that HW devices are reliable and perform their functions at an acceptable level.Quote from: jtx71 on November 24, 2023, 07:33:14 PM-Which of these wallets would you recommend?Thx!I would definitely recommend Ledger with their brilliant safety, as they advertised.  I couldn’t help but joke about this topic. This should not be taken as a recommendation to purchase this device.Trezor products still remain reliable and they are one of the top and mass hardware wallet manufacturers, so, in principle, their devices can still be recommended. Moreover, they have a newwallet in the form of Trezor Safe 3 with Secure Element (improved) protection.",
