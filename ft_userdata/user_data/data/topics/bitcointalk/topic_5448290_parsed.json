  "content": "I'm asking because I am not clear on what links if any this project has to the Terra Luna ecosystem. Should it be seen as a dead project just because it was part of that ecosystem ? Does it still have links to UST and/or Terra LUNA ?If they've managed to re-invent themselves this could be ( in theory ) a low cap gem. Tokenized Stocks is something almost nobody else is tackling, and I for one like the concept. I've been looking to invest in NVIDIA and Google for a while.So if Mirror has a working protocol where \"tokenized\" stocks can be traded , why not ? I think Tokenized assets could be the nextbig thing, with projects like QUANT and LCX getting involved.",

      "body": "Look to its chart, that will give you the idea whether to invest or not with this project. But I'll give you a heads up to save your time, that doesn't really good at all. It's a terrible chart that it's prone to more manipulation and quick pump and dump. Whatever is left on this project is no longer optimistic for the likes of you. Don't invest into projects like this because even if you do research, it seems that you'll still find projects like this that will catch your attention but it's better to avoid such for you to save money easy. There's no need to reinvent if the project is about to be dead, I'm sure many people have left their money there and have lost their enthusiasm about its future. But I can also be wrong since this is just an opinion looking at that straight line downtrend basing the chart.",
