  "content": "Good day my country people I know say things dey hard now and the present economic situation come be like say eh wan dey hard for everyone including the rich and middle class, but make we consider the poor people because even as things hard, most people still dey afford three square meal, transportation etc, so wetin I dey try talk na be say delivering assistance go play vital role for this hardship for our society, eh go promote love, save lifes, and reduce suffering, asides to dey wait for NGO's and government official to provide aid for poor people, we as individuals need to take I'm upon ourselves to help people wey dey in need, just like the holy book done even talk \"eh say love your neighbours as you love yourself\". For we country currently eh get many people wey dey undergo crisis from war, some dey displaced for various areas, other people dey face natural disaster like flood, if you dey in a better situation to help them make you no think twice but atleast try to assist them anyway you fit when you  come across such people.  Apart from that eh get other ways wey people wey dey privileged fit carry out humanitarian services like,To donate bloodTo dey pay visit to less privileged (orphans, displaced people)By to dey give food to your neighbours and family members when them dey in needTo give foodstuffs or cash gifts to widows for church and community.  Eh get one adage my grandmother been dey always tell me say one good turn deserves another, so make we try as much as possible to help people when we fit because humanitarian services dey promote love, peace and unity among individuals for our society.",
