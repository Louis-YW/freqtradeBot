Let me quote it: Quote from: Charles-Tim on May 06, 2023, 07:19:12 AMRBF makes bitcoin transaction to be easy, you do not need to have frustration of stuck transaction after you have used low fee. If the fee used is low when the mempool is congested, you can pump the fee.The mempool is at 151 sat/vbyte now. Because of RBF, I can use a fee rate of 20 to 30 sat/vbyte or lower fee rate and still be able to pump the fee if no confirmation within the time I am expecting. People should not be using wallets that do not support RBF.Electrum support RBF by default.",

You are confusing mbtc with btc so that's why the fees are high relative to the amount you want to send.I don't think this is the problem here. Based on the screenshot he shared, the base unit is btc, he is willing to send 0.00019btc and the fee he needs to pay is 0.000117btc which is indeed extremely high compared to the amount to be sent (~60%) but it's understandable given the current network situation.@OP, as OSS suggested, to have a good idea about the mempool situation and how much you need to pay for a fast confirmation you can check mempool.space. Or you can just rely on Electrum as it has a good fee estimator. Just make sure to select the \"Mempool\" option.",

ThanksThis is the usual setting that I'm using for optimal fee rate:Click the settings icon (upper-right side of the screenshot) and tick \"Edit fees manually\".Set the slider into \"Mempool\".Slide it through \"1.00 MB from tip\".Edit the 'absolute fee' (editable value at the right side of mining fee) into slightly higher than the automatically set value.Create the transaction.That setting ensures that your transaction when broadcasted will be within the size of the currently being mined block.The downside of this compared to ETA is, it's relying on a single factor (server mempool's size).So if mempools grow in size right after your transaction is broadcasted, it will be out of the <1mb from tip range.Also, it's expensive at the moment.Alternatively, this is the \"slow-confirmation\" setting that I'm using to make sure that it won't get dropped:Tick \"Edit fees manually\" like in the instructions above (only if it's disabled).Go to https://mempool.space/ and take note of the \"Purging\" fee rate.Back to Electrum, edit the 'fee rate' (editable value at the left side of mining fee) into something relatively higher than the \"Purging\" fee rate.Create the transaction.Since mempool is unpredictable, it's up to you if you want to set it 1~10sat/vB higher than the bottom of the mempools.",

ThanksI think any fee that you set is unlikely to get failed, it will surely get confirmed not unless you will double spend.Here is the best thing you can do --find the unconfirmed transaction in your Electrum wallet that you want to modify the fee for and right-click on it, and then select [Increase fee] from the drop-down menu and this will open a new window where you can adjust the transaction fee. The last step is to refer always to the mempool.space to determine the transaction fee that you want, the higher amount of fee the better for a quick transaction, and the cheap fee?  --only the bitcoin network can tell.",

      "body": "Quote from: Asuspawer09 on May 06, 2023, 08:33:55 AMThere are three options: ETA, Static, and Mempool.ETA gives you overpaid fee rate.Static gives you rights to set a fixed fee rate like 1 sat/vbyte or 5 sat/vbyte for your transactions. It will be always like this before you change the Static fee rate by yourself.Mempool gives you recommended fee rate by retrieving information from mempool. In theory, it is a good option but I would like to manually check mempools before I choose a fee rate for my transactions, no matter I chose Static or Mempool option.Where to check mempool and fee rate.

They have around 9% of the total hash rate and mine a block around every 2 hours on average. Note that for setting the fee rate manually, you need to click on \"Settings\" button and check \"Edit fees manually\".",
