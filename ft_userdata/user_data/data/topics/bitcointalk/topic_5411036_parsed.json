It's not one or the other when picking investments; it can be both, or even more than 5 assets (assuming you know what you're doing).Exactly, there are no hard cut rules that say if you invest in bitcoin, you shouldn't invest in another, or that you can only hold one investment at a time. If an investment is considered safe and you have the finance to accommodate it, nothing stops you from investing there as well. Diversification of investment can be profitable if one is aware of what they are doing, but it can also be the downfall of an investor if he is not careful, or does not have proper knowledge before diversifying.",

Maybe investing in Mutual Funds can also get big profits, depending on your investment, and you understand how to make a profit from that type of investment.But with the unpredictable movement of bitcoin, some people can't trust it and keep investing as they did before.

I think this is the best way to go about things but your % allocation of each would then depend on your risk tolerance. If crypto does well, it's probably worth knowing how to get your funds out and move them to safer assets so you can keep earning on them/store the equity you've built up.",

They are not even comparable! And honestly when it comes to investment, why not both? Bitcoin can give you extreme returns but at the same time, it can erode your investment as well. However for mutual funds, it's extremely rare to loose your investment. So the risk profiles are very different for these two types of investments. When you have money for investment, use an wide variety of assets and never invest only in bitcoin. When it comes to long term wealth creation, diversified portfolio is best!",

Few other will say Bitcoin is safe since it's encrypted by cryptography and decentralized, you could become a millionaire after holding for few years, but the risk is higher than the rest investment assets.

Diversification is extremely important for an investment portfolio. Even if you are certain Bitcoin will outperform, the peace of mind you get from having a diversified portfolio is worth the loss of maximizing potential gains. Itâ€™s also a lot easier to see whatâ€™s going on when you have skin in all the games.",

If we are investing, it doesn't mean only investing in one thing. Seem like when we are doing a business, we may have some business to make more income from several sources, not only one. In investment, I also do agree much on the method of diversification. In this case, diversifying the funds into both mutual funds and also Bitcoin may be a good choice. If we think that both are worthy, why not? We also know that each investment has its own risk, but they also give us certain profits. Thatis why we must consider on how we can set the target for each investment. In myopinion, I will keep investing both.",
