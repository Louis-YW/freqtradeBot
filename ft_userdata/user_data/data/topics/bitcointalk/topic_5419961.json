  "content": "US stocks, mainly the NASDAQ index used to be highly correlated with bitcoin but this year it looks like this is changing. It's like people don't know what to do and pump and dump bitcoin at random times, not looking at stocks at all. Some examples:September 9 -bitcoin pumped and dumped a few days later on the 13th - Here we had an inverse correlation with NASDAQ going down on 10 and 11 and up on 13. Exactly the opposite of what Bitcoin was doing. Bitcoin pumped again on October 25 and 26 and November 4, but dumped today on the 8th. Here Bitcoin pumped with the stocks, but the NASDAQ dumped on November 1 and 2 and then went up on 3 and 4. Bitcoin reacted to the stock dump with a 2 day delay.It's also worth mentioning that stocks had their first bottom in June and then a new one in October. Now they seem to be forming a second bottom at the levels from October. Bitcoin on the other hand is holding strong above its bottom. The bad thing is it's also constantly dipping below 20k, which should be a strong support since it was the old ATH, but in all this storm bitcoin is performing much better than stocks.",

      "body": "Today's decrease (not dump) in bitcoin price was probably due to the panic selling caused by FTX crisis which shouldn't have any effect on stock markets. We shouldn't expect FTX crises to cause a drop in Nasdaq index. In the past months all the markets have been affected by FED's decisions on raising interest rates. I think that's why we have seen same movements in bitcoin and stock markets and I don't think that will change in the coming months.",

The problem of institutional traders and manipulators will always occur in the market. At this game both CZ Binance and FTX will win at last, the average investors will pay at last.Op, this drama is not affecting stocks, gold is steadily gaining which should have interpreted into bitcoin if not these uncertainties happening in the market.",

Sure, some days they may not move the same direction but the overall trend is certainly similar. I’d say my stocks are holding up much better, but I also think crypto will recover faster. We’ll see. I think the recent activity shows that we aren’t quite to safe haven status yet, but the beginning of this bear market showed some promise.",

Crypto news can't affect stocks, typically today's bitcoin drop was caused by FTX but this has no effect on stocks at all. But the CPI has just been released and both are rising together, It can be said that the macro information can push the two markets to move in the same direction. They are not always correlated.",

Traders on stock exchange doesn’t use Bitcoin as indicator on there trade while Bitcoin traders usually use Nasdaq data as signal for there crypto trading. All happening on crypto remains on crypto market while Global stock exchange movement affects crypto as I already explained on my first statement.This movement on crypto is very unexpected and purely manipulated. Expect no correlation on this to stock market.",

I do not know how I reached this conclusion, but any correlation is supposed to be due to market sentiment, as there is no direct relationship between Bitcoin or stocks, otherwise the past ten years have not witnessed any pattern or correlation.As for the reason for its occurrence now, it is because the market capacity has become large enough to be affected by global changes.",

It's like people don't know what to do and pump and dump bitcoin at random times, not looking at stocks at all. Actually, this year is when they were more correlated than everTwo of the dips were triggered just after the FED announcement, and the last mess is caused by a multitude of factors that normally won't happen every month or every year, elections, meta, ftx, but even if we consider this, 2022 was far more linear and uneventfully than 2021.Quote from: coolcoinz on November 08, 2022, 03:04:08 PMBitcoin on the other hand is holding strong above its bottom.

[..snip..]True, and look at today's gain;    The S&P 500 SPX, +5.54% closed up 207.80 points, or 5.5%, to 3,956.37, its highest end-of-day level since Sept. 12.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +3.70% climbed 1,201.43 points, or 3.7%, to 33,715.37, its highest closing level since August.     The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +31.35% advanced 760.97 points, or 7.4%, to 11,114.15, its biggest daily rise in percentage-point terms since March 2020. Dow scores 1,200-point gain as stocks log biggest one-day advance since 2020 on signs inflation is softening  And bitcoin market today? A gain of 10++%, there is there huge movement today in every traditional market and crypto as well. And this is triggered by the CPI report putting the inflation rate down to 6.3%, down from 7.7%. So that is a very good news for the US economy.",
