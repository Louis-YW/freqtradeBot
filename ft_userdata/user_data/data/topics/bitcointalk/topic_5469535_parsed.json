  "content": "BackgroundHi fellows, As we all know there are different zones in the Bitcoin market cycle, and those who fill their bags for a single cycle or take an interest in multi-cycle accumulation considering Bitcoin's future potential, just need to be aware of the market zones and effective acclamation strategies as here in this post I'm trying to express what I've learned in a couple of months about the Bitcoin's market cycle and by expressing my thoughts I would like to seek guidance from seniors that what they think about am I on right track or not.Edit:Changed the Subject to testing the desired feedback scenarios, As I was expecting a discussion on the different strategies not praising the DCA.Introduction to Bitcoin Cycle ZonesTaking market zone to be covered in the same post, I do acknowledge maximum of the fellows already know but for those newbies like me, it will be easy to understand. The Bitcoin market cycle is based on 4 significant zones, Accumulation, Distribution, Markup (Bull Run), and Markdown (Bear Market). Considering important factors, I will try to be more significant in strategies rather than putting redundant information.Accumulation Zone & Strategies to FollowFirst of all, starting from the accumulation zone, in this market zone, whales and investors accumulate Bitcoins taking the realized undervalued market price, In simple accumulation zone is the most suited zone to invest in Bitcoin where the market price of Bitcoin goes lower than the realized bitcoin price.For the rest, I think the topic is getting lengthened..In this particular zone, a few more prominent Strategies can be taken for effective Bitcoin accumulation.Strict DCA: DCA is the most recognized accumulation strategy used by the Bit-coiners to fill up their bags, many different types of DCA exist but here in the accumulation zone investors should prefer the Strict DCA on a particular time span and specific amount on each interval. Smart people consciously use this zone to boost their returns with good decisions but a few newbies and other investors try to wait for the Bottom, which can lead to FOMO later on, by adopting DCA in this zone a much more effective investment can be made as no one can speculation bottom accurately.Use Limit Buying Orders: You can use the limit order, prepare a long-term buying analysis, and place equal buying orders on the different market support levels, this will greatly help in the volatility, in the accumulation zone compared to the other zones volatility remains constant (Consolidating market), still in case it will help you in decent buying prices.Try to Avoid FOMO: In the accumulation zone on the initial stage and ending stage of the zone most people fall into the FOMO, better to control their emotions, be conscious while making any decision as it will directly affect your accumulation process, take a close look on the market sentiments and plan accordingly your next buying range & capital of that range to be invested.Prepare the Emergency Funds:I was not aware of it firstly while exploring the forum, in the Buy&Hold with a discussion between seniors and JJG, still need to be more familiar with this strategy but what I've learned is this amount should be in the stable currency from which medium you can utilize it in any sort of unexpected market momentum. I'd like to ask here what seniors think about this.Distribution Zone & Strategies to FollowThe distribution zone in the Bitcoin's market cycle is the profit booking zone for the short-term investors who accumulated Bitcoins earlier in the Bear market  & accumulation zone. Here the accumulation does matter for those who are expecting their entry in the market for  2 or 3 cycles or even more. Even in the distribution zone, these Bit coiners accumulate Bitcoins but at a lower rate. Most people don't prefer accumulation here but still, those who are dedicated to Bitcoin or any other narrative (to avoid inflation, Saving mode, etc) do accumulate Bitcoins.Hybrid DCA: DCA can be an all-rounder for you if you are making entries for a longer period regardless of the market cycle, in the distribution zone you can accumulate by just making a few changes in the DCA, considering market sentiments and changing your interval accordingly the same thing can be done with the capital amount to be invested in the particular entry.Use Bots: You can use the Bots with a tight range with your buying orders, It's quite similar to the limit orders but here while the market stays consistent and shows lower volatility Bots can really help in effective average buying.Be Patient and Depends on TA:  In the distribution zone, all you need is patience, while taking regular entries control your emotions of greed and fear, do not fall into any traps, and take entries strictly to the Technical analysis to ensure efficient buying prices. Consider most of your entries in the correction times.Markup & Markdown Zone & Strategies to FollowIn the markup and markdown zone, the whole game revolves around the sentiments, you need to be psychologically stronger and be confident with emotions. In both of these zones, volatility shows its game and tries to manipulate the weak hands and maximum of them really fall into their hands.Fear & Greed Index: Market sentiments are important in these zones and fear and greed indicators can really help while considering the entry times. Fear and greed really help in the accumulation, especially in the Bear Zone, you can use it for your strategy analysis in the Bull Run as well.Buy Dips Aggressively: Dips are the opportunities, I would say buying dips alone can also be a good accumulation strategy in the Bear market even in the Bull run dips bring a lot of accumulation efficiently. Dips + DCA can be deadly   accumulation combo in the bear trend. patience is the Key.HODL: Hodl is a complete mind game, not only accumulation is important is more important to stick to it, and HODL should be your pure mindset while accumulating for even a single cycle or for the multicycle. I would recommend reading this thread to know more about the Hodl. HODL is purely a mental challenge That's all I think, the topic is getting overlengthen.",

      "body": "OP, you have done well to bring up this information here and it will really help newbies and those who haven't bought bitcoin yet. I will prefer the regular DCA method because this is the best way one can keep on accumulating more bitcoin, in order to increase his bitcoin portfolio gradually. DCA doesn't bother about the price of bitcoin at that moment either it is pumping or dumping because it is a continuous process and you are investing for a long period of time, maybe 8-10 years. Buying at the dip is also good but the disadvantage is that one have to wait till the price dips and at that time you might have spent the funds that you budgeted down for buying at the dip, which will lead to regrets at the end of the day. What matters is for you to have a proper plan of amount that you will assign for regular DCA based on your income. DCA approach is the best strategy for beginners, but if you have accumulated up to your target amount of bitcoin, then you can consider buying at the dip as a good strategy. Patience is the key to long term investment and DCA helps you accumulate with ease.",

It is my mindset when I started doing the DCA (dollar-cost averaging) mid-last year regardless of the market condition, cycle, etc. I honestly have less belief in “cycles” in which anything can change unexpectedly without warning. This is why even if BTC went downhill last time, I was not concerned that much and I just kept on doing DCA. I always make sure that the money I’ve saved for family and emergency is my top priority and investments are at the very least in the priority list.It is important about educating ourselves with the right mindset and approach when it comes to money management and financial situations regardless if we’re single or having our own families.",

Most times DCA'ing mostly good when there is a reserved funds which one can used for as backup funds to cover up every expenses without dipping hands into the investment during the DCA period.",

The key thing is setting this wallet up by yourself and not trusting third parties to do it for you even if it is some you trust. For someone going into a long term hodling the best thing should be the user of offline wallets like hardware wallets. Although it is a bit complicated but a multi sig wallet is one of the most secured with at least two co-signers, but this should be done on different to avoid a single point of failure associated with the use of master seed. While considering the amount to invest, one should set out just an amount considerably you can lose. My take of at least 20% of your income is wise but one can go higher if they have the funds",

OP made a very good start in covering most of the strategies with their best fitting but due to the lack of experience, I think a couple of more things left over way a decent work done by OP I would like to call over a topic where I had discussed the accumulation.☑ Things to keep in mind before accumulation of BitcoinBesides that multi-cycle accumulation requires very detailed analysis before jumping into the accumulation, a couple of things must be taken into account if you are going in multi-cycle it is a multicycle for others for you consider it a single cycle of longer duration, where you'll get more back to back accumulation zones and never miss out this particular zone for a good accumulation. It can be even more efficient in buying compared to the Bear market.",

For example if i am accumulating btc then i will or shall have a plan to when i will book the profit. Generally I will say, I would hold btc for ath that comes after halving and that time depends and is not specified. Now i need some clarifications from you that, you said, distribution zone is for booking profit from the accumulation that you had did but for the short term investors. But i would say anyone who have accumulated the BTC and are trying to book the profit in ath then they might not be considered as short term investors. Because they are at least holding the funds for 1 year and must be consider as holder (long term) I might be wrong here that's why i am asking you to please simplify it for me.And do you know something about A/D indicator because if you are talking about accumulation and distribution then a little talk will worth it but otherwise. I also not know about A/D indicator that much just trying to get some more idea from you. PS: BTW a nice compilation, i really like your post and keep coming with such topics.",
