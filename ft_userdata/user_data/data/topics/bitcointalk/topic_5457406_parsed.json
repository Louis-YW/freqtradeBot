It can only make the rich people in such country to be more influential and be more respected by the poor people. But speaking of an economy, poverty is the opposite of a good economy.",

Share your ideas on the importance of the poor masses in economy sustainability.In as much as the poor people, at some point, can't afford the ends they need That does not change the fact that everyone has a role to play in the growth of an economy, but the rich and the poor have their parts to play.No matter how poor one seems to be, there are still some things that the person can afford, so the buying of goods contributes to some extent to the country's economy.But another major thing that I believe the poor usually offer to society is cheap labor. That's to say, since they don't have money, they will likely do work that requires a higher pay and take a low pay as payment since they are, at some point, just after any payment that can just foot their bills for that day.So providing cheap labor is one of their other contributions to a country's economy since payment, which could have been used to pay 1 laborer, could now possibly be shared among 3 for different jobs. Companies reduced expenses.",

Also, most people are poor at some point in their life, and they can escape poverty by continuously learning and working hard.

Let us stop deceiving ourselves almost 95% of countries cannot provide for their citizens even 50% of their needs . For the development or improving the economy of the country even the ordinary individual need to participate in the development of the country not all the government.

The more poor there are, the worse the state control machine works.

      "body": "I think that the poor play a big role in some economies, because if you are poor, it is very likely that you are also uneducated, and in that case you are subject to very easy \"management\" by those higher up in the hierarchy. If you take the example of China, which has a very cheap labor force (comparing it to the US or the EU), then it is very clear that without the cheap labor force, that country would not be competitive in the world compared to what it represents today.Let's further take the example of many African countries that are very rich in resources and at the same time most of the people are poor or living on the edge of poverty - while at the same time their politicians do their best to keep the people where they are because that way they can easily manage the country and use resources for their luxurious life.Unfortunately, poverty is something that many people turn their heads away from, for the reason that they simply do not care, or it is in their interest that the poor remain exactly as they are.",

The whole city fell apart and was full of rubbish. Everyone plays an essential role in a community, not all people are to be doctors, lawyers and generally have an academic career. We also need handymen, such as plumbers, electricians, cleaning workers and so on for the community to function properly.Quote from: Chilwell on June 24, 2023, 01:41:55 PMPoor people don't have any contributions to the GDP of the economy this is quite okay, but saying it because they don't belong to the national workforce, I disagree with this statement because individuals don't need to belong to the national workforce before you can contribute to the growth of the economy, for instance in my country only a few percent like 30% are working for the government, now how can this percentage improve the economy, this will be done in the addition to the foreign investors I disagree, people barely making a living contribute to the country's economy, as I mentioned earlier, they are a vital gear in the community, without them, cities wouldn't be able to function properly. On top of that they contribute a great deal in the economy, because a large number of them are unable to save money and spend every bit they earn, while wealthier people tend to save and invest instead of spending them.",

Share your ideas on the importance of the poor masses in economy sustainability.The poor are people that lack skills and education. Lack of skill leads to low wage which breeds poverty. The poor are the main laborers of the country. They work for the rich and receive wages from the rich. They end up giving back the money they earned to the rich through taxes and bills. Without the poor, there will be no cheap labor to work in industries and other sectors. The poor contribute immensely to the economy of the country through taxes and bills. Some bad governments treat the poor as slaves. When they want more money they increase taxes and the cost of essential services. A clear illustration is what happens in the ant kingdom where the poor are the worker, the soldiers are the middle class and the queen are the rich. The workers and soldiers live to serve the Queen.",

We generally mean poor people who are landless and daily wage earners. Now what you need to know is how they play a role in economic development. Suppose you need 10 10 workers in case there are no workers in your country then how will you fill the shortage of those 10 workers. Due to lack of workers, your work will surely stop due to which you may face financial problems. Again suppose you need some van drivers to take some of your goods from one place to another. If those van drivers were not there, how would you move your goods. That is, every professional person plays a role behind the economic development of the country from their respective positions.

Most of these wealthy people wouldn't move as well but they can take that and it won't matter to them because they're wealthy, they can buy all their needs even if the economy of their country is shattering.

Instead, we need to try to create more opportunities than criticize each other on the issue of quality of life. It doesn't matter if everyone loves and shares to have a balanced life.",

Is the people that are people meant to be more in the country or does being poor has a significant use in an economy? The level of poverty is not suppose to be significant that is why a country that has high rate of employees would also have a favorable economy to his citizens which will increase the number of foreign expertiates that will becoming to the country to create more businesses and bring more money to the economy.
