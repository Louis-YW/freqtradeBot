  "content": "I'm thinking to stake Ethereum and run a node, I'm trying to decide between the twoUnfortunately I didn't follow much about the Ethereum ecosystem development and my knowledge of what's going on, and how to stake is very low. But as I dont plan to sell the eth soon, I defiantly feel like I should run a noteI would go with avado as it looks very simple, but it feels like avado is almost 50% more expansive (especially now at black Friday) than Daapnode.How simple it is to install an Ether node on Daapnode compared to Avado? (i heard avado is very simple). I'm looking for a simple straightforward solution, hopefully with minimum possibilities to make mistakes. I do not want to start to dive into the depth of learning a new language.How does the support team and community of each?How to pick the right staking machine? (how do I know how much Ram I need and how much TB? and if to pick NVMe or SSD)and a bonus question - what is MEV?",

Try asking him for help if you want to make your own node. But I believe that to maintain your node you need knowledge, so I donâ€™t do that.",

      "body": "If you decide to purchase either of the two, you won't need much technical knowledge to run it. It's more like plug and play with a few clicks, which an average user can do. Like you said, some seems to be more expensive than the other, and it might be for a reasonThe documentation about the two is readily available on both sites and Ethereum.org1. https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/2. https://dappnode.com/en-us3. https://ava.doIn case you have any burning questions; their more active online communities can also help you out. Ethereum's community decided to move away from Bitcointalk sometime back, so you will find those who are so much into the developments happening in the Ethereum ecosystem there rather than here.https://ethereum.org/en/community/online/",
