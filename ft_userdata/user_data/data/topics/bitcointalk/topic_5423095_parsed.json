  "content": "I thought we should start a thread where we could speculate about who would be the teams meeting in this year's Soccer world Cup final.I was innitially predicting to see England vs Germany at the final, but the wway Germany demonstrated to have their team, it doesn't seem to me that they will get too far. From what I have seen from the first matches, I believe there is a strong chance of seeing a Spain vs England match at the final of the world cup. So, what are your predictions???Keep them coming!",

      "body": "I think that the Final will have most likely Argentina in it,there are a lot of conspirator theories that they lost intentionally the game with Saudi Arabia as they need to get second of the group in order to avoid Brazil early in the elimination stage.I also believe somewhat in this theory so the other team remaining to go far from their performance is England without a doubt who scored a lot of goals in their opening games and despite Iran not being a strong opponent still scoring 6 goals in a game says a lot to me,they should improve their defense a bit but for me England is one of the candidates to go to the final,so my final prediction is either one of these:Argentina vs EnglandBrazil vs England",

They can score six goals but not to fantastic team.Germany loosing to Japan can give Japan the confidence going harder to the games.My prediction to this final is to see Spain, France, Brazil and Japan",

How this Arab team beat Argentina, they are lucky Sir. The strongest candidate in my opinion is England, although this team has controversial defenders \"sorry\", but they have a great striker.",

Arabia could win against Argentina... I was pleasantly surprised by Iran and their game today, it seems to me that South Korea played a good match yesterday, but unfortunately they didn't win even though they had nice chances. Well, after this start, it's hard to guess how things will unfold, there are still more games in the groups and somehow it seems to me that there will be more surprises.",

For now, we're only in the second round of the group stages so i'd give other teams a similar chance since there could be a certain team that would suddenly look impressive once the playoffs start but at the moment I like France and Brazil to have a deep run.",

Germany is the reason for all the war. But the people who suffered war also like the Germany players. This is the power of sports and Football, Brazil and Argentina was in the next place of people support. Among this three country will take huge advantage in the game. And France had a good chance of winning as compared to other nations. Recent game of Argentina loss made to understand, it can be beaten. So I was curious for the semi final.",

Argentina, Germany really took us by surprise. I don't expect much for Argentina to win the title in this championship, even though Argen is our favorite team. to qualify for the next round phase, is still in doubt.  Previously I speculated that Argentina could at least make it to the semi-finals. even so, we'll see if they are able to escape from this group phase.On the other hand, from the start I would not doubt the Brazil squad at all. and proven, they played very impressively. on the other hand, England also played quite well, France, Spain who really played really well.I don't have predictions on other teams, apart from Brazil, who will be waiting for the final match. at least, once this group phase is over. we can conclude and predict based on the records and statistics of the team that will be championed that will go to the final match.",

But seeing today's match against Ecuador who was able to hold their draw, it will be even more difficult for the Dutch journey to the final. Meanwhile, Brazil is still sufficient so far, they have more qualified attack variations. Regardless of the result, I am still optimistic that these two countries will reach the final of the world cup later.",

In my view Portugal is not a steady team and Ronaldo is already a 3rd age player that cannot play the whole game. Of course that I would like to see them conquer the cup, specially because this would bring one more record to Ronaldo, but I'm afraid chances are pretty slim.",

Another team am going to predict to win the World Cup apart from the Portuguese team and Argentine team are the Brazilian team, you could see the level of team work they displayed yesterday, so I think between Portugal, Argentina, and Brazil one of them stand a better chance of winning the world cup.",
