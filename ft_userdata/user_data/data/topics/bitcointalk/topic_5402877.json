Why should he get special treatment?He/she deserves all the red tag from anyone who feels red tag should be given. Because of his/her clumsiness and bad management, all the participants of lunaland (an alt campaign managed by Royse777) didn't get a single payment despite how successful the project was back then, it was suppose to be a weekly payment but rosey never follow up to ensure participants of signature get their weekly payment,  he rarely answered questions in the bounty telegram group, instead of sincerely apologise for the mismanagement of the campaign he threatened to red tag anyone who dare challenge his/her incompetence (not to mention he/she got paid regardless).Participants of that bounty never reported Royse777 because of the influence he/she has here in the forum. This is another way of scam, not necessarily direct scam. I would be red tagging him/her if I have the power. What is worth doing is worth doing well.",

Congratulations!!There are many great applications but since I have a limited number - I had to pick the best suit for the campaign. Thanks everyone for applying. Accepted ones please update your signature and avatar please. And confirm it to the next posts.Quote from: Tutte on June 17, 2022, 06:13:37 AMhe threatened to red tag anyone who dare challenge his/her incompetence (not to mention he/she got paid regardless).Participants of that bounty never reported Royse777 because of the influence he/she has here in the forum. This is another way of scam, not necessarily direct scam. I would be red tagging him/her if I have the power. What is worth doing is worth doing well.If fear was something worked for you then this is the right time for you to create a scam accusation, I was never been in such bad shape before, so use it. People can have their opinions freely. I would suggest you to create a new thread of anything that you have against me. In the accusation board you have better chances than here.The \"red tag anyone who dare  challenge his/her incompetence\" was completely exaggerated by the way. I still have not used my DT power to abuse it against anyone even when I have many changes where I could and took the unethical advantage. I hope the community have seen it in me before.",
