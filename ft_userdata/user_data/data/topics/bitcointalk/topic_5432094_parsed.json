Hacks, data leaks, scams, Ponzi schemes, they are all old things. Only DeFi 2.0, stable coins, algorithmic stable coins help scammers to scam more easily. They scammed people not because cryptocurrency market is a scam market but this market is one of tools used by scammers.QuoteCEX rascality caused a whole lot of issues which resulted to some popular slogans such as \" not your keys, not your coin\" what will you say with regards to your journey and experience in 2022.I share bad experience and horrible loses of people in FTX fiasco but from now, we would have more transparency from CEX operations and reports. Not all consequences from FTX fiasco are bad.Cryptocurrency Security Checklist",

But I guess thats how the market it is. There will be new tech or thing that will bring back the market healthy again. Lets just say this is just a temporary set back for everyone. Theres what we called cycle and this is only a part of that.",

Then 2023 is a repeat of btc's bullish period leading up to the next halving session and reaching a new ATH. I hope it keeps repeating itself and that cycle continues to be believed. Although a while ago I read on Cointelegraph that the 40,300BTC that had been mined this year had been sold. This is done by Core Scientific, Riot, Bitfarms, Cleans Park, Marathon, Hut8, HIVE, Iris Energy, Argo and Bit Digital.It seems that they are struggling to bear the cost of Minning especially the cost of Electricity. Despite the recession issue and a lot of bad news regarding crypto that makes investors a little hesitant to invest.",

I only take advantage of market opportunities to trade, which at that time was very profitable market conditions.For this year, I actually don't hold bitcoin at all because the price tends to be unstable and can't be calculated.My hope is that in 2023 Bitcoin can start to rise and be able to start its heyday again. That way I believe that more and more adoption of Bitcoin can make it reach its highest ATH again whether it happens in 2024 or even 2025 and hopefully this will really happen.",

In 2018, I'm still a newbie at that time that's why I considered 2018 as the \"Year of Hell\". Fast forward to 2022, it happened again but this time, I'm already ready if the worst thing comes and it came this year. I'm ready for it and instead of me panicking, I took the opportunity and accumulated slowly.My experience this year has not been very happy but at the same time, not that sad. I might be a bit disappointed since I had an impermanent loss in my portfolio, but I'm happy that I bought cryptos and stock market for a cheaper price.My expectations for 2023? For the market none but I expect, and I hope that the world will be better next year than this year. Crypto market will be moving in sideways. That's what I expect. I will continue accumulate still until next year as long as I have spare money.",

Although I have learnt few things about crypto currency prior to this year I was skeptical in investing into bitcoin because of the price. I could recall it was 50k plus when I wanted investing into it but this year has given us who are a little late to bitcoin a second chance to get it below the 20k mark. The year has also proven that centralized institute ain't to be trusted and I picked positives from it.I expect a bearish start to 2023 and anticipate its bull at the middle of the year but regardless I am holding hard this time. At least 2022 has thought me few lessons",

If the collapse does not happen for Luna and FTX, then I believe there will be other collapses to replace them.
