It's not that it was bad that time, but I guess it was just one escape from the people behind, even a chess game will have people betting on who is going to win.So it might be a bad experience for me, nevertheless, I'm not that addicted, just play when I wanted to or just gambling with the money that I can afford to lose. I guess those kind of environment might have been in my mind and mold me to not become a gambling addict.",

It is good to discipline oneself while gambling but which I lacked at the time.In total, I lost in gambling than winning, so I have zero my mind not to ever use the money that I can not afford to lose to gamble ever again.We are the problem of ourselves, or we give ourselves problem. If you use like 5% or less of your weekly income to gamble, that will not affect you if you lost all the 5% weekly. We should work towards what will not affect us if we lost to gambling.",

During this time we will come up with little funds and stake on dice to see how has the highest number. This was how I learnt how to gamble. As a gambler I have loss more than I have won which is a norm in gambling because you can never win the house edge, I will say that gambling takes more from us than what it gives to us no matter our skill or luck. Gambling responsible is the only way that will make you live healthy as a gambler.",

Already as a young kid I have been interested in gambling due to two factors. The first one was my grandfather who played lottery and scratch cards all his life. He would take me with him to collect his winnings and place the new bets every Saturday. To keep me entertained he would always buy me 2 scratch cards. And the other factor was watching casino movies. When watching movies like oceans eleven or rounders I knew that when I will be 18 that I am going to visit casinos myself. Most of my friends back in the day felt the same and we would regular visit our home town casino. And then there was the poker boom in 2010/11 where a lot of small poker tournaments where being organized locally. In my country it's not allowed to gamble for money outside of casinos, so all the Poker tournaments where offering physical prices. It was a good way to win a new graphic card or monitor with limited downside.",

      "body": "Firstly, what attracted me to gambling was the profit opportunity it offered and the belief it was possible to play smartly, overcoming the house on long term and profiting from it. I also believed gamblers lost money because they didn't know how to manage their bankroll efficiently and were driven by emotions, instead of logic and reason. So if I could play in a different way I should have success on this endeavor.And after the introduction to crypto casinos I had this belief once again, due to the possibility of using bots to play dice game automatically, while using different configurations or strategies. However, after some time I saw that wasn't feasible, so I had to gamble for different reasons, which go beyond the possibility of making profit, always with the conscience I can lose money anytime, therefore I should play only with money I can afford to lose, always respecting limits and predetermined conditions.",

      "body": "In crypto casinos, it's always BTC that attracts users to gamble. The opportunity to grow your BTC is always irresistible because it's like hitting 2 stones with one bird.  Bitcoin price goes up in a bull run and then they win bigger in value while they also won those BTC from playing on casino. Two regrets also when they lost their BTC I know this feeling because I also lost some of mine. But I think most of us are also traders, when the market is just too dull and no particular trends that move the price, traders turn casino players.",

I can have a lot of fun betting $10 on my favourite football team or MMA fighter and watching the game with friends. If I win, I usually spend it on food right away and we order a pizza or something and spend time together. If I lose, somebody else sponsors the feast I know a few stories though. I have a neighbor who can bet all his savings each time and I think he's crazy, but it's too late to reason with him. I saw him spend 10k on a bet when he barely has food in the fridge. One time ha had money saved up to buy a car and he went on a gambling spree and he had something like 20k saved up and lost 15, but still had to buy a car so, he bought some old shit that should be scrapped and drives that. He should go to rehab, but I can't make him.",

That month in 2018; it was a tennis bet i first staked; if i am right, i think it was either Australia open or Roland Garros. I picked up the booking codes from twitter and proceeded to stake the game with the hopes of earning x1000. The ticket had 20 games; and out of the 20 games there were only 3 cuts. This gave me hope and then i continue to bet \"albeit occasionally\".My experience with gambling is bad because until i quit; i was spending without earning haha",

On my end, profit came first before enjoyment and gladly, I was able to go out from that mindset and is now enjoying things with proper management regarding risk. But as we all know, profit tendency is what dragging people into gambling. There is an impression wherein gambling is believed to be a gateway or an easiest way to be rich in an instant. Despite of knowing that things won't go as planned, people are still hooked up with this idea. Quite of a nature of human to focus on things which would come in an instant.",

Now, let's head down to when you're losing, you can't stop placing bets either when you're also trying take back what you have lost - so that's another gambling attraction, it's the urge to win back what you have lost. While sports betting is a kind of gambling activity which somehow very addictive, especially when you're a hardcore fan to such sport i.e NBA or Football. I've seen many people who just have quarrel  with their friends because they were cheering and betting on a different team.  Trust me, sports betting will not only lose your money, but you could also lose a friend when you both have different teams.",

I can't say that I was a frequent guest in physical casinos, but online casino gambling attracted me primarily because of the accessibility and ease of depositing and withdrawing money, especially in the case of crypto casinos.As for my personal experiences, I've had both positive and negative moments while gambling. One particularly memorable good experience was when I hit a small jackpot on an online slot game. The sheer joy and disbelief I felt in that moment were truly something. But, I've also had some sad moments. Like any gambler. Since then I have learned that losses are part of the game and it is important to set personal boundaries so that gambling remains a fun activity and not something that will negatively affect your financial stability.",

Even though winning and losing are only limited to luck and failure, gambling activities are growing rapidly as technology develops. Now you don't need to visit a casino to gamble, technological developments have made it easier for gamblers to carry out gambling activities online.Some people might think gambling is an instant way to get rich. Gambling is considered to be able to make money quickly and easily without having to work hard to get it. They will continue to gamble even though they often lose, this condition is caused because the brain has a unique system, namely the 'curious' system. This system is connected to various areas of the brain, especially the pleasure center of the brain. Whatever activity you think can give pleasure will be stored in the brain, then it will encourage you to release dopamine to do the same activity again. Likewise when you are gambling, dopamine will be released because there is unlimited excitement and fun, especially when you are winning. A person's experience in gambling varies greatly, some often win and some often lose. Even though they often lose, they will continue to play because there is motivation to win and it is considered fun.",
