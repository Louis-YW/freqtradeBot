  "content": "I notice what is currently happening in your battle against your enemies. From my experience so I far, I believe you are only helping to encourage them, with the way you and your media promote or give credit to technologies, to the rich one who is currently working against you, false king of babylon, plus your occasional talks about negotiating with your enemy. All these and others are only making things worse for you. You are like a lion in the midst tortoises who are only able to weaken you through their craftiness rather than their strengths or ingenuity. They understand that the only way to defeat you is to get the ONE helping you to stop helping you. If for example i give you list of things to do or avoid in order to defeat your enemy, they will craftily get you to do the opposite in order to get our CREATOR abondon you, and your protection weakened as a result. I will advise you to completely disconnect from people or things you don't trust. When you want to talk with them make sure it's well publicize so that I will be here praying for your purification and protection. You are stronger in your bubble/shield as long as it's formed/strengthened by your obedience and adherence to the Will of our CREATOR. Mingling with those who are going against HIS Will only weakens the shield. Always understand that if you are within the Will of our CREATOR, HE Will work for you. For example, when you are in a serious one-on-one combat with your enemies, bullets are deflected or won't penetrate your shield. The sky, water, forest, ground etc also work for you all thanks to the CREATOR who controls them. But when you become disobedient they stop working for you unless grace is on your side. This has been happening since the beginning of your Special Operation but you seem not to understand or you gave credit to your hardware/technology calculations. Anyway, from now onward (esp now things are not going well for you like before), your enemy & the enemy of our CREATOR will begin to be subdued. When you notice this then you know that it is the Hand of the CREATOR rather than your technology or wisdom. The aim is to gradually move Westward from Donetsk/Lugansk to Kiev/Lvov. Â Mark this date so that when it begins to happen you know where who it's coming from.",

      "body": "Just curious. Who in Russia are you talking to? Russia is very diverse culturally. There are many Christians in Russia, as well as many who aren't. And the government of Russia is acting more peacefully than the US government.If you are talking to Russia as a country of the world, why her? There are worse nations, and there are troubles in all. Zechariah 6:8 talks about those horses going toward the North Country giving the Spirit rest. Is Russia this North Country, at least in part? And is the 'rest' given to the Spirit talking about Russia's desire for peace?",

      "body": "Agree; things go in your favor when you work under the creator's will and on the right path. But when you are on the wrong way and acting against God's will. Then, things would get worse against you. But at this time, you (Russia) must stop, think and analyze your path. As per my observations, your acts are affecting millions of people.",

But when you are on the wrong way and acting against God's will. Then, things would get worse against you. But at this time, you (Russia) must stop, think and analyze your path. As per my observations, your acts are affecting millions of people.It's true that Russia's actions are affecting millions of people. But the affecting is an attempt to free them from the US banking Ponzi scheme that is enslaving millions.Consider. It was the US and the new US banking system that disrupted Russian power by supporting the Bolsheviks so that they could oust the Czar from power. Then it was the Russians and the USSR that did the main job of conquering Germany in WW2.Of course, as many nations, Russia's pride in their successes turned them into something worse than Hitler's Germany. Russia's success started to fail, and by 1991, she agreed to breaking up and freeing the member States of the USSR. But it was the US that did not follow its 1991 agreement by not expanding NATO.So, today we have Russia that is simply doing a police action in Ukraine to protect itself and Ukraine from US imperialism, and people think that Russia is bad. But it's the same thing that the US has been doing all around the world for over a hundred years. It is the same thing that placed the Bolsheviks in power.Russia has learned its lesson and moved into free trade with other countries. But when they didn't bow to the corrupt US banking system, the US started to expand its controls in Eastern Europe, and at this time in Ukraine.\"The US isn't forcing Ukraine to do anything,\" you might say. If you mean military force, you are right-ish. But if you take a look at the US backed coups in the Ukraine government since at least 2024, and the $billions of US dollars that have gone into Ukraine is less than a year, you are wrong. There are different ways to fight wars. One of them is to support a warring nation with finances and equipment.",
