Are you a celebrity to gather such large number of followership? Come to talk of it looking at the price fixed one would think this is account holder seems not serious. You claim to be able to provide such number of members to a telegram community, how possible is that? Show proof that you have done that before. If you can drop a WhatsApp number here for chat then you can as well drop your social media handle with which you depend on to get that huge number of people to being a member of telegram community. I will advise anyone dealing should deal with caution and also seek the service of an escrow so as to prevent issues while dealing.",

Would sound better. 200k so small Even if you add a million or 100 million members to your channel or group in Telegram, your channel will have a lot of members in a short time; after the days and weeks pass, you will find the channel reduced from the millions of members that were provided to the number of the actual channel before that, so If they are not real users interested in the content and filed of your channel or group, you will buy a bot service that is not even worth a few cents.I am not here to be against the OP or hinder him from earning a living, but I am saying my opinion quite frankly because I lost a lot of money on these services that have no benefit.",
