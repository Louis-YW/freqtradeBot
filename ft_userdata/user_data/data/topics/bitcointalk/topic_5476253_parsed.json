Procrastinating is a danger to growth and productivity If you have the money to invest on bitcoin but not buying, it might not be procrastination. It is not procrastination if you make analyses and see the market to be in favour of the bears.But if you do not make that kind of analysis and just want to buy, or you know already that bitcoin is undervalued and the recent happening in the market is showing more signs of the bulls dominating, having naira to buy but not buying and postponing when to buy, that is procrastination. This will definitely be what will happen to some people and they will only later noticed that they are late already when the price of bitcoin has gone up significantly.",

And this time is used is as a result of making a bold step by starting from a point. It is often said that \" time waits for nobody\" the more you procatinate the more others succeed.",

Yes I think a greater part of what causes procrastination is laziness because it delays you to call for action on the process of achievement. Most people who procrastinate are more of lazy people. To confirm this, most times that we procrastinate, if we check properly, we are lazy at those points. So, it is tied together, however it is not to mean that people who have been classified as lazy are not great achievers.

It is normal to just put off work or the idea of it and just relax and enjoy the moment and it not being called procrastination or being lazy. Everything should be in balance, and as such, working so much should be complementary with taking some time off to just be lazy and relax. Afterall, success is an accumulation of effort overtime and not overnight.",

So, it is tied together, however it is not to mean that people who have been classified as lazy are not great achievers. They are, they draw their strength from zeal, passion and the need to survive.    Well, laziness is a personal attribute, an inclination and attitude. Naturally lazy people are not dissatisfied with their lifestyle choices, they just normally prefer exerting themselves the least to achieve their goals. They tend not to be perfectionists, not to be workaholics, not to need work to define their schedules and to be happy.  I think laziness occurs in the wake of failure. When you fail in a major way, your subconscious mind builds a major blockade. You’re stricken with fear. What will people think if I try to do something and fail again?    Procrastinators are usually unhappy with their inability to manage their time. They fantasize about accomplishing a lot more than they usually do, they suffer from cognitive dissonance and they tend to feel guilty about their choices. You can procrastinate about getting one chore finished because you’re really busy with another chore that has a higher priority. That’s not laziness. If you were truly lazy, you probably wouldn’t bother doing either chore, if you could get away with it.",
