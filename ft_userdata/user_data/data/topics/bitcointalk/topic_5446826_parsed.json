  "content": "QuoteThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service has taken its first formal steps in laying out rules for the taxation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), potentially exposing them to a maximum long-term capital gains tax rate of 28% if they are considered collectibles rather than the 20% that applies to other digital assets and to securities. The March 21 Notice 2023-27 says that the agency is intending to issue specific rules for NFTs, which can represent collectible assets (Artwork like the BoredApe Yacht club or Crypto Punks series) and non-collectibles (event tickets) and sometimes both.This notice marks the first formal attempt by the IRS on laying out guidelines for NFT taxation. Previously taxpayers have been applying general rules applicable to property for NFT transactions, relying on IRS Notice 2014-21 issued in 2014. This notice also comes as part of a visible if undeclared campaign by the executive branch, federal agencies, and some members of Congress against the digital-assets industry.NFT Tax TreatmentSection §408(m)(2) of the U.S. Tax Code defines a collectible as:any work of artany rug or antiqueany metal or gemany stamp or coinany alcoholic beverageany other tangible personal property specified by the secretary of the TreasuryTaxation of an NFT under current IRS practice depends on the asset it represents. The agency calls this “look-through analysis” and encourages filers to use it when determining tax consequences until the new guidance is issued. For example, a gemstone represented by an NFT would be a collectible, but the right to develop a plot of land in the metaverse would not.Collectible Vs. Non-CollectibleThe status matters for tax rates and reporting requirements. Long-term capital gains generated from NFTs classified as collectibles could be subject to a 28% tax rate, above the 20% of other capital assets. Moreover, collectible-NFT sales should be reported on Form 8949, Column (f) with code “C” to indicate to the IRS that it’s a collectible as opposed to a regular capital asset.you can read the full article here--after the US government imposed a 30% tax on the mining industry, it seems that the US government will not stop there, they planning to make new tax rules on NFT holders. it seems that this decision will have a big impact on the future of the NFT token category. For those who have NFT category tokens, are you going to sell immediately or are you going to continue to follow the development of new rules on NFTs?",

In the early days on Bitcoin, I assume they were laughing at the idea of it becoming an actual currency or being accepted to some extend as a tool to transfer value in a decentralized way.As soon as liquidity, adoption and volume increased, they had stop the laughter and move onto taxing.

There might not truly be a difference in how they could differentiate, and systemize, between an NFT and a CS:GO skin or WOW items.

Actually, some gamers are making money out of selling their skins and games(when the prices do up). They should report their income from gaming.If KYC policies were forced upon Steam(Valve corporation) I think that Steam would simply kick out of their platform all the games, that offer in-game items like skins, boxes, etc.(which can be bought and sold in different online marketplaces).Personally, I don't care about the NFT market at this point. All the hype around NFTs is gone and taxing NFT holders would be another nail in the coffin for the NFT world. It's like kicking a dead horse.",

But if not, i am guessing you can opt out from any ski trading activity because online game companies sure as hell aren't going to drive away potential customers that won't be filling kyc or buying and selling skins. They can still buy games and addons even if they are not selling them forward.It's not like every game will have mandatory marketplace. But sure, people who buy and sell skins, either nfts or not, will be most likely be filling mandatory kyc.",

Now, everyone can no longer game in peace. Almost everything requires taxes, and you need to report each asset you own. Right, I have a free arcana from the recent welcome package, where should I register this to declare ownership? ahahaha It isn't even tradeable. This new government laws imposing taxes to everything is getting nonsense. That aside, if this really requires KYC, are we on the way to become pro players? we can no longer create new accounts if we cannot verify using KYC?",

I remembered back then when gamers are very excited about the future of gaming industry as how it was depicted on the anime Sword Art Online (SAO if you know what I mean) yet now it's getting farther and farther from the reality, although we knew that it is close to impossible, doing this act against the gaming community will only leave dreams as dreams. I don't know about other companies but there're few companies who are planning to adopt NFTs such as steam to their gaming experience, and if this new law implemented world wide, how will the players able to afford those taxes? I have been a free to play gamer since the launch of DOTA 2, do we have to go to jail for being unable to pay tax from games? I should've listened to my mom back then and focused on my education.",

No matter how hard you try, if I open a new metamask today, and put all my NFT in there, nobody in the world would be able to track that down to me, that's impossible, you can use something like The onion router as well to make sure that it can't be tracked back to you and you are done.Basically it is as decentralized as you want it to be, and then when you want to cash that out, there are mixers if you want to use it, but then you could always just pay the cash if you profited and not really care about the tax in that situation, after all making x100 means you can pay the tax.",
