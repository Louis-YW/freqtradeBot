I will check these out.live betting would be cool. but the odds will drastically change while the game is happening. i have not seen like this in crypto but sure this will be fun when you decide to bet before the game start and when you see you are losing you bet again for the other team. the fun part is when the result is draw.i have no idea actually but this is what you are looking for?",
