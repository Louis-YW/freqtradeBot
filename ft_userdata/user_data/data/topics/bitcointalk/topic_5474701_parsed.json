      "body": "Yes it is possible depending on the wallet you use. This feature is called the bumping of a transaction fee. Replace by fee (RBF) is used when you send a transaction and you find out that the fee was too low to get it confirmed at your specific Time. Using the RBF method will replace your transaction with another one with a higher fee either to the first address you sent the first transaction to or to another address. This feature is not available on all wallet as such you need a wallet that supports it before you can do that. Example of this wallet is the electrum or BlueWallet",

      "body": "If your transaction has been flagged as RBF, you can replace it with a new one paying higher fee easily. To be able to do so, you should use a wallet which supports RBF. It may worth mentioning that there are many nodes that have enabled full RBF and accept the replacement transaction with a higher fee even if the original one has not been flagged as RBF.",

Actually what i'am using is https://docs.rs/bitcoin/latest/bitcoin/ but i'm open to another libs or tools if possible. What exactly do you want to achieve? The link you provided is a rust library for Bitcoin. Are you planning to develop a tool that can manually recreate transactions and change the fees?Here's another tool to rebuild a transaction if you are planning to change your address or change the transaction fees then this tool below would work. Just make sure you download the page and make a copy of this on the offline machine to sign a transaction and only broadcast the transaction on an online device.- https://coinb.in/#newTransactionOpen sourced here https://github.com/OutCast3k/coinbin/",

It's irrelevant to your question about the link that you provided above, I opened it but it's a list of Rust Bitcoin and not talking about RBF transactions or how it works.  Are you sure about this?They are talking about RBF above or ReplaceByFee.To understand it better, here's an educational link so that you will understand the whole concept of RBF.https://bitcoinops.org/en/rbf-in-the-wild/",

He can probably wait till fee goes down and he will be able to pay with original fee but there is so bad situation on mempool, fees are probably only going to rise. Quote from: BtcMaxi2090 on November 19, 2023, 07:20:05 PMso actually what i'am asking is that if it's possible to manually change the fees of a transaction that already has been sent to mempool ? Everything is possible, you can even reverse transaction with proper wallet. You can use RBF as recommended above if possible but if this option is not possible for you, then you can change fee indirectly by using Child Pays For Parent option that allows receiving address to deduct some satoshis from balance and increase fee.",

Your child transaction will be 200 vbytes, and you want the final fee to be 20 sats/vbyte. So your total transaction size will be 700 vbytes, your total fee will be 700*20 = 14,000 sats, you've already paid 5,000 sats, so your child transaction needs to pay 9,000 sats. This will work out to 45 sats/vbyte for your child.This obviously becomes more complicated when you start considering multiple unconfirmed parents, bringing in additional inputs to the child transaction, and so forth.",
