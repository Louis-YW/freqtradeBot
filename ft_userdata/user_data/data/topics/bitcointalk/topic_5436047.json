At least knowing gives you a chance to adapt and prepare. Not knowing is a worse place to be.I couldn't agree with you more. The crisis of 2008 seems to have served as a wake-up call for many. Then our rescuer came and he brought Bitcoin to us. More than a decade later, the advantages of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as savings have become clear. It's a protection against inflation, for one thing. We've seen what happens to conventional currencies over time, but Bitcoin's supply is capped, making it more resistant to inflation. It's a hedge against the instability that can occur in the global economy because it's not tied to any one nation's financial system.And let's not overlook the reality that the United States as a whole is dealing with a lot of problems as of late, problems that span the cultural and human rights spectrum and may portend a future economic downturn. And the solution they propose is to keep printing more money? Damn. Therefore, the best approach to safeguard our children against economic ruin is to safeguard ourselves and our resources.To sum up, I believe that anyone seeking insurance against the current crises in the United States and the rest of the world would be wise to keep Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Our economy is quite vulnerable.",

Many people depend on the public spending to attend their health, to study and to eat (food stamps programs), so obviously they would struggle even more. Increasing the cost of credit as much as necessary to stop the inflation could relieve the situation of those people, but I am personally not sure it would be enough.I imagine someone who does not longer receive their food stamps but manage to find cheaper prices at the grocery store. The only thing that is left out the equation is that person being able to get a job to buy their food, I assume there is when enters the private property/industry with a vacancy for them? I am not an economist, though... I still believe that cutting stuff people may be living on could be problematic...",

Bitcoin isn't the \"magic pill\", that will solve all financial problems in the world.Precisely because the dollar is the world's reserve currency, the US economy and financial system is fundamentally different from the economy and financial system of other states. The US can print astronomical amounts of dollars and transfer them to other states and the US economy practically does not suffer from this, as long as these printed dollars do not return back to the US, since in this case inflation will be inevitable. But for some reason, as an example, they are always sent to the printing press in the USA.Other states are forced to more closely and responsibly monitor the issue of their paper money, because an increase in the money supply directly affects the level of inflation in the country. But in any state, certain financial difficulties have periodically arisen and will arise, which are covered by various financial mechanisms. This should be taken into account by citizens and not accumulate the national currency. Therefore, real estate, gold, antiques and other similar material assets will always be in value.",

The inflation of the USD came well above the target rate and well above where it's been for decades. However, it's still 6.5% over 2022, with a peak of 9% in July. For the top economy of the world, this rate can seem like a lot, but it's not nearly enough what could be considered a serious enough problem to abandon fiat. In my country, when the inflation is at 7-9%, it's considered a good year, a pretty stable year. In 2022, we had 26.6% inflation, and this isn't even in the top-5 of currencies most hit by inflation because there are the classics like Zimbabwe and Venezuela, but also Turkey and Argentina with more than 80% each, Sri Lanka at 66%, Iran at 52%, and many others. What I'm leading to is that the USD is still stable enough to be considered alright both in the USA and in other countries. I'm not even sure what kind of inflation rate of top currencies like the USD (and let's not forget Chinese yuan which had only 2.1% inflation rate this year) we'd need for humanity to start abandoning fiat, but I'd say it must be over 30% because let's not forget that there are more than a dozen countries living with worse.",
