You will be enabling people to chase their loses. If you are offering money to people who have lost the money they had to gamble with that day and striking a deal to collect collateral if the loose, you are also taking from them as the casino they are gambling in.",

If you do this, gambling will only make you more addicted. And you will probably suffer greatly.  So it is always better to keep yourself under control when it comes to gambling.

Let's see how he recovers it. It is a dangerous business, in some jurisdictions illegal, as you say, and morally questionable.",

Same with the Pawnstar on the History channel. gamblers go to their office and show their valuables, it does look like a good business though. He only needs some big dumb guy like Chumlee but meaner.It was told on the news recently there are few people going to Vegas anymore. This could affect his business being a loan shark. I think more people will prefer to gamble online than go to traditional casinos. If giving out loans to online users is possible, i think that will be a better route of course collateral is still a must.",

Instead of avoiding it, you are actually putting your money in the hands of gamblers and hoping they will pay, which is quite difficult considering that most gamblers will act aggressively when they are not happy about being collected on their debts and it seems like this kind of business is not worth it.",

I've never heard of someone this way before unless you said it yourself.Obviously this is a dangerous and risky business, even though you have a concrete agreement with an agreed interest rate what if the gambler loses and runs away leaving you with nothing? Remember that emotional gamblers are always determined no matter what is in front of them so I say this is a risky business, so my advice is not to or avoid this bad idea.If you want to stop gambling then it's good if you have thought about it from now on, then why not make relevant investments in bitcoin that you yourself hold?",

He has a lot of property now that he acquired through default loan for a very low amount. This is really profitable but guilt of letting people loose more is my biggest concern on this kind of business that’s why I just play instead of lending money o addicted gamblers.Some online casino let you invest on their bankroll and do profit sharing on the profit. This kind of gambling investment is much safer for me even though the profit is small compared to lending on local gamblers.",

He was not involved in the gambling but only lend money to the gamblers at exorbitant interest rate. By the time the gambling was over everyday, he was usually the richest among all the participants. As a matter of fact, 70% of the total funds usually ended up with him. I don't know if it is the same model the big casinos use but I see a lot of similarities",

I think Freebitco.in has that feature too. This will be a hard task to do considering how many scammers are out there in the cryptocurrency industry. You might want to get some good collateral for this and it would be best if you post this in the lending section of this forum.Targetting the gambling industry means more risks because it's a fact that gamblers lose more than win so there's a chance they won't pay back on the set date especially if their salary cannot cover it all or they deplete it again by gambling more trying to double the money before they pay you.
