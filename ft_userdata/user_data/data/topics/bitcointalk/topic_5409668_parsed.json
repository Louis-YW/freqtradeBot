  "content": "For some people frugality is very difficult. because everyone's needs are different. and sometimes the cause is a balance between income and expenses. so for example when we receive a salary of $ 250 USD per month and it turns out that our expenses are $ 250 USD per month. then of course the money we receive from the salary will run out and only enough for a month.maybe these tips only apply to some people and not to some people. because I know everyone's income is different and everyone's needs are different.The following are tips that I usually do in saving my finances so that they are more effective and can be set aside for saving or investing.1. Must take note and calculate our income and expenses regularly and consistently every month or week.this is necessary in order to start saving by looking at our financial condition. and evaluate whether our spending has been done effectively or not. and measure how much we can save later.2. Buy only what is needed, and put aside the things that are only wanted but not needed. so after seeing our financial income and expenditure records every month. so from here we can start analyzing what things we have bought so far that are only based on desires and the things we buy based on needs.and from here because we want to save money then make our priority only to buy what is needed. and we reduce the things we want but don't really need.well the result of doing the first step will be useful here.sometimes people spend more money to buy the things they want regardless of whether they are really needed or not. and sometimes people prioritize wants over needs.So from here we change the concept of making needs a priority. so we can reduce expenses by not buying things we don't need.sometimes this step is the most difficult. because it requires a high level of commitment.3. make the allocation of fundsbecause we already know which things are needed each month. from here it is necessary to make an allocation of funds so that the effectiveness of the money spent is more allocated.4. Stay away from excessive lifestyle (excessive luxury) and try to live with a minimalist lifestyle. as usual you usually order fast food. well from here you try to make more of your own cooking. (this is only done by people who are not busy). because sometimes when we pay $5 dollars for a serving of ready-to-eat food for one meal. so when we spend it on fresh ingredients that we cook it can be enough for several meals. (optional)5. Make a goal (dream to be achieved) to make yourself more motivated.6. Start saving and investing the money earned from frugality.7. Pamper yourself with the specified time portion.sometimes we need entertainment and fun. so if we usually do it often, for example every week. then make it once a month. because too much frugality can also make us stressed. then entertainment is needed here. provided that the entertainment is not excessive. because if we overdo it even our money can run out overnight.simple life but still fun.maybe you can add tips from your experience all.Thank You.",

Now, it's a hard lessons for me, and it's  very hard to get out of credit card debt. Luckily I took a turn, prioritized them, and never used it again except for extremes situations.I also learn to save 10% of my monthly earning as well, put them aside and then all my bills and what's left is the money that I spend and everything. It's kinda boring routine, but hey if it is effective then you can't complain.",

Find a way how to increase your money. Because if you will just let it sit for example in banks, the interest is very small. Unless, you are putting it in a time deposit or other investment options. You may not own a business, but you can invest in stocks. But before going into this, of course you should have prior knowledge before investing in any of the companies.",

But I tell you that there is nothing will happen and grow/multiply your money in this way, investing is the most ideal when it comes to this. You can have your financial freedom and reach your goal in business or investing but yes, you have to face the risks which is one reason some people afraid. I'm not going to say that you have to unless you are willing to do so. Have to think about it several times before deciding.",

Some of them aren't exactly needed or there's a better and cheaper alternative, they're more of like a premium kind of thing imo. I also constantly DCA out of my salary so I can constantly invest so as to not let my money just, well, sit there on my bank doing nothing.

Then you can maintain a certain lifestyle and save more easily.In fact, I would say that frugality comes from a poor person's mentality. Since the creator of the thread was talking about personal finance and growth, although he then focuses on frugality, I would say that getting as high as you can in your profession, which will earn you more, considering changing profession if you see that in your current profession there are not many prospects for growth and having side hustles that give you extra income are good ways to try to earn more and not focus on frugality as much as on growth.",

In fact the living expense which used to be let’s say $250 per month two years ago is now more than 300-350 bucks this year for sure. Now, it’s impossible to cop up with this inflationary situation because of the same reason. This is why it’s more of our time and multiple income sources which can sustain good life.",

These two things are very important to think about because the body also needs healthy nutrition and the brain also needs relaxation which does not always have to think about money and money.It's true to live a simple life, but you don't have to cut too much of your life just to prioritize investments. 5% to 10% of your total budget is also a good range for you to invest as long as it is consistent with it.

      "body": "I'm a very frugal person who has his expenses sorted out weeks before receiving my salary. I started as a dude who waits tables for a part-time job while studying for my degree. My salary is way less than you, and I am still somewhat lucky since back then I'm still living on my parents' house. The bulk of my salary goes to my tuition and school expenses, and I always have $5-$10 change on that salary and promptly kept that. I intentionally avoid going out with friends even though I wanted to and perhaps that saved me a ton of money in college. Fast forward to now, I always keep in mind that I only have X amount of salary that I'll be receiving every paycheck, even though I actually am receiving way more than that. It stuck on me and just kept on saving and saving and ignored the temptation to spend a lot of money in one go even if I can do that. I still have my iPhone 4s in 2021 that I bought on 2013, and switched to an iPhone 11 that my workmate sold to me at a loss due to an emergency. If only the emails and the internet is working fine on that phone, I would still keep it and not buy the iPhone 11 my workmate offered me. Mindset is also really important if you want to grow your finances. A lot of us tend to start being frugal and stop mid way when we don't see results immediately. Just keep on saving and ignore the temptation around you. It'll reward you handsomely when the time comes.",

The best principle in saving, as OP suggested, is to think twice before buying something. Ask yourself if you really need it and if you're planning to actually use it.Personally, I ask myself if I'm going to be needing it (a tool for instance) in the 6 upcoming months and if I could possibly find other alternatives in the future, providing that I end up needing it. That way, I've managed to evade some purchases, for instance in Lidl, which often sources tools and you're caught in the marketing trick of it not being always available for sale.",
