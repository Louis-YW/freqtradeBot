It is critical that we are careful in engaging in these fraudulent projects. However, this is not brand-new to crypto. After the success of bitcoin, an unlimited number of altcoins were created as a result. But some of them, like Ethereum, are now useful. Again, there is a significant risk for investors due to the fact that the majority of altcoin projects are only doing it for profit. However, I am not entirely arguing that it is a bad idea to create crypto projects from well-functioning industries because doing so may enhance the system.",
