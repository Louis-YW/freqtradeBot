Before you can conclude about a gambling site, use them both together for weeks and gamble frequently to know that one is not better than the other in term of house hedge. Gambling should not be frequent, but do that to test and learn that online casinos have similar house hedge.",

Both dice game from Stake and Bc.game are both decentralized which means you can verify the authenticity of the result. Probably you are just feeling comfortable on BC.game compared to Stake since you experienced your big win in there but not because you are lucky on a specific casino while you are unlucky to other one makes you judge biased.You are always shilling bc.game, admit it or not. So your opinion is obviously not fair and baseless especially since your proof is just you are unlucky at Stake.",

Casinos are only places that provide games and bets for gamblers, and casinos cannot guarantee luck for their users.So it is very foolish for those who believe that certain casinos can give more advantages.",

Because I also play in stakes and bc games, but these two never thought that they were better than each other. Because every time I play here, all I think about is maybe I'll get lucky today and when I lose and my gambling capital is used up, I stop. It's just that simple what I'm doing.",

You should be able to see the provably fair result on each of your rolls on both sites. And both of them have a house edge of 1%. So, both games are alike.Declaring a game better than another one just because you had better luck on it isn't correct, because some users will have better luck on the other site. A good point of comparative would be the max multi they offer.Personally I think the best dice game out there is Just-Dice. Even if the site is not for bitcoin they allow you to win x990,000 and that multiplier is just crazy. My biggest win there was an x330,000 and takes me 2 days to hit it.",
