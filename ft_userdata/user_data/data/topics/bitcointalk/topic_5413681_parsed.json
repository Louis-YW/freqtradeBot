Soon will be added other currencies also. As for the employee's cards, you can transfer money from your main corporate account to each employee's card without incurring any transaction fees. This allows you to efficiently manage your company's finances while providing your employees with a convenient way to access the funds they need. You can also choose between physical and virtual Visa cards depending on your preferences.Best regards,Wallester Team",
