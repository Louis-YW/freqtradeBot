If you want to do a business, spend more time to prepare the business in a way it would attract people. Before you start a casino, you need to make all works as planned in a way you lack nothing. That will help your business.Advertisment is very important. Assuming you spend $1 million on a business that needs advertisment, there is nothing bad to budget $500000 to $1 million or more on advertisements. Advertisment is very important for a business to succeed, which is the reason people are going for it.Having money to pay for advertisment, it also indicates to people that you have enough money and people like something like that. Some people will check your gambling site if you advertise, some people will later would be convinced to check your gambling site if they keep noticing your advertisement.",

But we were saw many people are create their own fried chicken restaurant and they make the name close to KFC, it can be VFC, AFC, SFC, LFC, etc.Do you think VFC, AFC, SFC, LFC etc will survive and can become big business like KFC aka the old and popular one?",

All the projects you think are new to work on had already been worked on by someone else but you would want to do something similar to that nature so so your idea is not a new one and what is expected of you is to go for the materials read it to add more literature and value to your research and get some citation for reference purpose\" I remembered it as I saw this topic.You know casinos have long been in existence before yours so you will have others to contend with and you can only achieve that by rendering quality and unique services which other casinos have not. Talking about advertisement, that is a major factor or player too because advertisement is a promotional campaign to create awareness of the casino existence and features of the casino to rendering services. If you must survive as a casino, you will need to constantly be relevant in making known your presence and Services together with your constant upgrade to current casino technological innovation and development.",

You don't see people go to every new shop that opens but sells the same thing, do you?That is why they start promotional content and giveaways in order to draw out the crowds, a marketing that is necessary to kickstart a new casino. I think bringing in celebs to do some promo talk and giving out some free coins is a new mode of advertising than the older method of banner ads.Nowadays influencer marketing is also very popular since they cater to a lot of people who gamble.For the owners this is a big headache but once you get into the flow you will grow your own userbase and they will bring in more members though affiliate or word of mouth.",

Why do new online casinos struggle? A Few I knew are not doing fine and they had to put an end to their advertising campaigns. New casinos must be able to provide several promotional bonuses to attract the attention of many gamblers and they must prioritize service to all potential customers or customers who have played there.Do not forget that casinos need to try to have a good enough reputation in order to survive in this competitive gambling industry.They have many advantages and of course can have their own characteristics to provide comfortable satisfaction for every gambler. That way new casinos will quickly adapt so that they have lots of loyal customers and are able to prove that they are casinos that are worthy and can be relied on.",

A new casino will face the same issue as an established casino faced when it started.The conventional approach for promoting an online casino works but won't generate good business. I have seen some established casinos nowadays hiring influencers and promoting their products using their influence. Some new casinos might hire them initially and some might not be depending on their marketing budget. Overall patience and long-term marketing are the two ways through which a casino can stay afloat in the long run.",

Why do new online casinos struggle? A Few I knew are not doing fine and they had to put an end to their advertising campaigns. When you are starting a casino business, you don't just expect people to start using the casino once, you have to first build the reputation of the casino, which will definitely take time before you can do that, as a new casino you should try and manage the money you spend on advertisements, make sure you get your reputation first, you can be organizing review campaigns which am sure the amount you will spend on that will be kind of less, the more people are trusting your casino site, the more people are using the casino, then you can start pumping money into marketing. If you are marketing, it should be for a long period of time. You can market for just 1 months and you will be expecting the same result with a casino site that market for 1 year.",

They need to have a quality website & operation so they can also give us their quality service. Next to that should be the marketing & execution of long-term plans.",

      "body": "I would say that both approaches can work depending on the circumstances. Taking a slower approach can be good as it allows the casino to focus on building a strong foundation and ensuring that everything is running smoothly before investing heavily in advertising. This can help to create a positive reputation for the casino and attract users through word-of-mouth and organic growth.On the other hand, going all in on advertising from the launch date can be effective in generating a lot of buzz and attracting a large number of users quickly. However, this approach can also be risky as it requires a significant investment in advertising and may not be sustainable in the long run if the casino can't generate a steady flow of new players and doesn't have a solid foundation in place.",

I think it depends, for the first option, remember they say, slow and steady wins the race, if the casino is shot of funds for proper marketing, it be better they start their advertising in a very small scale, and be patient until they raise enough money, and as soon as they have the money, it is still not advisable to go all in on marketing, at this point they can begin to increase their marketing bit by bit, until they reach a level where they don't have to struggle anymore..One thing that casinos must understand is that marketing is very expensive, it doesnt matter whether in this forum or outside this forum, money must be spent, know how to go about marketing in a way it will not hurt the finances of the casino in a negative way is the best strategy..For casinos who's owners are big men with lots of money to throw around, it's not bad if they go into full marketing at the beginning of the business, as long as the money being spent on marketing wont affects finance side of the business, and casinos must realized that marketing works better when its done long term, don't just advertise for a while, then leave.",

Why do new online casinos struggle? A Few I knew are not doing fine and they had to put an end to their advertising campaigns. It depends on how much the casino has, if the casino is just starting up and does not have enough money to run a large advertisement campaign that's going to bring more customers then they should go with the slow approach. The casino should realize that they can't just remain on a football field and then expert to catch animals found only in the forest. What I'm trying to say is that if the casino is looking for good customers and those big deals then they should be ready to all out when doing their advertisement. I know that sometimes little advertisements might even be more effective than some large adverts but since it's a niche that's very competitive then they have to do something unique to catch the attention of gamblers.

      "body": "There are various reasons why New Online Casinos Struggles. Among all other reasons, the main reason is market research. Before you launch your platform, You have to do a market analysis. As a casino owner, ask yourself why you will choose a new casino over all other reputed casinos. If you cannot answer this question, you will be unlikely to survive in the market. The new Platforms should pop up with unique ideas which people have never seen before. If you have a regular thing already available on other platforms, tell me why I would choose your casino over all the reputed platforms. Incomplete Website: New Casinos launch their website before they finish their development work. I understand that developing your website never ends. But, You shouldn't enter the market with an incomplete platform where people will face issues. This will give a wrong impression to your customers. Customer Support: Customer support is the most important thing when you launch your website. Since this is a new platform, users may face various issues or not understand everything. That won't be good if your website doesn't have live and email support. Promotions:  Existing casinos already have promotions like free on Deposit. Free spins on sign-up. Cashback, Rakeback and many more. You will unlikely get users if your casino doesn't offer competitive bonuses and promos. Honesty: This is the most important thing for a casino. If your website starts doing shady things like banning users and confiscating balance without proper investigations, You won't be able to go long.",
