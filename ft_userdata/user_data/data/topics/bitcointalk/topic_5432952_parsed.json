So, you are just doing nothing but you are spamming by creating multiple topic on a same board. If you really need it you should update on the same topic instead of creating multiple topics.",

      "body": "Most lenders will not fill a loan request from a newbie unless you have collateral. I should say valid collateral such as some altcoins in most cases. Each lender has different things that they accept as collateral, but most want 125% of the amount of the loan in altcoins at a minimum. Most also do not accept accounts as collateral. You have already created 3 topics looking for different loan amounts. Started at $250, then to $30, now down to 17 and noone is going to fill any of the requests without collateral. You have also been negative tagged by 2 users. Best to give up until you get collateral.",
