  "content": "Historical Political Structure that affecting the contemporary Political structure in Nigeria. After the Berlin conference in Africa of 1884-1885, British came down to Nigeria in 1900 and Otto Von Bismark who was a Capitalist brought his company, Royal Niger Company which replaced National African Company. Bismark been a business man appointed High Commissioner Lord Lugard to pilot the affairs in the region.  And by then the region was administered separately with different governors. Lagos, Oil Rivers Protectorate, and Northern Region. In 1906, Lagos Crown Colony (Western region) and the Oil Rivers Protectorate (Southern region) were amalgamated. So the region (Nigeria) became two Protectorates. Northern protectorate and Southern protectorate and they were governed separate.In 1914, Northern protectorate and Southern protectorate were also amalgamated, the reason by Lugard was that the northern protectorate was very poor and the southern protectorate was very rich so he emerged the two to develop the north and easy administration.With the final amalgamation Nigeria became bi-regional Country. That is North and South in Politically. But in Economically there are three. North, West and East. Therefore, the presidential seat in the country is only meant for Northern and Southern regions. The North stand alone while the south is subdivided into three. South West, South East and South South. From inception of 1900 Nigerian youths have not enjoyed the country till date. Nigerian Youths Movement (Political party) in 1953 was established for the youths but it fail based on bad leadership. In 1960 Nigeria got her independent and Nigerians were very happy that the white man is not in African scene. The black man would be ruler in the corridor of power and things would be prosperous in the country but Ironically our leaders are just as their colonial masters. They use two elements to deceive the masses to win election.1. Ethnicity2. Religious1. Ethnicity. I am from your tribe please vote for me. This element does not exist. Ok it is very good I am from your tribe and I have voted for you yet your promises are not vain. Non of your promises has been done or carried out.2. Religious: Muslim and Christian. I am from your religious group vote for me. How many mosques or church they build. How many Christians and Muslims have they sponsored. Those elements do not exist in the minds of the Politicians but just to deceive the citizens to win election. No Nigerian elected leader has fulfill his or her Political promised.On Saturday, 25 February 2023, Nigeria will conduct another general election again. The average Nigerian can't have $1 a day but Nigeria Politicians are using $240888.39 to buy form for election. As it is said earlier, the structure of Nigeria Politics is North and South which is affecting the Political power shift in the country. The North and the South are the main occupants of the presidential seat and the present president is from the North and the following key aspirants/candidates are coming for the presidential seat.1. Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu (South West) All progressive Party2. Atiku Abubakar GCON (North) People Democratic Party3. Peter Gregory Obi CON( South East) Labour PartyThese three major parties, two of them are very wealthy that can influence the electoral process. Which are number 1 and 2. But the South South and the South East youths are for Peter Obi which the number 3. Number one is too old and he was involved in the killing of the #endsars protesters. Number 2 is a conservative which can't implement the demands of the youths and the number 3 is a progressivist which means he will do things for the youth. There is a possibility that Obi will accept bitcoin as a legal tender in the country. https://www.cfr.org/blog/lord-lugard-created-nigeria-104-years-ago?amphttps://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-61167341.amphttps://www.google.com/search?q=Tinibu%2C+Atiku+and+Peter+Obi&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjo04De06r4AhUV_IUKHRCPC0QQ2-cCegQIABAC&oq=Tinibu%2C+Atiku+and+Peter+Obi&gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzoHCCMQ6gIQJzoFCAAQgAQ6BggAEB4QBToGCAAQChAYOgQIABANOggIABAeEAgQDTo",

The average Nigerian can't have $1 a day but Nigeria Politicians are using $240888.39 to buy form for election. i personally see no difference betweeen the current president Muhammadu Buhari and these two old men still fighting for political position (Bola Tinubu and Atiku), they are all birds of the same feather which if mistakenly manage to see the presidential seat of the country, Nigeria will still suffer for another 8 years of misery. Because that in a country where life is hard and people are dying of hunger, we still gat some people who could afford a presidential ticket for $240,888. while Tinubu was rumured to have paid over 500 party delegates $38,542  (16million naira) each just to vote for him during the just concluded APC party primary election of which he finally emerged the winner.To be frankly, i think this is the second time all Nigerian youths need to come out in mass just like we did during the Endsars protect, because thou it was bloody, at least that was the first time in the history of Nigeria the government knew at least the youths got power, and what it takes to overcome the government, and that's why they had to send the military..it is very sad that i am pouring out all this here, because to be frankly speaking, Nigeria don't a president, because can you imagine today will be making it a complete 1 week plus some days that bandits entered Catholic church in Owo, Ondo State and kill innocents christains for no reason, and up till this day, no official statement or word of condolence from the 001 of the country Mr. president to console family of the victims,  because i know vividly well such a thing can not happen in America or France or England and within 24hours the president won't be on air..  So its just a pity, and come 2023, Nigeria must not make this same mistake again, as we shall unitedly vote Peter Obi as president of Nigeria.. we are tired of old men who has got nothing to offer us keep ruling and killing our nation",

      "body": "Sadly, most of Nigerians are still on their slumber by turning deaf ears to reality. Obi's biggest mistake is taking a VP from same region. It is an irrefutable fact that North provides the highest votes hence, they can not be ignored. Obi should have picked someone popular from the north in order to win their support. Although all hope is not lost yet but there's still more to be done. D2D campaign must be massive in the north.",
