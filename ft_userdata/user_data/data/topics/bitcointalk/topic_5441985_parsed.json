Today's world has become egalitarian, and sometimes women are better than men at jobs that were previously only available to men. We should not look down on women today. I don't know about other countries, but my country has a large number of girls participating in the crypto market.",

I find women more organized than men, so there shouldn't be any fear of them losing their keys or personal data. In my location women suffer from discrimination which affects their interest in some sectors of the economy. The cryptocurrency sector is currently dominated by male because only few women have shown interest in the sector. The society sees the sector as a male thing and women are encouraged to focus on some professions that is perceived as feminine such as teaching, nursing, house keeping, etc. But this discrimination is gradually phasing out because more parents have started knowing the importance of allowing their girl child to freely choose their profession. However, it will be wonderful to have more females in the cryptocurrency industry because women also needs financial freedom and privacy.",

I can share an interesting story/scam happened to me. A few days ago, I logged in my Facebook and tried to reach some of my friends overseas, suddenly a very young and attractive lady sent me a friend request. Out of curiosity, I accepted. Then she was beginning to \"make friends\". To be honest, I am not young and naive and I know there must be reasons these attractive girls are chasing you. One hours later, she asked for my What's App number and I gave her. Then she started chatting there on and on. Basically she was saying she got divorced and was interested in me, which is all false of course. And in the next few days, she kept sending me all crypto transaction records saying that how much she earned every day. Then I knew she was trying to seduce me to buy all altcoin for her personal gain. Well, I am not stupid and said no. And she was not upset at first because she said she would be my girlfriend but we had to make money first, bla bla bla... in the end, I laughed out and she knew I was not a fool and would not fall in her trap. Finally she said I was not suitable for her and stopped talking to me. Do you think this is an exception ? Hell no, I have met these women dozens in the past years. I guess this is another reason why so many altcoins are badmouthed in the market. Scams only depend on scammers.",

You need to pull yourself together. Not only your opinions are blatant misogyny, they doesn't make any sense either. You lie that women forget their privatekeys because of reasons you won't give. And by doing so are implying that men are somehow don't do that. And yet you want more women in cryptocurrency, and even trading, which when you do it in cexes doesn't have anything to do with privatekeys. So what's the point with your post? Just to diss women?",

Women are not forgetful as you said in this topic. When it comes to forgetfulness and carelessness, it is more of an attribute of men than women. Whenever I have an important documents, it is always the female gender that will keep it safe. The man is always bothered with so many things in his head which includes job's responsibilities and many other things and this make man to be more forgetful. The reason women are not very much in cryptocurrency trading is because they lack the ability to take risk. The men are the risk-takers and they are mostly the breadwinners. That is why you see them being more populated than women. I am not surprised that it happens in cryptocurrency because that is how it happens even in other sectors.",
