  "content": "Source: https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1405120619530Okay so these 5 pairings will be gone after December 22nd:XRP/BTCXRP/ETHXRP/BNBADA/ETHADA/USDTBut I am not sure about the other pairings though. As I have checked in Binance, currently XRP has 11 existing pairings and ADA has 10. Since my cousin has XRP holdings in his Binance account, I think it’s time for him to move his XRP holdings to another wallet because of this latest move. Correct me if I am wrong, but only certain pairings will be removed? Or XRP and ADA will be totally out of Binance?Would like to hear your thoughts about this guys. Thanks!",

You can imagine the damage this news will effect on the binance exchange, I was hopping that after the CEO issue and fine given to binance to pay, that it would be all, but to my greatest surprise it seems the SEC are looking forward to pull the exchange down. We have all seen it, binance being the world most popular exchange being tossed to and fro by the SEC, I think this news alone will make lots of investors to cut ties with binance exchange.",

Theres none mentioned about the usdt pairing. As Ive seen it, they cutting some alts pairing, and I also noticed that on p2p only usdt left for buy and sell and the alts has been removed. So your friends xrp still safe in my opinion but for advise, much better using a non custodial for storing those asset he have.",

It could also be that the new management might be trying to fix the issues that lead to the fines held on the exchange hence found XRP and ADA pairing as one so it has to be cut off but I don't think the token will be cut of totally from the exchange.Quote from: cheezcarls on December 16, 2023, 11:32:07 AM Since my cousin has XRP holdings in his Binance account, I think it’s time for him to move his XRP holdings to another wallet because of this latest move.  It's more advisable not to hold ones crypto assets on an exchange, your cousin moving his assets will be a good decision for him to a good wallet that will be more secured, he should look at list of non custodial wallets and choose one best for him.

Your not wrong either that the SEC are looking forward to pull the exchange down but maybe it's an assumption. I won't be surprised on any event that takes place on binance because if the CEO could be forced to resign then there is nothing impossible to happen.",

I believe that they must have a good reason for their action, hopefully it's for the good of their customers. My trust level for exchanges is fast dwindling because of verious issues that trusted exchanges are currently facing. It's either that they have regulatory issues with some country, or some hackers has infiltrated their system and they're shut dowMaybe the new Binance CEO is trying to reshuffle things for the good reputation of the exchange, perhaps the new measures is to make the exchange better, events in the nearest future will prove their intentions.",

I think this is only a decision from Binance only and not applicable to to other currencies or exchanges, as you've said already, the safest practice is to move ones asset away from an exchange to a non custodial wallet, this is the only safe practice i understand of for now, when anything happens to an exchange or they implement a change, you will not be affected by any chance when you're independent on them.",

Lately Binance has been in news for non so good reason and now removal of these pairs which may not benefit anyone. Are we witnessing downfall of Binance?",

Do you have a time contract?It depends: Volume: If the pair has failed to reach the volume requirement, then they'd be removed. Exchanges would only list a token if they stand to make bank of the fees if there's plenty of volume. When that volume dries up, it means no more profits for the exchangeRegulations and legal scrutiny: Most times, assets like that gets removed because the underlying asset are under the radar of the government. As such, no exchange would want to keep it listed. PS: This isn't the ADA/USDT, XRP/BTC pairs on spot but for Liquid Swap product and not the spot or derivatives pairs and contracts.",

Do you have a time contract?its probably to improve efficiency, I guess mantaining pair requires a lot of resource and if its under utilized by the community it simlpy wasting their resources after all the recent trend already gives us many coin that binance probably are gonna be listing anyway. the thing is binance kept frequently listing new trending coins and I guess right now the pair stacked up too much they need to eliminate some that they consider to be not so popular.considering that as mentioned above binance is also eliminating so many pair i guess binance just trying to keep the pairs they provided slim and instead trying to add more and more newer coin, probably they'd increase the rate of delisting of pair in the future after all they've got new CEO here, so they must be doing something different this time around.also in the announcement binance clearly stated to concentrate the liquidity, they're trying to concentrate all the money from being divided into many pairs to just into one pair.",

But honestly, to me they're too big to even think about the risks, although we've seen volatility with XRP in the past when it's been generally pushed, and if you want, you can also bring it up in advice to move assets to places you think are safer than staying on Binance.",
