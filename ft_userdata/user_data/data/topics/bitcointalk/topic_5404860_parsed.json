Of all that is contained in OP, I think these two are in existence on the forum and they do the most as, they could earn you a ban and like that you have virtually zero chance to polluting the forum any longer. The forum has so graciously patterned a system that ensures its smooth running and its users uphold a certain standard that is second to none.The ranking pipeline, the merit system, trust system, plagiarism and spam post checks amongst other policing that is done on the forum have been some formula that upholds forum integrity and encourage users to discuss only that which is sure to enrich the forum, it's law abiding users and grooming of the next generations.  Rules do the most here and they work just fine to its preservation!",

Since this is the case, some people take advantage of this medium in order to create various scams and hacks in the forum which prompted some of our users to personally report all suspicious projects and/or links to certain boards for immediate action. From my experience alone, I could say that you must really remain curious and vigilant in order to keep yourself safe from all the potential scams that constantly lurk here.",

If everyone avoids the things the OP described, it will improve the reputation of the forum. I can say that it is helpful to evaluate the forum as one of your homes.
