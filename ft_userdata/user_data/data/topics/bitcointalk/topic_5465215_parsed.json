      "body": "Maybe Binance is just trying to simplify its product range and focus on other stablecoins. It's also possible that they'll face regulatory pressure to stop supporting BUSD. The SEC is clamping down on stablecoins, and it's possible Binance is trying to avoid potential lawsuits in the future. Personally, I still feel bullish about Binance and BNB. Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange and has a strong innovation history. I believe that BNB can increase its value in the future.",

There must be a reason that the SEC are gunning for them so hard.",
