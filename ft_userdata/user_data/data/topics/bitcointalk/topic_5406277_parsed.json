A lot of people are investing in and flipping NFTs instead of trading cryptos like we are. Have any of you had luck flipping NFTs or claiming NFT drops? Are the NFTs you collect art based only or also utility based NFTs like the NFT drop from MAXX Finance? Although it can be harder to sell NFTs in some cases (because there is no liquidity), the plus side is that you don't have to worry about which exchange you can sell your airdrop on (as is the case with token drops), you just sell them on major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. I think this must be profitable for some people as you see NFT punks and apes trading for millions of dollars. What am I missing here and how do I get in on this trend?",

If you get bad NFT and no one interested with your NFT, then you expect to not get anything.",

As you've said, there's no longer liquidity on it so it means that there's no interest on it. No one shall stop you from collecting those NFTs that you're seeing but if you want to see its worth by selling it then there's no liquidity, that's nothing.",

I missed the last NFT run but I'm not going to miss the next one.I think we don't need a special board regarding NFT, because NFT itself is an Altcoin (Token other than Bitcoin). This isn't to say that NFT isn't discussed here, people here also discuss NFT related matters (although not on a regular basis).Some examples:1. Axie Infinity's NFT volume is up 205%, the project co-founder says 'nature is he New2. Meta (facebook) launches NFT display options on Facebook.3. Are NFT Tokens a Good Long Term Investments?4. Everything you need to know about NFTs tokens For special discussion about NFT, I suggest you to join Reddit, you can find a special discussion about NFT there mate @RussiaUkraineTranslation",

I don't know if the NFTs era is ending like the Axie Infinity, less player and investor which for sure the value will not reach it's ATH or their value will go much dipper.",

I missed the last NFT run but I'm not going to miss the next one.Not that long ago there was still a massive amount of interest in NFTs and people were hyped about any opportunity they could get to talk about the subject, but since then many people have lost so much money and then the bear market appeared that I think it is natural people are nowhere near as excited about them anymore.Now if you can obtain profits with NFTs then you can buy a few if you want, but I doubt many people will share the same enthusiasm, as they are not going to suddenly forget about all the money they have lost just because there are still a few people out there which can still profit from NFTs.",

Some of them also has an expiration and you need to accumulate in game money to buy a new NFT which takes off what should've been a profit. Then, it becomes a cycle. So, unless you buy an NFT that has an infinite life then you will just keep on playing without making anything or lesser than those who spend cash.",

Sometimes NFT drops brought in very good profits, but that was 2021. NFT drops on Twitter are 99% garbage, just like the whole NFT industry. OpenSea supports all this garbage and gets its interest from it, and the fact that the tokens traded on this site have no value either in terms of art or in terms of cryptocurrency, they don't really care.",

If you want to join in the hype of NFTs then better join an NFT projects that are already successful in their goal like axie infinity and more. You should also be specific on what kind of NFT are you planning to own?. To tell you honestly, I haven't heard much or read from somewhere else about NFTs and what I mostly noticed are existing NFT projects. Not sure if the hype of NFT is still the same as before. As what other people said, NFT hype has an ending the same as the ICO trend before.",

If people are being feed with the same thing for a long it won't interest them. People need different things, and such an effort is the NFT. Initially it feels tasty due to the hype, but very few lasts whereas the majority go valueless. Even now it is possible to see different NFTs around, but to own an NFT that is worthy we need to be lucky or else we should have the perfect knowledge to estimate the market for the specific NFT.",
