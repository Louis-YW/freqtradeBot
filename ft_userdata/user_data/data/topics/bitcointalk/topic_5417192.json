All IPTVs offered through the forum are in Goods -> Digital goods (Invites & Accounts) and as far as I've seen, they all accept BTC - and if you want to find more, I suggest you use the keywords IPTV - Bitcoin on any search engine.Of course, a test for at least 24 hours is mandatory, and it is best to test at the weekend, when most people are watching TV, and thus the servers are under the greatest load. From personal experience, I had a service that worked almost perfectly every day except for weekends when it was practically unusable.",

You should try yourself how it will workf for you by taking free test, most providers offer it.Free IPTV - forget it. One day it might work well, but it can stop working at any moment.

Those IPTV providers usually offer big discount if you are paying for a whole year in advance and then it ends up cheaper. I do know that it is a much bigger risk as service can stop at any time, but all people I know that have one of these illegal IPTVs are using it this way to reduce the cost.Quote from: UmerIdrees on October 18, 2022, 09:50:41 PM Or maybe i need to find an IPTV service provider in my local city, in order to get some cheap rates.Cheap and good usually don't go together. What's the point of saving 2 or 3 dollars a month if service will be bad and you won't be able to watch anything on weekends when there's a lot of traffic.",

So, I'm also not very fascinated about idea to pay such price for illegal IPTV.Most of these IPTV'S for $10 offer something like 10 000 - 15 000 channels, but you really need that much? 90% of these channels will be in language that you won't understand and most likely that you will watch just small % of these channels.I suggest you to look for more localised providers which will cost cheaper. It will have less channels, but these channels will be that you actually need. For example, now I use IPTV which costs $3, have about 2000 channels, and yeah, I'm paying in Bitcoin.",

Secondly these IPTVs contain premium channels too which themselves cost some dollars but they are included in the package already.OP, you need to focus on getting quality of the streaming IPTV with working channels as i know some IPTV services which are useless as most channels will never load and sometimes you will face buffering issues. You may get a cheap IPTV but sooner or later you will realize you are getting nothing from the provider.",

So, I'm also not very fascinated about idea to pay such price for illegal IPTV. I don't know how it is in your country, but over here if you want to watch legally top football leagues, champions league, NBA, F1 and few other sports related channels you would have to spend ~50 dollars per month as all that is scattered across several providers. So yeah, IPTV for 5-6 dollars per month (if you take yearly sub) or even $10 is not such a bad deal anymore.
