It is expected that politics be transparent, but it is not a clean game as citizens want. Some politicians are very desperate for power and are willing to do anything to make sure that they win or retain a political position. Some politicians who are unethical can go to the extent of killing for ritual purpose, killing an opposition candidate or killing a strong and influential member just to achieve their aim. Some politicians who cannot kill you physically because of how the will be the major suspect can go the extent of seeking spiritual ways to kill another opposition politician that is a threat. This is not what politics should be.",

News is everywhere about political killings and no wonder why many people want to take a seat in the position because it's not for public service but for their own personal interest and the perks that they'll get upon being elected. That's why when you ask old folks about what they think about politics, they'd say the same thing that it is dirty. Well, killing in any form is unethical and inhumane.",

      "body": "And killing outside politics is ethical?  Anyway, politics is a dirty game, has always been for centuries and will always be. So long as it involves a selected few getting more money and power over others, there will always be bloodshed. I guess this is just human animal nature. I mean, look at how the bees behave and their queen, Lions, and their prides etcIf you think there will ever be free and fair elections, then think twice. Politics is just a game of crooks and manipulators. Personally, I would wish the business of electing someone to rule over the masses ends forever.",

Fragmented groups with military power inside the country will kill as many as they can to achieve political power only until the next coup attempt toples the existing regime. Then more killing until someone comes out on top and takes over the country. No elections -- whoever has the largest gun wins.",

Almost in all the countries that have conducted elections in the last 4/5 years have not had hitch free elections and result especially for the highest position of the land, president.Politics is not ethical from the practice of how politicians have now made it to be. They plan to eliminate opponents that will stop them and this incidents of killings never stops after elections because those bad guys that were employed surreptitiously to perpetuate such evil will still have those guns used to terrorize the country, some becomes saboteurs to the same politicians to kill for, some go into blackmail and that further conflagrate the insecurity and instability the government of the day will face.",

A man in my community who people dried won political seats on several election polls but never wins on public selection, if you're good people should vote you willingly not manipulations and killing. Free and fair election required elected leaders with merit not with blood stains. What do you think?Where I come from free and fair election is a mirage. Politicians that win elections are known killers. They win elections using intimidation, thuggery, and murder. Opponents are not allowed to engage in the political process freely. Voters are threatened and forced to vote against their will and this has become the status quo. If you are not willing to engage in this dirty bloodthirsty game of politics it is better never to contest an election because you will never win. The courts are not independent because they are controlled by these thugs. So when you seek redress in court, it will turn out to be a waste of time and resources. But this condition will not last forever. Just as the Arab Spring consumed many corrupt politicians, one day the masses will say enough is enough.",

Free and fair election required elected leaders with merit not with blood stains. What do you think? You need to leave political matters to those who understand it more than you do. If there is such kind thing in your locality, that does not necessarily warrant you to bring it to the forum. There are so many things happening in the world which would be interesting for us to talk about not a mere political scene that has nothing to do here. Merely you need to understand that politics is a game of the blood and those who know how to path there ways and shed blood to get what they wanted always find there ways to the top. I don't really like to talk about this kind of politics matter.",

I am sorry that you have to live in such a place but that's what corruption does to systems. This is why am not against the transparent systems and selective individual privacy. Monitoring cash flows and full transparency is most effective way to fight corruption. And when it's happening on that level you are describing, you really need to start from the ground up building a better system. There needs to be some radical changes when killing in politics is so normal that you need to ponder if it's ethical or not.",

That is worse, to kill your family members for the position of power.",
