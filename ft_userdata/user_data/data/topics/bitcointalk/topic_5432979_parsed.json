  "content": "QuoteSeventeen days after the release of the redesigned N200, N500 and N1, 000 banknotes by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), millions of Nigerians have not physically seen or transacted business with the notes. It was learnt from some bank workers in Ojo, Ikeja and Agbara in Lagos and Ogun states that they have not been issued new notes while others said the CBN was rationing the new notes. “We don’t have any new notes and have not been dispensing any in the last one week because CBN has not issued us any since the last one was disbursed,” said an Access Bank staff member at GRA Ikeja. A Point of Sales (POS) operator in the Ogba area of Lagos, Mrs Zainab Ajibade, said she was still collecting the old notes because the new ones are hardly available. She said that banks are still issuing the old notes to them. “They are still issuing the old notes to us and in some cases if you are lucky, you can get N2, 000 worth of new notes if you are making a withdrawal of N50, 000 or N100,000 depending on availability,” she said.Source: https://dailytrust.com/17-days-after-release-scarcity-of-new-naira-notes-worries-nigerians/Buhari don play him last card on us. Since them do the new notes, I never fit see am eye. Me way dey do business never even see the money, None of my customer don fit pay me with an, na only old notes I dey see. When I go bank na still old note them dey issue give person, my fear be say the deadline way CBN give for the old notes go soon reach and yet the new notes never dey circulate. The way e dey go I dey feel say them go extend the date and we go dey use old and new notes together at once. This problem go persist till the next government come into power.",

That is the reason we are in this situation, it’s not encouraging at all even the reviews I’m reading online about the quality of the new notes is heartbreaking. This government and CBN took us backward 20 years. We will have to manage the new notes because the cost of redesigning another is too much and that money would be better spent in improving the agricultural sector. Nigerians need to start holding our leaders acccountable like we do our celebrities and media personalities if we concern ourselves with the socio and economic conditions of the country with half the energy we use in shaderoom gossips and naija twitter. We would be better off",

Some reasons been that they want everything to be cashless policy and we should stop using naira notes again.Concerning the availability of the new notes, I recently withdrew from an ATM machine of Access bank and it was dispensing all new naira notes. The same access bank today again was issuing old naira notes at the ATM machine. I’m just confused why this is so. Maybe they’ve finish disbursing the new notes given to them. Some people are still awed till today when they see the new naira notes which suppose to have been everywhere by now. We should already be seeing a great decline in the old notes availability which is not the case.",

The scarcity of the new note na wetin dey follow make am hard for people to accept am as I dun see many stories online of people rejecting the new note when use for service payment.

But knowing how the country works and how large it is, they should have had a better alternative to make the new note circulate faster. I think the CBN authorities show incompetence in their service because, since they stated the rule of the \"deadline\" for old notes as 30 January 2023, they should have begun earlier on to distribute the new note to all banks in every state and region of Nigeria, making sure that no ATM dispenses the old note, but, disappointedly, as Charles-Tim said, \"ATMs are still dispensing old cash notes till date.\"OP, talking about the scacity of the new note to worry Nigeria, I fully don't agree to it, because I see some video clips online where some people are saying they don't want the new note, and some are saying the color of the new notes can easily wash off if immersed in water. One shocking clip I saw was the new #200 note being divided into two pies and titled \"first person to tear the new #200 currency.\" Not so sure, but I think 20% of Nigeria don't yet agree to the idea of this new note, which is not in their power to decide. I did not save some of the funny videos I saw lately last year about the new naira note, even were some business owners refused to accept it for payment.https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY1EvVe6/https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY1Eqbna/https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY1ETmgh/https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMY1EKmhY/(hope such links are not forbidden in the forum, am not awear if it it, so early apologies).",

Now the new naira note that they minted are being withheld from circulation as the circulating new notes are scarce. Nigerians are really not ready for the cashless policy as the economy itself is not stable to the point of implementing such policy. It will only cause more harm than good. They are talking about cashless transaction, how will the market women that are not inclined to that level do, the commercial drivers, the village traders etc how will they cope with their various businesses. What I am hearing now is that they do not want the new note to be excess in circulation so as to encourage the cashless policy what a waste of time.
