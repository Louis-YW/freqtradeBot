  "content": "The past few months have been one helluva of a time for those of us in the cryptospace. The major thing which I believe has kept us going is trust and optimism in Bitcoin. Today, I stumbled upon a report by Morning Consult on The Crypto Report: Our Analysts on the State of Cryptocurrency. Below are some of the key findings1. Cryptocurrency is mainstreamQuoteA wide array of U.S. consumers have avidly adopted cryptocurrency over the last few years, but most of these crypto owners still view it as an asset in their portfolio rather than a form of payment2. Men, millennials and high-income households continue to drive cryptocurrency adoptionQuoteAs of May 2022, 17% of U.S. adults said they or someone in their household owns cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency ownership surged in July and December 2021, most likely due to a drop in the price of bitcoin — the most popular cryptocurrency — and surrounding media coverage as consumers “bought the dip.” But demographically, the new crypto owners looked very similar to those who already owned crypto: They were mostly high-earners, millennials and men.3. Crypto owners come from all walks of life and are disproportionately ethnically diverseQuoteCryptocurrency owners are also a more ethnically diverse group than the general population.4. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency among U.S. adultsQuoteBy a wide margin, bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency owned by U.S. adults — which is why it is often considered synonymous with the term “cryptocurrency” itself, and why fluctuations in its price cause broader market impacts. Threequarters of cryptocurrency owners say they have some bitcoin as of mid-June 2022.5. Crypto owners aren’t shunning traditional financial services — they’re power usersQuoteBut in fact, consumers who own crypto report using more financial services providers than the general population. Far from shunning traditional finance, crypto owners seem to embrace it.  6. Crypto owners use alternative financial services more than the general populationQuoteCryptocurrency owners are seeking out better ways to pay, although that is not necessarily why they own cryptocurrency7. Owners view crypto as an asset and are in it for the moneyQuoteA majority of crypto owners (66%) primarily see cryptocurrency as a way to make money rather than send it — although it should be noted that over a third of them occasionally use their cryptocurrency as a means of payment.8. Crypto purchase intention remains strong despite declining trust and challenging economic conditionsQuoteThis purchase intention is likely driven by an opportunistic desire among consumers to “buy the dip” as prices of cryptocurrencies have fallen — especially in June, when many institutional investors were forced to liquidate their leveraged positions.9. Beyond Bitcoin, crypto owners are an optimistic groupQuoteConsumer sentiment in the United States is plummeting, but cryptocurrency owners remain relatively optimistic, despite significant price volatility in bitcoin and other digital assets in recent months. However, market turmoil is leading more Americans to say that cryptocurrencies should be more heavily regulated.10. Consumer sentiment is considerably higher among crypto ownersQuoteOver the course of 2022, Morning Consult’s Index of Consumer Sentiment has hit a new series low, dropping 13.5% since mid-January. Confidence among cryptocurrency owners, however, has held up relatively better and is down only 8.1% over the same period. The ICS among cryptocurrency owners is currently 15 points percentage points higher than among all U.S. adults.11. Crypto owners are the most optimistic about their future personal financesQuoteCryptocurrency owners are more optimistic than the average U.S. consumer across all five components that make up Morning Consult’s Index of Consumer Sentiment. Morning Consult data shows that cryptocurrency owners tend to have loftier price expectations that, if they came to fruition, would likely benefit owners’ personal finances.12. Bitcoin prices falling away from owners’ expectationsQuoteCryptocurrency owners’ optimism may well prove to be misplaced as we enter what the CEO of Coinbase recently described as a “crypto winter.”13. A rising share of Americans favor heavier regulations on cryptocurrencyQuoteA market selloff, especially among so-called stablecoins, has brought calls for a bailout and prompted some policymakers to speak to the need for increased regulation of the cryptocurrency space. 14. Adoption drivers differ globallyQuoteCapital controls and extreme inflation are associated with higher levels of cryptocurrency use at the country level, but overall, gold and fiat money are still the preferred stores of value around the world. Global citizens disagree on whether governments should issue central bank digital currencies, with wealthier countries tending to be more skeptical.15. Seven of the top 10 adopter countries have some form of capital controlsQuoteNigeria leads in cryptocurrency activity, with 55% of adults in the country saying they buy or sell crypto at least once a month. On the other end of the spectrum are Japan and China at 7% and 8%, respectively. (China banned cryptocurrency trading in September 2021.) The United States falls within the bottom half of countries surveyed. Only 16% of U.S. adults say they buy or sell cryptocurrency at least monthly. Most of Western Europe and North America also fall below the median for cryptocurrency usage. In countries where we see the highest level of cryptocurrency use among the general population, we can point to some similarities: They tend to be lower-income, and seven of the top 10 have some form of foreign exchange or capital controls. Some countries, such as Turkey and Argentina, have experienced extremely high inflation in recent months, which may also be encouraging the retail use of cryptocurrency.16. Cryptocurrency use is only weakly correlated with inflation ratesQuoteThe most recent annualized inflation rate data from official sources — April or May, depending on the country — and the share of people saying they have bought or sold crypto in the last month show a positive correlation. However, outliers experiencing extremely high inflation, such as Argentina and Turkey, disproportionately drive this relationship. If we remove those countries, the correlation drops from .5 to .21, a weak relationship.17. Gold and fiat money are still the preferred stores of valueQuoteMore than any other financial instrument, gold was the top choice as a store of value, with majorities of adults in every market saying they trusted it as a way to keep wealth they would need access to within a year or two. After gold, local currency was favored in most places,though Colombians and Argentines preferred the U.S. dollar. In light of sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russians have the least faith in the U.S. dollar compared with all other options for storing wealth.18. The top reason for interest in crypto varies by countryQuoteIn China, the United States and Russia, the top ”major reason” men gave for their interest in cryptocurrency is “I believe it’smore private”. Globally, investment is the driving reason for cryptocurrency adoption19. Will central bank digital currencies pose a challenge to crypto?QuoteEven as over 90 governments pilot or scope issuing a central bank digital currency, we’re a long way from a global consensus that countries should issue their own CBDCs. Adults in several European and Asia-Pacific countries are unsure or skeptical, while Latin Americans are generally more positive. Pretty interesting isn't it? What do you think about this report? What part do you agree or disagree with?",

OK, the situation is a bit better than it was 5 years ago, but still. However, Bitcoin is incredibly new when you compare it to other fiat currencies. Plus, it's a completely new concept as well, which takes some time for adoption. I understand why companies aren't willing fully jumping on board, because there's a risk for them. Especially with the volatility. For anyone that has ever owned a business, you'll understand that constant cash flow is vital, especially when you're working on a contract basis, and you don't get paid until like after 30-90 days after you've completed the work. If you factor that in, you might wait 90 days for payment for work you've already done, and taken a hit for due to materials, and wages then it drops, and becomes a lot less than you paid out. At the moment, Bitcoin doesn't suit everyone due to the volatility. The volatility does mean it's especially attractive to speculative investors though.",

How's that even possible?You're just gonna realise that there's alot more to do,if not,then bitcoin wasn't made for everyone and the goal isn't be coming a legal tender.N/B This is inwardly my ideology,do well to make yours known with already proven facts if the are to the contrary. voice of the peopleSandra",

A rising share of Americans favor heavier regulations on cryptocurrencyQuoteA market selloff, especially among so-called stablecoins, has brought calls for a bailout and prompted some policymakers to speak to the need for increased regulation of the cryptocurrency space. I will say this very bluntly; People who only bought the currency to short it, and won't even use it to buy anything at that end, are getting burned right now in this bear market, and I couldn't care less about them. If people have to be burned to realize that crypto is not a currency and not money making tool, then so be it (I mean we don't see anybody stacking up dollars they bought for euros and saying that \"this huge stack of dollars will one day become valuable\", right??!?)Some people do it because it's their job - real traders who make a living out of it - but others who think that they can still get money for free need to learn the hard way that it's not possible; by losing their investments in bear markets.And then people want the government to make more regulations and protections from their own selves. Well sooner or later, they are slowly going to realize that the Fed staffs don't care jack about policies that normal people can very well practice themselves, as fortunately there are still some sane people left in governmental positions.So these crypto regulations will go exactly the way as the gun control regulations, the porn regulations, and the \"books in the library we don't like\" regulations: To naught. Because as these people found out, it is so much easier to just abstain from using the resource than to force the government to forcibly take it away.So don't expect anything in the way of cryptocurrency regulations to be passed through on a federal level.The only exception to this cold fact is the group of stablecoin regulations, because they came from the government itself, not from partisans (on either side) who are beating the drum because they don't like something. Everything else is just white noise in the gov-sphere.",

What part do you agree or disagree with?Actually Bitcoin is just 13years old, and as such many people finds it a bit difficult to believe to be a better store of value than gold and fiat currency which has been in existence for centuries till date, and if you could properly carry out a detail investigation you will see that those who soo much believe in gold and fiat currency as a preferable means for store of value compared to bitcoin are people within the age bracket 45yrs and above, because they have used to it and blinded to adopt to the new change and scared of its volatility, while those below the age 45yrs sees Bitcoin as a better investment and a good medium for store of value, which i just pray let it not be too late before these our fathers discover Bitcoin as a better means to store value.Quote 19. Will central bank digital currencies pose a challenge to crypto?QuoteEven as over 90 governments pilot or scope issuing a central bank digital currency, we’re a long way from a global consensus that countries should issue their own CBDCs. Adults in several European and Asia-Pacific countries are unsure or skeptical, while Latin Americans are generally more positive. central bank bank digital currencies can never pose any challenge to cryptocurrency, because they are totally birds of different features, first, cryptocurrency is universal, unique, fast means of payment, the most stress-free means of payment and reliable means of payment that surpasses regional barriers, government policies and e.t.c, which is actually what people crave for, and for that reason will make them choose crypto to central bank digital currency",

      "body": "There are too many \"news\" about bitcoin all around the world, doesn't mean that it makes sense and to be fair not all of that matter neither. I could whip out a 100 page news article based on what happened just in June of 2022, does it mean it would all be valuable? Reports are like that, they are comprehensive and kudos for not getting bored while getting all of these ready, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a bit useless and doesn't need to be this detailed.I always defended the idea that bitcoin is not something complicated, and doesn't need this much backroom information, just buy it, hold it, and profit. That's how you make money, why care about all the little things?",
