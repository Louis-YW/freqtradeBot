  "content": "I did a quick search and didn't find any mentions on the forum so far. I recently stumbled upon an article claiming that the Brave browser, which is quite common in the cryptocurrency world for its BAT tokens and the privacy benefits it offers, is supposedly installing a VPN service on your computer without informing you or getting your permission beforehand. Although this is a paid optional service, don't you think you should be asked whether you want a service running on your computer?I've also used it in the past but found no real purpose to replace the Chrome browser, which I find the most convenient of all so far. The BAT tokens aren't worth the hassle switching either.I find it a little contradictory to advertise this browser as a more secure and private option, while at the same time you're being installed with something you're potentially not interested in without your knowledge. On the one hand, I want to believe that it's not that big of a deal, but on the other, I find it unacceptable. What's your opinion about this? Do you believe it's worrying and something to be noted?Quoting services' screenshot from the articleSource: https://www.neowin.net/news/the-brave-browser-on-windows-has-also-been-installing-vpn-services-a-fix-is-in-the-works/",

      "body": "It is necessary to activate the VPN manually.Regardless, Brave has had nothing to do with privacy for a long time. If they ever had that as a virtue, they have largely become like all other end-user browsers. Even when you mention their BAT token and integration with Uphold, they are very limited and KYC is mandatory. There is no privacy at all.",

How safe would it be to use such a browser, made in Visual Studio with simple code?",

Thanks for the suggestions, although I'll stick to Chrome, as I find the Google account integrations convenient.Quote from: NotATether on November 02, 2023, 07:38:54 AMJust stick with Firefox or Chromium.

But then again, you can just use the uBlock Origin or Adguard extensions to circumvent that.Indeed, doesn't make much of a difference with Windows. The ideal would be to install Linux, but I don't find it too appealing, even though it's way more secure.Quote from: joniboini on November 02, 2023, 02:07:37 AMLooks like they did the correct PR move by promising to make the installation not mandatory and only apply to those who subscribe to their VPN service, a new update will automatically remove those services. I do agree that it is an annoying move though, it looks like they won't do anything unless someone finds it out. But yeah, they are not the best choice for privacy for a while now.That's something at least. Although it's not a mandatory service, I'm not too fond of the idea of having them install the service without your permission, especially since I wasn't interested in it in the first place.Quote from: shield132 on November 02, 2023, 07:51:26 AMChrome is the worst browser to use if you care about privacy.

Chrome, Edge, Opera, Safari, Yandex Browser and others should be avoided and Brave is in this list too because of their shady behaviour in past.I see, it certainly isn't and if I'm not mistaken, it's a burden for the computer as well. It uses a lot more ram than the Brave browser, which I had tried a couple of months ago. Edge is certainly off the list as well, since it's a Windows - Microsoft applications, the rest are completely indifferent to me, as I've never bothered to use them.Quote from: shield132 on November 02, 2023, 07:51:26 AMI think this is not a big deal.

I also prefered Firefox in the past, but now with Android phones and Google integrations, Chrome has settled for me.",
