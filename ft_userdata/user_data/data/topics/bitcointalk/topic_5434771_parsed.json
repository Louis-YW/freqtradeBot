So far its having a dead cat bounce and is still close to 40% down from the pre-FTX-crash price. I don't think that this \"rally\" is enough to make them solvent again especially that whole solana marketcap is lesser than FTX liabilities and FTX was insolvent when solana was above 30$ (its 22$ now)@OP - correlation does not imply causation",

The truth is that bitcoin is still immature and cannot yet be compared to gold. In my opinion, the crypto and bitcoin market is still a pump and dump market, a money game, for us to take each other's money. Although it has evolved over the years, it cannot be said that it has matured. There is no such thing as a safe-haven, or inflation-resistant asset with a market capitalization of less than $500 billion. Bitcoin has all that potential, but it's not yet time to say it's working. It's too early to say that, maybe we need a few more bear seasons.",

It's too early to say that, maybe we need a few more bear seasons.What would fundamentally change if Bitcoin reaches 500B marketcap? It's only 100B higher than where it is now. The problem with Bitcoin's price is that it's hard to make an educated guess about how much it should be, because it's not based on anything. It's not a stock or a bond, it's not a national currency, it's not a commodity (it's not being consumed). It's most similar to gold, because gold's value is way higher than the value of gold's use in industry and jewelry, and yet gold is far less volatile and actually exhibits anti-inflation and safe haven properties, unlike Bitcoin.",

Imagine if the price of gold changed by 20% because some gold exchange pulled a scam. And yet people say that Bitcoin is gold's rival, that it is a better store of value.People who say Bitcoin is gold's rival and a better store of value prolly do not understand the both assets. Gold is a safe-haven asset because it holds its value for a very long time without spontaneous movements, thus for people that aren't looking for too much ROI with relatively very small risk, Gold is their choice. But Bitcoin is much more volatile, but prolly less volatile than it was a couple of years ago, and in the short term has an uncertain movement in its price, but long term the ROI is way larger for its investors than those who chose gold, thus i can say Bitcoin investment is prolly too risky/not for short term investors, but if one is a long term investor, Bitcoin is for them.Having said that, we have to consider the fact that most of these news as regards why Bitcoin rose or fell are more often than not speculations, Bitcoin isn't influenced by a single event any longer, but a combination of numerous events, which altogether influences the price of Bitcoin. This btw isn't changing anytime soon because weaker hands will always rapidly sell off when there's news and buy back when there's an appreciation in price. Mass adoption might bring the well needed maturity to the Bitcoin network.",

There's the recovered money again by FTX but the thing is, after that recovery, I hope that most people who still got funds there and if they're allowed to withdraw it, they should take time and withdraw it as soon as possible.And whoever are the people behind FTX's new management then they really are helping and making the situation better mostly for those victims that have already lost hope on it.

Always the richest, most important ones first, like any other insolvency claim, before democratising the losses among the retail majority.You want to make the big wallets whole first so they can reinvest in you when you put out other ventures (be on the lookout for FTX-shadowed projects launching this year and next).",

But I didn't know CZ involvement was just to trigger FTX crash, I don't want to speculate on this.",

I'd say bitcoin is a replacement for all of the above and then some, platinum, diamond, etc.It can act as a asset, money, currency, payment, savings, stock, etc along with representing an asset such as gold just like the stock market does. Anything the stock market is doing is and can be done through crypto instead.Any crypto can be used in the way you decide it is for, and not everyone uses all these features of crypto.I like how I can generate unlimited wallets for free offline for any crypto. I can't generate unlimited bank accounts or any other sort of account without it being blocked/filtered/etc. The amount of CPU/power that is wasted in just account keeping for anything is insane. Crypto wins big in this case. That makes governments nervous and always has.  The dates match when bitcoin took big dips for the failures of terra, celsius and FTX.",
