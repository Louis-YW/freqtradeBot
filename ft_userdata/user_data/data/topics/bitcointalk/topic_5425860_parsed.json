Bitcoin is the most reliable cryptocurrency there is, altcoins can be more profitable in short term but you don’t want to hodl alts for long cause they can crash anytime. 3. If you want to hodl bitcoin for long term, then the best time to buy is when the price is low and weak hands are selling.4. Use decentralized exchanges/ p2p to make bitcoin purchases.5. Lastly, do not hodl in centralized exchanges. Where you store your bitcoin is very important since you’re responsible for the safety of your coins. Any wallet you decide to use should have its private keys like we say “Not your keys Not your coins”.  Read General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?",

You have to remove that mindset that you have seen bitcoin change the lives of many people around you and face what can happen that not everybody has been lucky with bitcoin. Many have lost out in their investment in bitcoin because of panic. They sold below the price they bought it because of fear of more crash. To those ones bitcoin will not be seen as something good. Do not be like those ones. Invest and wait for profit to come to you on long term.",

But dont assume any profits with certainty since you are also taking a huge risk by purchasing a volatile asset that could go up and down. But we all knew that theres no other way for such investment but to go up right?Most people are easily get scared when they see negative on their portfolio but I say thats normal.

Many people who have acquired only a few inches of knowledge about bitcoin without knowing the whole history of its existence and have invested in it are disappointed today. I am reading that a CNBC survey shows a sharp drop in confidence in bitcoin. But if you look at all the ups and downs of Bitcoin, history shows that, in the long run, it has always regained its good reputation.Therefore, OP, knowing all the ins and outs of bitcoin as the foundation of your future should be a prerogative.",

      "body": "Welcome to the world of crypto, very happy to have you here. As someone who has been in the crypto world for several years, I have some advice for you that might be able to help you survive and maximize your profits in this market;- The first thing I did when I entered this world was find out about crypto terms and popular tokens that are worth investing in through CMC.- Invest in popular coins first, like Bitcoin or Ethereum or BNB.- Don't be FOMO and invest in coins that you are familiar with. If you want to buy a coin through an ICO, IDO, or pre-sale, make sure you first find out the background of the coin and don't invest too much.- Don't put your investment in just one type of coin and always use a crypto wallet like Metamask or Safepal to store your coins.- Crypto is not a place for you to get rich quick, if you still think that way you should stop now. You can earn money on crypto if you really take advantage of the various opportunities that exist, because there are many things that can be used and it will bring you money.- Increase interaction with the community and socialize more often. It will give you a lot of knowledge and experience.- Finally, if you want to invest in crypto, you should invest at your own risk. Nobody cares if you lose money here or the value of your assets falls. The bottom line is what you do will be your own responsibility.I hope you can understand what I said above. Good luck.",

But as a beginner you may not have much knowledge with the crypto market, while hodling your bitcoin you may experience some bear market, it shouldn't discourage you about your investment  or make you panic, the bear market comes and go. You need to make your own research about bitcoin and the crypto market so that you can make good decisions to be sure if you are prepared to invest.  Don't take a rush to invest,  get some knowledge first.",

Bitcoin has made so many people rich and many more are still coming up, but in addition, the gateway is already open for people to buy and accumulate as much as they can.

However, the market is standing on a thin line, and it's likely to crash even further throughout 2023. The dollar-cost averaging (DCA) technique is useful in reducing any associated risk in such cases. This forum is generally a decent source of information; however, you'll see plenty of prediction threads in which everyone will be simply expressing their own personal opinion, which is usually not based on any statistics or valid sources, and even if it is, there are no guarantees. To sum up, if you can afford to buy bitcoin, do it little by little and try to hold them till the next bull market.",
