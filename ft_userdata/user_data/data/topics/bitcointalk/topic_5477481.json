      "body": "As already mentioned, bitcoinjs-lib is the most common library that is used in the Bitcoin community coz it offers a huge range of functionalities. You can also use bitcoin-address-validation library which might suit even better. It is specifically dsigned for validating Bitcoin addresses and support almost every address types aswell.This might be easier to use due the focus of validating Bitcoin addresses. I'm not saying that bitcoinjs-lib is a bad choice. Quite the opposite and as already mentioned: its a library that covers a broad spectrum of Bitcoin functionalities, making it suitable for complex applications that require extensive Bitcoin transaction handling, wallet management and a few more features. I just wanted to list an alternative.",

Nowadays, searching for libraries on Github works very well (back then it was more of a gamble to find something you were actually looking for, kind of like using Microsoft's Bing  ). Here is the result: https://github.com/search?q=bitcoin+javascript&type=repositoriesThere would also be the library in the search result that I had already used myself: bitcoind-rpcHowever, the last commit was almost 2 years ago.",
