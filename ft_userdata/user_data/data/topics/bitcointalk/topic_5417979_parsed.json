His opinion does not mean much here.2- \"I cannot see any increase in salaries\" - wrong3- \"I think that the problem is global - and not specific to my country\" - sure its global. Its hard to find a country that is not affected4- \"The crypto market is not going to recover if the economic situation is not going to be reversed\" The market bottom is always weeks before the worst days right when there is the most bad news and it looks like its only going to be worse. So its possible that we already bottomed even though the macro looks terrible.5- Its hard for assets to continue to go down if thing that they are evaluated in (fiats) is going down at a rate of 10% annually.",

It is part of the natural boom and bust economic cycle of market economies - there is no getting away from it based on historical evidence. In the boom times people borrow a lot, spend a lot and the times are wild. In the bust times, people are paying back debt until the banks generally get in a place where they are more comfortable lending again and the good times pick up cautiously again. Ignoring this or trying to tame it is a task of futility, so better to just take advantage of opportunities whenever they appear.",

It’s important to expect the worst case scenario and play safe just not be caught on potential more price slippage. I don’t see harm on Musk statement assumption since he is just doing a projection based on the current market situation. US can’t control inflation despite there plan to increase the value of dollar. Slowing down on investment is the best thing to do if you have doubts or uncertain on the market. You will not lose if you didn’t ride on the market gain but you will lose if you invest recklessly on uncertain market. I will choose the abstaining just to make sure I have enough funds to cover my personal expenses just incase recession last longer as expected.",

I thought it was possible to postpone it and some events could bring it upon humanity sooner, but that it's just how the current global economy functions. Am I wrong about this? If not, then why are people acting like the recession is outrageous or that it's due to the war? There was also Covid, and that was bound to have a negative effect. Even prior to Covid, there were speculations that the recession should hit around 2020. It's 2022, and it's finally here. It's bad and probably just getting started, and yeah, it'll take a few years to get out of it, but I don't see it per se as surprising.",

Here Musk is absolutely right, although recently he sometimes surprises with his statements But back to the problems. If the financial and economic crisis a decade ago was triggered by \"soap bubbles\" and overvalued areas of the economy, today's problem is much more complicated. Today's problem concerns more significant areas:- a total violation of world legislation, obligations, with the complete impotence of all international institutions that should have dealt with such issues.- corruption, venality, cowardice,  betrayal in the highest echelons of politicians in many countries, which has surfaced now, but was founded decades ago. Although even now many are sold faster than \"port prostitutes\".- monopolization of the world's leading economies, energy supplies from inadequate suppliers. Which leads to a global change in hydrocarbon supply patterns. As well as long-term problems in the industrial sector.- the coincidence of several global problems, in a short time. Covid and then the global terrorist war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine, and the economic war of Russia against the EU.- Now we will still be watching the squeals and tantrums of the two \"fraternal terrorist regimes\" - Russia and Iran, due to the expected investigation into the supply of weapons to the \"second most powerful army in the world\" from Iran, which automatically becomes an accomplice in this crime.Therefore, most likely, the world will finish off the problems caused by all of the above for another 3-5 years (optimistic forecast)",

The covid pandemic and war happened so suddenly, these two things caused the economy to crash and fall into crisis, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates to control inflation. Raising interest rates will bring inflation down but I doubt it will not stabilize if the war doesn't end but the task of the Fed will only be to raise rates because they have no better solution.",

And now we're at a time where the economy is having a lot of trouble, war is going on in different areas, but honestly, I think it's the individual who's being affected and adapting to the change every day.

If you look historical at the global data for the last 40 years you can see a lot of the crisis happening on average 8-10 years apart. In the 1980s you had the Savings and Loan Crisis in the United States where a lot of small banks had too many bad loans. Then in the 1990s you had the Asian debt crisis again affecting the global financial system and resulting in negative economic growth around the world. Then in the 2000s you had the DotCom bubble crushing Tech stocks globally again. In 2008 you had the subprime mortgage crisis and then recently you had European sovereign crisis, corona crisis and now the high inflation. It seems that recently we had more problems than in the past, this is likely due to the long period of time with low interest. For more than 10 years we have interest rates close to 0%, it was just a matter of time for inflation to pick up again.",
