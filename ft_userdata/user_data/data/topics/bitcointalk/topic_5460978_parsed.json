Just thought of giving you a heads-up with the correct board for these sorts of posts. Also, it's crazy how the rich get richer by joining these projects, investing in their protocol by depositing liquidity from multiple accounts and then dumping it on the new users who believe this will make their money go 100x. Once people understand the actual reality of these projects, it all will stop.",

Anyways the thread you created is really good but it was just posted in wrong board so I guess you cannot get engagement in this thread and many will just suggest to move this thread to proper board.",

Can you link to the tweet that confirms something? Their telegram pinned message says that there's no airdrop, snapshot or token coming. And if someone keeps hinting about it they will get banned for misleading info. So i am not sure if there's anything worth speculate. Why would i believe speculators if devs are denying everything so hard.I had to google LayerZero because i never heard about it before, i thought you were talking about Layer 0 protocol as an infrastructure.

It doesnt confirm anything but the fact that they are talking about sybil. If you are an airdrop hunter and they sounded like that. Pretty sure its not just a hint but a clear fact they are doing an airdrop and no need for confirmation since that would blow out of proportions.",

If you do small transaction you might not qualify. You also can’t send funds back and forth between accounts. You should also be active from time to time. Don’t just do one transaction and stop. You also should use other networks with your address. Same with the zksync airdrop. Rules for qualifying will be similar.",
