  "content": "Nigeria is located in the western part of Africa with a population of more than 216 million in August 2022. Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa and is frequently referred to as the \"giant of Africa\" with abundant mineral riches. In the middle of all of this, Nigeria has been called one of the most corrupt nations in Africa.Corruption has to do with the misuse of public funds or fraudulent behavior by individuals in positions of authority. After a BBC Africa Eye investigation, the pension board in Cross River state, in the country's south-south area, was publicly uncovered in early 2022. In order to transfer funds to themselves and support their luxurious lifestyles, the authorities withheld retired workers' pensions and declared them deceased. Even after spending many years in retirement, those who can access their money still need to pay bribes to do so. The majority of these retirees are aged and have been borrowing money for survival. Many of them are even unable to pay for adequate healthcare for themselves. These does not only happen in Cross River state but it has become a tradition in all part of Nigeria. Nigeria has frequently been listed as one of the most corrupt nations in the world. According to statistics, Nigeria commits 117 million bribes annually, or 1.1 bribes for every adult. Despite having a skilled labor population and a wealth of mineral resources, Nigeria's economic development is unfortunately being threatened by corruption. Most young people want to leave the country in pursuit of a place with greener pastures and independence from the government..Onitsha, Anambra StateThe image above speaks much about the decades-long poor infrastructural development in Nigeria. Onitsha is a city in southeastern state-Anambra State, Nigeria. Due to the country's low economic growth, which is a result of corruption, this road has only become worse and hasn't changed. In many parts of the nation, little has changed in recent years. Major Causes of Corruption In Nigeria:1. Greed 2. Poverty3. Acceptance of corruption by the populace4. Weak government institutions 5. Poor Education, illiteracy.6. Ostentatious lifestyle 7. Customs8. Lack of freedom of press9. Lack of selflessness and patriotism 10. Another causes of corruption in Nigeria is tribalism etc. Nigeria perception index according to CPISource: (https://www.transparency.org)The corruption perception index for Nigeria is shown in the photos above. Nigeria has consistently ranked 20–30 on the list of the world's most corrupt countries.Not only Nigeria is affected by corruption but other countries beyond African continent are also facing corruption. Top most corrupt countries in the world according to Corruption Perception Index (CPI):1. Somalia 2. South Sudan 3. Syria 4. Yemen 5. Venezuela 6. Afghanistan 7. Equatorial Guinea 8. Libya 9. North Korea 10. The Democratic Republic of CongoThe image above illustrates the world perception index in 2021 (https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021)The countries most impacted by this corruption epidemic are those in Africa. In conclusion, it can be said that corruption is an international problem that requires a team effort to solve. It is necessary to regulate corruption for economic sustainability because its effects have been so catastrophic in many regions of the world. Strong anti-corruption organizations and a real commitment to transparency in both the public and commercial sectors are required to combat corruption worldwide.",

Most things comes as a joke and yet, we are in the hit of it all. Governments and citizens alike. We ought to look at ourselves and right our wrongs while transferring that to the situations we experience in our society while we step out of our homes. The issues we have today started from one man and at some point, the change we now seek could as well start with one man and at some point.It's time to choose yet another leader to lead the people to where God knows what end. It is my wish that Nigerians would take this exercise serious, have a little faith in the system and do what needs be done in ensuring coordination and zero malpractice at the pools. Let's begin to get it right.",

Corruption is been passed on from generation to generation and the truth about it is that nobody is will to change,as they take corruption to be smartness.    For example a policeman will stop your and ask you about your car papers,if your papers are complete,he asks about your driver's license,when you provide it,he will ask you to on your car inner light to see if it is working. For crying out loud what is the policeman business with your inner light at day time. All he is looking for is a way to extort the car owner.    Nigeria can stop or fight corruption by government orientating the citizens about the implications of corruption to the society and country at large,the reason of this is to change the citizens and the young ones mindscept towards corruption.    Secondly,there should be no Godfatherism in politics,so that the right leaders who have the citizens in mind can win elections without the tribunal. Corruption is like HIV when not treated turns to AIDS after some years and gradually kills the whole body cells. Corruption brings a country economy down",

I won't blame the leaders solely because Nigerian citizens has played a role in it. During election many are fond of selling their vote even for less than a dollar. Nigeria as a nation can only be save during the elections, corruption is a sickness that starts when any individual sells their vote and nigeria as a nation would keep suffering in it until the right person is voted in based on their competence and capabilities.",

The root of corruption is greed for position and money. These corrupt politicians want positions not because they are concerned with their citizens but rather want to take power and wealth. As for me, doing a revolution is the only thing left to kick corrupt politicians out though ordinary people will suffer again. They really need to stand up for their rights or else they will suffer worse in the future.",

I am not telling this from stories from books or newspapers. I myself live in a country that until 2013 was simply destroyed by corruption. Corruption has become power. The courts, the prosecutor's office, the police, law enforcement agencies and ministries, right up to the parliament and the president - everything has grown through and through with corruption. Only a global change of power, legislative, executive power, bringing corrupt officials of any size to justice will give a result. It is difficult for me now to cite my own country as an example of the fight against corruption, the process that had begun was interrupted by a terrorist attack by a neighboring country. By the way, that neighboring country is scared to death of the fight against corruption and totalitarian power, this is one of the reasons why she wants to destroy my country - so that there is no example of how to effectively deal with totalitarian thieves' governments! By the way, this country has the largest reserves of natural resources, a huge territory, and half of the population, according to official figures, lives in total poverty ...Study the example of Singapore - a perfect example of how one of the most totally corrupt countries has become the central economy of Southeast Asia! And be sure to visit Singapore - you will see how amazing achievements can be achieved without resources and vast territories!",

It takes radical overhauls to change and create more transparent systems, but you will also be fighting against the ingrained interests who have a lot of money and power to try to prevent any changes to systems that benefit them. Politicians are also sadly playing the short game, where they can often only think four or five years ahead, while the systems you are trying to change have evolved over generations. When there is a lot of poverty, as you state, then democracy can be bought for very cheap and this undermines the whole system - it's definitely a catch-22 system.",
