Had it been the creator's identity revealed, or in one way or another they know the people behind it, I believe we won't have gotten to this level that we are in the crypto space. Since Government has been looking for means to control bitcoin, all they could have done is go after the entity behind the technology and it will be a done deal.",

While he disappears he also didn't sell anything from his genesis wallet.Satoshi is also aware that creating a new currency that no one can control threatens the Dollar. Muammar Gaddafi paid in full when he tried to move away from Petrodollar. If a powerful man like Gaddafi can be stripped of his position to death because of it, Satoshi is no match if his identity is revealed.",

What reason do you think might have really caused his action?-  In the 12 years of bitcoin's existence, no one knows what was the reason why Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. Everything is just speculation. And there are even times when they have called Satoshi Nakamoto but it was not proven in the end either. Anyway, despite everything, the majority accepted that what Nakamoto did was a big help in general in terms of Financial solutions around the world.   And we have seen the impact it has had in different parts of the world, most of the countries have even accepted and made this 2nd option online payment in their business companies, apart from that it is not it is undeniable that it also helps the country's economy.",

It could be because he thought what he wanted to create has been created and no point of staying again as he wanted to make bitcoin to be for the public and not centralized to a certain degree. Because Satoshi remain anonymous is the reason some other people believe bitcoin is better and by that way, we can assume that anyone that contribute to bitcoin progress are also Satoshi.",

Satoshi does not want bitcoin to depend on it and this will guarantee complete decentralization.Regardless of the reason, satoshi's decision was the right one to leave the project during the early development phase. I can't imagine satoshi leaving the project after bitcoin has reached the high level of confidence it is today.",

Security and Privacy are the closest factor that we can assume for his reason to bow out on crypto scene because you can not enjoy your life if he was known to the public as creator since he wants a privacy at the first place when he invented Bitcoin.",

In order for everything to be perfect and not to have any problems later, satoshi chose to hide forever. Maybe he foresaw this and can now see bitcoins getting bigger and bigger and obviously a lot of governments don't like this, if he wasn't anonymous it would be big trouble for him now.

There must be few people who worked with them right? Few colleagues, may be friends or relatives who at least sometime talked about it over coffee or something?

His escape and hidden identity is actually very wise move because he could live peacefully without being bothered by anyone. Bitcoin's reputation and trust rate wouldn't be affected as well. That's just my view but he is the only one who knows his reason for bowing out of crypto what he did was a brilliant exit. His anonymity has a good impact and benefits Bitcoin as well as his life.",
