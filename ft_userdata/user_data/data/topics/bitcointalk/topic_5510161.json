  "content": "I know the government has recognized crypto for a while now, but this news shows that sooner or later, cases like these will become more common. For a lawyer or judge to make the right decision, they should first educate themselves about crypto. The fact that they're already studying it is a good step, as it will help regulators and other professionals better understand Bitcoin.Quote from: https://x.com/ibcgroupio/status/1830366048807272889CANADIAN COURT ORDERS $1.2M REPAYMENT IN BITCOIN LOAN CASEA court in British Columbia has ruled that Daniel Tambosso must repay Hung Nguyen $1.2 million for a loan of 22 bitcoins provided in 2021.Nguyen, a real estate agent, argued that the loan represented his life savings, and Daniel's failure to repay has caused severe financial and mental distress.Daniel claimed he was a victim of a Ponzi scheme and had borrowed the bitcoins to recover misappropriated funds linked to Satoshi Nakamoto.The judge rejected this defense, citing basic contract law, and ordered Daniel to repay the loan.",

      "body": "Well bitcoin's notoriety started with Ponzi schemes and MLM, bitcoin itself being called a ponzi scheme in a recurring thread when I first visited the forum - no surprise that bitcoin is getting popular with being the mode of payment in ponzi schemes.Few noteworthy things:1. Its a court in Canada, a developed country. I cant begin to imagine when this will be coming to developing countries where politicians speak bad in the name of crypto without understanding even a thing about it. Judges are better though, they are quick learners, but politicians run the country.2. This case is about resolution of a loan default. This is a good step for the future of bitcoin based lending.3. Once again the reason for taking the loan was to invest in something risky. This type of mentality needs to change - because I care too much about my own money, I invest using a loan - heck, when you take a loan, you a signing a contract law, you are responsible for that money's loss.",

He borrowed 18 BTC then the next day he borrowed 4 more to make it 22 BTC.Daniel Tambosso invested it and he fall for a scam that's why he wasn't able to pay Mr. Nguyen in the next 48 hours (that was the agreement). I don't think this kind of news though will bring Bitcoin into mainstream, on the contrary, this is a very negative news in my opinion.",

But as said, it's for good case, and in reality bad case like the deal between Tambosso and Mr. Hung Nguyen, is bad and it's like nightmare for the lender.Honestly if I was him, I would not give that loan. 22 BTC is huge fortune and the lender in this case took very big risk.There are about 153,000 addresses that hold 10+ BTC.https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/addresses-greater-than-10-btc/",

This is too good to be true and as a cryptocurrency investor since 2017, how did Mr. Hung Nguyen fall to this scam deal?A more interesting step but in Mr. Hung Nguyen's side, it's stupid. He believed in a screenshot that should never be a proof in cryptocurrency. If he needs proof, he will ask Daniel to sign a Bitcoin message with private key.QuoteSo did a \"screenshot of a blockchain wallet (presumably that of Mr. Tambosso) showing a balance in excess of $5.2 billion in bitcoin.\"Nguyen agreed to provide a short-term loan, and the two men signed a first contract for 18 bitcoins.",
