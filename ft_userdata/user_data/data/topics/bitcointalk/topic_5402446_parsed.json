After checking the charts of coinmarketcap, I see that the maximum price of this coin was at $1.03. Now it is trading at a price of $0.027. Thus, the Chain coin lost 98% of its value from ATH.",

I'd say that expect the worst thing to happen during this crash and we don't know how long it will be there.Just as what we've been doing and got used to, we better follow what just the market is showing. If we're on a bear market, then be it and accept that it will take a long time before it finally recovers if your standard and price ceiling is the one on its ATH for all of the coins that you're holding. And that's gonna require us a lot of tolerance.",

So we speak about the next two years that will be crazy when it comes to fluctuations, where prices tend to have downtrends more than uptrends!

A question which is something that cant really be answered by anyone on this market because this would be a never ending kind of scenario on this unpredictable market where everything could really crash.Expect the unexpected and this should really be in your mind whenever you do make yourself get involved with crypto space and come to think that even traditional markets are experiencing such declines.So there's no exception to this one but rather instead of panicking out then it would be nice if you would seeing these chances for you to get cheaper coins.",

For those who were saying before that they missed out the opportunity.Now, is a good time to reflect and contemplate on what to do with this market situation.Because if you think you are presented this another great opportunity to get in, why not start collecting some satoshis and other valuable alts?No one can exactly predict if we will continuously go down or up, but you can always follow your instincts.Anyone can make their list of why we are crashing today, but what are you doing to improve your own portfolio?",

What will the next? and How long do you think it will take for the market to recover? This is the era of the Bearish market and I think that this crash will not end here. There is still a possibility to crash again until it reaches the dipping price. Although no one will know how much exactly the dip will be in this bearish season. This is likely still in the cycle of the bearish-bullish market, so no need to panic. We have been experiencing this several times. Moreover in 2018, the market was also the same, like this. I also still hold several coins that have been dropping very significantly, none to do right now besides waiting for the next bullish era. Yeah, I believe that after this bearish market, the bullish will come again. But we must be still very patient because the bullish market will not probably come in several months later, but years. Commonly it will be starting after the Bitcoin halving if we see the graphic so far. But once more, this is a crypto market where there may be some certain possibilities and surprises.",

No one knows what's next per se, but I'm pretty sure that this is just the beginning, and we're still gonna have to a wait a bit longer before the crash ends, hopefully I'm wrong tho. Since this is not the first time we're facing market crash this big, so I guess it's no surprise for those who have experienced it before. At the moment bitcoin price is already reached $21k, seems like it's still going down and alts likely will also suffer more from the crash which already happened and we're seeing red everywhere. At least, try not to panic, downtrend like this is bound happen sooner or later and not only once or twice it's going to happen a lot more in the future.",
