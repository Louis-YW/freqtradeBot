  "content": "Hello guys. Another project has announced their airdrops. Here is their tweet regarding the allocation.https://twitter.com/namada/status/1732787033423462743?t=G9I1IpH4Igk6zj7ZG_GsLg&s=19Categories has been divided with a lot of parameters.- 15.6% @badkidsart holders- 10.6% @cosmos stakers- 21.6% @gitcoin donators ( I think 12 to 17 rounds) - 10.2% @osmosiszone stakers- 8.10% @github contributors- 20.6% Namada's Trusted Setup builders. You could simply check with the site but read first the blog they explained the details. Dont miss this as of this writing I think 17days left to claim it. Somehow it reminds me of TIA as the process is exactly the same.",
