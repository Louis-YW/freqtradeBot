Millennial president Nayib Bukele is seeking $1 billion for the crypto-backed bond, though instead of financing he's received skepticism from credit agencies and the International Monetary Fund. The IMF previously criticized Bukele's call to make bitcoin legal tender, and has called for the government to reconsider its reliance on the cryptocurrency. Now, El Salvador's conventional bonds due in 2032 yield 24%, a steep level that suggests markets perceive the debt to be high risk and are bracing for a default. Bloomberg data shows that yields on El Salvador's conventional bonds have fallen further than every other nation except those of war-torn Ukraine. When Bukele first debuted his plan for bitcoin bonds in November, the nation's dollar debt hit an all-time low, Bloomberg reported. In February, Fitch Ratings slashed El Salvador's rating to CCC, pointing to its increased dependence on short-term debt and limited financing sources. However, El Salvador's finance minister recently said there's \"zero risk\" of a default. I am not very fond of believing politicians in general, and even less so when they deny something. The fact is that if the bond has failed to attract investors, if the price does not take off, and we even enter a bear market, if adoption there does not take off either... I do not know, I do not see a bright future in the short term, although I think Bitcoin is a good bet for the long term for the country if it manages to hold on through hard times.What do you think?",

They want stability, and they won't find it in El Salvador. Moreover, the recent fall of bitcoin to almost $30k is bringing El Salvador closer to collapse.",

The actual cost was 11-15 billion, and half of that billion would go into purchasing bitcoin. Now, if you don't have a brain-eating bacteria affecting you, why would you sell your coins, and buy Salvador bonds so that they can use them to buy bitcoins?- let's break away from the US tyranny, after calling Biden a moron for saying Russia will invade Ukraine, lol, he also forgot another thing, that in June he received the aid of 115 million from the US, double the amount he spend on Bitcoin, and another large chunk in November, 300 million to be spent along with Honduras- and of course, he fights against the evil FMI, while sending each month negotiators and pleading on all fours to lend him 1.2 billion- by omission, the 400 million issued in debt to cover the government deficit in 2021?- the pet hospital constructed with BTC profits when he has actually lost 25% in USD value, profits that, how you even have profits when you don't sell?Bukake (not a typo) is the perfect example of why you shouldn't trust politicians at all, they don't do anything just for your sake, and all they do with your money, it wasn't Bukake spending his money he was spending his own people money to buy coins, the 30$ he gave he didn't do t from his own pocket, he did it from their own, juts like your wife takes your wallet to go shopping and you would assume everything was free because she bought it. But people love to have a hero, laser eyes, tweets, and lies they know they are not true but you need to have something there, a guiding light, and just like religion when you desperately need some comfort. And there is Bukele, the savior! And god forbid showing them he is not a hero but a politician! Pitchforks!Bitcoin doesn't need Bukele and it doesn't need Salvador's approval, bitcoin needs people that use its strengths for their own needs, bitcoin doesn't need politicians, politicians, and basements pos that live on likes and shares desperately need Bitcoin to have a reason in life.Quote from: Poker Player on May 09, 2022, 03:22:03 PMI am not very fond of believing politicians in general, and even less so when they deny something.Hope more learn this now and don't forget by the next tweet of some wanna-be senator who needs a comfy seat.",

The failure of a $1 billion dollar venture in crypto amounts to around 4% of GDP and should not represent a significant threat to el salvador's economy unless they have other significant issues that are troubling them.Tourism ranks in the top 3 of el salvador's industries. Hikes in gas and food prices have a tendency to cut into disposable income which usually hits hospitality and entertainment sectors associated with tourism the hardest.Its been said el salvador has a tremendous unbanked demographic but that bitcoin adoption there has stalled for various reasons. There is still a chance for crypto adoption in el salvador to take off IMO. I don't think circumstances there have reached a point of complete closure. What they currently lack is access to free electricity powered by hydroelectric energy to enable crypto mining as occurred in venezuela. Among other things.",

Obviously it is not really that great, obviously they are in big debt, obviously IMF is dragging their feet, and those are all terrible situations for them.But, not like El Salvador was a golden nation with money flowing through the streets before the bitcoin legal tender deal, they were dirt poor, and they are dirt poor, bitcoin didn't change much about it.",

I know that there are many who will turn this into a negative story and blame Bitcoin for everything, but El Salvador has been in real trouble for more than 20 years, and it is known that they gave up their national currency at that time. Yet the fact that Bukele bought another 500 BTC in a recent dip shows that nothing has changed in his strategy.Quote from: _act_ on May 09, 2022, 06:35:57 PMThe bitcoin bond is set to be September of this year, but I wish Nayib Bukele did not talk in favour of Russia before the war started with Ukraine, people know that Nayib Bukele is supporting Russia. This can be one of the reasons that might made the bitcoin bond success to be retarded or become difficult to be possible as some investors that wanted to invest before may not invest again.I have shared this idea in the main ES thread and I still think it makes sense, but it should be said that the ES is not officially on the side of Russia, but they just abstained in UN voting condemning the aggression against Ukraine. It is difficult to say whether this had such disastrous effects on the interest in BTC bonds, but I remember that they justified the postponement with some technical problems, and at the same time they claimed that there was a huge interest from investors.I think some investors were certainly affected by this decision, but despite all the sanctions against Russia, they still do very well with most countries in the world, billions of dollars flow into their treasuries every day, which means that there are a lot of hypocrites who say one thing and do something completely different. What I want to say is that it would have been much smarter if the ES had played a different card and condemned the aggression, and then, like most others, continued with its usual business.",

I don't if it's going to affect bitcoin that much, bitcoin is much bigger than this to be affected because of the investment of a country or organization. Elvalvador bought some bitcoins at a higher level just like the companies such as MicroStrategy but they didn't lose anything yet, El Salvador will lose when they sell bitcoins also this can be another chance for El Salvador and even some other people to buy for lower prices, if they saw what happened back in 2020 and in 2018 when the prices were falling down they will understand the price fall is hard but it's temporary.
