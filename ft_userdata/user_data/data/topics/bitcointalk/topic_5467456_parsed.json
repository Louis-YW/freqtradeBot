The buttom line is there is death occurring both in young or old. If the old has wisdom he should try and share it at the earliest times so that if he dies, he won't die with all his wisdom.",

When you're close to them, you're inspired by their wisdom and motivated by their hopes. Both embedded in one body and soul. On this ground, I can say that both hope and wisdom are intertwined. But for the sake of this thread. I would prefer wisdom than hope become it is the wisdom that will spring up the hope in you.Oftentimes, People tend to mourn adults than children because of the memories and experiences they've gathered over that person. Especially when the adult breeds much wisdom snd understanding. Your ability to work with different people and environment could be as a result of your wisdom and understanding. This is why we would naturally mourn some adults and won't more others or even mourn a child more than an adult regardless of the age.",

See it this way, the wisdom stands in place of the adults and hope for children. If we lose hope there won't be any form of getting wisdom but if we get to lose wisdom which are the adults we get to see the children taking their place while adults can't take the place of the children.",

If there's a deeper meaning between either of the two, why can't just we just proceed for hoping for the best in our future and at the same time get more wisdom as we get older?You choose what you think is best for your situation but in my situation, both are needed. The hope that there will be something better to come out from the youth and the wisdom that the older and experienced folks ready to be shared to them.",

There is no doubt that the future is more important than the present for me, that's something very specific for the humans as we are able to fear what has not yet happen and plan for centuries ahead. The obvious problem is that children cannot grow up without adults, so eventually the death of an adult is a problem to all.",

Based on your question on hope and wisdom, which one I will prefer. Both of them are very important but when it comes to death, I will prefer the old ones to die first because they are already old and we won't loss much from their death compare to when a child dies because who knows if that child might be the president of that country.Wisdom comes from God and the if an old man dies, there will be someone that must have tapped from his wisdom, or there will be another old man that has similar wisdom that is still living. Children will grow up to rule the world and they will be the ones to continue from where we stopped, they will bring in new generation to the world, but an old man has already brought his generation to the world and wouldn't contribute much to the growth of the economy because he has already contributed his part  when he was young. There is joy to see that everyone grows old and not to die premature.",

Hope and wisdom, adult and child, which do we value most? Both are needed in a society to prosper. Wanting one over the other could as well bring some setback to that community or nation. I will just work with the one I have at that time while mourn the one that already left. If I happen to have them both, I’ll utilize them both and if I don’t at that moment, I’ll capitalize on what I have and stop trying to think about what had already been lost.Quote from: BADecker on September 25, 2023, 06:17:35 PMHope $ Wisdom...I know this girl named Hope.

      "body": "It's an interesting question. In my country you expect old people to pass away. Nobody is amazed that someone lost his grandma. We simply move on and continue living. The situation is much different with children. Their deaths are always a shock and people cry over the opportunities that child could have, the things it could have experienced that were taken from them. It's especially sad when a child dies tragically, like in a car accident or is murdered. As a parent, I'd choose to die to let my child live. I'd rather lose the experience that I have, but give a chance at longer live to someone who has whole decades before them and the strength to take full advantage of this time.",
