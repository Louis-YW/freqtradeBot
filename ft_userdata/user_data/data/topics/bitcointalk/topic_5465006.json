  "content": "Hello. I have been scouring the forum and various other sources for bitcoin/altcoin websites that offer Poker (specifically No Limit Texas Hold Em) for a while. I used to use Blockchain.Poker for a while, then it got shut down and the creators haven't released the source code or even a reason as to their closure. I saw sites like SwC being mentioned, but the information on sites like this seems to be spread quite thin due to a lot of the gambling sites focusing on sports betting. I was wondering if anybody had any experience with sites akin to Blockchain.Poker that offer a similar registration requirement (just a username + password and a 2FA option) and low rakes? Or was BC.P just a unicorn and there isn't any like it? I apologize if this topic is a duplicate, I tried searching for similar topics but I wouldn't be shocked if I missed one in the sea of results. Thank you.",

There's a lot to choose from as far as hold em, omaha, or stud. Both omaha and stud have hi/lo variances also and limit holdem is offered. Cash games have tons of tables as well through all limits. You can find a game at anytime.",
