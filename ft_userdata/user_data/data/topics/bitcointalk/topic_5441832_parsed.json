There is much more behind financial success.University lecturers don't know how to make and manage business. If anyone thinks that they can prove me wrong, then show me rich and successful lecturer, otherwise don't reply me!",

Because in reality if you don't have enough knowledge which can be learned on higher education to many people will fool you and that will lead to destruction of your business.And if you think higher education is a waste if time then think about it since your teacher will teach you all about necessary tools,theories and other more that can help you to define many things about entrepreneurship. Although other more can be learned thru experience but its really a huge advantage for you if you have diploma coming from your higher education since discrimination will be lessen and people will not look at you as smart individual.",

But don't compare with the geniuses in the world, they drop out of school, but they are born geniuses, they have ideas, ambitions and if they don't stop learning midway. I'm sure they will be the top bachelors at prestigious schools.

High education will give you credentials so that your customer will trust you on what your business.Nowadays most of the entrepreneurs always have higher education compared before so it be hard for you to compete with them if you will start from scratch without any credentials established.

The education to some countries these days are just sticking to theories and it kinda hurts that there's little to less application that could be done.You could be a successful entrepreneur without having a degree.

Big corporate CEOs often get caught up in the numbers and lose sight of their mission, which is to create “awesome” products or services, according to Musk.“There should be more focus on the product or service itself, less time on board meetings, less time on financials.”“A company has no value in itself. It only has value to the degree that is [an] effective allocator of resources to create business services that are of a greater value than the costs of the inputs,” Musk said.This thing they call “profit,” Musk added, “should just mean over time that the value of the output is worth more than the inputs.”Musk said the biggest mistake he has made as a leader of both Tesla and SpaceX was spending too much time in meetings looking at PowerPoints and spreadsheets, instead of being out on the factory floor.“When I go spend time on the factory floor or really using the cars or thinking about the rockets...that’s where things have gone better,” Musk said at the WSJ summit.He finds that if he is engrossed in the details of the issues, it boosts morale and his team is “more energized.”Musk urged CEOs to “get out there on the goddamn front line and show them that you care, and that you’re not just in some plush office somewhere.”Musk recently became the second richest person in the world as Tesla’s stock price and market cap have grown over the last several months. He is currently worth an estimated $157 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/elon-musk-on-the-problem-with-corporate-america-too-many-mbas-.htmlIt seems MBAs are an acknowledged fast track to becoming a corporate executive or CEO. Its acknowledged as the talent pool from which corporate america recruits the majority of its leaders.Although Elon Musk appears to think its an issue. He believes many MBAs do not understand many of the critical details relavant to businesses they're in. Which somewhat does make sense considering many CEOs negotiate for $300,000 annual salaries, when they're running a business with negative income and high debt. Which has been known to lead to the business bankrupting.",

I also have to contradict you in that professors don't know how to make and manage a business. I do know professors who drive a Porsche and live in a mansion. They are themselves running businesses sometimes or they are highly paid advisors to successful companies. A degree does help because it teaches you to persistently pursue an end goal for a longer period of time, frequently having to solve complex problems and to efficiently coordinate and distribute your time and intellectual capacity. It is also sometimes the case that people who get higher education come across a topic during their research tasks that they identify as a potential area for future opportunities. Saying there are no benefits and you can't get rich when going for higher education makes absolutely no sense.",
