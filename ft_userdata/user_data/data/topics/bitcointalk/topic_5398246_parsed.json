  "content": "As you know, the evil, ugly IRS considers mining revenue 'income' the moment it arrives in our wallets. However, I found a trick to roll the crypto into a retirement plan and therefore get a tax benefit.Step 1: Incorporate your mining operation as an LLC, if you didn't do so alreadyStep 2: You must earn a net profit after power cost & depreciation!Step 3: Open a Solo 401(k) retirement plan for the company. There are services that make this very simple. They will register a trust fund entity on your behalf and appoint you as the trustee & plan custodian.Step 4: Open a new corporate exchange account on Kraken/Gemini/Coinbase Pro in the name of the trust.Step 5: Send your mined crypto to the exchange. Sell the crypto for cash, transfer the cash to the trust bank account, then transfer the cash to the exchange.Step 5.5: Buy whatever crypto you want on the exchange.Step 6: You just made a 401(k) contribution which is either on a pre-tax or Roth basis! If you chose pre-tax, it's like buying 20-30% more coins. If you chose Roth, you'll never owe any future tax on withdrawals.Step 7 (optional): Send the coins on the exchange to your own hardware wallet.Solo 401(k) accounts allow you to invest in almost any asset. The other benefit of this type of account is a high $60k contribution limit, the ability to borrow up to 50% or $50k at zero interest, and rolling over existing retirement accounts into buying tax-advantaged Bitcoins while the price is still low.Of course, please consult with an accountant or attorney to make sure you're doing this correctly. Mistakes will be expensive. The maintenance / transaction fees can be $1000/year or so as well.I have just started this experiment today. The process should be complete this month.",

      "body": "Quote from: philipma1957 on May 14, 2022, 01:57:03 PMWe will be looking into this.I forgot to mention that I realized sending crypto to the trust as a 'contribution' is not allowed. You need an alternate way of putting it into the Solo 401(k), like selling it on an exchange, then contributing the cash to the Solo(k); or putting the cash in a new Traditional IRA, then rolling that over into the Solo(k). Every single contribution, loan or withdrawal must be in the form of fiat. This means if you want to take a loan/withdrawal, the trust needs to have enough liquid assets (stocks, bonds, crypto, cash).I'm happy with the provider I chose so far. They handle all the paperwork, IRS filings, etc. for a flat $49/month fee. All I had to do is sign a few papers that they prepared, open a bank account, open an E-trade account, then open a Kraken account. No transaction fees. I can PM you my referral code if you like.The beauty of a Solo 401(k) is that it's truly 'solo', which means you can invest in whatever you like while your business partner can choose their own investments. So I can see it working for your situation. Whenever you think ASIC or GPU prices are too high, or a bear market is coming, you can contribute your share of profits to the Solo(k). No need to buy more equipment if you want a tax deduction.Quote from: philipma1957 on May 14, 2022, 01:57:03 PMOh you are now at 100 points which is a new level Full member once you get the activity in. A few weeks of posting will get you to activity of 120I appreciate the advice I've received from you as well as the other long-time miners. It saved me thousands of dollars. Thank god I cancelled my plan to open an ASIC mining warehouse in Texas. I would've been in deep trouble by now, with customers quitting in the beginning. It would've been a repeat of my failed 2018 ETH warehouse.Instead I'm developing this Stratum software that can distribute hashrate among many customers, switch pools, boost revenue with profit switching, etc.",
