So, lets start a discussion here.It is interesting concept, but it moves discussion into completely different direction. First, we should answer the question if private key (and/or access to it) should be personal or should it be transferrable. And another question is if current technology is secure enough. For example, read that article:https://medium.com/hackernoon/demystifying-apples-touch-id-4883d5121b77It describes how Touch ID is designed. You may ask question - what you really want to rely on: do you want hardware/software from a given producer to tell you if you have access to the private key or do you want to have reliable solution which produce always the same result for a given fingerprint. I assume that each time you scan (add) your fingerprint into system you must be sure the generated hash will be the same - otherwise you cannot access your \"wallet\" on the new device (or after factory reset).",

Face and eye scanners can be fooled with pictures, or with 3D prints made from pictures.So the end result is either a private key it is near impossible to recover, or a private key which can be easily attacked.I agree with what you have said: using fingerprints or other biometric traits is, at best, a highly insecure approach to generating private keys, let alone the fact that biometric scanners differ significantly in functionality and reliability, which may result in different interpretations of the same biometric data and thus loss of funds, or may cause mental or emotional disorders in cryptocurrency users relying on such devices and questionable cryptographic schemes. But the authors of the following paper Two-factor-based RSA key generation from fingerprint biometrics and password for secure communication claim they have found a solution to the problems you outlined. Although it focuses on RSA, the same principles can be applied to ECDSA, I will quote from \"Abstract\" section here:QuoteAbstractIn an asymmetric-key cryptosystem, the secure storage of private keys is a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach for generating the same public and private key pair on a need basis. Hence, the need for secure storage of the private key is done away with. The proposed approach for generating the key pair is based on two factors: fingerprint biometrics and password. A stable binary string is generated from the distances among pairs of minutiae points in a fingerprint using a gray code-based method. Experiments show that gray code representation significantly reduces the number of inconsistencies between the generated bit strings from two instances of the same fingerprint as against the binary code representation. Hence, the ReedâSolomon error correction code successfully corrects errors due to variations in multiple instances of the same fingerprint to induce stability in the generated string. Hash of the stable string generated from the fingerprint and the string generated from hashed password are XORed to derive a stable seed value. The proposed approach uses this seed value to generate two large prime numbers. These prime numbers are used to generate the public and private key pair using the RSA key generation method. This seed value ensures the generation of the same key pair every time. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can ensure a stable generation of the key. It is not required to store either the fingerprint template or the password. Moreover, the generated private key is also not stored. It can be regenerated on a need basis.",

I don't know if I'm missing something, but arranging a set of numerical strings in ascending order does not exactly provide a good source of entropy. They also say their Reed-Solomon correction code can correct up to 20 bits of error, which sounds great except it also means an attacker can be far less accurate than they need to be the Reed-Solomon code will correct their inaccuracies to a significant degree.

They state literally that \"obtaining a stable key string from fingerprint biometrics is the main objective of this proposed work\" and \"a consistent set of minutiae points must be used for key string generation,\" and, in my view, \"stable\" in this case means \"deterministic\" or \"recalculation-friendly\" rather than \"random\". This stable key is essentially an output of the SHA256 function to which a specific argument is sent, namely a binary string generated from your fingerprint using some sophisticated techniques aimed at making a string more friendly to error correction. Given that the resulting string is neither random nor secure, there needs to be added some random factor, which in this case is a user-generated password. To generate a second string (the first was a \"stable\" string from fingerprint), you calculate the SHA256 hash of your password and salt (salt is derived from the password itself using iterative hashing for 10000 times) and then XOR these two strings (hash of the password and salt) to calculate final hash of the password. Further, you XOR the string from the fingerprint and the final hash of the password to calculate the seed. Your seed is as secure as the password you used as an input because the whole process is deterministic and the fingerprint is relatively easily obtainable by a potential attacker. Yeah, this is basically a very sophisticated method to create a brain wallet.",

In old age the fingerprint remain the same but there are chances that there could be slight change in them which could restrict us from using the wallet.Second case is if the technology is implemented then we know how many places our biometrics are in contact with and same thing will be known by the hackers and other also that you can generate keys with the fingerprint of one person and they have different ways of copying the same like with liquid silicon and many ways to make computerised fingerprint so I aslo think it's not safe this way and should be avoided.",
