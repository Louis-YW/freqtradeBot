  "content": "This week for BitcoinWith a strong bullish engulfing candle on the 4H chart, Bitcoin has effectively broken out of the symmetrical triangle. It has also moved over the MA 100, indicating that it will continue to rise.In my opinion, a retest of the 30K zone is needed to close the gap before going on to the 34K zone, where the MA100 is now located on the 1D chart.It's too soon to foresee the result of this current week, yet in view of the ongoing move, this will be the principal green week, since we have continually tried the lows to get greater liquidity on the lookout, so a bullish move is logical.In addition, the MFI (Money Flow Indicator) on the LTF (Lower Time Frames) has turned positive, indicating that money is coming back into the market.This week for ETHEthereum then again is as yet battling to close over the balanced triangle, dissimilar to Bitcoin which has previously broken.On the 4H chart, we can observe a clear breaking point, as well as a climb above the MA 100, which was previously used as support by the bulls.The next major hurdle that the ETH bulls must overcome is around 2230$. Trade ETH with mexc.comWe see a clear bullish volume increase in the last few days, the MFI has also turned bullish, suggesting that money is entering back in the market. If the bulls defend the 1900 zone, we could see a push towards the 2230$, on the 1D chart the MA100 is currently sitting at 2719$.",

I hope Etherium and BTC will remain in top always.We have the same analysis with Ethereum, it never gets old and still one of the best altcoin to accumulate. No doubt for bitcoin will remain at the top as it's the king and the same goes for Ethereum. At this time, it's hard to see that Ethereum will be replaced by another coin. And if it does, I think the closest one will be BNB but it's still far from reaching its end marketcap the same with Ethereum. Just get to have both of them and you're all set for the next bull.",

Well, we should always analyze and never go all it, it is still good to have many options.",

I hope Etherium and BTC will remain in top always.Sure, bitcoin and ethereum will always be top. A lot of altcoins came out and most were advertised as ethereum destroyers but then there wasn't a single altcoin that could compete with ETH. For example SOL was once considered an ETH killer, yesterday the Solana network crashed, resulting in the entire blockchain being halted and disrupted. This is the 4th time in 2022 SOL has encountered a problem. This is clearly a failure in trying to beat ETH.",

I ends up looking like it will go up, then it goes up a little, then it looks like it will go down and it goes down a little.Just because MA has reached over 100 doesn't mean that it will go up, it just means that right now the direction is up again but that will end up with a bit of a drop in the end again. This is why we should be focusing a bit more towards something more cautious when we are investing. That will result with a good investment where you know it will go, instead of just hoping the chart is right.",

Somehow I don't expect the end of the bear market just yet, it might go on for a couple of months longer.The current movement of bitcoin is better than a few weeks ago because the bitcoin price has been able to return to the $30k level, although sometimes the price can drop back to $29k.This situation made the price of bitcoin go up and down and it seems that now it has entered a recovery phase from altcoins and, of course, bitcoin.But that doesn't necessarily guarantee that the price for bitcoin and altcoins will continue to increase, considering that the bitcoin price has not been too high.So we still need to be patient to wait some more and just keep holding our coins tight.",

You can't plan market pump and dumps by whales and insiders or world events before they happen. Only insiders and exchanges make money trading in unregulated markets. You might as well play the slots with your money (actually, some people are doing that right now with their ETH and 0xMR on betcrypt365 and lnocasino because it's the fastest way to recoup your losses). Anyway, my strategy has been to buy POS projects like NEAR, Celo, and ICP and stake them. When the market rebounds I will have 10-20% more coins to sell at the top. For me, this is better than trying to time the market , especially because you never know when the next bull market will start and you don't want to be left behind holding inflationary dollars.",

TA works, you just need to do it patiently and consistently.Traders made a lot of money because they analyze the market most of the time and by doing this you can actually predict the next trend but of course there’s still a chance that its not accurate but still, its advisable to analyze than to make any guess. Its good to see green candles again with Bitcoin, this might be the start of a new trend for this year.",

The only way it goes is below $30k and that's it or there will be much worse than that and that would be below $20k. It might happen next year or before the halving a year before it happens based on the chart patterns and I expected this to happen already since that's how the market works.It may be unpredictable but those prices will come in no time since I don't think it will stay for $30k-ish this long cause I've seen a pattern like this when the price was $10k - $15k.",
