Check out this link:https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxdEL-1C2zg/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==My proposal to those countries who still consider the energy demand of mining before adopting BTC as legal tender is to take a cue and be creative in deployment and development of renewable energy plants from waste disposables and other convertible resources. Thus, they would have resolved the issues of energy consumption and maintenance when setting up mining farms and integrating BTC payments for transactions, as legal tender or under regulators bearing.What's your thoughts, let's discuss!",

I seriously doubt it.We've always known that governments don't like bitcoin because it is decentralized which means they can never control it, print it out of thin air, censor people's transactions, and stuff like that. Everything else including environmental impact, energy consumption, etc. is just an excuse because if they announced the real reason (\"we [the gov.] can't control bitcoin so we fight it\") it would lead to mass adoption in a blinking of an eye As for the \"waste to energy\" idea, it is already being done in a lot of developed countries. The electricity it produces is not enough for mining farms though specially since there are easier and \"cleaner\" way of getting that electricity like something as simple as solar panels.",

Given that the equipment cost and all setting cost is too high that the profit that bitcoin mining can produce can't sustain the cost. One other thing is the government, it would be lucky for the company if the government fully supports them with their decision but given that most of the countries are uncertain with cryptocurrency, I high doubt about the supporting part.",

I know there are more industrial heat, but this is quite different in the sense that it is deliberate in the recycling process and have considered options that concerns sooth emissions and any condition that used to affect the previous implementation of waste to energy solutions.",

I seriously doubt it.It is not a main or only reason for governments to be against Bitcoin. They see Bitcoin as a big threat to their fiat currencies and CBDCs in future as well as are fearful that their citizens will become less favorite with their fiat currencies, CBDCs and switch to use Bitcoin more as better mean for value, monetary transfers and reserves.Energy consumption is only one of reasons that is used by governments to attack Bitcoin and they can use more reasons even unreal, non-existing to attack Bitcoin.Endthefud.org (energy)Endthefud.org (Justice)Endthefud.org (Bitcoin as money)Endthefud.org (Inflation)Endthefud.org (PoW vs PoS)Endthefud.org (Governments)Endthefud.org (Miners control Bitcoin)Endthefud.org (Tech problems)Bitcoincleanup.comBitcoin MythsBitcoin FUD Deep Dive And DebunkEvery Reason Bitcoin Will Not FailAddressing Persisting Bitcoin Criticisms",

Is the government not adopting Bitcoin mining due to high energy requirements? I don't think so because bitÄ‰oin is based on blockchain and is decentralized which the govt does not want. There are many countries that allow and support bitcoins but also some other states that ban bitcoin not on the reason of low energy but on the basis of its decentralized nature.But yeah economically and environmentally it's a good plan to reduce the waste in your cities and and change it into energy. This could lessen the greenhouse effect and also provide new job opportunities for the maintenance of the plant and give good revenue to the govt. Also, these plants can less the cost of energy for Bitcoin mining as it requires a huge electricity which is high in cost if this plant gives the required energy to Bitcoin mining it will cost less as it is produced from waste. So in my view its a good initiatve for both Bitcoin mining and for the state.",
