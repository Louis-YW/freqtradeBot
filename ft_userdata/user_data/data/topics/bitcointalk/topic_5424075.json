      "body": "I can consider them considering that they spend that huge amount of money on advertising, both Stake and Duelbits are proof that it's worth marketing here in Bitcointalk, and we call this branding, Duelbits and Stake could have stopped after 3 to 5 months like what other casinos have done and done but they opted to brand themselves here in Bitcointalk because branding is important and gamblers are attracted and considered these casinos who spend money as a long term casino that you can rely on to protect their reputation by being fair. There are other casinos that are running for a long time already and they too believe that a signature campaign is a good way to advertise and brand your platform.",

Also, you can find that Rollbit has in their hot ETH wallet more than $1.2 million at the moment reference. it's just one of their addresses.it is very difficult to draw a conclusion as to who is the most profitable because they do not share such data at all.",

Stake spends over $6k per week. It's not just the gambling companies but other services are doing the same.If I am not wrong then Chipmixer is spending over $15k per week. Best change is also spending over $4k per week. Of course the conversion from the community worth a value for these companies. Mainly they want to see their name all over.Quote from: examplens on November 29, 2022, 02:38:33 PMit is very difficult to draw a conclusion as to who is the most profitable because they do not share such data at all.A small casino which is not spending much in advertising may have higher profit margin than a bigger one. It's obviously relative to businesses.",

The amount of money they make is enormous. Those of us who are not big gamblers may feel that how do the casino survives but when a casino with millions of users depositing even $100 per week, it's a billion dollar income even considering some lose to pay the winners. We had many scam accusations and they were settled later. Few of them I can remember. Once was over 335 BTC and another one was over 1500 LTC. Fact is, we are only seeing those are coming in public but they should have many more big clients like these.I think with bitcointalk for some of them it's a cheaper advertising option. When casinos sponsor an international club or event, they spend millions.",

But if you're talking about the payout, surely Duelbits isn't really a giant since there's few other casino can pay higher than that. Don't forget casino is make a lot money from people who're keep losing, withdrawal fee, abandon account, gambler who break the rules and internal exchange fee. $7K isn't a big money for them, their daily profit might bigger than that.",

We have dozens of signature campaigns on the forum, paying thousands of dollars a week, that have been running for years continuously, and we currently don't know how long Duelbits casino intends to run this campaign.Every business, including casino platforms, have their own marketing strategy they believe will bring them the best results. Some casino platforms prefer to spend money on affiliate marketing, while others focus on social media campaigns. However, sometimes the best methods are not always the most expensive ones.",

From round one to ~100, the numbers of participants were 12, 15, 25, 25, but with the World Cup, the profits are great, and therefore the spending will increase. I doubt that they will continue with these numbers until the end of the year.The amounts are small. the cost of official advertisements is millions of dollars on our Local TV or city while the cost here is 360k per year in bitcointalk, which seems not expensive if we take into account that the number of users will decrease.",

They need to invest in it if they want their brand to be known.But really, $7,230 is a small amount.

I remember in an winter afternoon, I was waiting to withdraw some cash from the ATM and an elderly woman was checking her balance. Obviously she was slow and I was losing my patience. When the balance was showing on the screen it was some £2,xxx and I was thinking damn this woman is rich 😂 Thanks to bitcoin LOL",
