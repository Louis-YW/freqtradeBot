I mean this token now is simply Ethereum without it dapps and what will be the sense of its smart contract if all of its dapps running on ecosystem is already migrated on much better Ethereum blockchain. The main reason why merge occur was to solve the scalability issue of Ethereum blockchain due to flooded transaction volume. The only thing left on this token was miners that trying to convince to invest on token so that the token that they will mine will have a value. This is like the old Luna blockchain that leave by the main developer to start the new one.I’m not buying this hype token or if ever I will be touching this, I will just purchased a couple of this for holding purposes but not for serious investment because people will surely leave this and go with Ethereum that supports by the one who make it popular which is Vitalik.",

If Ethereum has problems, then perhaps someone will pay attention to this coin. But the big profit for Ethereum miners was given by commissions in blocks that reached several hundred coins, and on Ethereum PoW Fork (ETHW) this will not happen for a long time.",

Vast swaths of so called \"crypto influencers\" express apathy and concede to ideals of centralization and corporate greed while using ESF as some lame excuse that makes it okay. They blindly ignore what so many of us have learned to be an obvious red flag:***Massively Premined Coins***Ethereum is proving why we should always beware of the intent of those in power by way of their own tokenomics design.These are the narratives that people who actually believe in crypto should be driving:1) Proof of Work can be done efficiently. We can't let the narrative be that crypto Proof of Work is destroying the planet just because corporate industry has exploited ASICs. 2) Massively accessible Proof of Work available to billions of people will always be more decentralized compared to Proof of Stake ecosystems where:        a) The only way to attain coins in Proof of Stake is to buy them from people who held coins before you or to buy enough coins to stake to garner rewards and        b) Seizure of network control merely requires heist or purchase of native coins/tokens rather than the logistical feat of acquiring compute gear.3) The dystopian reality and outcome of massively successful premined projects are        a) A rug pull to miners who were early community founders and adopters of their ecosystems,        b) Regulatory obliged corporate validators, and        c) Censorship.As far as which coin is best designed to lead us into the future of decentralization, scalability, and security, that's easy:EPIC (Epic Cash) is proof of the possibility for energy conservation having designed a mining protocol that is predominantly mineable by CPUs and GPUs and adds the step of splitting the duty cycle so that either of the main components can only mine 48% of the day thus making it more than twice as energy efficient than any comparable coin on Randomx or ProgPoW. EPIC is actually profitable to mine above .1 kwh energy costs.EPIC is not easy to mine but the juice is worth the squeeze. I've covered my CAPEX many times over mining EPIC and it won't stop.I've done my fair share to get the word out. People will pay attention when it makes sense for them to do so.",
