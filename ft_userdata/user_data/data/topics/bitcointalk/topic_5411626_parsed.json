And what else is considered a collateral beside alt coinsThank youDomain cant be a valid collateral if that is not for a running business as that might be value of 10$ while at the time of lending it can be seem as 1000$ or more. Beside altcoin, physical coin and valuable materials (watch, gold etc) can be considered as collateral.",

And what else is considered a collateral beside alt coinsThank youGenerally speaking, no, but it really depends on the lender.  It's nearly impossible to put a value on most of the domains out there, but if you were to offer (for example) \"yahoo.com\" as collateral, I assume someone would accept it.  The other issue you're going to run into is that the lender wants assurance that the domain cannot be retrieved by the borrower through social engineering.  The only way to do that is by transferring ownership.  Unless you're willing to transfer ownership of the domain to the lender (or an escrow agent) and incur the costs of transferring to and from the lender, then not even \"yahoo.com\" would be considered as valid collateral.",

      "body": "Domains can be used as collateral if the lender considers them valuable enough. At that point you might then have to set additional terms for what happens if you're unable to pay the loan on time, is the lender able to use the domain straight away or should additional time be given (this could be discussed afterwards but the lender might be more likely to reject the offer or put an imeddiate auction up for the domain so you have to try to outbid other people wanting to buy the domain).",

It's not too long and will give you an idea.If that domain can be recovered by you in any way - by email, by proving your identity, name it, it's not valid collateral.Even more, if the possible lender thinks that you may be able to recover the domain, he's \"gone\".If that domain is not valuable enough (the domain, not the underlying platform that can be moved anywhere else), again, it's not a valid collateral.I hope it's clearer.",
