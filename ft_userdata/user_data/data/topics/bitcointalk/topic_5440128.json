For a newbie and someone who have bitcoin and forum in mind to grow, you most learn have to accept correction, i read some posts in technically board and i noticed one person is into arguments with almost six people in one thread, so began to reason this don't want to agree with the majorities, and that argument results ban in technically board, which the person can't post there.

It always seems impossible until the day you earn your first 1 merit, because every high rank you see today was once in that shoe and we all know how it felt like that someone appreciated our content to be worth meriting for the first time. But one thing you just need to understand is that growth is a gradual process, and as such, it's always good to obey all the rules and guidelines which governs a place/online community such as this forum, and avoid shortcuts, because just as you have earn 16merits today, if only you can remain consistent, while providing value to the bitcointalk community, your growth is rest assured",
