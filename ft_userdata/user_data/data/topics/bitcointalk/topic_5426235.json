I agree, the industry is getting cleaner and cleaner with the failure of those platforms that are designed not only contrary to the philosophy of Bitcoin but are also unsustainable. The more this kind of failure happens, the more people will be drawn back toward Bitcoin. This must be a healthy and organic way for the industry to shake off its bad apples. If this kind or purging happens in rounds regularly, the purer the industry becomes. Sooner or later, what will remain are those worthy of everybody's support.",

You don't even need Bitcoin to crush those shitty altcoins since coins like Ethereum, Monero, etc are definitely going to outlive them. I expect there will be more cases like FTX, Celcius, etc in the future. The market will continue to filter shitty companies that promise 20% annual return as the only way to keep their business afloat. It's like what mk said, most of the altcoins are moving to their own category and do not compete directly with BTC.Quote from: mosleya on December 07, 2022, 02:39:42 AMWhat are your views on the future? I clearly know that the persistence of beliefs is often not so strong, and few people can hold Bitcoin for a long time.We got a nice cycle if you take a look at the past. A bull market comes, lots of companies get mainstream, and shortly after that they go bust after the bear market starts, some revive with another name, etc. You will be surprised to see that a lot of users are holding BTC for years, and the number of 1 BTC holders is increasing every year. BTC will definitely stay, while scam/shit tokens will die sooner or later.",

Because according to my knowledge and experience of the economy, Bitcoin has just eased the payment system, nothing more progressive on the part of the global economy.Also, Bitcoin has not been completely adopted as we see, which makes me know that more would happen in the future on the positive side. This is regardless of whether Bitcoin is stable or not, it's about how the world would need it more due to its enormous advantages. And of course, altcoins will help with this, and more altcoins that would be more regulated and dependable might be developed soonest whether we like it or not.This indicates that Bitcoin is not the point but the blockchain technology itself, and it would be advanced upon for better exploration.",
