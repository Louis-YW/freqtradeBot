That bitcoin will increase above $150000 to $180000 or more in this year. But I will still prefer to advice you that you should not invest all the money on bitcoin. You can take like 50% and invest it. Let the bull run comes and wait for the next bear market. Be patient and see what will happen in that time.

Bitcoin is a gem, though I suggest you to invest init. There is only return of 5-7-8% in the fixed deposit which should be deposited for such tenure, while you can't withdraw before completion of deposits termed time. In the same time if you invest some in Bitcoin then you can withdraw your assets at anytime without any barrier.If you are still in a perplex about whether to invest all or none of your hard earned money, then better to go with less in starting (so, you can learn about how bitcoin gonna progress in future) but you should be aware of while choosing wallets for a long term. some of the reputable members over here has suggested best wallets for storing your Bitcoin : Yu can go through here [General] Bitcoin Wallets- which, what, why?Quote from: Manas Singh L on January 20, 2025, 11:50:37 AMWhy the Bitcoin is mostly volatile sir, mam? What do you think of this my move is I am doing good or bad. Please genuine suggestion only. Thank you Why is bitcoin volatile? Because it hasn’t yet been fully adopted.Organically adopted new money always has and always will a start out first as a collectible, then move to a store of value then, move to a medium exchange, and then finally to a unit of account. We’re in the so volatile phase now. Once the masses adopt bitcoin, the opportunity cost to spend it will go down. Then bitcoin will be a common medium of exchange.",

      "body": "Firstly, welcome to Indian board where your thread will likely to get better replies, so I reported and moved it here.Volatility comes from the demand and supply, it's not like how and when since all things are happening on it's own so the volatility will be stabilized when bitcoin reaches it's threshold level of adoption and no more room to grow. Well, those days are probably 100 years away from now so let's focus on do's and don'ts of bitcoin investment.Fixed deposit (FD) gives an average interest of 7-8% and don't forget you will be paying 10% TDS on interest if the amount exceeds 40K INR so effectively you can make 6-7% via FD which is guaranteed but you can't compare it with Bitcoin which could quadruple or dump to 1/3 of it's value in a year so you need to make sure what you prioritize the guaranteed small return or take the risk and make big?My personal suggestion will be just buy bitcoin with half of your bitcoin savings and let the remaining in FD to balance the risk factor and in the next 3 or 4 years you will learn about which is best...",

Honestly, I don't think it's a good idea to take any advice from anyone; if I am you, I will do deep research and explore first before I invest. Some people will just do polls or ask others for advice on their personal investments because they are not sure about the research they can even do on their own. Accepting other people's advice is not bad, but it will be bad advice when it comes to investing.As you said, conducting in-depth research and exploration can be done first before seeing how other people's responses and suggestions are, so that there will be a comparison of how the intervention will be carried out whether it is appropriate or not. OP was also wrong in responding to Bitcoin because Bitcoin will never develop steadily in the future, because Bitcoin is a volatile coin and so on.Bitcoin is not regulated by anyone and with a high price volatility that makes bitcoin different from other investment instruments, this can be used to benefit from every price fluctuation that occurs.",

As companies and funds start to allocate for the long term, bitcoin will become more stable because these funds will not be able to react to every single piece of news. They will need to vote on whether and how much they want to move from cold storage. The largest percentage is held by these co called diamond hands, the less volatility we will experience, because institutions are rarely driven by fear and greed. They do the math, calculate everything and discuss it at meetings, while the largest bitcoin moves are often driven by the media, like it was with the supposed China bans, covid pandemic news, or the recent situation with US applying to sell bitcoin.",

Why the Bitcoin is mostly volatile sir, mam? What do you think of this my move is I am doing good or bad. Please genuine suggestion only. Thank you There's some theory that Bitcoin will stop to be volatile when adoption gets to it's peak but I don't completely think so. Bitcoin will continue to be volatile because that's what it's know for and it'll only stop being volatile when it's no longer existing for investors to buy. Bitcoin investors are more interested in Bitcoin because of it's volatility and the profits that they can make than the purpose that it's an exception currency. Don't be afraid of investing in Bitcoin because when the price falls, you haven't lost money if you keep hodling. You're only going to lose when you sell at a loss than what you bought but when you keep hodling, you'll be glad that you did that instead of selling. Bitcoin is volatile because it's a currency with more of speculators and doesn't have a large market to reduce the volatility. The market is also very new hence alot of things, will improve in the future.",

I don't want my money to gets double, triple or a hundred times of my investment but I want my money to grow in slow, slow way which can helps on inflation.Volatility is already decreasing. See the volatility chart of the past years. The volatility decrease is however not uniform: in years where the price peaks happen, volatility is still high. The last two peaks were in 2017 and 2021. In addition, there was a volatility peak in March 2020 when Bitcoin price crashed due to the COVID-19 pandemic but it recovered fast.I would be however cautious in 2025: we have already experienced a bull market since late 2022, with the price having increased 650% since then ($15,000 to $100,000 approximately). This means it is not unlikely that we will hit a new peak just in 2025 or 2026. If you invest near such a peak you will probably have to wait years for a positive return.I think Bitcoin will evolve into a more stable asset very slowly and gradually. Perhaps in 5 or 6 years BTC will experience a volatility close to gold today (the Bitbo chart I linked above allows you to compare BTC volatility with gold's), and it will take decades until it is as stable as more stable assets (like bonds).Quote from: Manas Singh L on January 20, 2025, 11:50:37 AMWhy the Bitcoin is mostly volatile sir, mam?There are several theories, but mine is that the reason is the short term investment horizon of most investors.In simpler words: People invest to make short term profits, and then they sell as fast as possible. This leads to \"herd\" behaviour -- many try to either buy or take profit at the same time, creating big FOMO waves and crashes -- and thus very pronounced cycles of bullish and bearish phases. Fears of a big crash are also a factor contributing to volatility.If people had more confidence in Bitcoin moving in a more stable way, and invest with longer time horizons and without this exaggerated fear of a crash, then also this could further lower Bitcoin's volatility.",

What I like to call positive volatility is when A volatile cryptocurrency ends up being profitable over a particular period of time especially years. Sometimes adoption tells what kind of volatility a particular coin or token will exhibit. The more genuine the adoption is the better the volatility will work in favor of the growth of that cryptocurrency.Everyone looks to invest in a cryptocurrency that will appreciate properly over a given period of time. Meme coins to have strong volatility also but the problem is their adoption is not actually a genuine one unlike that of Bitcoin.",

However, FYI OP, volatility is never a threat for bitcoin and for us investors, it’s even a great advantage for us to make a perfect entry in the market when bitcoin price drops low. And we won’t be seeing btc price consistently dropping its price since there’s even a lot of chances that we will see its price going to the moon.My point is, price volatility is an asset, not a threat. Without it, we will never witness btc price reaching $50k or $100k. And we’re bound to witness more of its new ATH price when bitcoin becomes more globally adopted, wherein bigger financial institutions will adapt bitcoin as their new investment.",
