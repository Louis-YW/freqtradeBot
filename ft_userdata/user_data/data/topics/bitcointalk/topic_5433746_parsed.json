LOLBitcoin started to falter when a recession was starting to materialize in various strong economies around the the world, first it stumbled due to Covid and now due to Russia's invasion of their neighbor. While we have seen a recovery in business, people are still in shock and maybe the recession has not fully completed itself yet, so there could be another year or two of people being very careful with their money. It's also a lot more expensive to borrow money, while Bitcoin's massive spike was in some ways caused by the ability to borrow at very low rates. It pretty much became a game of pass the parcel until the music stopped and the game could still be running now, so people are reluctant to get back in and may be looking for the next wave to ride.",

I agree that people might not be optimistic until they get this feeling of halving being just around the corner but that doesn't mean they'll be willing to dump. I feel like we've reached a period where there's not enough bullish people to start an uptrend but those who wanted to sell did so and people who still hold bitcoin went through a drop from a possible bottom of 30 thousand down to 15. They aren't going to get scared now because another 50% drop is very unlikely.We're going to stay in this range until something really bullish happens that drives the price up. Accumulating is always a good idea, but I'm really confused by people who didn't want to do it at 16 thousand but want to do it now. It doesn't matter in the long run if you bought at 17 16 or 15.",

The bear market isn't over yet and we need more evidences of investors' optimism before finally concluding it's happening for real.This is what we should really be having in mind which there's no way that we could really be able to determine if this one would be the bottom or not where we could only say if it is when it is already that rising in value or its price which is something unpredictable since from the first place.This is why you should really be that versatile and be aware on how this market behaves so that you wont really be that everytime hassling or stressing yourself asking into your mind whether this could be it or not.Adapt entirely when you do see on whatever price movement that it would be making.Not all would really be having that risk taking mindset when it comes to their investment but rather they would really be holding up their position and would really be observing on where it would be going, this is something a very common behavior for investors here on the market.",

And yet the price held at a very high level and with that, if no major problems arise in the coming weeks, it is very likely that this is the floor. But as always, any crisis can cause a new despair in the market and the fall can be big followed by a resumption of the rise soon after. Buying and holding in the portfolio can be excellent, betting on leverage is still a very high risk.",

FUDs continue spreading because of the recent news of a centralized exchange collapsing, that's why the Bitcoin price movement remains struggling at this moment because a lot of people learned from past mistakes.  Though it's unpredictable sometimes the price always matters on what happening outside or even manipulation like social media spreading the worst news about crypto.",

The volatility, uncertainty, and unpredictability of Bitcoin are high. It is better to prefer DCA over one-time investment. The price could actually go up just when you thought it's going down, and down just when you thought it's going up. I understand that you're probably one of those who wait for a sign of recovery before investing. You might do it now. But be careful, this might just be a bear trap. Either way, DCA.",

The FED they said will pivot which was also anticipated to happen, I guess that will be the moment the financial guys are saying. If it goes below $15K in a few weeks, then we are really going to be seeing Bitcoin bottom on the monthly chart which had not yet happened in the history of BTC.",

If buying in bulk is too much to do, then DCA is the solution to that problem.There is no mistake that FUD is heard everywhere, but if we have been in this space for a long time, this has become mainstream news and even I personally have ignored it, because I know there are people who want to take advantage of this situation.
