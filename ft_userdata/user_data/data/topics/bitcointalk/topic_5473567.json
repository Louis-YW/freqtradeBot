Crypto Currency and Bitcoin is banned in our country because the safest way transfer money and no identification the transfered who transfer money from who to whome. In our country money laundering is a common case if Bitcoin or crypto currency is legal in our country then they will use the way properly to transfer illegal money. I think they also use this way to money launder but if cryptocurrency legal in our country they will use this way properly for their illegal works that's why I think that's the main reason why cryptocurrency ban in our country.",

These governments think that it's still Bitcoin that's starting all of the illegal transactions that are happening in dark and deep web. It's not just all about those factors that you have mentioned but it's that they're not just ready for it and with this belief of negativity for using it.

Or even money sent has no name to know if actually you are sending to a particular person of your choice.
