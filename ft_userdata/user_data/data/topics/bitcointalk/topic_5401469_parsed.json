      "body": "No. You shouldn't consider the timestamp to be anywhere near accurate, because it is not meant to be. Bitcoin follows the chain with the longest proof of work (POW). This means that all of the nodes automatically follows the chain with the longest POW, when they receive it. Hence, you have a double spend, or more specifically a 51% attack when an attacker is able to generate a longer chain with more POW, and by including the transaction which spends to another address. Bitcoin uses the timestamp to determine the validity of certain transactions (nlocktime) and the difficulty increment. Otherwise, every block has its own block height which increases sequentially. In the block creation process, each individual block does not consider the timestamp of the previous block so long as it doesn't deviate too far from the MTP. There is quite a lax tolerance on the time deviation because it isn't possible for every node to be synchronized to the exact same time at the current state.",

      "body": "The timestamp of a block has to meet two important criteria: It has to be greater than the median time of the previous 11 blocks and less than the network adjusted time + 2 hours. Therefore, this limits manipulation. Quote from: NdaMk on June 05, 2022, 01:49:15 PM2. If coincidentally (or maybe manipulated), a block's timestamp is later than the previous block, wouldn't that affect the blockchain or the timestamp of the block built on top of it?A block can be submitted with a timestamp earlier, later or even of the exact same timestamp as of the previous block. Quote from: NdaMk on June 05, 2022, 01:49:15 PM3. Wouldn't the irregularities in time stamp results in double spending attack in bitcoinNo, because blocks are normally generated every 10 minutes (on average) and therefore nodes check for double-spending analogously with the order of the transactions they've received in each of these valid blocks, regardless of their timestamp.As said, block timestamp exists, mainly, to determine difficulty.",

If time stamp can be manipulated or altered regularly doesn't that affect the credibility of its service.No. Bitcoin does not use the timestamp to confirm transactions or order blocks. It should only be thought of us a rough indication of the time the block confirmed, usually accurate to around 3 hours.Quote from: NdaMk on June 05, 2022, 01:49:15 PM2. If coincidentally (or maybe manipulated), a block's timestamp is later than the previous block, wouldn't that affect the blockchain or the timestamp of the block built on top of it?No. This has happened many times in the past, where blocks have had earlier timestamps than preceding blocks. It does not matter since blocks are ordered based on block height. Each block contains within its header a hash of the previous block's header - this is how blocks are built in to a chain, and is not dependent on the timestamp whatsoever.Quote from: NdaMk on June 05, 2022, 01:49:15 PM3. Wouldn't the irregularities in time stamp results in double spending attack in bitcoinAgain no, because like blocks themselves, transactions are neither ordered nor confirmed based on the timestamp of the block of their own nLockTime field.",

Inaccurate settings that result from changes in daylight savings time are why two hours might be considered acceptable. The question isn't about a timestamp, but 'who transacted first'. The consensus of who has transacted is agreed on about every ten minutes, which is slow enough to build that knowledge. A double spend will not happen within a single block, because that would be very obvious, and ten minutes is enough time for the network to update to not have to question whether the transaction has occurred before.",

It would be incorrect to say that the inflation rate is time stamp independent, because bitcoin are created at rates based on the difficulty adjustments that use time stamp dependencies.But I take your point, the inflation rate is explicitly changed every 210,000 blocks, which vary in exact timings, and stating it how I originally did could cause confusion.",

Wouldn't the irregularities in time stamp results in double spending attack in bitcoinThe chief aim of presenting consensus in decentralized systems is to agree on the state of the network at any point in time, which in turn constitutes the correct timing and order of transactions. The only working way to achieve such consensus while also maintaining a decent level of decentralization is through competition between miners who are trying to earn the right to add their version of \"timing and ordering\" to the blockchain. Miners spend energy to find a correct solution to a puzzle they themselves constructed, and, if the solution is successfully found, miners exchange for reward their block with nodes verifying every piece of data they receive. It is these successful miners who will decide which transaction goes after which, but they pay a big price for being able to be a \"temporary\" decision-maker. Therefore, adding correct timestamps into blockchain is a very expensive business in which you have to actively compete with others in order to stay. If the security of blockchain relied solely on people correctly putting timestamps in their transactions, the blockchain would have already been destroyed because mere adding of timestamps costs virtually nothing to users. Nothing would stop an attacker from adding millions of transactions with the same timestamp, and we would have no way to determine which of them are correct or which of them to add to a block.",

And for all practical use cases, knowing that \"this transaction was broadcasted at this time or later\" is good enough. Of course it is possible to create or broadcast it earlier, but then it will be rejected by default. So, if users put zero in the locktime, it is just that they don't use it, because then such transaction can be included \"after block number zero or later\".QuoteThe actual timing from the node's point of view in terms of blocks since the Genesis block, not seconds since the epoch.Both cases are possible in locktime, it is just users can use zero (or any timestamp that is earlier than now) and it will be always included.",

Your node may timestamp a transaction as soon as it receives information about the transaction's existence, but this timestamp will be relevant only for your node and in no way affects the actual transaction. QuoteAnd does the timestamp of a block means that each transaction in it are automatically timestamp? No. But we can safely affirm that transactions written in block 1 occurred before transactions in block 2, regardless of the timestamps put by miners in both of the said blocks.P.S. If you think of the bitcoin blockchain as a big clock that ticks every ten minutes on average, then you may say that all transactions that constitute a particular tick share a common timestamp.
