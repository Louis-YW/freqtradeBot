The market is so bad right now, it would be great to get free airdrop and wait for it to pamp!I have rarely hunted Airdrops for the last three years so there is nothing good about Airdrops that I can share with you here because I also saw that most of these Airdrops only pay a few dollars and it's still not worth the time you spend on it. doing Airdrops. So why are you hunting for Airdrops if only your time is wasted, unless you can be very confident and often follow Airdrop events created by several well-known exchanges with clear income.",

The thing about those airdrops that it's not all of the participants will get the rewards, they will select only few hundreds of the participants to be eligible to receive the rewards so it's kind of giveaways rather than airdrops.I would prefer to seek for another thing if you are using your time just for seeking airdrops because it's very rare to find \"decent\" airdrops nowadays.",

Instead of wasting time with such things OP can participate in testnet events of projects that are in beta. This is something I find quite common today, and most people who participate in the project's experience program and provide feedback to help them improve their product, are rewarded in a dignified way.",

No mate, not only these days but it has been a long time since airdrops have become less profitable. I think the best era for airdrops are at the year 2017-2018 but after those years almost airdrops are either scam or the projects are so bad that the tokens won't have the chance to grow no matter how long you will hodl them.Till now I still have a lot of coins that I got from airdrops and yes they are still worthless. Now, that we are on the bear market, airdrops have even become less profitable. We are only wasting our precious time doing them but we can just buy a coin from top projects as their price are still cheap. Not only that it was easier but the potential to earn big is also high.",

After all, it would be a shame if the precious time we have, used to search for airdrops for which the results are not satisfactory. So instead of making a profit by following airdrops, why not just focus on investing in top coins, by buying top coins regularly from some of the income we have. Or we can also stake on several trusted platforms to get passive income. We can also improve our trading skills, so that we can make money from crypto trading. There are actually lots of options to be able to make money from the crypto world,  for sure airdrops are not a good choice in my opinion to be able to make money.",
