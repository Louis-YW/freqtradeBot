The two can be a good thing to always accept and take into consideration but one thing we must always be careful about is not to let pride gone over us when trying to appear on a self motivated level or stage, there are times we will also want to be motivated through what people see or commend about us, this will help us to know how far we have performed and where we needed to add more additional efforts to our life, also in other words, we will have to be self motivated because not everyone we can get motivated from people around us the way we want or expect.",

Read a lot, read more, your curiosity will grow, and that's where we finally found our goal. and goals are the strongest motivations I know",

The best motivation is self motivation, but the strongest motivation can be from either self or from someone else.Nothing beats the motivation you give yourself, even though it may not be the strongest in every case, it is important that everyone is able to motivate themselves by themselves. If you depend on other people to motivate you, there will be times when they will not be there and you will need motivation. And because you depend on someone else's motivation always, you will find it hard to do what needs to be done sometimes. When you can self motivate yourself everytime, you will be able to say to yourself everyday the things you need to hear and will always have the motivation that is needed to do what needs to be done.",

Let's share your idea.Self motivation is the most important,  without self motivation no matter how people try to motivate you to do something it will never work. It is only when one has self motivation then the motivation of other people can work for him or her. In life we first need to push ourselves first before other people can push us, when we are so reluctant to do things their will be no positive results. Self motivation comes first before any othe motivation can be effective in us.",

I am struggling to make meaning of your words but I guess you are talking about being motivated by a problem or challenge. Motivation can be generated by the drive to tackle what hurts you. A problem can be a source of motivation especially when one begin to strive or devise means to over come it. Many inventions were born out of the need to tackle a problem. So I agree that when people begin to inquire \"why this problem\", it could serve as motivation.. Quote On this note, as an individual which do you think is the strongest motivation,should we say it is,- self motivation or - a second party motivation? Let's share your idea.I don't really care about the source of motivation as much as it is positive. If the motivation is to contribute positively to society, the source is irrelevant. To be self-motivated is better because it is internal and requires no external force. If there is nobody or thing to motivate someone that depends on external motivators, such a person will not make progress. I prefer to be self-motivated so that I will be independent.",

Maybe self motivation may be the most important but external stimuli are also important. External motivation is mainly important for stimulating self-motivation, and herein lies its importance.Most of those who were able to succeed in achieving great goals necessarily believed in themselves and in their ability to implement and reach, even if they were constantly frustrated.Today I watched the final match of the Wimbledon women's professional tennis championship, and as usual, the Tunisian Anas Jaber lost, who always won us back to lose in the final match. This provides an example that self-motivation is important to win all matches but can backfire when self-confidence becomes excessive.",

You can have a motivation after you have come out of a particular challenge, so will this be considered as a personal motivation or third party? I see many things can be a source of motivation but what is important is how we are able to see that as something motivating us. Like they say, the best advise is the one that an individual give to themselves. Therefore, if you had a challenge and after words that challenge became your source of motivation, then take up the challenge and make your life better, that is what is important. We don't have to allow situations that are not pleasant to bring us down but we are to learn from it, get motivated and move on.",

Gradually when you have someone that motivates you,you can later when you are on your own motivate yourself. Some persons on their own needs other people to motivate them on their decisions because they feel that two heads are better than one.On the other hand,some people have that gift of self motivation in the sense that they encourage themselves and take a bold step to whatever is suppose to be done by them. One thing I understand is that motivation mustn't be talking to someone but it can be that the way someone is handling issues can motivate you that you can do the same. I was motivated by my friend's dad even though we have never sat down to talk for once.",

Let's share your idea.Although siblings, parents, or other family members can motivate someone as well, what motivates me the most is when I see someone achieve a common goal in a very meaningful way that is not illegal. That always serves as motivation to me in order to keep trying and also get what that person has got. Self motivation today causes some people to give up when they see they keep trying but they didn't get what they want. However, even if someone tried to motivate you and you lack self-motivation, I doubt it would work since you would feel like, as an adult, no one could force you to do something you didn't want to. Particularly if he received a certificate from school attesting to his success. I realize that our fates are different, but when one person achieves success, it inspires others to keep working hard until they, too, reach their goals.",

You might get to pick a role model go life and wish to do as they do or see them for a reason why it's possible to archive certain heights in life but, it all goes down to you haven't been willing yo take necessary steps and push yourself.Self motivation and determination becomes a course gor change.",
