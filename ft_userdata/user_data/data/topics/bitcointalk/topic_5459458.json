There's nothing wrong with that because you're in the right place to grow. Instead of dwelling on what you've done in the past, focus on the lessons you've learned. Remember, regret won't change your past, but you have the power to shape your future.Taking risks is essential if you want to achieve success. Bitcoin, being a highly volatile cryptocurrency, requires patience to profit from it. The good news is that it's not too late, as Bitcoin is currently in an accumulation zone. By staying patient and making informed decisions, you can still benefit from this opportunity.",

And your story is 50% resemble with mine. As i also got familiar with BTC back in 2018 but due to lack of money and confidence i dropped the idea to invest in BTC. At that time both the US dollar and price of BTC was lower then now. Like if i say in local currency the price of BTC is more then 80 lacs and back then it was only around 8 lacs, if i am not wrong.The point is, i never regret on my decision well only to some extent but mostly i try to move on and do not think of past that much because which is already passed why we should regret on that and also effect our future. So i only focused on my future by learning from past mistakes. To earn respect and money sometimes risk is also important. As back in 2018 my cousin and i shared an idea of borrowing money to invest in BTC but we both were jobless and have no idea about future so we both thought not to take risk and put stress in our lives while there is already alot of stress of home work. (Yeah i was like in college at that time, i think it was last year in school idk exactly now).The point is, if we had took the risk and invested in BTC we would have earn a hell lot of money back in 2021 but a as I said, what's bygones is bygones.",

Risk tolerance isn't all about avoiding risks anyhow, it's just about finding which ventures you can take on without begging for alms on the streets. I don't take it against you to think that this industry was not for you initially cause for a lot of people it really isn't. Risks of losing stupendous amounts of money, losing jobs, getting scammed, all of that stuff is pretty common here and this industry's not for the faint of heart. All in all, I see that you're trying to get into the world of crypto now that you knew better. I support that and if you have any questions about how this thing goes just let us all know and we're pretty much gonna be happy to help you out with it!",
