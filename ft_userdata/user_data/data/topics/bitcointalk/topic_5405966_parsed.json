      "body": "Sounds a lot like you're describing cloudmining... 99,9% of those companys are scams.The ones that aren't are selling you 100% of their risk for a (very small, potential) part of the profit. Not a good deal...But since you say they are offering 100% revenue, i'll go out on a limb and say the odds of it being a scam are 99,999999% instead of 99,9%As for your second question: nobody can upload images... You can use a service like imgur to upload the image you want to share, then hotlink it (if the service you're using allows hotlinking).",

Stay safe.Quote from: Jane-HK on July 12, 2022, 06:44:04 AMOne more question, why can't I attach pictures As said, you have to upload somewhere else and get links.Even more, you're newbie on this forum and only the link will be visible, not the actual picture, until you rank up. Of course, somebody may quote it and make it visible for you.",

How do you add a picture to the post? I can't put it on.A \"product\" recommended by \" a friend\", is \"similar\" to mining. Forget the 100% return even if they claim 20% I would is 99.99% a scam.If you can't post a picture following the above instructions theta t least link the website in question, if there is no website then the chances for it to be a scam have just grown to 101%.Quote from: mocacinno on July 12, 2022, 06:53:50 AMSounds a lot like you're describing cloudmining... 99,9% of those companys are scams.Might be some liquidity mining scheme, lately those have started popping up like mushrooms, far more than the cloud mining trend which is, fortunately, losing steam.",

About attaching pictures you can't able to attach them since theymos disabled it due to abuse. You can only able to attach an image if you are a Jr. member above but you can able to put the direct image link here.If you become a Jr. member in the future you can follow this [Guide] How to Add image on Bitcoin Talk Post?",

I am a newbie, I would like to ask is it true that the revenue is 100%?I believe this is one of the cloud mining or shady site which always pledge high interest. Just ask yourself how profitable is mining now that someone will promise you a high return.The best high interest now is you buy BTC now and keep it for the next halving.Quote from: Jane-HK on July 12, 2022, 06:44:04 AMOne more question, why can't I attach pictures That's because of your rank but if you provide the link to the image you want to attach, we can quote it for visibility.",

I am a newbie, I would like to ask is it true that the revenue is 100%?Be extra careful and vigilant, Bitcoin mining right now is not all that profitable, if a mining platform is making you an offer thats too good to be true, then its probably not true, so stay clear and do not throw your money away.QuoteOne more question, why can't I attach pictures I believe you've gotten your answer to this already, but just to add, as a newbie, you can not directly post pictures on the forum but you can share link to the picture and a member with a higher rank will help you to make the picture visible to others, you can start posting images when you become a junior member.",

You must have gotten both answers to the question you asked, you should never trust any venture that promises 100% return, whatever gives you a feeling of too good to be true is usually too good to be true do not second-guess it. I see you're definitely interested in owning some bitcoins of your own, it is a good plan but you must approach this plan patiently and with proper planning.",
