It may even cause more problems if not done correctly and without fixing other problems.Think of it as an individual with lots of debt borrowing money to invest in bitcoin and then bitcoin crashes and they have to panic sell and be in an ever bigger debt.El Salvador situation improved under Bukele not because he adopted bitcoin but because of hundreds of other good decisions he made like solving some of the fundamental problems in the country like the gang problems, the corruption, the attracting of foreign investment, etc. Bitcoin was like the cherry on top. For example as Bukele improved the country's security and started attracting foreign investment, he also did it through bitcoin.It is the same with Argentina. Bitcoin is not the magic solution to solve decades of economic problems. The crazy man in Argentina has also done a lot of additional damage ever since he took office to the point that Argentinian inflation went to almost 300%. Although some claim that this \"shock therapy\" is going to help in the long run but still bitcoin can only be that \"cherry on top\" not the solution itself, and only after dozens of fundamental issues in Argentina are solved.",

The national economic sizes of Argentina and El Salvador are different, with Argentina has a bigger economy.Milei will have more problems to solve, more challenge to pass through, to do big policy changes in Argentina. With success of El Salvador and Bhutan, Argentina and other countries with Presidents who are pro-Bitcoin and pro-cryptocurrency can more seriously investigate those successful cases and try to learn from this, apply successful strategy for their countries.",

As far as I know, El Salvador is the only country that has used its national budget to invest in bitcoin. Although their investment is profitable, one thing we need to know is that they have been continuously buying bitcoins for years and have not sold any bitcoins. So how can we say that bitcoin is positively impacting and helping their economy improve? Also, where will economically struggling countries get the money to invest in bitcoin, and what will happen to them if a bear market suddenly hits and lasts for years? By the way, to improve a country's economy, the government needs to take action and come up with reasonable economic policies to improve people's lives, fight corruption...Don't be naive to think that just relying on a volatile asset like bitcoin can improve a country's economy.",

As pooya87 said, El Salvador's economy has recovered and grown significantly in recent years because Bukele's sound economic policies have paid off. This has nothing to do with making bitcoin legal tender as they have not sold their bitcoins yet.Additionally, there is notable news that El Salvador is looking to borrow $1.3 billion from the IMF and in return they need to change some of their policies on bitcoin. If their economy is really better off thanks to bitcoin, why do they keep borrowing money from the IMF? And I wouldn't be surprised if they acceded to the IMF's demands in exchange for a loan.https://cryptodnes.bg/en/el-salvador-to-scale-back-bitcoin-policy-in-exchange-for-1-3-billion-imf-loan/",

They aim to build a thriving crypto industry within their borders. Since moving money (Bitcoin) becomes much easier with such policies, investors can transfer their funds without issuesA good example is  Dubai, they introduced a Bitcoin-friendly policy by removing taxes on Bitcoin transactions. Their purpose was to attract investors and innovators to their country. Similarly, if Argentina decides to make Bitcoin a legal tender, it could boost investor confidence, which would, in turn, help improve their economy. We know that if a country is poor or struggling, they need foreign investors to stimulate economic growth, so Bitcoin-friendly policies could help in achieving that.Crypto taxation in Dubai for expats: A quick guide",
