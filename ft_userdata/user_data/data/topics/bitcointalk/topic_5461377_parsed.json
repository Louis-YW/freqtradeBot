The next bull run, all I can see is about 50,000 and above; I don't see anything above that anytime soon. The market is struggling real hard this time and will need enough anticipation for it to hit more than this in the coming months. Maybe we should expect like 2 bull runs and above before bitcoin can be able to break a new ATH again. That should be possible after the halving, maybe the year after the halving event, which is 2025.",

I see a trend with past halvings and past bull runs, the growth multipliers decrease with latest halvings.If the trend of growth multiplier continues, a new all time high will be.2021 all time high is about x3.45 from 2018 all time high.2024 and 2025 all time high will be highest about 3.45 * $69,000 = $238,000.My prediction is it will be from $70,000 like $100,000 to lower than $200,000",

It's no more news that the coin reached about $70,000 ATH months after the last halving, I expect the next halving to be more significant. And as the last one reached a market capitalization of over $1 trillion with a price of $70,000 when people have not known the coin and be preparing for it this much, I wonder what it would do after the next halving this time that more people would not want to miss out.I expect a market capitalization of over $2 trillion this time, and by natural/demand calculation, Bitcoin should be at least around $140,000 or more by then (1.6 years).",

The whole story about BTC ETFs obviously didn't stimulate the market too much because most people don't understand the difference between futures and spot ETF anyway, and regardless of the powerful players that are involved this time, there are no guarantees that such an ETF will be approved in the US.The only thing that is certain is the halving, but in that case it should be taken into account that even the last halving brought rather modest results compared to the halvings before that. It is realistic to expect that the price of the last ATH will at least double, but past results do not guarantee that history will repeat itself.",

The greatest bull run that bitcoin had was the bull run of 2017, price went from something to everything, the rise was phenomenal. The recent bull run wasn't as great and successful as the 2017's bull run but it was still good because bitcoin's price is very high and we should expect 20 times and 50 times increase again. I'll remain positive and still think that we will see a new all-time high but we won't go from 30K to 1 million, that's for sure. Personally, I think that we will reach 100k-150k-200k range, the maximum we can reach will probably be 300k, the absolute maximum after the next bitcoin halving. For sure, everything depends on the impact and influence that external factors will have on Bitcoin. In 2020, Elon Musk had a big influence, the fact that PayPal supported Bitcoin, had a great influence too, hope something similar will happen, like Amazon or eBay accepting bitcoin payments.",
