We users of different online casinos might've experienced it, but the support teams easily give a solution as the platforms doesn't want to degrade the reputation of the platform.The competence in the gambling industry paves path for the success and give the best comfort for gamblers.",

I wonder if there is a comparative case being brought in Europe or Estonia - if not against this casino then any others. It does seem like a pretty underhanded way for these companies to perhaps claw back some of the money from winning customers, while also limiting barriers to depositing for losers. If a customer has lost a lot of money and a KYC request comes up, it might just be enough of an obstacle to stop them from ever adding more money to the site, so it is definitely a valid complaint. Let's hope the fine is put to good use in pursuing even more casinos who use such abusive practices.",

I guess it's the question of practice though, as the OP mentioned, it's only when the bettors won big that suddenly the casino will ask you to submit info. And when you comply, still, there are suspicious and then you might not get your winnings, hence there is a scam accusations against the casino itself. So it's better to ask for KYC in the beginning for me, and not get gamblers info false idea that they won't be getting KYC'ed.",

Therefore rules and terms referring to verification should already be expected by all users. Referring to crypto-casinos on the other hand, KYC might be a mandatory requirement in the future due to regulations. But for now, we shouldn't really bother with KYC-related stuff on crypto-casinos as most of them don't require KYC and users can still be free to play anonymously. However though on big winnings, always be ready that some sites must really ask for KYC and we have no choice but to accept it as regulations are now touching the crypto-gambling sites. More importantly, just always refer to their Terms and Regulations to know more about how KYC will be imposed on that said crypto-gambling site.",

Fining casinos is not necessary, in my opinion, that only causes unnecessary losses to the industry.The solution would be to let gamblers know that we would be likely asked for their information in case of losses as well, just letting them know in advance (in case this gets pushed by regulators, I repeat)",
