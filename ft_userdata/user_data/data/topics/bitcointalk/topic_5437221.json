Bkex may close your account anytime. Please, participate in IEO that will be launched on these exchange sites https://cryptorank.io/ieo-platforms-roi Bkex has a very bad IEO roi. Bkex's volume was unreal. it was having so many fake volume. I have ever seen IEO that launched on bkex called amepay which has become shit token right now. Stay away from bkex if you are still care with your money. Kucoin is far better than bkex.",

In my opinion, BKEX is not a good platform but during the uptrend, they do add a lot of shitcoin, luring newbie to their exchange and then doing suspicious stuffsQuote from: aubert on January 29, 2023, 04:50:59 PMKucoin is far better than bkex. Kucoin is definitely an awesome exchange. I still have more than $400 on their exchange. Their withdrawal process is extremely fast and convenient",

Usually I joined with IEO listed on Binance as launchpad and never interested for other exchange market listing IEO tokens.Better check how reputation from BKEX exchange right now and looking on current IEO have been listing there are any success token or not, I don't know still potential or not for joining any new IEO token actually listing on BKEX are not really popular exchange market. For token sold could be manipulated and be careful if you are interested for IEO on BKEX.",

Im not sure if they did cause the avalanche project has a public sale done on a different platform. They dont even did an IEO with popular market such as Binance, hence it would be impossible for BKEX to did one.IEO is good and has potential to earn profits from early price participation but since we are in a bear situation, its not good to launch any. Even Binance launchpad are not doing a high performance for their recent IEO.",

It was not launching on BKEX, much less in IEO format. BKEX does not look like absolute garbage, maybe there will be some good growth that can rewrite ATH. Although the exchange itself does not inspire confidence and I would not send money there. In any case, the best IEOs go to Binance, Bybit, Kucoin.",

Especially their trading volume is not that huge compared to some popular exchanges like Binance and Kucoin.Be aware also to some exchanges because it's already proven that there are some exchange who are manipulating the IEO for their own good.",
