  "content": "I was driving to the office this afternoon and found a crowd gathered on the flyover bridge in the city bypass. Because of the nature of the location, it will be ordinarily bewildering to find a chunk number of people gathered in that location. Well, it was the case of a beggar who purportedly disappeared with a child at a shanty house located in a closed range beneath the flyover bridge. I was extremely shocked and scared to witness the incident live at the scene. As described by one of the police men there, the culprit was a woman who was escorted with an old tattered looking man. The beggar woman disappeared with the child that was better described as a girl. I be like mogbe, this thing dey really, really happen be that?Before e happen for my kororo eye today, honestly, I been no wan believe say these things are real. For instance, day before yesterday, we been dey discuss these issues for office and I still maintained that I don't believe in it.Like my colleague at office mentioned another incident that he claimed happened in his koro-koro eye too, where a guy's pr*ck was stolen and they had to travel in several kilometers to recover it back.As we are faced with the current inflation in Nigeria, scarcity of food amongst other hardships alias current realities that are ushered by the effect of the fuel subsidy removal, many unbelievable sad stories and events continue to trend over the social media platforms.Everything put together is scary right now.What's actually going on in this our country?",

Na person do the thing and not the government, I don't see any reason why pointing finger on the government or the country.Where did this happen exactly?This thing isn't new in our country, it happen everywhere, insecurity has increased in Nigeria the past year and we need to be informed about our environment and people that we live with, the right place at the right time, security agency cannot do everything, the parent also need to do their own too. The way I see this is bad parenting! Why allow a child that don't know anything move around where they want with the situation of the country.There was a time when we go comot for huse waka anywhere we like and come back home safely when we still small, nobody is going to ask you where you went to but today, even as an adult, anytime I go visit them my parent, they call me when it is late just to check up on me anytime I don't come back home on time. The country don hot now and we need to be vigilante about security",

Really?Haven’t you seen the hardship people have being facing in the country after the fuel subsidy was removed? People are now feeding from hand to mouth in the country. We now have more beggars roaming the street than before. This incident you’re describing that happened is not the first time it is happening but we just have to be prayerful as nation since we are known for that always. This incident just depicts that people are now making use of others vulnerability to do evil against them which is inhuman. I pray a lasting solution is found to this soon. Both the government and the people have a hand to play in this to make this achievable.",
