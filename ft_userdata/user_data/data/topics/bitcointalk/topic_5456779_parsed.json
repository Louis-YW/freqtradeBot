  "content": "I can take almost any job. Here is briefly about me: I spent a year engaged in bonus hanting in casinos, I did a complete substitution identity, through a proxy, a virtual computer, registered in the casino and wagering free spins. Then I did half a year of multi-accounting airdrops, as there was knowledge of anonymity I got from bonus huntings, it was a successful case study for clients. I have experience in analytical work related to banks. I was copywriting unique posts and posting them on forums to promote crypto exchanges. I've also done the usual data gathering and searching. Manually parsing websites, etc. Ready to work 10 hours a day with no days off. I have experience in crowd-marketing. Farm retrodrops. Very well versed in cryptocurrency. Already 4 years living in the world of cryptocurrencies. So it is very easy to work with me in many areas. I can lead a farm of retrodrops, as I don't need to explain what is bridging, how wallets work, smart contracts, work in different networks, etc. In general, if you have any work, then write to me in TG @SLEDOVN.I'd be happy to hear any suggestions.TG @SLEDOVN",

In other words, you are trying to tell us you are good at cheating casinos off their bonus offers by multi-accounting and other means?How are you even proud of such?IMO, that's not ethical at all, and it shouldn't be something you are proud of or even included in your \"portfolio\". Very few people can trust someone with such unprofessional behavior to do for them their work",

      "body": "Apparently you are confusing offline work with online work. There are a lot of job options on the Internet and a lot of ways to make money. Am I proud to have done these? - Definitely not. Am I ashamed of it? - Definitely not.The casinos were giving away money and I learned how to profit from it and gained a lot of new skills. I found something and turned it around to my advantage. Your demagoguery about conscience is meaningless. You can then write to every casino owner that because of him people are losing money and making their lives hell by becoming addicted people.In any case, I described my skills and those who need workers will be able to write to me. Also, your conclusion about unprofessionalism is extremely illogical. I have cooperated with many and always cooperate honestly. Even now I have a retrodrop farm of 200 accounts under my management and I honestly keep all the data, not trying to cheat the customer.",
