They got a feature on their swap market exchange to optionally activate a \"pay miner fee with tokens\" this is good if we dont have eth or any L1 tokens on our wallet to swap our tokens for stable or any token we wish to have. Im not yet trying it but since its available I guess its very useful one.What do you think guys? I know some browser apps like jumper, bungee have refuel feature same as this but Imtoken is a longer platform since then.",

Except in most cases were someone who is already a user would testify about them, maybe a trusted individual who has been using them for long, just as for long I have been using Myetherwallet with my private keys safely stored. I could easily import them over TrustWallet (TW). However, it's good seeing that one can pay gas fee using the token at least will also reduced the tension of not having gas in the wallet. So they have a very amazing features.",

Hmmm, I think the feature is actually not what we expected.",

The pay miner fee with other token is cool and i was hoping to see it soon on metamask, i think i read something similar about mm will launch that feature but am not very sure, well, if imtoken has this feature already good for them but i will rather wait for mm to include it, am sure it won't be that long before this will happen.",

And as the creator of this topic, you should be responsible for the discussion you've started, I look forward to the validation of this feature as soon as possible from you, so we can discuss it further.Then, another question came to my mind, we know that in order to execute a transaction on the Ethereum network, of course it requires gas, how can it be possible for a transaction whose fees are paid using tokens? does imToken have its own contract infrastructure on a particular network (eg on the Ethereum network)?",

The team behind Imtoken is so flexible and you could really feel the upgrade and development on their app. I just found out of the feature since Im always using metamask. This is my alternative app actually. Also they supported a lot of blockchain and even bitcoin wallet. But I am using zerion now due to the task on galxe it could be another criteria for an airdrop.",
