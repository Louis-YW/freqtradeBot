  "content": "Base on one of my recent post titled\"Common Money Mistakes Anyone Can Make\"(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448160.msg62062701#msg62062701). One of the serious point there is SPENDING MORE THAN YOU EARN. I believe this should be discussed as a separate topic as it's a very crucial part of ones financial life. Spending more than you earn make ones keeps accumulating debt from expenditure before getting income. This isn't good for ones financial life. With this you hardly save money but keep accumulating debt. It’s better to avoid debt if you can. That way you’ll avoid paying interest on what you owe. Below are ways one can easily stop spending more than you earn:👉👉Create a Budget (or Improve Your Existing Budget)99% of the trouble that people have with money isn’t that there isn’t enough of it but that there is no plan for it once you actually get it. Your budget (either weekly or monthly) should consider your income and your expenditure. Guide your spendings for the week or month with the budget made. This might be hard at first, but having that extra cash in hand, definitely worth the effort.👉👉Use cash onlyShopping using card look more convenient and most time encourages you to buy unnecessary things even out of plans. I really observed I spend more money(even more than 20% of my salary) on airtime only any month I load airtime directly from my bank account through USSD. This is so convenient that immediately I exhausted my airtime when calling, I just dial the USSD code to get another. This doesn't help you financially. You get to stop. Knowing your Credit and Debit Card Number offhand isn't helpful for you. It makes you shop unnecessarily online. Using cash-only envelope budgeting system can help you minimize your spendings and sticks to budget.👉👉Shopping with a listThis is a lifesaver and a game changer. It’s so simple! Literally, all you have to do is write down what you need in the house that week. Make the list, and stick to it. If you only need to get chicken and vegetables and some pasta at the house for the week, there’s no reason for you to be going to the snack food section. It’s a trap!👉👉Control your grocery listHaving meal plan can help you minimize your monthly expenditure. This helps you to stop spending money unnecessarily on food without depriving yourself of your favorite treats. This will also help you to plan your week without any worries and give you the insight of all what you need from the store.  👉👉Learn to say “no”Not all goods worth buying at the moment. Although ads may be tempting but one should learn to go off any unnecessary items.Reference: https://www.pnc.com/insights/personal-finance/save/how-to-stop-spending-money.html CONCLUSIONIt's good for one to satisfy his/her desire when making purchase of items but this shouldn't cause issues in ones lifestyle. The key to stop spending too much money is to create better money habits in your daily life. But I know that’s easier said than done. Putting one or all of these ideas into action, helps in building a healthy spending habit. Take control of your spending today and you’ll reap financial rewards for years to come.",

      "body": "I agree with all your points, but the second place where you say to use cash only is partially unacceptable, although it depends on individuals. Having a shopping list is enough to make you only spend what you have written down to purchase, so going above the limit is assumed to be something you decide to do on purpose. Unless, of course, you don't have a budget to work with, which is what your first point is about. So when a person meets the other points you stated, whether they pay with cash or a card, they would still go for their intended amount to spend; going above that limit because they are paying with a card is a deliberate decision.Also, greed and a show-off lifestyle can make some people spend more than they earn.",

Some times before they receive their salaries they must have had enough bills and debt to service and that is very disturbing because they would have nothing to sustain themselves and thereby leading them to borrow another. And this keep repeating itself and over and over again and they cannot be able to save a dime for themselves.Quote from: odunybiz on April 21, 2023, 07:11:54 PMBase on one of my recent post titled\"Common Money Mistakes Anyone Can Make\"(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448160.msg62062701#msg62062701). 👉👉Create a Budget (or Improve Your Existing Budget)99% of the trouble that people have with money isn’t that there isn’t enough of it but that there is no plan for it once you actually get it.

This might be hard at first, but having that extra cash in hand, definitely worth the effort.  Sometimes shopping  without budget leads to overspending and this is not too cool. One needs to make sure to always  make out budget according to his or her level of income so as to have a little savings for reserve because no one can tell when an emergency can come up at any point in time. So therefore it is wise that one should be able to learn how to save by proper budgeting according ones level of income.",

To be successful we should earn more as well as save more, just because we earn more the spending shouldn't turn high. Being from a third world country we were able to experience how my parents provided what we need. They used to work hard and save each penny, and spend on things that is utmost necessary. Apart, with the remaining funds they prefer buying gold because they believed it to be the support platform when there is some emergency need.

Not those generic types of things like buying some food, specify it if possible so you can immediately cut costs. Though in my case in my first few times of setting up a list, I usually buy an additional or two not on it but eventually it simply became a natural part of the stuff I buy even without the list, I guess you can consider that as planned then?",
