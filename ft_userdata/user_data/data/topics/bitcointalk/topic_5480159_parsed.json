Yes, it's my own bank, which is called a cold wallet or hardware wallet, which is non-custodial and open source. So why do I need to search for anything that I don't know? Why should I search for a custodial service? Though I don't trust custodial wallets, Binance-insured funds called SAFU. I don't know the amount, but it seems they fully refill wallets in the event of any incident. So use your own bank, called Cold, or hardware wallet.",

And yes, what happened to being in control of your money that one will rather put their money in the hands of someone else in the name of “insured”. Puzzling. I will talk generally. Legal insurances have the right to fix a maximum damage that might substitute to one person depending on the initial budget he gave, the value of the item... When you bypass this limit, you will be reimbursed eventually but you will lose a big parts of your wealth. Insurances used to rotate and use the money deposited there, otherwise what's the point of it if they just keep it in a cold storage if you can already store them yourself",

I've tried visiting the website but it takes forever to load on my end so I can't see the website. I'm not sure if people who own tons of Bitcoin will apply to them due to the amount that you will only get unless you just mistakenly read how much was insured on their website.",

But if the insurance comes with hodling coins on the company's centralized platform, then there's a big issue of trusting that company to not steal your money. This particular company, as others pointed out, does not look trustworthy, so there's a very good chance that they'll scam people who entrust their coins to them. In that case, it's much better to have no insurance but to store coins safely independently.",

Instead, you can make your own insurance by saving that money. Conventional insurance service is not a scam or a waste of time. You are correct that your insurance premium might become greater than the asset's cost but it helps reduce risks. The insurance company will have to pay for damages even when you have not paid enough premiums to cover the cost of settlement. Insurance is also another means to keep money for the future because you might not be able to save by yourself.    Quote from: NeilLostBitCoin on January 03, 2024, 09:52:31 AMIf this service is legitimate, it would be wise to only deposit an amount of Bitcoin that can be insured.

From the response and proof we have seen in this thread, this is a clear scam. Keeping Bitcoin with third parties is a great risk, a non-custodian wallet is the only option.",

The standard is to understand that \"not your keys, not your coins\".
