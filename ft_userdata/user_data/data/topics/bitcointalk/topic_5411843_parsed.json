Even with that, I do not think admin want to create more boards for now. I do not know much about bitcoin networking if what you are saying is correct, but anything related to trading can be on trading discussion board.",

But if by 'networking' you mean meeting new people that are involved in trading like yourself, then i'm afraid Bitcointalk isn't the right place for that cause of privacy reasons.",

Digital MonkI don't understand what you meant by Bitcoin business and networking. Do you mean a board that will be like an exchange where you buy and sell Bitcoin? There is service board where many people offer such services.  Do you mean where to find help about trading, there is trading board. Are you saying about altcoins help there is also a board. What do you mean by Bitcoin business, there is goods board. I think every board that is relating to Bitcoin is complete in this forum.",

What is the board economics doing where you could find other child boards where relevant tooics in this aspect could fit in, i don't think there's a need for that since the forum is blessed with enough board that covers every aspect you could thought of including your locale, i will just advise you to sit down and search through the boards one after the other and discover where such could fit in for discussion, except you have another motive behind this to be done that is not projected to us but which could have be against the forum acceptability and conduct.",
