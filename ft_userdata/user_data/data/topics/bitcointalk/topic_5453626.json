For most people the sole purpose of buying and holding bitcoin is to save them self’s from traditional financial restrictions. Bitcoin has many benefits but the most important part ones is it been a store of value because it has limited supply and also hedges against inflation. For someone who is looking to save money without the fear of losing due to devaluation of the traditional financial system then bitcoin also solves that. Also bitcoin is a currency that can be use for payment purposes and this has been proved to be more efficient than traditional currencies or any other digital currencies most especially cross border transactions. Bitcoin also generates you profit while holding it because of it’s volatility which also in turns could cause loses but this can be minimized if you’re looking to hold for a very long period of time. So the best thing is for you to do your own research and compare the risk and benefit of bitcoin and then relate maybe someone like you could actually get involved.",

Are you a famous newbie investor? You need enlightenment? There are many information online that may enlighten you on why you should you buy Bitcoin. We aren't the answers whether you need to buy or not. If you really want to buy Bitcoin, learn it yourself, or find a mentor that might guide you. As for me, I will not enlighten you or whatever term you want to use. You want to buy Bitcoin? Go find information online that will help you. Go watch videos that will help you. Go read articles that will help you. We don't need to enlighten you nor you need enlightenment from us. It's already good that you have a friend that helped you. Well, what I said might be a bit harsh, but that's the reality.  Go learn, and good luck I guess.",

For the sake of emphasises, I would repeat, Bitcoin and not altcoin. In recent times, altcoins has proven to be more risky than you would have imagined with most of them dumping to never rise again and an inexperience person could easily find themselves in a deep shit.Maybe this is some means to go about your research but, I would say you should make conscious effort to understanding all that it entails before investing.",

Maybe your position in life is already a comfortable one so someone telling you about how Bitcoin can improve your living standard will not be enticing to you. There are many other benefits of bitcoins, and you just have to research and read on them yourself so maybe one of the benefits becomes catchy to you. People are buying bitcoins because of many benefits not just the benefit from investing, find a benefit of Bitcoin that is beneficial to you.",

These experts has been wrong so many times that if you follow their advise, you would end up disappointed. They predicted Bitcoin to trade at $100k last two years but it didn't happen. These guys will say everything positive to convince you to buy their courses or subscribe to their channel.Why you should invest in Bitcoin is because of the privilege that comes from using Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized so when you use it your transaction are anonymous and if you invest, you have a highly percentage of getting a good return when the bull market starts.",

I am sorry to tell you but the times where you can become very rich in a short period of time with bitcoin is over. Everybody in the world has heard of bitcoin by now, it's not a secret anymore. The times where you could mine a lot of coins or buy them cheaply is also over. Which doesn't mean that bitcoin isn't a bad investment, compared to other asset classes bitcoin offers a lot of advantage and should be part of any portfolio these days. It's important to have realistic expectations about the returns of bitcoin. If you are fine with making solid returns over longer period of time then you should definitely buy bitcoin, but if you are looking for a way to get rich overnight than you should be looking at the alt coin market and take more risky coins.",

Since someone have already introduced you to forum and you don’t feel convinced, then you have to seat yourself down and convince yourself, nobody is going to spoon feed you here, if you are not convinced yet, then you might not just invest, maybe you will be among people that will be regretting later in the future why they didn’t invest in bitcoin when someone introduced them to bitcoin.Take your mobile device visit google and read more about bitcoin or visit YouTube and watch some videos about bitcoin and cryptocurrency generally maybe that will convince you to invest, and if you are not still convinced then you can just leave bitcoin. Now the market is down, when you experience a bull run now, you will be convinced, but you might not get bitcoin at this cheap rate anymore.",

I lost a bit by investing in Bitcoin and immediately sold my investments you will never get success from Bitcoin by doing so.  Invest a certain amount of money and leave it for a long time.
