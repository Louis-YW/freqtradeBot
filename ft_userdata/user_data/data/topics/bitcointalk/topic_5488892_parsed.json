      "body": "Quote from: https://medium.com/@perrinoproperties/runes-a-beginners-guide-to-the-new-brc-20-token-alternative-9ba334c07132How do Runes work?Runes work by leveraging the existing Bitcoin infrastructure, specifically the UTXO model. In the UTXO model, transactions are made up of inputs and outputs. When a user spends a Bitcoin, the UTXO representing that Bitcoin is consumed and new UTXOs are created to represent the change.With Runes, each satoshi within a UTXO can be assigned a unique token identifier, allowing for the creation of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. When a user wants to transfer a Rune token, they simply create a new transaction that consumes the original UTXO and creates a new one with the updated token identifier.In short they create a new one shit project that claimed to solve the high fees, but they didn't want to leave Bitcoin network. Actually the best solution to solve high fees when transferring BRC-20 token is to leave Bitcoin network.Quote from: we-btc on March 14, 2024, 02:36:39 PMDo Runes support Bitcoin's purpose to be an \"electronic cash system\"?No, you're not using real Bitcoin, so there's no support or contribution to Bitcoin.There are many projects that support Bitcoin to be a currency e.g. lightning network, rootstock etc.",

      "body": "Just realized that Runes seems to be very similar to an older, but not very well-known protocol called PeerAssets (it comes originally from an old altcoin called Peercoin but is compatible with Bitcoin and all Bitcoin-based blockchains).Both use UTXOs to sort of \"visualize\" the \"payment tree\" like Bitcoin transactions, so for example the Bitcoin Core RPC commands to list transactions would also show the token transactions, and SPV clients can show them too. And in contrast to the earlier \"coloured coins\" protocols like EPOBC, the value in satoshis transferred by the UTXOs is not relevant for the transferred value at all. Also the OP_RETURN structure (containing values, decimals etc.) looks quite similar to me although the data format seems different. Both have also the advantage that they don't need any auxiliary token.The differences between both protocols are subtle:- Runes seems to have unique names (\"symbols\"). PeerAssets tokens can have names but they are not unique, so you can't identify tokens by name, only by the TXID of the creation transaction, but the advantage on the other hand is that squatting is not possible at all.- PeerAssets transactions have an additional output to a private key based on the TXID of its creation transaction called the \"Pay to Tag-Hash\" output (of value zero if permitted by the blockchain), making it possible to use it without any additional database, but bloating all transactions by ~20 additional bytes. This can be seen as a fee spendable by anyone, and also doesn't lead necessarily to a bloating of the UTXO set.- PeerAssets tokens can be \"minted\" afaik only by the token creator.It has also some similiarities to the Colu protocol from 2015, but Colu uses some offchain methods, like using torrents (hashes being stored on the blockchain) for metadata.So my impression is that this new protocol doesn't add anything really new to Bitcoin, although it is certainly better than BRC-20 and its successors.",

Remember the time when bitcoin was so expensive? That's because the network was full of these runes and inscriptions. If we really want to have a better bitcoin network, maybe supporting lightning network and using that network and they're definitely the most helpful way that you can contribute to the network, not flooding them with these worthless things, it's a good thing that they've gone a little bit since then, no worries of high fees at least for now.",

A relative who has been saying that he has a gem of a project for me mentioned runes and he said it will make him a millionaire in 2025, I just laugh very hard, it's possible though because sometimes those things that aren't making sense makes the most money in crypto but later they will end up in where they belong. Runes are not necessary, we already have so many NFT projects in the crypto space and they are all craps but running on the Bitcoin network seems like the fool's game, the fool's money will surely come in but the end will be very ugly.",

It is actually a bit more complex to what franky1 answered (as always ...   )First, the most obvious fact: You can store arbitrary data on Bitcoin since its very inception. Neither Segwit nor Taproot is needed for tokens. Doginals is a relatively new method to store NFTs and tokens on Bitcoin code from 2014/15 (Dogecoin can be seen technically as a \"pre-Segwit Bitcoin\").The problem of many of these old protocols is that they clutter the UTXO set with data which is not necessary for transaction validation. That's why OP_RETURN was introduced in 2014 or 2015. OP_RETURN allows to store data on the chain without having to store it in the UTXO set.OP_RETURN is also what would be used by Runes principally to store metadata. That is why I wrote it is better than BRC-20 and similar protocols. While BRC-20 does not clutter the UTXO set that much like a protocol in the style of Doginals, the problem of BRC-20 is that you need two transactions to move any token.The unpopular truth is: While you have a blockchain with transactions structured like Bitcoin, where you can use any data you want for public keys, amounts and sequence data, then you can't prevent the creation of tokens nor NFTs. And OP_RETURN is the best try to make that \"node-friendly\" - i.e. that they don't have to bother with cluttered UTXO sets due to tokens.There are ways to make tokens much more expensive to create, but that would need a complete rework of Bitcoin's inner workings. For example, I remember discussions about Grin, where it should be about 50-100 times more expensive to create an \"arbitrary data storage solution\" (for example, tokens or NFTs) than on BTC (given the same level of network congestion and the same unit value), because there are only few bytes on Grin per transaction you can use to store arbitrary data.",
