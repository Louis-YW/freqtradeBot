As a trader, just reading without practicing what you have learnt which involve some level of risk does you no good than having an ordinary head knowledge. Don't forget that risk is venturing into the uncertainty, so endeavor to keep it a calculated risk before diving into the final decision.This is not just about trading, this is about anything connecting to human life.

I get your point here. Even if we don't totally lose money because we don't take a risk, but the profit potential if we don't take risk will be lost.Others are negative minded, who are very afraid of losing money  which is what will prevent them from taking risks. But if we have enough knowledge on the things that we do, we can minimize the risk.Honestly, if you're not taking risks you will stay what you are but if you take a risk you will go far in life. This is true to life.",

Riski doesn't entails only investment and trading. Life is full of chances, ups and down and if you don't want to remain down, you have to take risk in anything legit to succeed. Going to school today isn't a guarantee that you are going to have a job later in the future but we risk it and invest money on it, some along the line made it to the final year and graduate while some dropped out along the line with fund wasted.

Most important message here is to take a calculated riskThere are so many obstacles in life that you have to make a step ahead if you don't want to be left behind, you can't do without risk, check out marriage for instance from statistics, how many divorcee do we have in our society, it's not working anymore for some people but does that mean you shouldn't try and find a happy home? No! You have too find a happy home and the only way to do that is by giving it a try.Likewise trading and investment, business failed and investments turn zero but shouldn't mean you never to try, the richest people we have around today have risk all they have back then to acquire the level of wealth they had today.",

Is the risk worth the reward? If it fails what do you do? What is your plan B? These are questions you ask yourself before taking a risk. Don't take risks that will wreck you if you fail. Sure, somebody takes the \"all or nothing\" risks and it works for them but it's never advisable. That's more of a gamble and not an investment. Calculated risk means you have analyzed the whole situation, the whole investment, business, or trade you're about to make. You invest what you can afford to lose. A sun that would be missed if lost, but also a sun that would not wreck you if lost is what you should use to invest.",

Everything in life has its own risk, so if you would avoid the risk and just stay in your comfort zone, nothing will happen in your life, and I think only lazy and fearful people would want that. So always encourage each one another to never be afraid to take calculated risk, because it’s only in taking risk we will be able to see the best version of us. Be it in trading, investing or in any forms of risky adventure, always know your capabilities and be brave enough in dealing with the risk. Never forget that the people who are in the peak of success today have definitely learned to take calculated risk, even if they failed at their first attempts.",

Calculated risk does not necessarily mean that you will have to use a pen and some kind of calculations before you take the risk. Calculated risk means that the risk should have high possiblity of turning positive than turning negative.It is better not to take a risk than taking an uncalculated risk. An uncalculated risk one step closer to failure and should be avoided by all means. Maybe having a simple savings will be better than taking an uncalculated risk",

The term calculated risk as contained on my post has to do with risk that can be managed by the one undertaking it. Taking risk beyond your strength  can result to a long term damage.QuoteI justify this because without an explanation what is specifically intended is just an abstract idea that makes people only know that they can write.In this case your judgement is totally wrong to have assumed that. I believe one or two must have gained something. This kind of post help people engage in critical and evaluative thinking which will help them figure out a calculated risk for every step they are about taking. If read through the reply, you will see people with different idea of what the term calculated risk means. If a newbie in trading and other investment stumble across this, I believe their mind will be lit up with knowledge.",

Stop losses are a standard tool in any sensible trading strategy. Anyone who says otherwise has never traded. I put stop losses in almost every trade. If the trade is already positive, the limit is moved up until I reach my desired target. If the trade becomes negative, a sensibly set stop loss saves me from losing too much money - or coins, of course.",

In trading, whether it's crypto or any other financial market, safe play is not at all rewarding you need to get used to taking risks. in risk management emotions play a vital role and for proper risk management, proper emotion control is required market sentiment provokes psychology.In short, to achieve both of the goals we need to decide on a scale for our trading discipline imagine a scale that you will make X amount of profit in your timeline and Y amount of Loss. Whined you hit any of the ends on the scale exit the market and reset your timeline. it will greatly help in risk management while training and emotion control as by-products.",
