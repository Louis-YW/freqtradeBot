Most crypto purchase options with credit or debit will require some types of verification to prevent credit card fraud. This is pretty standard as they are considered high risk transactions. You can read more about it in our FAQ and KYC sections of the support pages. You can always try and if it does come up then you dont have to proceed as well.",
