I can remember when the fee went up as high as 50 sat/vbyte and more than 100 sat/vbyte. I was able to use ViaBTC free accelerator at the time with 18 sat/vbyte for segwit version 0 address to segwit addressÂ  version 0 address. That saved me fee during the time.If a transaction is stuck, replace-by-fee can be used to pump the fee even without accelerator if you are capable to pay high fee during highly mempool congestion.",

It asks $999 for getting 3 confirmations in 60 seconds, $500 for getting 1 confirmation in 5 minutes, $50 for getting confirmation in 11 minutes, $25 for getting confirmation in 30 minutes and $15 for getting confirmation in 1 hour. To any newbies reading this post:There is no way to give a precise time for transaction confirmation and the website I wrote about is a scam. As already mentioned by Charles-Tim above, ViaBTC service is the only working free accelerator.",

Very soon as well most nodes will have adopted the option of full rbf, so tx fees can be bumped, even when those tx's weren't flagged as rbf when they were broadcasted.",
