      "body": "My initial encounter wasn't positive. During the active phase of the revenue-sharing Ponzi scheme, some individuals encouraged me to invest using Bitcoin. Despite my reservations about Bitcoin's volatility initially, I eventually became persuaded. I purchased Bitcoin and invested it in the Ponzi scheme without fully understanding what a Ponzi scheme was, naively assuming they wouldn't turn out to be fraudulent. Sadly, I lost all my Bitcoin as a result. I remained disconnected from the online world for a few months until I comprehended the nature of Ponzi schemes and started advocating against them. Subsequently, I became engaged with a forum and began contributing. Over time, I resumed purchasing Bitcoin and have since become an established Bitcoin investor.",

I think I first bought these copper coins from the “Anonymous Mint” which had the bitcoin symbol stamped on one side. I liked the coins and bought a couple rolls.

How wrong I was then.I was in the same shoe as you, A lot of us missed the very first opportunity or encounter with Bitcoin due to zero knowledge and no detailed information available then within my area such as the level that it is right now, so then I saw Bitcoin as something that would end soon because of my various experiences with Ponzi scheme trending as at the time when I first knew of Bitcoin in 2017, that made me had this mindset that Bitcoin was not going to last.",

The only vivid memory is feeling super anxious while setting up my first electrum wallet and making my first transaction. I stared at the wallet in disbelief for a good chunk of time as I waited for the coins to reach their destination. Fast forward years later, I still cross-check every address when I make transactions, even though I'm doing them almost daily. I suppose it's a good habit, as it's helped me avoid accidentally sending coins to the wrong address.",

If you remember your first Bitcoin experience so please tell me.I bought my first Bitcoin from a physical bitcoin vendor,  i bought $10 worth of bitcoin just too feel how bitcoin is and how it looks like. It was so exciting to have bitcoin in my wallet, I felt like having something so much precious with me but I couldn't keep it with me. I sold my first Bitcoin because of fear for volatility because I was new to it, no experience to give me comfort over the market. My first experience having bitcoin in a wallet was joyous.",

You are definitely right that BTC's journey from being a novel concept to becoming famous or very well-known is a remarkable part of its history. The concept of HODLing has indeed become synonymous with BTC, reflecting a long-term investment approach and faith in its potential. From time to time on BTC history it is captivating to consider the possibility of someone carrying their passion for BTC throughout their entire lifetime. As far as I remember I owned BTC before through airdrop or collecting faucets because before I was afraid of getting hacked when purchasing BTC.",

I started by reading a random article on the internet, then created my first wallet on Blockchain.com and started messing with faucets. Back then, there were so many faucets that your mind couldn't perceive them. I remember countless lists of some kind of provider, of which I can't remember their names, who were acting like middlemen. Multiple faucets paid directly to them, and after accumulating a decent amount, you could go ahead and withdraw it to your actual wallet. I'm pretty sure that in the hypothetical scenario of these middlemen still existing today, I'd have decent amounts of BTC abandoned in them. Then there was the Xapo wallet, which had its own list of faucets that paid directly to their wallet.Oh man, I wish I could go back in time, not just for the BTC but to relive being young and carefree.",
