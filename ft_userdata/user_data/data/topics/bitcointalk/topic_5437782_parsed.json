  "content": "Is one of the centralized exchanges in trouble again? CEO is arrested because he was embezzling $50M worth of money but can it go down like because users and partners would panic and withdraw their funds and partnerships? Are they solvent enough for that? Or is the owner just going to be voted out from the CEO position as he has only 34.2% stake in it and everything goes on like nothing happened?What do you think?Source:https://cryptoslate.com/south-korean-authority-arrests-bithumb-owner-over-50-million-embezzlement-charges/",

This is becoming of a trend that big people in the market including the owners of exchanges are becoming involved with such fund from their depositors. Regardless of the reason of the arrest, this teaches only one thing.\"Never store your funds in exchanges.\"",

There’s a lot of FUD and rumors already about this and that is your biggest reason not to trust this site anymore. Another reminder to stay active with your exchange and if there’s a news like this you have to act as fast as possible, don’t store your long term holdings on any crypto exchange because its not safe at all.",

This is not the best time for fraudulent exchanges as their Top board members are getting exposed for illegal dealings.",

If you have cryptos on this site get it now but don’t panic, transfer it to your secured wallet. Anyway, I don’t think the whole market will be affected by this news as we are already rising but there’s still a possibility if this issues will be affected their users, hopefully the up trend will stay strong and will not be affected by this negative news.",

This is particularly concerning for anybody who has money sitting in a single exchange given the state of the market today. We all understand that the primary benefits of cryptocurrencies are their purported safety and anonymity, but it seems even regulated exchanges are no longer a secure refuge for our money.That one person, even one with a relatively minor role inside the company, may have such power over our finances is disconcerting. You should thus pay great attention to market developments and news. A solid solution to avoid these kinds of issues is to keep our money out of exchanges and instead in a wallet that we have total control over.",

However, based on quite a variety of cases, he will only be fired and the vacant position will experience a significant impact. Starting from distrust of traders and performing simultaneous withdrawal actions may result in account suspension. Not a few cases like this will have an impact, the result is a decrease in trading volume. I do not expect the adverse impact that we will see on the bitcoin price.",

Yeah, i didn't like the site and markets don't seem to care so i guess we are fine. If we are going to use FTX as an example, i heard they had they had some reserves in FTT token, which would be insanely irresponsible. I was little afraid that if there would be bank run and again they would need to dump altcoins to get their reserves back and some companies invested in it would fall with it. But maybe this would be in a different scale anyway.",

Any failure of the CEO is always connected to the exchange since he is using the exchange for his personal gain. People will never trust again this kind of exchange even if they will change their CEO. Bithumb is already crumbling in the Korean market due to competition and tighten security for shady behavior of exchange. I think filing bankruptcy is their next move instead of risking more losses when they continue their operations since people will be scared using it. Users are probably escaping their asset from the exchange since this is almost same scenario with the FTX scandal.",

But, I think there are still risks in these types of trades. Not all crypto exchanges are scams/fraud but there are still exchanges left who are trustworthy. It's only not advised to store funds on them for a long time if you have no business there. For what if we have a crypto wallet if we don't use them?There might be other explanations to the case of @Jerometash. Maybe he did some violations and the exchange delete his account, that is why he can't log in it anymore and he said he didn't bother complaining, maybe because he is really guilty.",
