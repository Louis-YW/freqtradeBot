I cannot find them in electrum_data\\config   fileI am using the portable version of ElectrumThey are baked in to the Python source, which you cannot access from the Windows EXEs since Python code is compiled down during the build process. But if you run Electrum directly from the Python interpreter, there should be files littered in your Python's site-packages folder, and these contain the full source code of all Python packages including Electrum, which you can even modify (although be advised that any changes you make will be overwritten on the next update).",
