I wonder if they will continue to post if viewers, merits, or paid campaigns disappear completely?If you join a campaign, you are paid, being paid can motivate you. If I would be truthful, if no payment again, the motivation will surely reduce, I will only prefer to post in wall observer and few other boards. I won't leave but my post count will significantly reduce. Being paid makes this forum more active. Those that spam the most are bounty hunters and 1xbit campaign participants. This forum is working good this way, with the merit system.Quote from: Ucy on August 31, 2022, 10:07:54 AMI know of people who post their minds whether there are views/rewards or not.

You can ignor users of your choice. I go for quality posts, I do not ignor users, but there are posts I prefer to read. It all depend on what you want. You can even ignor all boards and stay only on off-topic board, but I see off-topic not useful for me, I am only there to report some spam and scam posts.Quote from: Ucy on August 31, 2022, 10:07:54 AM*Here is a word of advice to passionate posters, you don't need forum views or forum rewards to change the World.

That is the kind of forum experience I want... post from the heart.I can decide to write a post from my heart about how my dog (Maxi) died a few years ago, i could talk about how horribly i felt and still feel till now, but nobody, utterly nobody in the forum actually wants to hear about that, that is why if i make the mistake of posting it in any section outside of the off-topic board, it would be moved right into there, that gives you an idea of what the off-topic section is for, posts that most members here do not care about, it doesn't matter if it came from the heart or wherever, it is not useful in the forum.Needless to say that it is quality posts that matter, and not posts from the heart, that is why it was unexpected that the sort of paradigm you want for the forum is from a member's posts in the off-topic section, hell, i don't feel anybody else wants that. The way i see it, even if a member posts in a certain way that you don't like, if it is not spam and is quality posts that help the forum and keeps its integrity up, then we will take it.",

Hmm, how's this imbalance of passion read in your own scale of prejudice? Huh? If you look at the whole thing from the critical aspect, shunning any form of sentiment then you'll understand that people don't take much pleasure in doing something they're not paid for....

It was made to be interactive all round* atleast to some point except you don't want 'em around so you need views because we are all teaching and learning in the same process so you can't say you're teaching people when nobody is listening, can you?As for the benefits, I think the invention of merit wasn't a misconception and also users we're not meant to run away from getting merited; tbh I sometimes see alot of good Post that I shouldn't hesitate to merit but is either I'm too busy or out of Smerit.Cancel that ideology dude.QuoteI can guarantee you that if your post or idea is revolutionary, it will be noticed and used even if the view counter is showing \"zero view\"... and you definitely get rewarded for the great idea.

This is mystery only those who are awake will understand. Well. As for me the rewards in the forum makes bitcoin more familiar and famous in the whole world.¬† All the forums I have used in the internet, this forum has the highest rules. Mostly the plagiarism rule which is making people to avoid copy and paste. If there is no rewards people would copy articles and paste it here and got ban, because for them banning is nothing since it doesn't benefit them but because of the rewards everyone is careful about their post for the fear of ban and also to sustain (active) their accounts in the forum. Yes some users are to impress but not all. Some are posting to increase their activities, so whether you are impressed on not impressed is not their issue. While some are for their count post. In the process or among of all these people there are good posts. Therefore, you can't classified everyone as impressive posters. Even the off-topic board you mentioned have a lot of impressive and shit post. The main thing is not even about impressive posts but the knowledge that is giving to others is the main thing.",

      "body": "Passion is highly subjective and can be interpreted differently by different people. Passion is also not mutually exclusive from extrinsic motivation to fulfil a task. Hence, a forum user can be passionate and get be motivated by a paid signature they are wearing. This of course does not mean, they simply come up with things to write to reach a post quota, rather spend more time on the forum and get to share what they think more.As an illustration; I frequent some social platforms and would usually come across content I like there and have something to contribute to, but more often than not, I would not engage such content (could be due to laziness, lack of decire to enter a virtual discussion with a stranger, or laziness). On the forum, however, for someone wearing a paid signature, there is more of a motivation to type out what they think and share with others.P.S, there are lots of spam posts made to meet some shit bounty quota. I'm discussing on regular users who have an interest to contribute.",
