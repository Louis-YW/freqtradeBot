The receiver should neither want that, even if he happens to have such large receiving capacity, as it'll cost him to rebalance afterwards. Briefly, the remote nodes respond with failure, because you both exceed the max number of HTLCs allowed, and because you don't have enough sats to cover the fee.",

I am trying to do an atomic swap to get inbound liquidity for my channel, so I have to pay for an onchain fee and I want to minimize my costs on a relative basis. Why do you say \"You're about to pay 0.01 BTC in fees\"? It is a 0.05 BTC transaction and I set the routing fee limit to 0.1% (which should be more than sufficient based on the channel fees I see and the number of hops required), so routing fees are capped to 0.00005 BTC.

No I don't share a channel directly with the node I want to swap coins with. I was doing that for privacy reason so that node would not know both my node info and UTXO info. Should I do otherwise?

When making a payment in lightning, the receiver doesn't know the node that paid the invoice, they only know the last node which routed the transaction. In other words, their node won't know if you are the one who swaps the coins, you could just be routing that. Quote from: Jodmapht on May 30, 2023, 03:00:22 PMShould I do otherwise?

In any case, you should absolutely no send a payment of 5 million sats, which requires multiple routes to finalize.",
