I wouldn't recommend it if OP wants to spend less amount and time on a signature design. I've seen some signature designers like Zwei who only charge $15 per set of signature designs. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3431093.0I want to give it a try but I find it somewhat challenging to create an ASCII art logo for ElonCoin.",

I also have designed some signature before but I haven't had the chance to update the images on my service thread here because of the imgur problem, all images I uploaded is not viewable. I charge min. $10 for a set. You can contact me here for faster response if you'd consider. Thank you!",
