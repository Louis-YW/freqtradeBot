I don't know the depositor name.  Also I think he joined since February and last deposit 2 days ago. Maybe the the other deposits is  since months ago.  So the commission or wager amount must show up already. Checked Stunna profile he rarely active recently but will do as you adviced thank you.

No one will perhaps answer your questions here and it is only Primedice or the affiliate department that can explain this I think we will wait until they will give a response.

I don't know where they find those support agents. It’s not a bot but rather that’s the only thing support can do since there power is limited and your issue is about affiliates which other department handle. Just do the advice of other user to contact Stunna or post your concern on PD thread since they have an active representative there that will help you to connect to right person.

Moreover it's surprising to reply that if the affiliate has actually not gambled anything yet. I agree, the reply provided by the customer service agent may have been unprofessional as they should atleast provide other option if they can't provide or disclose any information from the account.However, the customer/gambler or the OP should have not insisted asking for information regarding his affiliates as those cannot be disclosed. Anyways, OP can either confirm to his affiliate if he did wagered his deposit or not.

Also if a person deposit to stake or Primedice  then he cannot withdraw without wagering atleast 10% of his deposit it's for the AML policy. So your theory cannot be possible. Also another theory I had is the player tipped his coins but also cannot be possible as to be able to tip or chat you need to wager. That's why all logical theories cannot be possible.
