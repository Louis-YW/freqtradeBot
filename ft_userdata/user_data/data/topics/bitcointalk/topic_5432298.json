In any investment, profit is not assured most of the time, especially in this industry wherein market prices are volatile or changing from time to time. Losing is the only thing certain especually if you won't be having the right guess. The idea of investing only an an amount you can afford losing is ideal. But think if there are even people who does it. Ofcourse all of us are having high hopes of earning profit from doing so, because why would you even invest into something if you are not having assumptions that you'll get something from it? Money is just tempting that it would abide our personal boundaries or limitations set for ourselves.",

Do you have that EXTRA money that you can afford to lose  Well, you are playing a dangerous game but at least you are aware of the risk since you are not new to bitcoin. To answer your question, I only invest the amount I can lose, meaning part of my salary goes to the savings account and I use only part of it to buy bitcoin. I could invest more, but I don't wanna get into situation that I need to sell bitcoin with a loss just because I need cash asap.",

Do you have that EXTRA money that you can afford to lose  No matter what your class is, be it a lower class, middle class or high class when it comes to business and investment,  one needs to be very versed in so many areas especially when it comes to a high-risk investment like cryptocurrency. So for that everyone have to invest by buying bitcoin at whatever time and there is nothing like spear many every money have equal value and individual have scales of preference, some spend they spear money on bears while others invest that money in something tangled and of increasing value. But above all one most be diversified in several areas and to attain success in one life the level of their investment and area of interest matter, directly or indirectly.",

According to the generally accepted definition, the middle class refers to the social group between the upper and working classes. This means that many individuals within this group have some financial stability, including the ability to save for retirement and the means to indulge in occasional luxuries like dining out or taking vacations. Yes, it is generally advised to only invest funds that you can afford to lose in any type of investment, including bitcoin, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't invest. If you have a little bit of cash sitting around, or you have money set aside for the future, it may be worth considering a small investment in bitcoin as part of your portfolio so that you can take advantage of what could be a profitable opportunity in the coming years.Quote from: UmerIdrees on December 29, 2022, 04:25:12 PMYes, i invest in bitcoins but it is not EXTRA money and I am afraid I can't afford to lose. Do you have that EXTRA money that you can afford to lose  There is always a risk that your investment could lose money, so it's important to make sure that you are financially prepared for that possibility. As a rule of thumb, it is best to limit your investment to what you could afford to lose without it affecting your lifestyle or ability to pay bills. Unlike many in the working class, the middle class has the financial resources to make this type of investment.",

Do you have that EXTRA money that you can afford to lose  You spoke the reality of many of us, several of us don't have extra money talk more of having one we can afford to lose, many of us are buying bitcoin with our savings(like you said) and hoping we don't lose it, but rather, make some profit on it.But there is another context to this analogy which maybe you forgot to mention or you don't realize,To buy Bitcoin with extra money one can afford to lose does not necessarily mean just as it is said, it also means that one should only buy Bitcoin with money they won't be making use of in the near future, this is because buying bitcoin with hopes of making profit on it is a long term investment, it could take a month, two or more or even years to see a tangible profit on the initial amount you bought bitcoin with.So it makes no sense buying bitcoin today, and tomorrow, you sell it because you need the money to attend to another urgent matter that seem more important, so this is why it is advised to only buy Bitcoin with money one can afford to lose, which in other words means to buy Bitcoin with money you won't be needing or making use of at a significant long period of time.",

Do you have that EXTRA money that you can afford to lose  Of course, it's hard to follow this to the tee, the world is very different now, and if you don't know how to reinvent yourself to make extra money, then it's hard to invest on crypto. But what I do is that I invest 10% of my monthly income to bitcoin and bitcoin only, that's it, maybe a few altcoins, but majority is to bitcoin. But there were times that I can't invest that 10% because of some emergency that I uses all my fiat for expenses and others. But that's my rule, just 10% and I'm good with that, no pressure, whatsoever and I can still continue to invest on bitcoin with my 'extra' money. And I would say that it is very effective strategy to me.",

But we should always have a plan when investing into any asset, and this plan should involve growing our income stream, if we do not have much left over to spare.The major mistake you would make is trying to use bitcoin as a means to get rich. It doesn't exactly work that way, and you could as easily lose out the amounts you invested into it. Focus on growing skills which are in demand and getting paid for your services; you can then choose what percent of your income goes to Bitcoin (and any other investment) and which goes into your savings.Quote from: aoluain on December 29, 2022, 06:48:15 PMIs there really a risk though?Yes it is.If you invest amounts you might need at a not too distant future, there's no guarantee that you would be in profit at the exact time you need it and could be forced to sell at a loss.",

I believe no matter how rich you are, if you lose money it might not affect you but it will pain you, nobody really wants to lose money.

I believe it is because of these kind of people we are told to invest extra money in BTC, that is money we would not need fast, it doesn't mean it has to be a small amount of money.I will replace invest only extra money in BTC with invest only money you would not be needing in some years time, BTC isn't like altcoins that collapses, and people may think that when we say extra money we say so because BTC could collapse, but i don't think it can, the advice is for you to understand that when you invest in BTC it should probably be for the long run, and the money shouldn't be needed by you for a long while.",
