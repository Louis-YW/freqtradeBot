      "body": "I love them, I have probably not been with for so long and have still only invested in the first 2 packages.And am saving together for the next package so I can get more shares. But already in 3 days I have been paid money to my wallet and I was surprised at how fast it went. I am used to when you ask for a payout so it often takes 1-2 weeks, and have also tried a company where I gave up when I had waited for 2 months for a small payout. But here went, yes I do not actually know how fast it went, but when I checked an hour later they were on my wallet I'm so looking forward to them getting the new exchange done. But already now their coins have doubled in value. Fuck I'm looking forward to it growing even more. Can only say one thing, I've damn finally found my shelf",

PyramidPRO may adjust the threshold requirements based on the current situation of the User. you are absolutely wrong... and need to understand the concept here..Â  our decentralized part here is our users can hold their own money on their own private wallets. And we as exchanges don't need to hold millions of dollars in crypto. The Centralized part with login help to secure, even if YOU do lose your private keys, then who ever have access to your key ways cant access your orders, staking and more on our decentralized exchange, for the first step is you also need login to your profile before you can unstake, before you can cancel orders and more.also you are saying nowadays.... well I think you need to look forward in time and not on nowadays.Â  Â its a question about time before regulators finally regulate the crypto space, and all exchanger/ lending site and so on who is dealing with other people's money as service need to be regulated as well, and before that can happen KYC is a requirement if you want to be legal in as many counties you can, and to give the best support..we have already finished staking, the affiliate site and our Token. .. seems like you did not look deeper into our concept and just judgingÂ  I am agree mostly exchangers or even companies don't focus on their service, and that is one of our top priorities...",

Your quote is your our internal share system, where we can ask users to send extra prof who they are. if you become shareholder of any exchange, I am VERY sure you also need to send information who you are, with ID and more.and if we only have as goal to collect money, who do we give 80% aways to our internal shareholders.. make no sense to me what you are saying...",

I am not killing the point of any decentralized thing here, we added an extra layer of user protection to secure user's orders, staking and more... also more and more countries require KYC, BANK details and more... We are NOT hiding who we are, and therefor we need to be sure who are on our exchange, we need follow the rules in the countries we register in. and it will also make it more easy when moving forward going into new countries.and not sure where you get the porn from... did you watch that? when you were writing your post here... hahaha... but anyway.. we do not focus on our affiliate part with internal share, its basic running itself, but it is a part of the exchange, and whoever has shares with us, is getting a part of the total revenue... i am very sure in any company where you are buying shares, you will also want to know how you get paid and for what and when. But we will keep people updated here or telegram next month when we have big news for the exchange.",
