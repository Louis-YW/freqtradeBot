If built very well, the format and users' experience on apps is better than on web browsers. But web browsers are not bad too.Quote from: bitbollo on June 01, 2023, 02:18:09 PMall gambling related sites have been removed from google store (at least in our country, ITALY)... so you need to download it directly from their sites ( if available like duelbits)...I think it's much easier use just the url betting with a browser... You are correct, gambling site apps are not on playstore, it has to be downloaded from their site. But many gambling sites do not bother to have one.",

I know that some gambling sites have apps but I did not go for it just because I am good with the browser. But gambling are generally better on apps than browsers.

It is good for a gambling site to focus on one if the gambling site can not maintain security for the other, I mean for the app. But I have noticed that big gambling sites have apps and no security breaches.",

You can download the app here https://megapari.com/mobile. The only cons on using the website is their mandatory KYC when you withdraw your funds and some fee for crypto deposit but the app is working properly.Bitcasino has an app too but they don’t have sportsbook so I won’t include it here but their sister company Sportsbet has which you can download here https://sportsbet.io/promotions/sportsbetio-app. So far crypto casino doesn’t prioritize mobile applications since most of them is running properly on a mobile browser.",

There may be a risk that someone enters or violates and takes your data, so I do not recommend it for that reason , I have quite a few coworkers who do not get off the phone , they do everything out there, they are not totally dependent , it is difficult to tell these people that they do not continue with their phone , so when it comes to casinos they do not hesitate to do it There , just like a casino has its App they can play there and do not take Risks.",

I mean yes the advertising users all get a red tag, but there are many users that have a red tag and usually those tags are only checked if somebody is considering to trade with those users.Still the casino is a scam and you maybe should not just remove it, but put a warning about this casino in the list. Is in general very wise to not just use any casino, but only use a reputable casino.",

It's a fault really not his, for as you can see apart from the OP, he alophie12 I think is also a newbie to the forum too. And that's why the forum needs to do more enlightenment about all scam related gambling sites in the forum for the awareness of many if not all members of the community, you shouldn't be surprised there are some full member rank members that have no clue about 1xbit as scam reputed site not to talk of a newbie.It's just a shame that the administrators and moderators can do no much in their power about the total elimination of such kind of gambling site but just ditching of negative tags to their promotors in the forum. But then, like someone said, we should try to do a research on any site before recommending it to others in the event of proffering a solution.",
