So that the community would be that fully aware on which site it would be.It cant really be that surprising about verification when it comes on hitting up huge amounts and considering its $100k winning then im not surprised.This is one of the shittest moment whenever you are trying to pull off huge amount winnings neither its not caused by the casino itself but with the provider but having that 1 week time waiting? Somethings not feel right! It shouldnt really last that long.",

Thanks in advance!!The first step to getting help here is to at least reveal the name of the casino, I see you are brand new here and i must let you know that Bitcointalk has a large community of gamblers, somebody might have had a similar experience on the same casino and will be willing to share with you what they did to have their funds released  to them.or maybe their funds was never released and the casino isn't one you should trust and keep playing with, you will also be told.But my personally advice is to stop playing on casinos without a proven track record, choose a reputable casino, one that does not delay in paying you your winnings even if it is running into millions of dollars, there are many of such casinos on this forum, and one of them is stake.com.if you get your payment, i advice you change the casino mate.",

Give them first the benefit of the doubt and let them check all of those reports or what so they can verify your win.If you've done nothing wrong then you're a legitimate winner of that game and on their casino.There's nothing to worry about if that casino has a good reputation and you've been playing there long time ago but it's better to give that name.",

Thanks in advance!!Not to burst the bubble for you, we have heard similar stories, and they are all here in this board,  Scam Accusations. I'm not saying to create one, although there could be accusations on casinos, some of them payed right away if their fraud department determining that the player won without taking advantage of the casinos, in short it was clean.So in your case if you think you won fairly then all you have to do is wait for them to release the winnings to you.",

This looks as if you are advertising a scam casino website or perhaps a victim of a clone website that has wasted your time and effort.Quote from: SweetL0u on November 07, 2022, 07:44:09 PMI have experienced the same thing last year.

Are you an FBI or special detective who knows what is happening in people's minds.Quote from: Blawpaw on November 07, 2022, 08:00:05 PMYou should at least give us a name and warn others.

At least this was how I worked my issue out when it happened to me...Not like the casino have a support or an announcement thread on the bitcointalk, this suggestion may not yield much effort, I don't believe OP by the way because why would anyone gamble on such a casino that has the name starting USDT.DRAGON7.GAMES. It looks shady by name, the arrangement looks like something designed for landing scam pages often used to advise fake products, so much untransparent stuff from OP",

      "body": "You could at least name the casino website you played with so that the members could give more insights about your situation. Dropping names of the website isn't really prohibited here so might as well tell it so that the situation will be looked in considerable angle for both sides. If it was a reputable casino, you have a little to be worried about. Sometimes this just happens, especially if you won a big amount, The verification process is sometimes slow because of several factors such as there are many players withdrawing their winnings just like you and they are thoroughly verifying the information you have given them such as the information provided in the KYC process to withdraw your fund.Since this is a big amount, you could try to follow up for their verification on your case. Ask them about  an update on your winning withdrawal. If you don't hear from them and yet they remain active in other sorts of form, you could file a legal action about his matter to make you at ease. Now, if you happen to play in an unknown website that isn't really proven to be credible because of few feedbacks about it, then you are partly to be blame. This is because if a casino hasn't established yet their credibility, it could always turn out to be a scam. You just have to hope that everything will turn out great on your end if ever this is the case. New casinos who don't have license and reputation to uphold can vanished without a trace because they don't have anything to prove to their clients after all.",

Regardless of how OP found the site, he mentioned that he was able to claim his big winnings smoothly before with no problem that's why he is concerned now about his pending withdrawal status for a long.Since OP was asked to proceed with verification, then no choice but to comply with it if he really wants to pursue getting that amount.",

Thanks in advance!!What you can do to push them all about the status of your verification but seeing from the name of site and i never seen this site before. It seems a poor website. Your verification might not be processed by them if you didn't even try to push them. The domain of site has been making me feel doubt if that site will pay your reward. Mostly of members are always facing the problem with verification once they got the big amounts of money from winning big multipliers. Sometime the site didn't wanna pay them due to the various reason like liquidity problem or etc. There are so many people who had similar problems like you. My first time to see dragon7.games, the name itself doesn't even represent if the site was trusted even tough if it has been used for a few years by you.",
