  "content": "Good day!Dear All,This morning I saw a neutral tag given by Shashan related to a collateral loan I didn't commit. I know this reason can be skeptical to others. My mistake was that I overlooked a message sent to shashan during my inactive time. Quote from: ShashanThis unknown user continuously makes a comment to Shashan's thread that I didn't notice because if someone messages me, most likely I open those immediately to check if there's a revision for the translations I made. But the user keeps deleting the conversation, which is the reason why too late to catch them up. Also, Gmail is not linked to my phone, so I didn't receive a notification about their conversation, and shashan showed this to me. My account password didn't change seems like I experienced a DOM Attack.QuoteQuoted below is the address I'm only using in the forum.Quote from: Peanutswar on November 20, 2022, 05:03:44 AMQuote from: odolvlobo on November 20, 2022, 04:44:06 AMQuote from: Peanutswar on November 20, 2022, 03:17:32 AMGood day everyone I would like to update my wallet addressA better way to update your address is to sign the message containing the new address with your old address. Anybody who acquires your account could post a message saying that they are changing the address, but only the original owner can sign that post with the original address.Without signing using the old address, here are the possibilities:1. You are the original owner.2. You are not the original owner, and you hacked the account.3. You are not the original owner, and you bought the account.Thanks for the information.This is my old wallet addressCode:-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----This is peanutswars, old wallet address bc1qh45r8qdp5zqf5cux77sq0k3gmjdljv4jdac0n0 and would like to add my new wallet address bc1qnrcpx4q970yhp5t0qqgu5svcu27982cpdd8xnl-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----HwfgN/Z/80aAv1DRUsndg1yWcqi/3IOEOW22lMA2YQ3LdJLn5CNsJbwOVHY3knLRxwEL1ujUQgRN7fO1wW4YHt8=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----This is my new wallet address.Code:-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----This is peanutswar 11/20/22 new wallet address bc1qnrcpx4q970yhp5t0qqgu5svcu27982cpdd8xnl-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----ILiYa+mSEiu7SB/crI/OujyjELPwJr6tno2mrqIcI0ImOEZvDNHx7EF4eyQwmXeN9WIxVJEN6376YpJp3p3EGp8=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----I will repay Shashan but not on the designated date given to the loan; every time I receive a payment in a Signature Campaign/another source of income, I will deposit this immediately to Shashan's Address as repayment for the trouble created by that hacker.I created this thread to be aware that I will only use the quoted and signed address to prevent this from happening again. If someone receives a request not with this address, please don't entertain it. I changed all of the password related to this account.Â  After noticing this issue of that, there's someone can access my account.",

Of course an intruder can easily change this line as well, but if some others will remember that I don't take loans this will make it harder to take a loan from my name. At least some can ask why and what happened and it will take time.If there was a universal option for everyone to declare that they never take any loans it'd be even better. But making a separate topic for that would be too complicated and I don't see any easy way for that.Maybe asking a signed message from known addresses of a user by default will be a good decision for loan service.",

I highly advice you to make a full format of your PC (I don't know how deep was your cleaning) and change immediately all the passwords to essential services that you have (banking, services, governmental websites, e-mail...). You don't know for how long did the hacker had access to your account (or PC?) so one can never be too careful. If you don't use it, password managers[1][2][3] are also a great addition to increase the security of your accounts (it isn't foolproof, the greatest anti virus is always between the ears  ).[1]https://psono.com/[2]https://keepassxc.org/[3]https://bitwarden.com/",
