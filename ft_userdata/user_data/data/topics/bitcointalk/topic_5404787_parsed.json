  "content": "Hello I have about 4 dollars in litecoin in bitget and I wanted to move them to a stable currency as usdc and start doing trading with btc mainly but bitget does not let me..it tells me minimum 5 dollars.....What options do I have to move those 4 dollars in litecoin to another currency without having to buy?I did not want to buy at the moment because I want to make sure I follow the correct steps when buying anonymously (I got those 4 dollars as a gift).The only option I can think of is to take a dollar of those 4 dollars that I have and make a leverage of x10 and try to make some more money trading with that x10....would that be possible? or could you suggest another way I could turn that litecoin into another coin?",

(it probably won't take many trades before your account gets too low).",

      "body": "Honestly if you’re worried about trading four dollars, do you think you should really be doing so? I’m not saying this to be rude so please don’t take it that way, but $4 dollars is a pretty small amount of money but if it’s a lot in your country, then maybe simply saving it in something more safe/secure would be a better idea? ( I’m a financial advisor so just trying to be helpful here ).",

I repeat, do not do futures trading or else you will even lose those $4 of Litecoin you are keeping.Just leave the Litecoin in there until it rises into value, then you can exchange it for any stablecoin",

In your case, believe me, it's totally intentional.Anyway,, leave them there, you can come back in a few months? Years? but do not deposit unless it is your decision.",

The other way is obviously as you said to earn some bucks but this is highly risky, the way I am seeing this you really love this 4$ as well so trading will bring this to risk for once, you might lose all of it in just one go especially if you are doing this leverage trading so best is to put 1$ from your side and start doing normal spot trading.",
