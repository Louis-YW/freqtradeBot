This is only the second thread in this theme, though, I agree that that same question could be asked on the previous one, or just to recreate into the \"Calculations\" thread or something, if OP is eager to ask math, though it can be done by himself, so the topic is there just to be answered in 5-10 minutes If there would be more of such, then, yeah, it's obvious that it's done for things you described.",
