Just looks like cheap copy and paste clip art.The promo pics for Series 1 with the Bitcoin Bull, Satoshi Jones, Elon, etc. are really eye catching. Nothing really comparable in the Series 2 promo pics.You would think they'd add some of the best artwork for the Series 2 promo pics like they did with the first series.I'm keeping my hopes up, but will wait and see before I jump into collecting Series 2.",
