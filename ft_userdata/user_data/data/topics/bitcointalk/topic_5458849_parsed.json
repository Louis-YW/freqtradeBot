Have you seen anyone in this forum who is Jr member or Member rank wearing an Avatar? So you must to be a Full Member or above to upload avatar on your profile. To be a Full Member you must have 100 Merits with 120 Activities. I can see you are now a Jr member and grow yourself and be a Full Member to wear Avatar and colourful Signature code.",

      "body": "OP, protocols are necessary in every platform, organizations and where ever one finds him or her self. So therefore I believe it is applicable here that one must grow above the rank of a junior member before one is deemed fit to upload avatar. So in that case, you would have to rank up to a full member before you can be able to use an avatar for your profile.Nevertheless, there is no restrictions to one putting avatar unless otherwise and if it comes to wearing signature code, the restriction is that the account is banned from activities here on ground of fluanting the forum policies and regulations.",

So if you want to have an Avatar on your profile you'll have to work hard and achieve at least a full member rank.",

I think a forum staff member has also provided a fairly precise answer to your question, even though it's short, but easy enough for you to understand. Now your job is just to try and be patient to upgrade your account according to the conditions that apply to everyone so that you can use the avatar you want on your own profile and at least you have to be a Full Member, not a Junior Member or Member mate.",
