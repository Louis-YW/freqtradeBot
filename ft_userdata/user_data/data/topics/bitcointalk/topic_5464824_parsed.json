Strangely, I didn't find any information on restricted countries. @OP, does Koinpark really accept global users without exception?",

Aside from the unpleasant reviews that are made by others here over the platform, I personally feel like you went too far to say that it is the best cryptocurrency platform. Meanwhile, before jumping into grandiose conclusions like this, I strongly suggest you to conduct your own research and choose a platform that meets your needs and preferences, as well as those of the greater population.",

Is it the same on the other side or just my imagination that today I'm very disheartened even the whole Asian cricket fans are disheartened? Well, that's not the topic buddy the Site is not even loading up please fix it before claiming anything on the side of the Best platform, you better have a look at the leading platforms, with that, you can differentiate what the best platform means what a Testing phase entry means.A few mistakes in the branding as well, but it's upto the developer team. As for the buddy who provided some social links I came to knew they started their Bussnies in 2023 so let's wait a few weeks and see what's going on.",

Curious about which domain they started in 2014.",

I did search about Koinpark previously and results returned dates from this year. A long time exchange with high figures would return results that matches when cross-checked on google.Of course, if OP has a solid proof to back such claim, I'm pretty sure the community is willing to listen.

I think either @OP is drunk or someone who isn't sure that what he/she is trying to do. No member of this forum is naive enough to believe someone's words without any research and @OP thought we will accept his/her words and join that exchange. I must say that anyone who is trying to promote a site like that is a scammer and from this post I can say that @OP is basically here to scam the users of the forum. He/she won't be able to accomplish his/her goals and I think he/she will soon leave this forum because we have caught the fishy things about the platform.",
