Last time I read in a new that Elon Musk loses upto 4 billions in just few hours and the other time he made close or more than that in days. Money that would be very hard for an employee or middle class business owners to make in a year. If we take a look on the news we will see that billionaires loses upto 2 trillions dollar last year and this January we had been hearing about several loses from some of the world billionaires. Last year I heard that Jeff Bezos loses up to 80 billion dollars and Mark Zuckerberg also loses close to that amount which is enough to allivate poverty from a continent. The cause of their lose is best known to them but I think the funds should have been used to help the poor rather than allowing the money to vanish in a thin air. I have seen so many programs fro the masses especially to aid those that are in need. Some of these aid organisations do seek for donations from individuals, companies that are ready to help with funds.

      "body": "In my opinion, why can it be said that a loss of billions or trillions of dollars is because the wealth he owns is the result of the accumulation of asset prices that he owns, such as shares which when the price drops it will be called a loss, we know that the Tesla company owned by Elon Musk's share price has fallen It started drastically when he sold his shares and bought Twitter, many investors sold Tesla shares too and the remaining shares decreased to the point of being called a loss.So it's not because the money is gone or anything, but the assets they own have fallen in price, so that the wealth they have isn't real money but the total value of all assets.",

      "body": "Exactly because of what Dickiy said. There is no money, its value. So Elon Musk never \"had\" 300 billion dollars, it was his assets that worth that much but he never had it. If you think that those people \"losing\" billions means there was some money somewhere and now it moved and now its somewhere else, that's not true. It was just valuation, and that's why it dropped. If you want something similar in bitcoin, if NOBODY buys any more bitcoin, that would drop the price, nobody bought, so money never exchanged hands, but the price went up, so you lost value, meaning you are holding the same amount of bitcoin and yet have less money. Same thing, but with stocks instead.",

When the value of these assets, such as stocks, falls, it can appear as a loss, but it doesn't necessarily mean the money has gone anywhere.

When we have billionaires losing huge amount of money every year, why not they use those money to help the poor rather than losing themThe loss of wealth by billionaires and the rising poverty rate are most likely the result of a variety of interconnected issues, including economic inequality, global economic conditions, and government policies. In other circumstances, billionaires' wealth may be linked to specific businesses or markets that are performing poorly, resulting in losses. Poverty, on the other hand, can worsen as a result of factors such as unemployment, inflation, and a lack of access to education and healthcare. Don't judge billionaire's money because it isn't yours.",

And Tesla has a market cap of $1 Trillion, it would mean his net worth on his shares is $100Billion. However keep in mind that is only based on the last traded price.In a bear market there is no way Elon could sell $100B worth of shares without causing the price to drop. Which is what happened when he needed to sell shares to buy twitter. His selling caused price to drop by half. So he started with $100B and sold a few Billions and his net worth became less than $50B with only a few Billions sold. Hence why you should sell little by little in a bull market and never in a bear market.",

      "body": "Ponder upon this - wealthy folks parting with colossal sums of money might raise eyebrows, especially when weighed against global impoverishment. Yet, it's crucial to recognize that these individuals amassed their fortunes through diverse avenues and, hence, hold the liberty to spend it as they desire. Be mindful that many among them, the billionaires of the world, channel their resources towards non-profit entities and engage in philanthropy, thereby serving society.Quite a few billionaires have exhibited largesse towards charities. Take for instance, Jeff Bezos, who committed an astounding $10 billion to combat the crisis of climate change. Or Elon Musk, who has shelled out millions for various causes. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, via the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook shares to charitable causes during their lifetime.Without a doubt, we ought to extend our hand to help those in need. Yet, passing judgments on the expenditure habits of others might prove to be counterproductive and unjust. Let's focus on making a difference, rather than dissecting differences.",

I'll tell you how it works. Most of the wealth that these people carry is in form of assets. Like Elon Musk has shared of Tesla and Jeff has shared of Amazon, it's the price of these shares which went so high and they had so much of them that they reached at top richest billionaires list. Now they don't actually have this money in liquid form which means if they were to sell it they might fetch a much lower value infact they selling this might in itself reduce the value of these shares a lot. So when you see that someone lost 4 Billion dollars it's not that they gambled last night and lost it, actually the price of the share went down which reduces their wealth it was anyways not hard cash money so it can't be used to alleviate poverty.",

What it might mean is to create platforms where these people can be employed or acquire skills that would be beneficial to them. It could also mean assisting them to get better health services, good infrastructures or even quality education.

However that value is constantly changing and if faith is lost in a company for whatever reason, it can disappear like the illusion it was. Elon's arrogance, self interest and now highly political viewpoints being spammed on places like Twitter have done huge damage to his net worth because his ego needs feeding. He (and many other shareholders) lost their money because they did not sell out during the peak time in their company valuation, but even if they started to sell it would have indicated to others to sell as well and push the price down in a vicious spiral.",

Money that would be very hard for an employee or middle class business owners to make in a year. There is a very simple question for you right now, why should you be skeptical of losing money to the billionaire now? If you feel compassion for people who are suffering from poverty, in fact you yourself can help them as much as you can without having to think about the missing billionaire's money. After all, Elon Musk himself doesn't really think about losing that amount of money either, as he can earn more than that in a matter of weeks. So you don't need to worry and also don't need to feel skeptical about this now.QuoteIf we take a look on the news we will see that billionaires loses upto 2 trillions dollar last year and this January we had been hearing about several loses from some of the world billionaires.There is always news every year and you won't even have enough time to read it if you are constantly looking for news like this.

The cause of their lose is best known to them but I think the funds should have been used to help the poor rather than allowing the money to vanish in a thin air. And what you also need to know is that they have never felt difficult or difficult in their life after experiencing the loss of that much money even though the advice you are offering is for the good. But if they want to help poor people in a continent, of course they also don't need to mention it in the media because it's not a business that should have a special level of promotion.QuoteI have seen so many programs fro the masses especially to aid those that are in need.

If you really want to invite them to allocate some money to poor people in the form of donations, I think you just need to contact them telling them the real purpose and see how they respond to that.
