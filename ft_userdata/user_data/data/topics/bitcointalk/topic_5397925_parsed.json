  "content": "Scam AlertThere's a particular channel/group on telegram acting as a P2P Escrow for cryptocurrency trading. The group has about 10, 000+ members so it looks more like a large and secure group. Which can trigger any naive or gullible newbie to trade in.This is how dey work;Someone will bring out an offer to sell his/her coin at a cheaper rate and negotiate with you after the agreement as been sealed you would be ask to pay in FIAT to the admin's account plus some minimal amount as transaction fee (<$1). After the payment as been done and confirmed by the admin and you are now waiting for your coin, the coin trader will now come up with an excuse which might lead to you requesting for your money back from the admin and you will eventually be remove from the group and all your chats deleted so the next scam victim won't find out. I later found that most members of the group/channel are not real. How they add them up is what I don't know.The two images below are how two groups look like.The first image was the group my friend was scammed $50 and was later removed.The second image is a new group going roundScam 2;I joined tron.ac since November and I invested 1000trx later increase it,  though I made substianal profit on it. Yesterday I noticed I couldn't withdraw,  I thought it was network.  This morning same thing so I decided to contact their customer support,  I was told to pay additional  30% of total of my investment.  I quickly rushed to trxblue.com to check,  I withdrew with confirmation that it was successful but I didn't see any coin in my wallet.  So I contacted Joanna one of the customer support,  she replied that i should pay 20% of my total investment to continue mining.  Scam 3; Today I was able to uncover two scam airdrops.1 wirtual2: yam financeThis two are pure scam. They will mandate you to pay certain network fee for withdrawal, after you paid you need to validate your payment, when it's confirm they will block your account.Yam is a token designed to phishing your wallet to unveil your private information.",

I don't know how you fell for them, but you should know that there is nothing like \"Invest this amount so that you can earn 2% daily\"It's a;ways scam.",

Exactly the group was filled up with members using the procedure you just stated. But as newbies looking for how to make it heavy in cryptocurrency with proper knowledge. These are parts of the scam they fall into. Even the old me was totally scammed with such. But knowledge they say is light, although I learnt it the hard way",

I remember a year ago; I got scammed for about $150 from a Facebook Group admin. I was looking for a Free Fire account (Battle royale game). The group admin offered a game account with a reasonable price with another fake account. It's easy to get scammed on the internet if you don't use a trusted escrow service.",

When the Nigerian government banned cryptocurrency, most citizens began operating local peer-to-peer networks on WhatsApp and Telegram, and there are still hundreds of legitimate networks operating, as well as scams.OP can you provide evidence at least to back up your claim?",
