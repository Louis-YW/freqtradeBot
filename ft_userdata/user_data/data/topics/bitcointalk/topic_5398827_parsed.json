Canaan Creative was founded in 2012, releasing its first Avalon chip the following year source hereIMHO Canaan generally produces the best miners. While their Avalon miners may not be quite as efficient as Bitmain's Ants are, the Avalons' are far far more reliable.",

The warranty only applies to the original purchaser who purchased the machine directly from CANAAN.

CANAAN will never know how many times an ASIC has been resold. You must send the ASIC to the first buyer, and he will send it to China for warranty service. This can take several months, so miners first look for good services that can quickly repair ASICs in their country.",

Many existing threads about their different miners in the Hardware area, just use 'Avalon' or 'Canaan' as a search term. Various models were the A6, A721, A741, A821, A841, A941 (their only clunker but the 1st 10nm miner to market beating Bitmain by 3 months). Starting with the A10xx they followed MicroBt & Bitmain and changed to using built-in PSU to raise efficiency. For a very long time their Avalon 841 has been the most durable miner ever made.",
