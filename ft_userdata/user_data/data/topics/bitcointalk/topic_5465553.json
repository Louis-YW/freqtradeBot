  "content": "Z_MBFM's thread about his/her first collectible HERE and the generosity of some members has sparked an idea which we could all partake in, a kind of \"Pay it Forward\" sort of collaboration.I wonder if something like this has been done here before?I was thinking that one member starts off the collab by nominating another memberand send them something Bitcoin, Crypto or even FIAT collectible related - large, small,valuable or not, rare or abundant or even a one off self made specifically for the collab.The key to it is to not expect anything in return and if it works out further down the project that you get something back well thats Karma!I remember doing something like this on a photography forum many moons ago,It was a postcard collaboration type project like this.Anyway what do you all think?",
