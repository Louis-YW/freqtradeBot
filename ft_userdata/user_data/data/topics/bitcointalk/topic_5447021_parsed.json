QuoteHow will you get scammed when you try online casino?There's no 100% solution to this as they can shutdown the site and run away with the funds anytime. You just have to be extra careful in choosing which platform to gamble your money. Some of the basics to look for is their reputation. How long have they been operating? Check reviews from reliable gambling forums or sites.

      "body": "Whenever some person or company starts a casino online or in a physical location, they hire personnel and calculate a budget so they can cover the initial investment.It is like any other kind of business. If you want to open a restaurant, you need to buy raw food, pay cooks, buy machines and ovens. Sometime must pass by, before they see some profit.The advertisement part also is a percentage of that initial budget, by the way. When comes to security, I would say that in order for one to be safe, just to stick to casinos which have a good track record, are provably fair and are properly registered in their jurisdiction. If you ever feel like trying a small and relatively unknown casino, do so with small deposits.",

I think when you are on bitcointalk there are already some recommendations for online casinos so why look for something new just to try gambling. Even though it's good to try some new things, but when the risk is much bigger, I prefer to use something that has been proven in terms of reputation, rather than trying new things that are not yet clear.",

How can you tell that online casino is safe?It's important to do your research and choose a reputable online casino. Look for licenses and certifications, as well as reviews from other players. Another thing to watch out for is bonuses that seem too good to be true. Some online casinos offer huge bonuses, but they come with impossible wagering requirements or other hidden terms and conditions that make it nearly impossible to actually cash out any winnings.",

The influencer may not receive his pay until he achieves a milestone. Probably after 500 sign-ups under his referral and then he gets paid. Most of them will promote thier affiliate link all the time in the description. I was planning to be an influencer, I just don't have more followers yet on my crypto youtube channel. I wonder if I should be making contacts to casinos myself after all I already have 800+ subscribers. I wanna strike a deal actually, to see if I could get paid.",

Of course they lose some money by doing bonuses and promotion but what kind of business does not spend money on advertising? And this kind of advertising that they do is compared to other types of advertisement actually very cheap! Because they make back most of the promotion money from the gamblers they gave it to.

As you can see in this forum many casinos do their promotion through signature camp and they spend thousands of dollars every week on promotion.2. Casino sites receive a commission from every bet placed by gamblers.  And in games like blackjack, they are dealers, from here there is an earning and also has loss, but all in all, the casino sites earn a huge amount.3. When you choose a reputable casino site, make sure it is safe.  But it may not save you when you go to gamble on a new site.  So it matters what kind of site you are going to gamble on",
