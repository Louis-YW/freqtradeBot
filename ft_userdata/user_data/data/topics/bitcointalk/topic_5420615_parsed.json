  "content": "Looking for a decent developer with experience in TypeScript and has some knowledge regarding the stock market and trading.I'm working on a social trading app (nvstly.com) where retail traders can collaborate. Track & share trades with in-depth performance stats, compete & rank against others on community and global leaderboards, follow others to receive real-time notifications of their trades, share analysis, trade ideas, or anything market related, with brokerage integration to automate it all.It's a fully functioning web app in open beta right now, the end goal is to allow traders to link their brokerages that get auto submitted into the app and their followers can 1-click copy their trades- with fully automation eventually. Social traders can use it to auto share their trades to social media and Discord as well.We just recently added crypto trade tracking & sharing, supporting 12 exchanges. Would like to tackle broker integration before crypto exchanges.If this peaks your interest, shoot me an email or reach out to rich#0003 on our Discord.discord.gg/nvstlynvstly.com-Rich",
