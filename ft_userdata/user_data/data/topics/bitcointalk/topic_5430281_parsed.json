  "content": "Hello everyone,I've been wondering for a long time, but why hasn't anyone really given importance to a project like uPlexa yet?Blockchain based on cryptonight protocol that guarantees transaction speed and absolute anonymity. You can mine from mobile devices as well as from usual miners. The founder is doxxed (Kyle Pierce). In my opinion, the project is interesting and as of today it's 4-5 years in business working on a decentralized VPN to offer. Â Thoughts?",
