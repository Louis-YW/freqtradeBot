And so with doing this hack and changing it to ETH maybe they also want to give the government the middle finger, hehehe.But thanks to the heads-up and hopefully no one will fall for this trick.",

      "body": "Unless they have another method of defrauding these subscribers, these hackers appear to be novices at what they're doing. How do you trick people into participating in an Ethereum giveaway after you've hacked a popular channel with lots of subscribers like this? The subscribers can be duped into such schemes only if they are ignorant. I only hope they don't manage to scam people before the channel is reclaimed. After putting in a lot of work to make a life, people are always looking for a method to swindle others out of their legal earnings.",

Of course, the goal is to cheat. no other messages from youtube channel hacking. it will harm other people.It is true that because of this hacking, the government of that country will become more strict about crypto. But here is another thing, a lot of news will be created about this hack and this news will go to those who did not know about crypto until now. So there are two types of situation here. A country's largest news channel's YouTube account being hacked, and using that account to promote crypto scams, will certainly make the country's government think twice. So now the negative impact is more visible here, and more difficult times may come for crypto users in Bangladesh.",

The only way to stop that is to contact Youtube, that’s a huge account and can easily attract newbies, I hope no one suffer from such scam promotions. For sure, regulatory agency will address that issue and will run after Youtube and askt their security protocols, that can be a big trouble for them.",

All I know is the Youtube channel is attached to an email if the email security is weak there's a possibility of hacking, Gmail is equipt with text, 2FA, and other security measures and they will ask for security verification if you log in in a different IP, how com, these hackers able to bypass these security measures, they are really good at hacking so no channels are safe now if they can hack government channel they can hack popular channels too.",

These “session cookies” confirm that the user has successfully logged into their account. A hacker can upload those stolen cookies to a malicious server, letting them pose as the already authenticated victim.https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-bitcoin-scam-account-hijacking-google-phishing/So even if the security is tight and they have verification on their login they can mislead the system that the hacker is the real owner of the channel, Youtube owners should be educated on how these hackers work to protect their channels, Youtube channels are the targetted sites nbow because they hackers can make a lot of money here from their fake giveaways.",
