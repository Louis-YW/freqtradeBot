      "body": "Here's to hoping many more energy providers follow suit. Honestly, when Bitcoin can be easily used for essentials like groceries, and mortgage/rent, I believe there's not much stopping adoption for Bitcoin then. People will with time come to terms with it, learn about it, and it'll come somewhat nature, especially if we can simplify it for the layman a little more.We'll probably see bank services move to cryptocurrencies which does defeat some of the point, but I'm not entirely against that, since I understand some people prefer to have people looking after their money, than trusting themselves. Definitely not for me, but I can see the use case. If the government, banks, and crypto can somewhat integrate it'll be good for adoption. Obviously, I'm hoping most users will go the route of managing their own money though, but its hard to see it catch on at this point. Paying for rent, and energy bills would be a huge step though.",

Nigerian attended this status of one of the highest countries with large volume of cryptocurrency trading because of high inflation rate and devaluation of our local currency. it is sad the Nigerian government has turned blind eyes to this because the keep most of their reserve in foreign currencies",

We earnestly yearn that regulators will relax some of the restrictions to enable Nigeria to participate in the global digital economy devoid of bottlenecks. It will be an action we believe will greatly impact the Nigerian economy positively since digital currency adoption has gone through the roof since the last bull run. More are entering the space and already taking suitable positions as the blockchain world anticipates the mother of all bull markets come 2024/25. <6 lines of not saying a thing>Meanwhile, even if Nigerians or users in every country where we are going to operate decide to use the application for payment of bills, all returns are ploughed back to the original service providers through fiat. So, our services do not really write off the use of fiat, it simply provides an outstanding and faster alternative â€“ cryptocurrency.I fail to understand this, you don't ditch fiat but you use an alternative, this is simply something that is impossible, as you can't use an alternative without actually ditching the first choice, that's what an alternative is, and somehow you magically change cryptos into fiat and you pay the companies with what? A truckload of cash and you pay one by one each bill at a PayPoint machine?QuoteThese restrictions make switching directly from crypto to fiat difficult and this automatically makes our product a welcome development because what we are building provides users with the rare opportunity of paying for the multiple services we offer without recourse to the local currency. So, if you take crypto and you deal with fiat, it's not the same?What magic does that app summons to use and not use a system at the same time?",

I agree with other friends, whether it's any institution or banking, it is a good role to play. If it becomes a currency there are still pros and cons in some countries if it becomes a means of payment to facilitate the need for state contributions, in my opinion it will relieve because some communities will feel at home if this goes on even though it takes time",

If the country is about to go in for presidential election then why calling for revolution which only leads to a total forceful change of government and its institutions. Let me not deviate from the topic of discussion as it borders on Bitcoin payment which should be a favorable payment alternative to the fiat currency. Utility payment is one of the taxes citizens pay more often so the need for effective and easy alternative options is a welcome development.",
