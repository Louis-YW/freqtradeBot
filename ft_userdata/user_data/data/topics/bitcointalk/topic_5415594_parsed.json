Always watch your information diet because it helps in building your career and destiny.In all of this, What information diet are you receiving about crypto?

      "body": "This is quite an interesting way to put it because a balanced information diet in this case is going to remain the best, but different from life you can just have small amounts of a variety of information in order to get the full picture on what's going out there - in the end I think most people with accurate data get it from factual news outlets (like Reuters or similar media sources that have a relatively low bias or take informed decisions from statistics). Even on financial markets a lot of companies get things wrong. Take the companies proclaiming twitter became privately owned by someone because they had an agreement only to remain listed on the stock market and tradeable. A lot of news tries to be the first to report on something and a lot of those outlets get a lot of things wrong because of it.",

      "body": "Today is the time of the Internet, and the news and information background are very extensive. But, I think, for any average person who understands the whole essence of the Internet, it becomes clear that to believe or not trust just one source is a thankless task.To understand all the news, if it becomes necessary for us, it is needed to start not only from social networks, which, as you know, bring a lot of noise, but to turn to official sources, preferably several. It is better to hear the opinion of several experts voicing their points of view, and then draw your conclusion. This, I think, will contain the correct informational diet.",

Today, person A would say something, tomorrow person B will say another that is contrasting to what person A said yesterday about the recent trends and . Plenty misconceptions are online. I prefer to follow my own ideas and I use different approaches.",
