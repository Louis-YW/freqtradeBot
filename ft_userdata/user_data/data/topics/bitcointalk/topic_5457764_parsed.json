I am interested to know how much they can change the gaming industry, what challenges and problems are associated with them? Do you mean NFT games? It can revolutionize the gaming industry if its been use or introduce very well. But sadly this has been abuse by many scammers and NFT games slowly die because the demand slowly declining for the past couple of months. So far at this days I didn't see any NFT games succeed because most of the project newly launch if not failed they easily turn scam. So for now the main problem about this is the rampant scamming happening and if this activities didn't stop, maybe investors and other reputable game developers will not associate to any of these NFT activities.",

What do you mean by \"crypto games\"?If you are referring to games in a crypto casino, they are actually quite similar to the games offered in traditional fiat casinos. The main difference lies in the form of payment method. In fiat casinos, we use cash as the payment method, whereas in crypto casinos, cryptocurrency is used for transactions.",

The known problems to them is that most coins are going to have less value in every bear market assuming you really meant play to earn games. Looking at the Axie, its price was more than $100 back in the bull run, and then look at it now.There are tons of them these days on every platform and they'll be hyped next year as we are approaching halving. More investors and players will come too but if they are not traders, they will lose their money.",

Some.other revolution that may have started before and turned into a passing trend is because the driving force behind them was not strong enough. Cryptocurrency is going to be the driving force in this revolution in the gaming industry.l and it is sufficient to see it through. In the next few years, things will be more advanced in the gaming industry than right now, crypto games will birth more revolution.",

Cryptocurrency games are going to be well established that will make lovers to choose them than going for the casual games we play on ordinary casinos. There are lots of Metaverse games I do play and earn some coins depending on the project so this need time and consistency for people to see a need to start playing cryptocurrency games to start earning tokens at the same time. Just like the way artificial intelligence is increasing in adoption, the same way we are going to get accustom to playing crypto games.",

I guess it's a two-way problem, which causes these NFT games to flop eventually even though from the start they may look promising. It's all about how they handle their tokenomics, and how they do not account for the capacity of the regular person to abuse the system to their advantage. Take Axie Infinity for example. right from the get-go when things aren't blowing up the game is doing fine as it is, able to bag in as much as 200 bucks per month even with just a regular team of Axies. It's when the grind movement came in that things start to go downhill, cause they didn't take into account the fact that players could easily abuse the energy system and the SLP tokenomics, which lead to what started as a bubble in the economy, until it crashed and inflation set in. Older games are able to counter this by introducing scarcity, it's perhaps the lack of experience in the field that led to these devs overlooking these important factors that lead to their downfall. But it doesn't mean that the industry is failing or it's just a passing fad as they always say, you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelette.",

I'm familiar with blockchain/crypto gaming that is done on-chain, and in my experience thus far, I'd say it has a lot of promises for the future but we still have the problem of scalability with current applications. I know this is a problem from the underlying blockchain but until we can solve that problem without forgoing security, the experience won't always be so great. Also, another limitation is the gas costs. It's unpleasant to play games or place bets on games when I get charged for the interactions and activities I do. It would be interesting to have unrestricted gasless gaming as we do in traditional gaming settings.",

I am interested to know how much they can change the gaming industry, what challenges and problems are associated with them? Do you mean games that use the nature of tokens/NFTs and center the game around it? Honestly removing the idea that they use tokens and assume that they just use a currency that's completely up to the player base themselves, any game that uses said model would have problems with regards to its economy. Why? Because a stable economy would be what most players want, and most of the time, the sudden influx of players would destroy that balance and would require again time to balance it out. The existence of bots also destroys that economy. Now if you suddenly include the fact that said games use NFTs/tokens which reward players with real money, there would often be times when if the economy plummets to a certain degree, everyone just leaves, instead of trying to recover it. Those who are left would well, inevitably have a hard time trying to keep things afloat and would probably end up leaving as well sooner or later. It's probably a lot easier to manage stuff like this with games that don't involve rewarding players directly with currencies that can be sold for local currencies (USD), such as Albion, but well, it's another thing if it is.",

For me, I think crypto currency is a ground breaking innovation, most especially in the gaming sector, and I see crypto gaming as one that have come to stay, online gambling have never remained the same since the introduction of crypto, like I've always said here, I don't think I would be a gambler as much as I am today if it wasn't for crypto currencies..Crypto has made the area of deposit and withdrawal from gambling casinos so easy and fast now, one no longer have to go through a rigorous process just to withdraw or deposit fiat, and even at that, wait for days before the money reflect in the gambling account or show up on my bank account, even with a hefty fees deducted.So personally, all I see in crypto currency gambling is pros and just pros, I have not actually seen any negative side that fiat currencies does not possess as well.",

If it is play to earn then it is not gambling but more of an investment. There's no betting procedures in p2e. The only some sort of gambling in such kind of game is lack of assurance to be profitable in a long run but that's way different. Would it have impacts to gambling industry? I doubt. If P2Es would allow betting in form of player to player match, it might indeed make more sense but that's not something new in gambling industry. It'll just be in form of another kind of game but p2p exists already in this industry for years.",

If they focused more on the creation of an appealing experience and somehow managed to decrease the entry price for new players, then more people who would have been willing to pay for fun could have appeared.They abused the play-to-earn tag on their product and brought themselves into a bubble.
