      "body": "Welcome to bitcointalk.I see that you have already purchased copper membership which means that you can post images on the forum. Since can already post images here you should consider editing your Op and add some images to make it look more like an ANN thread, right now I don't think alot of people might take your site seriously cause there's nothing here about your site just a thread with less than 50 words. You should be aware that the casino industry is a competitive one, you should try to make yours stand out right now you're trying to win potential customers to your thread but if you don't show sign of seriousness no one will take you to be serious.Just a little suggestion; look through the service board find someone who does professional ANN design pay them let them design something good for you... You can just come to bitcointalk drop few words and expect everyone to jump into your casino.  I haven't check your site I might come back to this thread when I'm through checking it out, for now.make sure you work on this thread make it look more appealing to the eyes.",

However, I think you should only allow integer or/ double to the bet amount input fields as currently any data type can be accepted as an input. You might also want to add a maxlength on those areas. So, rakeclub.com is a casino solutions... I think you should move this thread to the Services board, you can found the button for that from the lower left part of this thread.Another opinion, it would be better if you will use icons for your social media accounts for this thread instead of using pure texts. Welcome to the forum, good luck!",

Also this 900$ do not include the domain and hosting stuff? Actually, that amount is already fair price since his script is for a full casino features. It’s not the typical dice and crash script that usually cost cheaper than this. Typically, domain and hosting should be setup by the owner. I’m more curious if he support assistance on acquiring casino license and how many customers that avail his script already.Quote from: ranegg on June 11, 2023, 03:44:23 PMThank you very much for your feedback. I really appreciate it. I am still working on my thread as I want it to make everything as clear as possible. Really appreciate the help and the tips.  Use canva to improve your ANN thread. There’s a lot of templates in canva that can help you improve your ann thread presentation effectively. Use escrow on your deals to guarantee the safety of your buyer since you are still a newbie.",

Make your thread an ANN lookalike by adding pictures and info about your unique casino creation platform. It's a tight race in the casino world. To stand out, you may need a pro for your ANN design. Don't forget to add practical stuff like allowing only integer or double bets, and pop in some social media icons. Clear up any confusion about payment and delivery. For your Basic Limited features costing $899, spell out the delivery timeline and offer buyer protection through a trusted escrow. An easy-to-understand FAQ and TOS will help build trust",

Maybe there is a way to adjust the web design and the different features, so that this casino template won't look the same for every buyer.I'm not a programmer or a web designer, I assume that many people, who want to start a gambling business won't have knowledge and skills about web design and programming.The template looks OK, but in the gambling world you have to stand out from the competition.

I think you should make the source code word first on the title before your domain because they doesn't blend in that much that you are selling a casino code instead of a rakeback services which many services here that attempts to scam user.Also include the payment method in your ANN thread and its best if you will accept Bitcoin since most of the user here that potentially your customers use Bitcoin. Lastly, Are you willing to accept escrow on the payment since no one will trust you here to pay you first since you are newbie. Wish you a good luck on your ventures. 🙏",
