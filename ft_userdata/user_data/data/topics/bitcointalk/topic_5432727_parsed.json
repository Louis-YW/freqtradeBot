Then you're missing the best and most exciting part when it comes to playing in a casino everyone is to each their own, they don't care what games others are playing and they don't care about other's opinions, it's their money and their enjoyment that matters, so let play enjoy what they are doing they will not take your advice anyway.I'm playing both but I'm more on casinos and it's my decision, because I enjoy it.",

It's true about the casino, but not entirely correct on the sport. If most people are keep making money on sport, then how can the bookies are survive? of course the bookies will going to bankrupt very easy.

I won a decent amount of money on all 3 Fury-Wilder fights and also I predicted the Canelo-GGG III fight would go the full 12 rounds.

Luka has been on fire.Screenshot of your previous bet or it didn’t happened.  Anyway you have a point that slots and other luck based games is very risky and less chance of winning compared to sportsbet. You can really dominate this category gambling if you are really good on it but you should not miss the point why other gamblers choose slots over sportsbook. Slots and other casino games has fast phase game which sportsbook doesn’t have unless betting on live games but you will still have a waiting time for the match that you preferred.",

      "body": "Betting should be classified into another class of gambling and should be called football betting instead of the general title gambling to refer to all of them. Quote from: pixie85 on January 02, 2023, 01:35:07 PMFor me it's also mostly sports. I don't mind to play something else like crash for a minute but I don't enjoy these fast paced games like I used to. The majority of members will also opt in for football betting since it is easy to speculate its outcome by analyzing previous team performance and statistics, and if we should put it then the ratio will be 70/30 so football betting is still the favourite of most gamblers around here. Quote from: MiliMil on January 02, 2023, 01:27:26 PMHappy new years people!I'm curious as to what the ratio is for users on this forum in terms of sports vs casino betting.The first majority of people will bet on football and other sporting event, just by predicting the outcome of the matches and if their prediction is right, their winning will be released. But what you will not get with this kind of gambling is that, you are not directly involved in the game process so therefore the aspect I'm gambling that is referred to as fun and enjoyment will not be experienced by the gambler, because in football bets the gambler only predicts and speculate the results. but in gambling games like dice and slot that you mentioned the gambler will play the game and go through the process which makes it more real for the player's experience and enjoyment.",

In the field of gambling, everyone is not good in one place, everyone is good for one area or the other. As you are good in sport betting some are good slot and dice casinos, no game in the gambling is not risky even sport games are for luck. There is no game is a waste of time and all games are waste of time. The way you win in casino, the same way others are winning in casinos. So all are equal. Please don't spoil casino games for others because you are winning in sports. Betting on  3-6 BTC for sport game (s) is your choice, people have place bet even more than that, so yours is not the first. If you are looking for sportbook, try this https://fortunejack.com/",
