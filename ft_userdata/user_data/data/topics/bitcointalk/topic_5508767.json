      "body": "I think from today's (2024) point of view you may overestimating Bitcoin's influence. For the future, I agree somewhat, the potential is there.Quote from: Jibdeen on September 09, 2024, 03:34:10 PM first of all it provide employment and source of income thereby regulating the unemployment rate and increasing the efficiency of the economy.I guess this happened mostly in countries like Venezuela, where the local currency was so weak that Bitcoin as an alternative provided more stability for entrepreneurs in some cases. In other countries, it may have helped to create businesses in the crypto sector.However, I think not even in Venezuela Bitcoin is/was important enough to really \"regulate the unemployment rate\". We'd be talking about perhaps 10k or 20k people involved in the crypto sector per country, and maybe a similar number of freelancers which would get crypto-related jobs they wouldn't have got if the payment was in USD.So this is for now more of a \"dream for the future\", like the idea of \"balancing salaries\" I've exposed in my thread here.Quote from: Jibdeen on September 09, 2024, 03:34:10 PM secondly bitcoin could have hep many countries if they would have acquire some and make it a legal tender years ago.A pro-Bitcoin policy like El Salvador's can \"help\" a country in two ways:1) providing good conditions for a fintech sector dealing with Bitcoin and crypto,2) as a part of the country's reserves, if the Bitcoin price increases.But I believe in the current world of 2024 the first point only provides significant benefits for small countries, like El Salvador, because only if the economy is relatively small a strong crypto sector can make really a difference for the local economy. Again, this may change in the future, so a pro-Bitcoin policy is never a bad idea.Of course if a country bought a substantial amount of Bitcoin in 2013 or so it could be rich now. El Salvador at least made about 30-50% profit for now.Quote from: Jibdeen on September 09, 2024, 03:34:10 PMthirdly it reduces crime rate in some countries because the reason for some of these crime is unemployment.And lastly bitcoin rescues many families and individuals get rid of poverty thereby increasing the quality of life ,helping businesses,and helping the economy in different ways.I think this, agalin, may have happened in very few countries like Venezuela with really extreme economic problems. But for other countries, this is again currently an overestimation of Bitcoin's influence, see above in my comment about its influence on unemployment.Quote from: Jibdeen on September 09, 2024, 03:34:10 PMi don't really see the reason why the government of some countries failed to make it a legal tender till now even after seeing what it has done to their economy.This is a common misconception.You don't need for Bitcoin to be \"legal tender\" for a pro-Bitcoin policy. \"Legal tender\" does not mean that it's \"legal\" to use it, it's that merchants have to accept it as a payment method.I think it's better if people (merchants) can decide for themselves if they want to use Bitcoin or not. El Salvador's \"legal tender\" policy has for example led to many people without technical understanding to use the Chivo wallet which was affected by a major hack earlier this year.In general for what you write to happen, Bitcoin must be used much more as a currency, not only as store of value.",

Bitcoin isn't a magic wind that you move and money comes out of it, to have access to Bitcoin or to tools and platforms where one can trade or invest and earn money require one to have necessary resources. Someone with no money and resources such as good devices or internet connection can barely have access to things such as Bitcoin or an exchange. So there is no way a poor person having no money or necessary resources can earn money using Bitcoin.",

As small as its impact might be right now, if we see more initiatives similar to what has been going on in El Salvador then it could have massive benefits in the future. Elementary school kids are learning about Bitcoin and many of them could go on to become entrepreneurs. Bitcoin education has to be coupled with other measures dealing with crime reduction and fostering innovation so that people have options besides becoming gang members. Even though Bitcoin has struggled to gain adoption, I believe El Salvador is doing the right things that will pay off in the long term. Other countries with high poverty and crime should emulate the good things that they have done.",

Yes that is right Bitcoin is making big difference in economy and people lives. More and more people are using it which shows it is becoming more important. Bitcoin helps solve problems with traditional money and banks. It gives people another option which can reduce financial stress and give them more control over their money. Bitcoin also lets people keep their financial transactions private which is basic right. As Bitcoin keeps growing I think it can bring positive change to how we think about and use money.",

The potential of Bitcoin to be used as legal tender still be there but that will need to wait for the acceptance from every government so we must wait for more.Crime is not related to Bitcoin because if they are unemployment and doesn't have a source of income, they may commit a crime because they want to have money to fills their daily needs. If they can have a job that can give them source of income, they may not risks themselves to commit a crime.
