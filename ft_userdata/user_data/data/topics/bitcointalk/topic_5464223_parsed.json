      "body": "Hedging? Balancing is better imo. Keeping a good balance of assets and adjusting when opportunities arise to do so. Waiting for opportunities that will allow reduced price entries, lower DCA price. That's a better way IMO, than looking at it as hedging. We are already hedging against fiat by using Bitcoin over Fiat anyway. Unless, hedging with another instrument is what you mean?

I think it's better to plot only the POI you think the price will go to. I'm not using EMA in my trade now but it can also be used as dynamic support and resistance which is confluence with SNR. Additionally, the trend in the weekly timeframe is clearly bullish so what we see in the market is just a retracement. We just have to wait until market get enough liquidity to fuel the price higher and create another high. Possibly the price will hit $35k to $37k base on my analysis.",

Assuming the most particular reason that Binance is in the hype of you can top news due to the cases and SEC, fuds etc etc.. So I can give a simple answer for the BNB and support and future recovery as far as Binance exists BNB will have the potential to stand alone to the position of the top 10.Binance has issues in the USA but they have some legal licenses in other countries so nothing to worry about here, There is no centralized exchange support just a hope hitter for those who invested in the BNB I think they won't make mistakes again.",

It’s a good sign that the price is slowing down now that there’s no bad news in crypto that will affect the price to move lower.It’s too early for now to speculate more lower price since the 25K price support is still remains untouchable until now.",

I agree with you and I also think that as long as $25k support level isn't crossed the price will continue to go in upward direction. I also doubt that Bitcoin may hit a crash and the price may drop below $22k because it's the month of September and it has always been a worst month for Bitcoin. So far its value is still above $25k and that's kind of a good sign for us but still in the month of September the price may see another dip that could bring its value once again to $21k or even below that. Let's see what's going to take place in the month of September and we should also keep in mind the the case of SEC delaying Bitcoin ETF's that's worsening the conditions of the market. I believe that we may see another dip if things like that continue in the market, and there's a chance that the price may drop below the support level of $25k in this month.",

We are now hovering on 25k levels and lets see if this one could hold strong or would really be totally on having some breakout which we know that indicators could neither be that precise or not. Forming out double-tops double bottom does indicate that it is really that indeed touching up a resistance or a strong support which it would really be indicating whether it would be able to hold up long or would really be having that total breakdown and it would really be entirely be depending on how this market behaves or reacts whether if theres some backed news or having none.This is the main thing that we dont really like on this marke is that it could really easily fucked up on whatever analysis that the entire community had been molding. No matter how good it is and no matter how established it would be but still it wont really be giving out that kind of assurance when it comes to precision and thats why it would really be just that wise on having that back up plans whenever the price might have some break out or not. Now that we are hovering on 25k which we cant really say that this one would hold and make out some bounce or would be totally be that having that break out and would go down even as low of 23k which it would be the next support. Somewhat its true that there are really that having the significance when it comes to fundamentals and news around which would really be neither a catalyst or would really be a reason on why the price could move up that way. If ever we do see some positive news then it would really be depending whether it would be negative or positive basing up on that one and since not all the time which the market or this space is really that reactive to that.",

The less you expect it, the more it will happen. If you are not convinced, maybe what I will say to you will make you feel contented. Okay there is a bad news about Binance. It is said that it will stop minting BUSD and now remove the said stablecoins on their exchange.I know it's not about BTC but it might have an in-direct effect to it like other negative news that we witnessed on the past. I don't expect that $23k will come so it might really come but I'm not alarmed with it. As you said, it's an opportunity (not a disadvantage.)",

And with that, prices is moving around the $36k-$38k, so that will be the resistance/support line for now. But we will see, October changes the landscape, investors pouring their money pushing the price to the levels that we have right now.

I tend to agree with this, I didn't monitor the market condition for about two months but I expect that the market will have a bullish trend, especially in this last quarter of the year.  Which is you're right to focus on the broader, long-term perspective.Short-term fluctuations may remain unpredictable, we don't know yet where the price is heading, and it could be those predicting the market price will make FUD and won't help the market. However, IMO, the market might seem more likely that we're encountering strong supply zones rather than a prolonged bearish trend.  The consistency of price respect for those areas strengthens the case for their significance.",
