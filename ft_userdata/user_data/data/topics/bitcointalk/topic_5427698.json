  "content": "Hi there, I'm auctioning 3 2014 Cryptonic Monero physical coins and a 2016 smoothie giveaway coin. One Cryptonic coin is pure silver and 2 are silver plated, the smoothie giveaway coin has 2 holographic stickers that aren't applied yet. The 2 silver plated ones have a couple brown tarnish spots on the side of the coin, I tried to make a photo of them but it's hard to see on the photos. All coins are unfunded.The Cryptonic coins are the first physical Monero coins ever produced and they are very rare, there are only a couple auctions of these coins (pure silver and silver plated) found on the internet. Â The only similar succesful trade that I know of is that someone bought a 2014 Cryptonic pure silver coin for $1700 in 2017. Because of this it's hard to estimate the value of the coin, if you think it's not worth it please refrain from posting in the thread.I am the original owner of the coins and can post the e-mail I received when I ordered the coins from Cryptonic, also the owner of Cryptonic posted on my trust page.Photos:Lot 1, 2014 Cryptonic pure silverLot 2, 2014 Cryptonic silver platedLot 3, 2014 Cryptonic silver platedLot 4, 2016 smoothie giveaway coinPlease limit posts to bids or comments/questions about the items up for auction.STARTING BIDS: lot 1: 0.10 BTC, lot 2: 0.043 BTC, lot 3: 0.043 BTC, lot 4: 0.01 BTCMINIMUM BID INCREMENT: 0.001 BTCEND TIME: DECEMBER 16TH, 2022, 23:59:59 Amsterdam timeESCROW: If you want we can use a trusted escrow on this site, you will have to pay for escrow fees.Payment due within 24 hours of auction end.SNIPE: Any bid made in last hour will extend the auction for that lot by 15 minutes.If within that extended 15 minutes a new bid is made, 15 minutes will be added to the auction for that lot from the time of that bid.PAYMENT: Bitcoin BTC, can also accept ETH, XMR and USDT if that is fine with the potential escrow too, if you want to pay in another cryptocurrency we can discuss that.SHIPPING: Shipping fees included",
