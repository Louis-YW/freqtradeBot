      "body": "I have my own way of thinking and seeing things that are happening around us today, biden has been the whole world crime master, but the question now is that what has the society doing about this matter, as we continue to keep silent about things that really matters, this is the actual thing that brings our life to an end.Biden has to be worried because after all his evil acts that he had done among the society, no one knows the plan or affection on the mind of public in the society, there are some things that has happened and can't be forgotten, I remembered what biden said in his first announcement of the year 2021 he said there should be a liberty of joy in our society, but in our society today there are no joy but enough disaster from biden and no one talks about it because of his personality, we all conclude things that supposed to bring a better end to us.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Therefore, they must consider ordinary citizens before making any rubbish move to prove their superior position. What they care about are their power and status, they have never cared about our lives, to put it bluntly, we are just trash in front of them. They will do it regardless of tricks, willing to sacrifice millions of lives as long as they achieve their goal. I just hope they achieve their goals soon and share the profits with each other in the ongoing war in Ukraine to quickly end the war and bring peace to us. Zelensky is like us pointing the pawn on their chessboard, who has never been valuable in a fight.",
