Does anyone know if I should always have the long backup code for each 2FA or is the code for all of my google authenticator accounts?I've had the same issue some years ago. I've \"fixed\" it by using Aegis Authenticator, which does exactly the same as Google Authenticator, plus it has options to backup, import, export your data. Much more convenient than Google's tool (especially if you indeed make backups).If you want to go by Google, it would be indeed safer to save separately those long strings; those are the (backup) seed for generating those numbers.",

Therefore, if you didn't get a backup code for Kraken, it might be because they don't offer this feature or they have a different way of handling it. You should check with Kraken support or their documentation to see how you can recover your 2FA if you lose your phone or the app.edit:I just noticed that OmegaStarScream has already referred to the Kraken help documentation. It would be helpful for you to review it thoroughly.",

Is there any way I can go about to retrieve those back up codes now again? I'm using the Google Authenticator app and the secret codes/backup should come from the website where you registered. If you don't have a copy of the backup/secret codes but you already imported them into Google authenticator what you can only do is to export them from Google authenticator you can find it on \"transfer\" after you click the 3 dots the only problem is it generates QR code, not the backup code.If you want the secret code I suggest generate them again or request from the website/apps you registered.",

I've personally done this and can vouch.Quote from: Potato Chips on March 29, 2023, 05:41:35 PMIf you're planning on moving to aegis, it should be easy now with the 'transfer accounts' feature. To put it simply, google authenticator would generate a QR code which you can scan using your aegis app. Once done, all accounts should be transferred!If you wanna see your backup/secret codes from aegis, press and hold any account > tap the pen symbol in your upper right > advanced > tick the eye symbol in 'secret'. But since aegis has a more efficient way of backing up, you don't really need to do this tedious way of backing up codes, I'd say it's optional.",

Although aegis has option to scan the image within one mobile but the QR code generated from Google authenticator can not be Screenshot to allow scanning.

What about your laptop's cam/desktop web cam? perhaps you could take a decent photo using them?",
