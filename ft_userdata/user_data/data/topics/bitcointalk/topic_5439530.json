  "content": "the changing of the naira note in Nigeria has caused so many financial and economical problems nation wide. The naira has lost real value in the exchange market against the dollar and other currencies over The years and the government are trying to do all their possible best to give it back its value. So the changing of the naira notes i feel was one the main reason for this as many wealthy Nigerians have stock pile loads of naira notes in their ware houses all in the name of greed and selfishness. So the cbn taught changing the naira and implement a new current cashless policy will help in the provisions of these naira notes that have been missing in terms of its circulations in the nation.Â Â  Now the new naira notes has been launch and deadline date for depositing of the old notes in the bank have been Â given and also extended due to the scarcity of the new notes in the banks nation wide and this scarcity has lead to serious issues in the nation as many Nigerians now tend to the conclusion that the Apex bank in Nigeria central bank of Nigeria has been the real cause of these problems. The rumors has been strong about the apex bank and the printing agency responsible for money printingnigeria security printing and minting company plc didn't do their job very well and this also was a result of lack or shortage of printing material. There are so many rumors added with these ones as many Nigerians are tired and frustrated over the new policy that is causing serious problem in the nation financially. Â Â So the rumors has finally caught the attention of the Apex bank and a report has been drop stating the clear reasons for this shortage of naira note in the country claiming the Apex bank has nothing to do with the current shortage of the new notes. Note:: fiat currency is a hold and setback to you Â that's why the decentralized system is way forward no one can actually control your funds #finacial freedom #btc Â Pdf and image source: here",

Bcos Nigeria debt profile is very big and that is also one of the contributors of the national inflation in the country. And today in Yenagoa Bayelsa State, all the banks were closed. In Delta State today, some of di customers in UBA almost beat a branch manager nd she came out 4rom her office explain things to dem. As it is right now things are getting out hand.

What if it's no joke that those mentioned banks finally get shut down? By then, citizens who are customers of those banks will begin to run up and down to get their money out of that bank too. If you guys ask me my opinion on that, I will just advise customers that have accounts with those banks to take their money out of those banks and put it in another bank that is not on the list.

It's so pitiful that someone who has money in the bank finds it hard to have access to it. Even if he or she has to, he gats to stay in a long queue or pay an outrageous price for the use of POS to be able to withdraw his or her own money. The introduction of a cashless policy by the CBN is a wholly good idea but It is so sad that we Nigerian are not prepared for this cashless policy.",
