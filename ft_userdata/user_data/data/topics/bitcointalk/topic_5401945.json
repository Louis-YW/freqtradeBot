      "body": "I think this is something that's annoyed a lot of investors about futures platforms in the past (it's potentially still ongoing too).There is a possibility a lot of traded crypto aren't backed by anything, this is less likely with more trusted exchanges (like coinbase) but it could still be a practice to an extent. Exchanges trading using statistics based on what their users are doing might cause a greater price change - and also the chance that exchanges could realistically make money by increasing the spread between currency buying and selling (which is what a lot of exchanges already do).",

But that’s where self custody comes into play, everyone can do it now. Doesn’t make sense to wait till it’s too late. Self custody is also in the interest of every hodler, because it can help the price out, the more people do it. Economy is always about incentives and exchanges have no incentive to be transparent, if they make more money like this, because after growing to a certain size companies are only ruled by profit.",
