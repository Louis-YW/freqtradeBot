      "body": "It's amazing how the transaction privacy isn't even part of the options. Litecoin has deployed MimbleWimble for that particular purpose just so you know but I guess only a few are using it. There are chains that are far more cheaper and faster but are way less decentralized than Litecoin since it's still using POW so that's probably another major feature.",
