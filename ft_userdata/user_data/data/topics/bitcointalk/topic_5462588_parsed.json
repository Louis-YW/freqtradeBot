Can Satoshi Nakamoto ever shut down Bitcoin?I don't think its possible Bitcoin is open source,  developers cannot see how it will become possible, but if he dumps his shares there's a possibility that the price will crash this is the likely scenariohttps://cointelegraph.com/news/what-if-satoshi-nakamoto-sold-all-his-bitcoin-today",

Can Satoshi Nakamoto ever shut down Bitcoin?Even if he would be alive, how could he do it when govenrments can't do it. Even if someone came out from hiding and sign the message as him, bitcoin is standing on its own. People also probably change their views about Satoshi and stopped glorifying him/her/them, because no one could live up to expectations people have of him.Quote from: Black susano on August 08, 2023, 11:38:57 PM3.

      "body": "I guess for the sake of Bitcoin decentralization Satoshi decided to pay the price by denying himself the freedom to enjoy from the wealth he created for the rest of the world who adopt it as an alternative currency and as an asset. So most time,  while other think Satoshi is dead or an acronyms, I believe that Satoshi already have a well planned game plans and he wanted to leave the scene quietly because he want Bitcoin to grow organically just as he mentioned in the white paper.",

Rather he is anonymous, which means he could be your neighbour but you wouldn't know.Quote from: Black susano on August 08, 2023, 11:38:57 PM2 .  Can Satoshi Nakamoto ever shut down Bitcoin?Even if he has the power to fo so, it won't be wise shutting down what he created. He will rather be happy that bitcoin is making waves. But to shut bitcoin means that majority of the bitcoin developers will agree. It is not possible because everyone cannot agree, even if majority agrees, the disagreeing minority will perform a hardfork.Quote from: Black susano on August 08, 2023, 11:38:57 PMTake a look at this\"Investigations: Satoshi Nakamoto, Mysterious Inventor of Bitcoin, Is Probably an Australian Computer Genius Named Craig Wright\" https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/12/investigations-this-guy-is-bitcoins-inventor.htmlIf you are a newbie to bitcoin, it will be fine if you forget all the bitcoin and Satoshi drama and focus on learning bitcoin. The drama is now mysterious.",
