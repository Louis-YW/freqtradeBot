      "body": "Quote from: SpeedRacerF1 on September 21, 2023, 12:56:25 PMI am offering a very simple but valuable service: I will send your message by email, having a reach of up to 500K per day with up to 10M uniques. You decide how many people to send to and for how many days to run the campaign. You can make the email message yourself or I can design it for you. My email lists are US-based consumers / general interestThe price is based on CPM (cost per 1,000 emails sent). It is $0.30 CPM with a minimum of 100,000 for one day. You can choose 1 to 30 days for duration. For example, if you chose to run a campaign for 30 days at 250,000 your cost would be (250 * .3) * 30 = $2,250 and over that time you would reach 7.5M people. I recommend that people choose a duration of 3-5 days. Please be aware that campaigns run Monday through Friday as a matter of policy.I accept Litecoin for this service, so whatever the USD result is would need to be converted to Litecoin for payment.This is the easiest way to ruin one's business, we have a  CAN-SPAM Act Quote..a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations. The FTC enforces the CAN-SPAM Act and the accompanying CAN-SPAM Rule.and they impose heavy penalties QuoteEach separate email in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act is subject to penalties of up to $50,120, so non-compliance can be costly so this is for every spam email you sent.A legit business does not resort to spamming because besides the stiff penalties, your site can be reported to your domain registrar for abuse and violation and they can flag your domain and your account, there are legit and proper ways to acquire subscribers, not this way.Reference :  CAN-SPAM Act: A Compliance Guide for Business",

There are a variety of methods of advertising, and if someone chooses to do so by email they can. Did anyone ask you for your \"advice\"? LOLOk folks, robelneo decided that you're not \"legit\" if you send email. Better all run home now before he gets real mad.I expect name-calling after your shady is exposed because you cannot defend your offer properly QuoteDid anyone ask you for your \"advice\"? Really? you posted this in an open forum so any members can post here It is obvious your business is shady and unethical you don't care about people all you care about is money money, and you don't care if their sites will be flagged for spamming, you are the moron here.",
