I believe president Tinubu is doing well by removed CBN governor and EFCC boss, and he is still ready to remove some that will give him bad name in the future. If president Ahmed Tinubu Can really fight this corrupted people well in the country, I think our economy that is trying to collapse will return back to life again, because the huge amount of money our security agency found in past CBN governor house today will reach Nigeria to lay a good foundation for our economy.",

After all the security sector dey very weak because of corruption and self desires of the chiefs in power. Security na e b the strength of a country but our own na them be the wolfs of the country.

With these little steps the new president have to carried, I may say it will be a great improvement for his administration and our country, Nigeria. But the issue now is to gets better  replacement for those key positions because they be the that will keep out him many issues,I am already believing with our new president that he will do and he will try his best to push Nigeria into a better position.",

As it is gas price has come down drastically in my area. Last week I bought gas wit #850 per litre but today the price is #450  and that is a good sign foe good leader. And if things go down below, then cost of living will be much better than before. All the sectors in the country is shaking like this. Tinubu might be the best president in the country because the way im dey operate now im no dey see or look face. Im dey do im own way.",

If to sae na just a tenure wey em go rule, make Nigeria talk good about am at the end.This is a commendable move by Tinubu to replace those service chiefs wey the office the play politics and collect bribe nothing much. At least this newly appointed service chiefs wey Tinubu appoints now, go now strategize how them go find a lasting solution on how to counter Boko haram and the insecurity problem wey the hover around the country.

But what ever may, we only hope to see a better security improvement in the country based on this. My only fear about this present government is that they have no blueprint plan for the country so everything would all be on a spontaneous occurrence from the government to her citizens and at the end of the day we would have nothing to hold them for as a promise they never fulfilled in their blueprint.",

However, what I do know is that it is good for there to be a change in those offices, to shake things up, boost morale of the employees, give room to others to play their role in nation building through infusing of new ideas. It really doesn't matter about the religion or ethnic group. What matters is that they were appointed based on merit. One of my wishes is that if something can be done about those people in the house of assembly and house of representatives who have been there for too way too long, who go from becoming a governor to senator and from senator to other kinds of appointments while an average Nigerian students are just suffering, I would be happy about it.",
