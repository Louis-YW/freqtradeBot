      "body": "Paying who to add what? Its an open specification, and others have been doing it on their own, ask them why they added it to their pool and firmware... Everything is written there.Quote from: decrypt.coBitcoin Mining Pools Will Have Less Power With This UpgradeStratum v2 aims to change a key feature in the way Bitcoin mining is done, making it much harder for mining pools to collectively censor transactions.Are Bitcoin mining pools too powerful? Do they make Bitcoin too centralized? Stratum v2, an overhaul to Bitcoin mining, aims to make these questions moot.In the latest release of the open source version of theÂ  Stratum v2 (SV2) protocol, Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI), developers announced that they have completed \"job negotiation,\" an important feature for the wider Bitcoin industry because it gives mining pools less power over transaction selection....When mining pools use the Stratum v1 protocol, whoever controls the mining pool has the power to stop certain transactions. Governments could use mining pools as a chokepoint to stop transactions they dislike, for example.",

      "body": "But as my post link points out - no one has EVER written anything to use the GBT data that GBT provided.Not even Luke who said exactly the same thing as you about GBT.There are also very good reasons not to.You are directly saying you are copying GBT, that failed.So what software has been written to allow transaction bias?The pools, in general, do not do transaction bias.If anyone did ever implement transaction bias, any pool that doesn't do it, will only be worse off with V2.Any pool that already does transaction bias wouldn't allow V2 since it would make the bias they do pointless.So basically there is only two points to the transaction bias you are promoting:1) Large miners to add their own transactions into the pool and remove higher paying transactions.2) Small miners to remove transactions that they decide they don't like ... which is the obvious worst case use of transaction bias.The reality is that if you are on a pool that is performing transaction bias then use another pool.Simple ... and much better for bitcoin.V2 transaction bias is bad for bitcoin.(then of course the fact that no one will probably even implement it - so V2 has no use) <- yes of course I'm referring to transaction bias.That's the bad, and only real difference between stratum and V2, and since it's been available since GBT back before stratum even existed and still today no one has ever successfully implemented it (as I already stated above) ... we'll see what happens.",

      "body": "It is already implemented so you are too late for that. If you mean only the block template thing (done by users, not pool), well time will tell. It is just a proposal, after all.I think you should join the people working with this software reference implementation. Check their github and post your comments there. It will be lucky if they ever read your comments here so you have much bigger chance of being read over there.",
