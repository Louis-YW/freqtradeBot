      "body": "The ANN thread is very good. Even the website is nice but I don't like casino linking it site to Binance Token (BNB). Now the user or the customer had to use TRUST WALLET for any transactions which will cost extra charges of moving the token out from trust wallet to BNB then from BNB to open source wallet. Only the process is very much conbersome. Well you are welcome to the forum. Your website looks simple, and everything is loading for now. There are some things you will do to keep your company has a good name. And that is prompt payment in any dealings. I like the ANN explanation of the site. And I will like to reset the block.",

      "body": "Hey @minho72, welcome to the bitcointalk forum. Just wanted to give you a heads up that this section is specifically for Bitcoin gambling platforms. If your platform only works with altcoins, promoting it here might not be the best idea.Quote from: notblox1 on January 31, 2023, 11:21:57 PMSorry but first thing I saw opening Endblock website is that weird looking video of woman speaking with robotic voice and picture doesn't really match the picture.Yeah, that video was created using synthesia or a similar AI text-to-speech software. I'm not sure why some companies go for that for their marketing. That looks so fake. I mean, virtual AI actors can be neat, but it's all about making sure the message is delivered in the best way possible. It just depends on the situation. Like, you gotta choose what works best and what's gonna keep the audience engaged and informed. That's the most important thing, right?",

But also dev or even the owner should consider to add bitcoin because they might get low exposure since most of the gambler use bitcoin to their prepared deposit option anywhere.",
