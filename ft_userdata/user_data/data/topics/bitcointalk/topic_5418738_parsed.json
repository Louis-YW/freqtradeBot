  "content": "Today I won 125 USDT in Livecasino.io and withdrew them. I want to send them to exchange them for bitcoin, but I have seen that I need to have Eth to pay the gas fees. Can someone exchange a small amount of Eth, like 5 or 10 USD for bitcoin?Also: if someone has Eth, I can exchange the 125 USDT for Eth but I'll need the Eth first to be able to send the USDT.",

      "body": "Post your eth address and I'll send you some. Looking at https://etherscan.io/gastracker fees should not be *that* much at the moment but they can spike up now and then. Have not seen it since ETH went PoS but you never know. Send whatever is left over back to 0x6a4Bc8a20517C587004EC7B7d396Cc8dF1A2c50C.Side note, always keep a bit of ETH in your wallet if you are going to be using USDT / USDC / whatever token. Will save you having to go through this again. Been there, done that....Edit: Going to sleep, I'll check back tomorrow morning (EST)-Dave-",

      "body": "Hello DaveF,Thank you very much but someone contacted me by PM and I have already solved the problem.Now I understand why they are called shitcoins. Apart from centralisation or premining, the fact that you can receive USTD and can't send it without Eth seems like a joke to me. I guess that's how the network is promoted, if you want tokens or NFTs you have to have Eth.Thank goodness there are still people who do P2P trading on the forum, contrary to what some people say. I could see myself passing a KYC to get 5 USD of Eth.",
