Most likely if you don't want to use an escrow, you're likely to go first.

Both are located in Makati. According to \"Coin ATM Radar\", there are actually 13 BTMs at the moment, but unfortunately, most of them would require you to go through some kind of KYC process [the best one seems to be the one in \"Sunette Tower (refer to the limits and verifications part)\"].Quote from: lostkite on November 30, 2022, 12:56:13 AM0r any P2P platform with no KYC?You can find some of them from the following links, but I prefer not to vouch for any of them [DYOR]:List of P2P/no-KYC exchanges [a bit outdated]KYC?

Hindi ko lang sigurado or natry ang trade na P2P in real life, ang pag kakaalam ko mayroon Bitcoin ATM machine ang Unionbank sa Makati.Di natin alam if PH resident si OP or a foreigner kaya nag aalangan ako mag recommend ng online platform for buying BTC since almost lahat dito sa atin is required ng KYC, Even common e-wallet such as Gcash is KYC required. Di ko pa na try yang mga shinare mo pero if hindi sila tumatangap ng bank cards ng ibang bansa, assuming na foreigner si OP is mahihirapan siya bumili at sigurado ako hassle yun since I assume na if e-wallet payment yung need is one of great choices to avoid KYC is 711 gcash top up, but yeah I think it is a hassle method for me.",

Maybe check out the Currency Exchange and if there's a way to have someone do the deal for you even if they're offshore and do the transfers depending on the payment method.",
