Can they at least think about allowing bitcoin to coexist with their money? I'm not asking them to abandon their fiat. Can they stop hindering Bitcoin's development and begin exploring its possibilities? It hurts that they are aware of the potential of bitcoin and have decided to ignore it. The issue of inflation, which destabilizes the world, can be resolved by Bitcoin. Additional money can be printed, but more bitcoins cannot be created. Inflation occurs when there is more money in circulation than is required. This can never happen with bitcoin.Quote- Inflation occurs when the money supply of a country grows more rapidly than the economic output of a country.- The Federal Reserve changes the money supply by buying short-term securities from banks, injecting capital into the economy.- The quantity theory believes that the value of money, and the resulting inflation, is caused by the supply and demand of the currency.Quote sourcehttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/how-does-money-supply-affect-inflation.aspWhen will they learn that bitcoin may be helpful? What are they waiting for?",

      "body": "Most governments resist using bitcoin to coexist with ordinary money because they want to create tough monetary policies and financial scenarios that would have a negative impact on the people. This is done to ensure that they can keep the citizens at bay. If not tell me why won't any country not adopt bitcoin as a legal means of payment considering the potential that it possesses. Every day, the IMF and the WORLD BANK will announce how this or that will have an impact on the global economy, yet bitcoin can easily fix half of the issues they are predicting.",

In the first place do they really want to solve money problems. If they solve the money problems, how will they extort us and keep empoverishing the masses.If it is not what they control, the government doesn't care about you and your fvcking idea or invention. If you want the government to adopt bitcoin, simply redesign BTC such that it will be highly centralized and then give it to the government",

It hurts that they are aware of the potential of bitcoin and have decided to ignore itLike KingsDen has rightly stated, the government don't care any bit about you. With the amount of resource available to them, it's hard for them not to accept the fact that, a lot of good can come from bitcoin or cryptocurrencies to its people. That's why, they've got a similar innovation in the CBDCs to fill in but, the ideas behind is what hinders its progress.The government is about control and nothing scared them more than loosing control of its people and most of all, to its people. This is the idea bitcoin comes with, the idea of freedom of finance and that has been the major element of government's grip on its people along with its military power.With cryptocurrency having a decentralized system of operation, it makes it a direct enemy to the government but the thing is, you can't fight freedom!",

      "body": "Have been asked numerous times. There are many reasons why Bitcoin is not widely accepted as a mode of payment. Firs is decentralization wherein governments won't be able to tax every transaction unlike with fiat or fiat based digital currencies. Next is the risk involved with market price volatilty. For sure not every people would be interested to invest and out their money at risk; the price moves a lot which can yield to losses at any moment. There are even businesses which accepted cryptocurrencies as mode of payment but eventually stopped doing so, simply because they cannot sustain the business by holding it whenever the market price is low. These are only few reasons why, and I guess we are not yet ready for total adoption of this technology.",

This means that its use is not limited to trading. Bitcoin can be compared to gold and precious assets even if it is not authorized to be circulated among people. Governments cannot ignore the value of Bitcoin even if they do not recognize digital currencies in the first place. Bitcoin in international transactions between countries (not between individuals) provides much better facilities and guarantees than what the financial system currently offers.",

That's what countries' economies are based on: the endless printing of money and control of interest rates in order to balance the scales so as not to have an economic meltdown. Bitcoin cannot be controlled in any way save for buying a lot and hoarding them, but that will increase its price which will again, prove that bitcoin isn't good for usage on a wide-scale when we're talking about a country's economy. It solves some financial problems on paper, but in application it performs poorly compared to fiat. At least though, it works for individual people that looks to solve these things on a small scale.",

A government can't compromise the whole economical system by adopting Bitcoin and forgetting their national currency, although in some cases it makes more sense to adopt BTC than making use of fiat currencies which are incredibly devalued. The point is that with Bitcoin a country can lose or win 50% of their treasury in one day due to market's fluctuations. People in general can't live in such unstable conditions, so Bitcoin isn't an alternative for a country to adopt officially, as main currency.Even El Salvador, which turned BTC into legal tender, hasn't seen its DCA and holding benefits yet, because on every dip the country purchased BTC, its price declined more yet. They are in an extremely delicate situation, waiting for a market recovery, so they can finally show their people Bitcoin was a good investment.",

Inflation occurs when there is more money in circulation than is required. This can never happen with bitcoin.Some governments don't hinder the development of Bitcoin, but some of them also don't fully understand how the Bitcoin system is so it still takes time to make a decision and see examples in countries that have legalized Bitcoin and adopted it into legal payments without eliminating fiat. This means that not all governments think that Bitcoin is a problem, even though not all governments think that Bitcoin can solve financial problems in every country, because each country has different laws, so you need to make the wisest decision possible for this.The development of Bitcoin will never be hindered by governments that do not agree to use Bitcoin as a means of payment, because Bitcoin can still develop gradually as long as there are people willing to use it. Especially now that there are several countries that see Bitcoin as a serious asset to be used and developed into payment systems, it is clear that Bitcoin will never die and will continue to grow every year.",
