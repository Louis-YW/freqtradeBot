If these go well, I will get more. COST: Cards are $8 ea cards were ordered/paid for today - so hopefully have them in hand before end of the month. Holidays can always change that though.PAYMENT: Bitcoin BTC and only to this address: bc1qn37ly2yjla0thlnfsverzezrvxtxdsyvecp4es Can also pay via Lightning if your wallet supports LN addresses: moparminingllc@strike.meif you get a pm to pay any other way - ignore it, it will not be from me.Shipping can be done directly by me or item can be provided to minerjones for consolidation with other orders and reshipping. There is no fee for me to provide them to minerjones.If you are in the US and want them shipped direct - add $5 total to your request for shipping/handling. International - will have to do that one a case by case.",
