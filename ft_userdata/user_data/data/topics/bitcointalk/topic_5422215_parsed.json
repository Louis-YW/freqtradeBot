Most projects would probably connect directly to a firm or a seed company without going public, and then open a small public token sale before it go to exchange. At least that's how some projects that I followed do their sale. Why don't you try to focus on BTC instead? While the ROI might be smaller I think it is better than buying tokens from new projects. Or look around the top 100 or something and buy their token after looking at their roadmap and how well they do in the last few years. It should be easier to filter them out since weak projects will likely launch another round of funding or sell most of their tokens due to the bear market.",

At the moment it is definitely pretty quite around those launchpads and community VC's. I still remember back in 2020 and 2021 the hype about those projects was huge. I am still part of DuckDao and Poolz which are both offering investment opportunities in private sales. Of course now in the very deep bear market the number of projects that is offered is way lower than during the bull market, but i still think that launchpads and community VC's are a good way to get into good projects very early.For example DuckDao was offering a investment opportunity into the private sale around of Magicsquare a few weeks ago. That is a great project in my opinion with big investors like Binance, Kucoin and Huobi for example.",

I do and why not? as long as crypto will be leaving from the winter season and the demand for the launch pad will be increasing again as before. People will be massively investing in the altcoins again. The only thing that can trigger it must be the trend in the crypto market.

IDO might be the most preferable choice by lots of people. seedify was good but i think that the main concern must also on demand for the project itself. There are so many projects that hodl their launch in the launch pad due to the crypto winter. It's not good idea for now but probable would be turned into the good idea once market sees bullish pattern. I still try to take polkastarter over seedify as my main choice.",

Any serious projects are most likely looking funding from private sales, not via \"seedify\". \"Companies\" who are looking to get funded via ICOs IDOs and IEOs etc are very often in there because they don't get the funding from serious investors, because serious investors to a better research and want more from their investments. They usually don't get fooled with tech jargon in a same way that generic crypto investor does, so of course these people will go anywhere where they get money for their project.You might get those tokens flipped 2x or 10x or what ever but i wouldn't count any of them to be a sustainable business model, but mostly a glue and stick solution sold as a blockchain tech.",

Since you are aware of the dangers then there is not much to say except that probably this is not exactly the best moment to do something like this, since the market is in a very difficult position due to the collapse of the FTX exchange and this is probably going to remain true for at least a few months, so if I were you I will take my time and wait until things calm down a little, and only then I will look for new projects in which to invest.",

ICO, IDO, or whatever offering, they will exist for a long time because there are still developers who cannot afford to start the business so they will just let the investors do the funding while they continue their work. I do think they are not a bad idea, but high risk is the twin brother of it. So, this kind of strategy is for those who have experience or investors who can really understand and monitor the market after the listing.Well-timed selling will be the key for profits.",

Investing on launchpad isnt same as seed round. Its more of an early investment that you are negotiated directly by the project or got some slot to invest with. Launchpad are already advance and its price is quite higher than seed. But the difference for this its price and locked up period. The seed round may have been cheaper but restrict to such time where they can get their prebought tokens tu support a project.",

You mistakenly think that you can participate in the seed round, since this round is intended for large investors, of which you obviously are not one. As for the later stage of coin sales, it is now easier to buy coins from previously released projects, the price of which is even lower than the early investors paid, besides, such coins will not be blocked for a long time.",

Right now, they still exist but their popularity has dramatically subsided, and almost nothing you can find a good investment from those. I agreed of choosing only BTC for investment nowadays, with ongoing negative trends regarding exchanges, it's really better to stick to BTC today rather than these tokens that are not really guaranteed to grow.",

If it has been mostly unlocked back then, I could have made my money back at least.Because of the bear market right now that started off with the LUNA and Terra USD crash, the price of CREO in CoinMarketCap is way below the seed price.
