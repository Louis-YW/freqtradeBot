(updated issue)Posted 14 hours ago. Feb 25, 2023 - 21:45 UTCThis incident has been resolved.Posted 10 hours ago. Feb 26, 2023 - 02:09 UTCQuoteThe blockchain started “forking” (creating conflicting versions of its transaction history) at around 00:53 New York time, according to Solana’s Discord server. Barely heard the news, why is it so quiet here? Apparently, it has been the nth time that Solana has had similar issues. Do they(communities and developers) have a lower standard compared to other altcoins? I mean it has been happening many times, have they been accustomed to such mistakes within the coin development process, so they just thought it is a normal one and getting used to it?Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11bgzdr/is_solana_down_network_tps_drops_to_100_heres_a/Solana Labs and independent validators are still investigating the root cause. However, the earliest assumption is that the downtime is linked to a recent Solana software upgrade.The Solana Foundation released Solana 1.14 and encouraged validators to update to it. However, it appears this upgrade featured a bug that engineers didn't discover during testing. Earlier today, majority of validators had upgraded to the new software, and this may have triggered the bug which led to the underperformance.The past incident noted the bug in the code was the culprit, this time, the cause was suspected to be the updated new version. Seems testing a system which has a $8,620,532,556 market cap on production is the way to go, isn't it?",

Obviously they dont want this to be a big issue but for such community who believed in decentralized can thoroughly explained that downtime like this isnt normal. Many network has been much better of use and not like in solana that suddenly break down anytime which affect the whole community whose using different dapps for solana network. If I am one of those holder or fan of solana then I'll think twice with this.",

It might this was what you meant during the bull market, AFAIK, around February 2022, Solana experienced a surge in transaction volume that exceeded the network's processing capacity, causing a chain split and a temporary network outage.  Also, they have faced issues with bugs in their software, which have caused network instability and other problems.",

The infrastructure is terrible, its roots stem into FTX, and aside from the remaining development that seems to be clinging to the chain, it is showing all signs that its at its dying breaths at best. It doesn't really pose any new solution to what Ethereum Virtual Machine chains solve. Eventually, EVMs will outpace Solana more significantly than it already has and Solana will start to die out. I think the peak of Solana is done and the time left is limited. This is my personal opinion anyway.",
