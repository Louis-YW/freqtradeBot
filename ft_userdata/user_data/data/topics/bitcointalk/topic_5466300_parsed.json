In the end, I decided to go over it with a palette knife and oils. This is the result ðŸ˜„ It was a lot of fun, and if I recall correctly, this is my third oil painting with mixed media. I've decided to share it once more so that some of you can make offers before I decide what to do with it. I don't think I'll be keeping this artwork in my place any longer.",
