  "content": "I bought a computer over the Black Friday weekend hoping to use it as a cold storage device. I generated my seed phrase on it using Electrum. The computer was never connected to the internet. Things changed and I need to return the computer. I know how to erase the computer to factory settings. My concern is that someone would be able to use it to generate the same seed that I created. Is that possible? I'm probably overthinking things, but just want to be sure that the seed I generated on Electrum won't be generated by the next owner of the computer.",

I'm wondering if resetting to factory settings multiple times in a row would make a difference..? Either way, I can't risk it, so will not return the computer. Thank you for your response!I just realized that I could easily move the entire bitcoin balance to a different wallet whose seed was generated on a different cold machine to be completely safe and then return the computer in question (after factory reset of course).[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

When you feel unsafe with your device and your coins are still in that wallet, you should move your coins to a new wallet. Remember, a new wallet, not a new address!You can sweep tooSweeping your private keys into ElectrumCan I sweep private keys from other Bitcoin clients",

I'm probably overthinking things, but just want to be sure that the seed I generated on Electrum won't be generated by the next owner of the computer.There is nothing easier than to generate new seed words (in other device or offline) and transfer your coins to freshly generated addresses that only you can control.However, I would still uninstall Electrum, erase folder and format hard drive, just in case something unexpected happens. If you do all I said there is almost zero chances someone else will have your coins.",

While the blockchain is a bit busy right now, it is definitely worth paying more than 1 sat to keep your coins safe. Or you can also wait a bit seeing that you have the option to wait before returning the computer.",

Either way, I can't risk it, so will not return the computer. Thank you for your response!For future reference; resetting your computer to factory settings multiple times isn't going to do anything. Even, formatting your drive multiple times using the quick option isn't going to do it. The only way would be to write 0s to it. Using dd or something similar, i.e you need to do a full format, ideally with multiple checks. Ideally, you never give a computer to someone else that has the hard drive in that you've used. Obviously, if you're returning it that complicates that. I'd boot up Linux on a live usb, and just format it with dd. You'll want to use /dev/zero, and /dev/random.",

Just reinstalled it, so if the laptop Use SSD (because SSD drive have usage limited) then you must change it to traditional HDD (many out there people lost the private key when save it to SSD, SSD need frequently connect to electrical.). So if you want to make sure your laptop didn't connect the internet, just take off the ethernet and wifi card from your laptop",
