To slow and eventually reverse the effects of global warming, we need to develop realistic carbon sequestration targets, employing various activities including afforestation, reforestation, renewable energy, soil regeneration, recycling, and enhanced marine climate management. We will achieve these projects by utilizing enhanced public interest, corporate interest, and innovative financing mechanisms. We will offer the PlanetErathSaver AI cryptocurrency ($SPEAI) directly to investors by taking advantage of blockchain technology. Once certified, we will create a carbon credit market, opening $SPE as an investment for companies and individuals to offset their carbon footprint. They can accomplish this by purchasing carbon credits from us and redeeming them on the blockchain, making everything transparent and verifiable.VisionThe vision of PlanetErathSaver AI is to offer simple, affordable, and effective mechanisms to enhance carbon sequestration and institute effective emission control systems. These projects will help fight against global warming and assist in keeping climate change at manageable levels. S-P-E will be running initiatives worldwide to avert global warming, expanding carbon sequestration efforts, and aiding the international adoption of $SPEAI. PlanetErathSaver AIwill be completely self-sufficient, as we will fund our environmental programs and reward our investors (see section 12.0) using the profits we generate from various activities, such as selling certified carbon credits, revenue from initiatives, trees produce, merchandise sales, and corporate use of our tree tracking application. We view blockchain technology as the future because it brings the world together and helps to create a unified, efficient global economy. Unfortunately, a lot of blockchain technology still relies on carbon- emitting energy sources. One of our ambitions is to neutralize the carbon emissions from blockchain technology completely. We are also in the early stages of developing a green blockchain to aid in this endeavor, which will be carbon negative and primarily used for certified carbon credit offsets to be verified, and an environmentally friendly way to transfer funds globally.https://i.postimg.cc/SxXyDwBD/20230815-073813.jpgLouise ClaiseFounder and Directorhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-clais-b74631266/https://twitter.com/ClaisLouisSPAI?t=10RVgFZ2fE2hq52LVTuqRg&s=09https://t.me/louiseclaisehttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100085482474702Louise Claise is a qualified Prince II Practitioner and MBA.

Corporations and individuals could then use $SPEAI CCNFTs to offset their carbon footprint. This is an ever-growing market that will be worth trillions of dollars over the next decade.Minting of original certified carbon credit NFTsStarting on Phantasma's blockchain in partnership with them. We will commission known artists for pro bono NFT auctions in which profits will be reinvested into the carbon sequestering aspect of our project. NFTs will be minted on a carbon-neutral/negative blockchain TBA in Q3 as technology is rapidly evolving. Long term, we will only use our green blockchain, but we will use another for the meantime until ours has beenfully developed and is up and running efficiently.SPEPAIadSPEAI has developed a green project launchpad. Holders of $SPEAI can qualify for guaranteed allocation of private sales for these projects.
