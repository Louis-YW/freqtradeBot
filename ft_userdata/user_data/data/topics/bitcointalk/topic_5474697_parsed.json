What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?Such an idea is what gave birth to a lot of the scam and exits projects that we have in the market today,  while some are deliberate exit scam against investors,  other died a natural death due to know liquidity and lack of resources to continue with the development of the projects. So the best possible thing to do is to avoid in totality whatever project that hnonot hard capital to build the projects and depend on crowdfunding to develop the projects,  such a mindset will only lead to disappointment for both the team developer and the investors.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?Build a project that didn’t require a huge capital to start with and make sure that you offer a great service in the public and there’s a utility for that project. Beside, you can just raise your funds along the way and by having a good project and a more realistic you can easily get the attention of the investors and have more funds to support a project. Just look at the market right now and see what you can offer that is not yet in the market, be more innovative.",

Thinking of altcoins to invest to make profit to meet up your dream will only leed you fall victim of  pump and dump kind of projects. It is often noted that scammers always take advantage of the ignorance of wjo dont know the right coin to invest on. What you should be thinking right now is coin that has high market capitalization, I think this will help you achieve what you sick. Or maybe you can be working and using part of your salary to invest on bitcoin gradually gradually, perhaps maybe by interval of 4year you would have save a huge sum of money which bullrun comes you could make maybe a huge profit that you will use to start your career.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?The success of any project really comes down to having a killer idea first and foremost.  Let's be real - if your idea isn't truly innovative or exciting, no amount of smart strategies or hard work is gonna save it.  But a lack of major capital can definitely be a challenge too.  Don't get caught up in trying to do too much too soon; start small prove out your concept on a miniature scale first, then expand from there. And, most importantly, I hope your promising idea is not about building robots to colonize Mars, because that would be just stupid.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?A lot of work in terms of marketing and implementing SEO. Honestly, even a dog project could have great results if the marketing was done properly but said work requires a lot of time and resources plus you're also up against others in terms of trying to rank on top of each other in terms of searchability. If you're not in a rush then you can slowly develop the project together with it's community, start a youtube channel that showcases the development of said idea, whatever it is and slowly go from there. It takes time, yes, but as long as the project is even a little bit interesting, you should be able to get some followers at the very least. If it was bad, then don't expect much really.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?It's not possible to bring good ideas to crypto without using resources, think about how you would design everything without mass resources? are you sure you can do everything alone?Then, to create a successful product, of course you need adoption, how do people adopt without ever knowing about the product? the answer is marketing, and marketing requires resources (money).Do you think that projects like Aptos (APT), Oasis Network (ROSE), and many other altcoins fund their own development? Of course not, they have venture capital as their backers, who fund all forms of progress. If you have an idea in crypto that's a game changer, believe me, you will find people who will want to fund your project.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?We've seen many of projects starting small come online to ask for term members even before the projects are put together. It's crazy that someone gets random strangers to be on their projects, though. It's a telltale sign of scam waiting to happen. Sadly, not many people can pick up such sign.What most smart devs and their teams do to raise awareness if they don't have funds to play around and advertise their projects is to airdrop their tokens and then create room for referral bonuses so those recruited can recruit others. Some of them run bounties and then offer to pay hunters with their unlisted tokens. Those two techniques seem to work better than others with the developers not having to commit much capital to it.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?Developers tend to go for crowdfunding.  It was very popular way of getting funds.  And for this crowdfunding to be successful, the project developer must be very knowledgeable in promoting and marketing their project.  They should also convince influential people into believing to their concept.It is all about advertisement and marketing.  Exposure and good impression is the key to cater investors.  The project should have a good communicator and efficient marketer and for a project to get noticed they need to invest more on marketing and advertisement and at the same time hunt for partners that can give benefit for the project in terms of exposure and influence.Quote from: Mpamaegbu on November 20, 2023, 02:20:32 PMWhat most smart devs and their teams do to raise awareness if they don't have funds to play around and advertise their projects is to airdrop their tokens and then create room for referral bonuses so those recruited can recruit others.

Everything requires sufficient capital gain, not only the concept must be good from the development team along with the superiority of the product offered to the public.So, what's important in my opinion is to cut back and just register directly on the stock exchange if you have strong capital. After that, I was very confident a partnership would come and wanted to collaborate on the project. In the end the main goal is achieved, the tokens are sold and that is the main attraction for potential users and investors. Simple and don't waste time.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?By finding a few people who are intelligent and good at coming up with ideas about turning real-world scenarios into digital experiences and finding another set of people who are good at finding anything online so that the ideas that are brainstormed are searched to see if they already exist or have been tried or not, and then find some people who are good at crowdfunding and collecting funds for startups by creating campaigns that can convince and motivate people to put in their money into things that are just dreams but can become reality due to their contributions, and finally, find a set of people who can create and manage the project, all aspects of it, from the website, whitepaper to the management and press handling.Do you think you can do that? If you think you can just go ahead and start from scratch and work yourself up until you achieve results.",

What strategies and actions can help to develop promising ideas without initially having huge resources?Be more honest and logical when this is the problem the OP is wondering about. If that project has no real possibility, then all ideas just stop at the idea level, not any project. All have the same purpose, but if a project lacks much potential, its existence is unnecessary because it has eliminated itself from this market.I think today, when relationships create funding rounds with huge valuations, large investment funds can easily spend a lot of money on developers building a product in a specific field.  Competition is only fierce when the hype period becomes ineffective and trends gradually die out as an inevitable process.",
