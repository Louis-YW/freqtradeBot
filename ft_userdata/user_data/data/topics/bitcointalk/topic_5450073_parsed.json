Because we maynot be able to buy Bitcoin agin at the low price. Day by day it's popularity will gain also it's usecases. So who will sell it too early? I think selling Bitcoin is a fool decision if you don't need it badly. Keep Bitcoin holding and enjoy the Ride of Bitcoin. I have trust on Bitcoin and one-day it will be legalized and adopted massively then it will be very precious.",

      "body": "In my case I will continue to accumulate, but I will probably do some small selling in the next bull run when the price is well above $100K. Investing in bitcoin must be done with patience and holding the investment for many years to come. The longer you hold it without selling or continuing to accumulate, the more you will profit. The problem is that it is mentally very difficult not to realize any profit for many years. That's why I think it's better to take advantage of the bull markets to partially sell and enjoy the rewards, just as you can take advantage of the bear markets to reload more. Recently when the price was below $20K it was a great opportunity to reload, and at these levels it still is. And if you don't want to mess around, DCA with the same amount at regular intervals and that's it.",

Those who invest for a long time always expect something big in the market. The record for Bitcoin's highest price touch in the Bitcoin market is over $60K.  That is, until now the price of Bitcoin has never touched $70K-$80K, so everyone may expect that if the market goes to such a state, they may sell their coins. But there are many investors who are dreaming bigger. At the initial stage they are waiting for the price of Bitcoin to reach $100K and it is believed by everyone that the price of Bitcoin will reach $1 million in stages. But the amount of investment I have so far, I will wait for one hundred thousand dollars.",

Because what is next might surprise us. Probably the currency that will be used anywhere you go so you won't need to cash it out for your own country's currency. As of today, that is difficult to happen as there are still many FUD that is lurking out in the internet, either social media or blogs who thinks other coins are better than it. Well, that their POV and we cannot really stop them from saying their opinion but sometimes it does hurt the demand and value of Bitcoin when they do it. Many projects went down, and soon they will realize they just need Bitcoin.",

My long term plan is to wait for resumption of bull cycle which is likely to occur after halving  in 2024 when Bitcoin is likely to exceed $100,000 level and that is the point where I will start selling my Bitcoins assets at that stage.",

The price already resisted around $31,000 and the possibility of making a swing low is now very high. My plan is to get more positions again when the price of the bitcoin reach the major support level again. The reason why I sold my bitcoin is just because I followed my plan, my bias got invalidated and it is the reason why I reacted and sold most of it. Did I do the right thing? As for me yes as long as I followed my plan.My next plan is to wait and get a lot of positions in the cheaper price, in that way I can maximize my profit when the price of the bitcoin beat it s current ATH. As for the short term, I'm bearish but for the long term; I'm still bullish and I hope that it will only take some weeks to months before we see higher highs and higher lows again.",

You can sell first 25% of your bitcoins when the price hit 35k , asecond  25% when it hits 45k, third 25% when it hits 60k and the 4th 25% when it hits 70k- to 80k.

And most of the money can be diversify into investing on other things, if you have enough money, you can become an employer of labour by creating job. It all depends on individuals.
