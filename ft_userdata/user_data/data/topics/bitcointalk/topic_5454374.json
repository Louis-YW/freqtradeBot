Now china is now taking the biggest approach to embracing web3 and support some crypto projects, since china has banned Bitcoin over 6 times in the past do you think this is another fake move? I know that Hongkong is the soul location that's doing all this crypto thing, do you think that the whole country (china) will benefit from this or this case will be that Hong Kong will be the location for crypto things?  What's your belief on these? Are they trying to beat the US to it? Because right now the US is playing dumb with crypto and china sees a better opportunity in crypto, what do you think?how will this end?",

      "body": "China have always been growing their blockchain talent under the radar. This was evident at the time that NEO was born. A lot of the bans following only specifically relate to certain aspects of cryptocurrency but never on the industry as an absolute whole (despite how mainstream media had portrayed it each time). China (at these points in time) also could not afford Bitcoin to reign supreme, just like the US could not afford, or Russia for that matter. This might be different now and why they are boasting their talent and opening their arms publicly.With the distraction of AI and other mega technologies that are shaping our world, I do wonder if Bitcoin or blockchain will take the stage again soon, and who will benefit most from it. I think it is clear that the US will not take that title.",

I'm more optimistic about Hong Kong on this approach as they're trying to do everything to make their economy better and offer a lot of incentives and opportunities to anything that they can source money and businesses. But with some policies that China will like to implement and they have to enforce that to Hong Kong, changes might come at any time. While as of now, things are better and a crypto hub in Asia can be named on Hong Kong or Singapore.",

Not so long ago, the country completely got out of covid and will now catch up and try to occupy those niches that are promising. But I am also watching the situation with interest and I am just as interested in what will happen next. With the abolition of all bans, we will be able to see the result, which I think will surprise many.",

But last year (2022) it showed support for blockchain technology.      And this step started when they supported web3 technology in cryptocurrency. However, we know that China is cautious, because they want to make sure that there is no threat to their stability and national security as well. So I can say that this is not fake news, and the times are really changing. And this is a link I read about the thing we are talking about https://news.coincu.com/190437-china-embraces-web-3-0/",

      "body": "I mean it could very well be just a governmental approach and not really just a \"independently anyone can do whatever they want\" approach. This way they could make sure that the government, which is basically just a single person, could get involved as much as they want via these companies and investments. Obviously its not them doing it, but they allow others to do it for them, and they get profits in return. You think alibaba is owned by jack ma? China gets a piece of it, same logic applies here. I believe they do not want to let everyone do whatever they want, that's not on the table, they just allow certain people and companies to do what they allow them to do and they want to get a piece of it because its a huge market and why not have some profit from what is possible?",

I don't think it's possible to ban crypto, it's just that they're more careful in their approach, and they're taking it slowly.  we live in the world of technology, there is no reason why a great country like China should ignore it.",

Institutions from the west may come as well. Yep they could be playing but all the time China always welcome technology. You know how it was in the past.

So most likely it’s good long term but in the short term I don’t think it will have much of an impact.",

Because right now the US is playing dumb with crypto and china sees a better opportunity in crypto, what do you think?how will this end? China is using Hong Kong to test crypto policies. China would make Hong Kong a crypto hub to experiment with the economic implications of cryptocurrencies. If it benefits the economy, Mainland China might lift its ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But it will remain banned if it has negative consequences. I am usually surprised about the stance of the US government on cryptocurrencies. Their lukewarm attitude might make them lose the opportunities that the industry offers. The Biden government has not given the crypto space a conducive environment to strive. If China lifts the ban on crypto mining, many miners will flee America because of strict regulations and the cost of electricity. But some American politicians that understand the crypto space are becoming vocal about thier stance on Bitcoin and others. Hopefully, a new government in the White House can change America's approach. If they don't, China might take the front row making them stay behind.",
