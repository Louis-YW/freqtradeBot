We don't know what's in it for them and why they're angry. A person would probably no means of being angry having no reason at all.There must be a reason why they're like. Maybe some internal problems related to their careers or jobs or businesses. We don't know, yeah, it's annoying when someone treated you like that without doing anything.But also, try to ask why they're like that so you'll understand if they're having a bad day. I'm not tolerating them but in every story, there's a different and untold story. Or maybe, you're the one who treated them bad first and then they reciprocated.",

I also say those things to the cryptocurrency haters because cryptocurrency haters tend to be very angry and hostile chlurmcks. When you mentioned supportive answers, I really have no clue what you are referring to. But you are right. In order to not be tempted to say those kinds of things, it is best if I do not communicate in any way with anyone who owns any cryptocurrency whatsoever since such communications always end badly.\"Info t really know if there are some persons that hate you but you don't have to bother yourself because this is not a real world.\"-And the real world is much worse. People usually are quite tame on the internet. I can't wait for artificial intelligence to take over humanity so that humanity goes extinct.P.S. I just looked at the transcript, and when I told o48o to poop in his mommy's mouth, I crossed that out like this. That means that I was being nice to him. And you were the one questioning my Ph.D. because you fucking hate education because you are a worthless piece of shit.",

What you think is correct might not be acceptable based on the person's perception or belief. I would suggest you ask people the reason for their anger and hatefulness. Don't just generalize that nearly everybody is hateful because this belief is very far from the truth. You should openhearted hear people's views and accept some helpful information instead of generalizing.Â There is a saying that a hungry man is an angry man. In my country, people are going through a whole lot of financial challenges. Most people have to survive on a meal per day because of the financial crisis ravaging the world. You don't expect such people to be happy. The only thing that can make them happy for now is financial empowerment. But it is also important to treat people right. Regardless of the problem one is facing, let us ensure we control our emotions because it could be dangerous. Anger and hate are the major causes of violence in our societies, hence they need to be controlled or reduced to a large extent.",

If a plant not expected to be toxic grows on a soil and some toxins are found in it, if you check well, it is as a result of the soil where it was planted and were it grew. These people who are angry and hateful are like that because they grew up in a hateful and angry environment and they have been influenced to be that way. As much as we may want to blame the economy and government for contributing to these, People are still living happy lives even with everything. If you meet these kind of persons who are always angry and hateful, do not consider having them as friends, you may be influenced to begin to act that way like them even without you knowing.",

Is is very bad!I believe everyone knows that anger and hatred are evil, but when faced with so much pressure in life, sometimes we just can't stop. Anger and swearing can be said to be bladeless knives, but they can cut off all relationships as well as seriously hurt someone. I've been trying to control my anger, but really so far I've always failed. Life is full of things to worry about, and when things don't go as we expected, we won't feel satisfied and will take our anger out on others. That's bad, but it's tough to control them.",
