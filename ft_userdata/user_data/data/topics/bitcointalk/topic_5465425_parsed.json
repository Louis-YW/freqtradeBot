Its obvious))We are using a lot of 1xbet.com functions, 1xbet using some ours.But our team is separate and we'll develop a lot of new features soon.Quote from: 1xBit.com on November 16, 2016, 11:56:40 AMWe are not the same but still use a lot of 1xbet options including customer support.Why would they claim to be related and use the same departments, like customer support, and some other functions if they are not?Quote from: MontPythonn on September 02, 2023, 05:36:13 PMProve me wrong, show me blockchain linksI posted this in a similar discussion last year.Furthermore, you should check out hellocrex's in-depth research on the link between the Crex24 scam exchange and the 1xBET/1xBit group: Crex24.com = 1xBet = 1xBit. Owners of fraudful exchange have been de-anonimyzed",
