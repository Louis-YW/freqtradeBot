There may be some difficulties withdrawing or depositing on certain exchanges during bigger moves (pump or dump) but these glitches are rare. Back in the early years 2011-2017 it was quite common, but not anymore. Just use a reliable exchange.",

I remember that some exchanges have wallet maintenance sometimes (whatever that means). While it lasts, deposits and withdrawals are stopped. It's your job to to check these things before depositing your money or trying to withdraw it. Don't save your deposit address somewhere and blindly send your coins to it without being logged into the exchange to see if everything is all right.Â  Quote from: Blisszi on February 10, 2023, 08:39:55 PMWhy will it always served as a means to run away with people capital? Because you are using an unreliable scam service.Quote from: Blisszi on February 10, 2023, 08:39:55 PMWhat's your best advise to this view? Don't use untrustworthy services and get acquainted with decentralized ways of trading. Quote from: Blisszi on February 10, 2023, 08:39:55 PMWhat do we do when such incident occurs in our trading platform's? Leave and never return.Quote from: Blisszi on February 10, 2023, 08:39:55 PMHow do we easily take away our investment it crashes? Don't leave your coins in someone else's custody. Be your own custodian. Do you mind transferring all your crypto to my addresses if I promise I will send them back to you when you need them? You probably wouldn't do that would you? If you don't want to trust me, why trust your exchange or \"investment platform\"?",

      "body": "So, does this mean you get scammed in the past, or are you using a terrible platform right now that occasionally has this system glitch you're talking about? If they are new, have no past records, or even have accusations about locking/blocking withdrawal from users, then I also believe you need to leave them asap. If you did get scammed by similar tactics in the past, I think it should be easy for you to do this.Quote from: Blisszi on February 10, 2023, 08:39:55 PMHow do we easily take away our investment it crashes?You can't take your deposited money back when they stop their system. Even if you are not on a scammer platform, you still can't do it, hence why you need to have some degree of trust when using a centralized platform. If you don't want to do that, use a decentralized platform.Quote from: Blisszi on February 10, 2023, 08:39:55 PMWhat's your best advise to this view? What do we do when such incident occurs in our trading platform's?IMO, If you must use a centralized platform, only send the money you can afford to lose. When more reliable decentralized alternatives appear, consider moving there. If you just want to trade occasionally just stop using a centralized platform and move to dex. No need to risk your money, privacy, and security just to get some flexibility.",
