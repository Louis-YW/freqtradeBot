  "content": "PREAMBLEBitcointalk is by far the home to the largest crypto family on the face of the planet. A community of Bitcoin fans, lovers and legends Â around the world where Newbie could come to learn directly from experts without a pay for a consultation fee. Is't that amazing??Where crypto investors, enthusiasts and blockchain developers Â come to discuss topics about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and Blockchain in general, founded by Satoshi Nakamoto in the year 2009 November 22nd, Â which now has over 2,798,000 members (June 2020), with a total monthly website visit of around 1 to 2 millions, administered by Theymos.And one thing i love about the forum is the ability to reward active users with a bit fraction of BTC for learning and engaging in Bitcoin discussion, which has actually change the lives of most youths today to being financially independent through the help of signature campaigns, not minding the state of economic crisis in our various countries. And thats the reason for me writing this thread, because just as a community which bitcointalk is, there exists different kinds of people, the good, the bad and the confused, and thats why i came up with this thread to actually list what qualities and characteristics make up a good bitcointalker on this forum. So go grab your glass of juice, as i begin to bisect & digest this thread to the very best of my ability.Table of Contents1. What is Bitcointalk?2. Who is a Bitcointalker?3. Qualities of a good Bitcointalker4. ConclusionWHAT IS BITCOINTALK?Bitcointalk is a bitcoin online forum where crypto lovers come to share knowledge or discuss issues about bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and the entire blockchain in general.WHO IS A BITCOINTALKER?A bitcointalker is someone who engages in the discussion of Bitcoin and other crypto-related topics on the bitcointalk online forum.QUALITIES OF A GOOD BITCOINTALKER?1. Valuable2. Obedient3. Respectful4. Dedication5. IntegrityDetails.....ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡1. Â VALUABLE (Adding value to the forum)To add value, according to the English Dictionary simply means to improve or make something useful. So what a good bitcointalker does is that they add value to the forum at all times by creating good quality threads/content which helps to teach users either how to use the forum or understand a bitcoin-related topic in a step by step manner that even a baby can understand. Providing solutions to questions when asked at the time of need, and encouraging Newbies and other forum members to grow. Unlike many others who come to spam the forum with bounty reports and poor contents. A good bitcointalker strives to add value to the forum and everyone in it, and a good example of a good bitcointalker who adds value is @ \"Fillippone\", because he is a good quality content poster who broke the record of earning more than 2900 merits in less than 12 months.2. OBEDIENT (Obeying the forum rules)To obey simply means to comply with or follow the instructions of something, so a good bitcointalker is one who strives to obey all the forum rules at all times. Because just as the forum prohibits begging, posting of referral links and plagiarized contents, a good bitcointalker adhere to all these rules unlike others. Because imagine a user posting a thread meant for \"Off topic\" on a \"Bitcoin Discussion\" or \"Gambling\" boards simply because they don't usually read the rules and regulations guiding each of these boards. Hence, disobeying the forum rules which could at times lead to either temporary or permanent ban.3. RESPECTFUL (Respecting fellow forum members)To respect according to the Dictionary simply means to show regards or care to someone. So a good bitcointalker is that person who always show regards and care to everybody on the forum irrespective of your rank, because it has become common to most senior rank members on the forum, that when a Newbie makes a mistake, instead of correcting with love and a polite manner, what they do is acting rude to such Newbies, which at times demoralize such person from continuing on the forum. But what a good bitcointalker does, is to correct with love and care in such a way that those Newbies or anyone will appreciate ever joining the forum.4. DEDICATION (Committing oneself to the forum)To dedicate simply means to devote or commit ones time or resources to something. So a good bitcointalker is that someone who devotes his quality time to the growth of the forum, because this days, the majority of people who register on bitcointalk sees it as an avenue to make money, forgetting the main reason why the forum wad created as a medium for bitcoin discussion, and when they don't make a penny in the first 3 months, gets discourage and panic, forgetting that with dedication and consistency, they too can achieve a greater result as others.5. INTEGRITY (Keeping good records on the forum)To have integrity simply means to be honest or have strong moral principles at all times. So a good bitcointalker is that someone who is honest and have a strong moral principle on the forum, who has never indulge in any illegal activity on the forum, and Â these kind of people are always rewarded with a positive \"trust\" on the forum for truely being trustworthy. Unlike many others who scam people of their time and money through promoting a fake project on the forum, a good bitcointalker can never do that, and thats why they are special, and an example of a bitcointalker who has integrity is @Cryptobrainboss, because he is a campaign manager who has always been true to his audience.CONCLUSIONSo in conclusion, anybody can become a good bitcointalker, but it all starts from you. Are you ready to adhere to the qualities listed above? Because if somebody can do it, definitely you can do it too.So thanks for reading this thread upto this moment.. Â I hope i was able to add some value.??Okay... So what do you think are the other qualities of a good Bitcointalker I didn't mention above. (Share your opinion...)",

Just to point out some points you failed to cover in your writing which are you mentioned the number of users on the forum at an estimate of 2,798,000 but you did not do well to let us know how many of those members are active or inactive as for us to have a clue of the total number of active members on the forum presently which is the most important.",

Right. Newcomers are unlikely to read all such wonderful posts. Because it's been said so many times.OP, your text needs to be voiced and a video made. It is left to hire a famous actor. A lot of lofty statements and education on the right manners, but you forget that people are different, and everyone always thinks well of themselves. Everything that seems rude to you is perceived as normal behavior by others. This is just a forum, and communication is important here. Nothing more.Take the forum as it is, and less pathos. As they say, be simpler, and people will be drawn to you.",

I noticed that everyone was very kind and I really felt that people were more interested helping others than in any online bullying. I was accepted without any question and it was comforting to me because I was still just new to the world of crypto. I saw the forums as a safe haven and in many ways it was. I think the most important quality of a good bitcointalker is respect for others and non-condescension. There was no need to do anything special for me to be accepted, and I never ran into anyone that I felt offended or intimidated by. The community is so large and the sub forums so diverse that I never felt out of place.",

This is how a bitcointalker in the early years of bitcointalk, but newbies these days are already not performing the task they should be doing, and they also don't have the qualities of a good bitcointalker. Instead, they become self-centered and only enter the forum because of their wants of money, and not because they want to learn in the forum and also contribute valuable information in the forum. Without merit system, i guess the forum will be full of spammers and shillers.",
