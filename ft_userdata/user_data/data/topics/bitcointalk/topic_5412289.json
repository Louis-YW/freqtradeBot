This is no guarantee that it will turn out to be a good, potential project. Irfan Pak is just a bounty manager, he can only assure you that the rewards from that project will be distributed to you after the end of the bounty campaign. For the development of the project will be responsible by the project's development team, Irfan Pak does not have any authority therein. If I remember correctly, many projects previously funded by Irfan Pak have also ceased to exist to this day.",

And with the current slump in the crypto market, many projects are feeling it too, so some projects may have to rearrange their plans and adjust to market conditions. So be patient and if you believe the project is a good one, you can continue to follow along while waiting for what happens next for the project.",

I wished to buy some but because of risk I didn't buy it. I'd did 4x in 2 hours and reached 0.2$. this is big missed for m. Now it's trading above 0.1$ and still looking good.

There’s a lot of rumors about this project recently, I’ve just seen this one in bounty thread but as you can see, other topic about this project was created before to talk about its efficiency and a possible future trend.

Btc is volatile but we are not worried about it. We like this actually because this allows us to to buy low and sell high or trade btc in short.You have created trident protocol to have a solution of the volatility in btc so it means this coin or yours is highly stable and is the same as a stable coin? But, you need to came up with a better introduction. Provide links and extra information in order for us to check the project and make a better conclusion if this was truly worth it to try.",

This time the whole of funds for bounty campaign is only worth around 1500 USD which is a very very small caused by the price of tokens didn't meet expectation by the developers. He was a part of campaign and that's why he was shilling for the trident. Im feeling bad with the project. I do believe if this project will be dead as soon as possible with the goes of time. Its APY makes it as a garbage project and developers are still anonymous. It has not even completed KYC verification or doxxed.",
