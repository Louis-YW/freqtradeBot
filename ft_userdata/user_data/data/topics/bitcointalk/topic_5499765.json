If so, how hard would it be to adapt that software for cpu, GPU, fpga and asic? Thinking of a project…It is not hard to make a fork from Bitcoin source code and difficulty will adjust to be lower and lower if there is small demands from miners to mine a new forked coin.How many Bitcoin forks are there is a article for your reading. Forks mostly die with time and what will wait for your assumed forked coin? Not different to hundreds of forked coins in the article.Do you have any idea to develop the forked coin?Will senior developers will join your forked coin?A lot of factors will decide future (survived or die) of your forked coin but my guess is \"it's not easy\"",

If so, how hard would it be to adapt that software for cpu, GPU, fpga and asic? Thinking of a project…For a novice? ImpossibleFor a seasoned team of blockchain developers with in-depth cryptography knowledge? Not that hard (i'm not saying it would be a fast job tough, it would require a considerable amount of time... especially because they'd be \"inventing\" a new POW algo and they'd have to adapt or write mining software for cellphones)... It would basically just be adding code to your fork to make sure that at height x (a height in the future) you would no longer use sha256d to find a valid block header, but instead use your_own_private_algo. Offcourse, the code would need some other adaptations aswell, and you'd have to adapt some pool software to run a pool, and write a mining software for android and ios.The thing is: your fork would either become a success, and people will fork your mining software for desktop cpu's, then gpu's, the fpga's, and eventually maybe even ASIC's (and the most effective form of mining would just push the other forms of mining out... As soon as a desktop cpu could be used, phone mining would die pretty soon. As soon as a GPU could be used, cpu mining would die)... or... more likely... nobody will use your coin and you'll lose your investment of hiring a developer.Just a tip: it might be a good idear to keep your discussion into one thread instead of starting a new one for each related question you have...",

Like they told me the bitcoin code was changed and can only be mined by asic mining chips. So, considering I want it to be minable by average members of the public at the beginning, they’re totally off-base and I paid a lot of money and it’s very troubling. I would love to have someone sit in on the meetings who is knowledgeable about this. Would you be interested? You’d be invited to mine some early on. I can tell you about it, pretty exciting. Goal is to reach the price of bitcoin from $7 in 1 year, supply 51 million, other neat features. Let me know. We can talk over whatsapp.  https://wa.link/gh3krvCheers!",

So, considering I want it to be minable by average members of the public at the beginning, they’re totally off-base and I paid a lot of money and it’s very troubling.From what I know, Bitcoin as it is, if you start it anew, can probably be mined by everybody... for a short while. Then one ASIC miner comes in and only ASICs will be able to mine it.If you make it ASIC resistant, then you need a different algo, maybe RandX.Maybe you (actually the devs you pay) can do some tricks and allow some kind of mix. But every time, the ones that can mine it cheaper, will mine it cheaper.And yes, smartphones. That's a different story. The ARM CPU of a smartphone is not the best for mining. It would drain battery very fast, would heat up,... all the things the phone users hate.So a lot of effort and money for no use. PS. If you think of the smartphone coins, those are not mined, that's not POW. Those' mining is actually some sort of airdrop. That's something else.My conclusion is that you don't know a lot of things and because of this you are asking for unrealistic tasks, for which they ask unrealistic amounts of money and may not implement much (because the requirements may also change continuously)/...And you want all this in a coin you'd for from Bitcoin. Why not a different altcoin, beats me.However, it will be something completely new. An altcoin obviously. And, like the altcoins I know, it will become really challenging to become valuable.",

If so, how hard would it be to adapt that software for cpu, GPU, fpga and asic? Thinking of a project…It's possible, you only need to fork the bitcoin code on github and create a new genesis block, that will reset the blockchain and become a new coin, i will also recommend changing the name of the coin, but it will have the same rules than bitcoin. And not only with bitcoin, if you generate a new genesis block for any coin it will star the blockchain from zero and reset the difficult of the coin. And about the phone miner, i have not a lot of experience with that, but since you can install an Operative System on a virtual machine on the phones, then you could mine from there.",

If so, how hard would it be to adapt that software for cpu, GPU, fpga and asic? Thinking of a project…It is trivial to fork Bitcoin. However, the mining code was removed from Bitcoin Core many years ago. You would need to add it back or adapt current mining software to mine your coin on a cellphone.Resetting the difficulty back to 1 would be automatic if you start a chain from scratch. If you fork the Bitcoin chain, then the difficulty would eventually go back to 1, but it would take a very long time. It would probably be better to reset the difficulty to 1 in your forked software.",

Thinking of a project…It is, but for something that mobile phones can mine it, is something that needs more time to develop, resources and implementation. And the questions, will their be a community to support it? Is this community will be enough to have that coin a price value that its supposed. Remember, there are lot of bitcoin fork already, yet nothing even reach the same height of what bitcoin today. That $7 goal in a year is nothing but a dream for a coin that is a carbon copy.",
