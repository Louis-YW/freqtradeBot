This is the converstion among my friends, no wonder no one wants to always buy when there is panic in the market.People who do not understand bitcoin well will tell you that its volatility is a flaw. Volatility is indeed a risk but we can work to make it into our advantage. We can use this volatility to earn profit, but people are too scared of this volatility because they think that anytime bitcoin will crash and it will be completely devalued.",

Its volatility comes with an advantage, aka the buying power or buying opportunity. Bitcoin's wild ups and downs are kinda what make it special. I don't think it's a problem, I tell newcomers it's a chance to snag it cheap and cash out when it's high. I've noticed these markets waves always give me a shot if I get how they work. Over they years, Bitcoin keeps bouncing back and I've seen holding tight through the crazy times pays off big.",

Not only for buyers but sellers too because volatility is movement of price up or down, so those hodlers who have hit their target would sell when the price has appreciated and wait to buy when it has dropped reasonably or to their own target of DCA. Also for the traders who do spot, they also benefit from the volatility. It is normal for a newbie to feel that way because they are yet to understand it. It is fear and understanding process that some of us felt too as new comers. If you are not an online investment inclined then it will take longer time to understand what volatility is.",

With newbies or undisciplined traders are different and they will be beaten by market volatitlity even they trade with Spot.They don't have patience and discipline enough for buying lows, selling highs, and their psychology is weak and unstable so they will panic sell and take loss. It's not easy even you are trading with Spot. I really disagree if you think that all traders who use Spot trading will get profit in this Bitcoin volatile market.People don't need to use Margin or Futures trading type to be panic in this volatile market.Psychology of market cycles.",

What I simply tell them is that they don't understand what BTC is and that's the truth.bitcoin volatility gives it the ability to remain the king of crypto. Its an advantage over other crypto currency. So many newbies are scared of this and won't want to partake in this great technology left behind for us all. I don't actually blame them.

Its volatility comes with an advantage, aka the buying power or buying opportunity. You don't expect non experienced enthusiasts who hasn't invested on the bitcoin before to feel unpanick or even think the fall moments of market value should be a point of time that they should bump into the market joyfully and see the situation as a good opportunity for them to Invest while it's their first purchase attempt.Whoever that says bitcoin is a flaw is an anti bitcoin but it's certain that newbies wouldn't be emotionally stable when sees the values of their bitcoin dropping low and see it interesting.That's the reason why newbies comes to the market more during market pump while experienced investors buys more at the market fall.So it's that the newbies don't know buying at the low market value is a golden opportunity knowing that bitcoin is volatile which it'd rise again after the fall instead they're more attracted to invest when learnt the market is increasing so they thought of taking advantage in that period. So assume your friends are acting out of lack of knowledge or they're being ignorant but bitcoin saboteurs.",

Without volatility such a huge appreciation in price would be impossible.",

Basically, people like them only have fear, the fear of experiencing losses due to volatility, when this is an opportunity to get quick profits. If they don't want to buy coins that have high volatility, they should just buy dead tokens that have no movement. Living in fear will not take you any further, you will just stay where you are. Precisely if Bitcoin is experiencing Volatility is a valuable moment to get short-term profits, most traders will make the most of this moment to fill their pockets.",

Its volatility comes with an advantage, aka the buying power or buying opportunity. They are not wrong. BTC's volatility is indeed a flaw and that is what makes it risky. A lot of investors cannot manage risks. Instead of lying to themselves that they can handle it, it is good that they admit they cannot deal with Bitcoin's volatility. It should not surprise you that even among us here, there are still people lying to themselves. They don't want Bitcoin's price to ever dip; they panic whenever this happens and don't even consider using the opportunity to buy more Bitcoin while waiting for the price to appreciate again.Real Bitcoiners know how to seize every opportunity to their advantage. To those newcomers who think volatility is a flaw, they are right, and there is no need to impose our views on them. We can manage risks by implementing the right strategies, but they can't and they don't care.",
