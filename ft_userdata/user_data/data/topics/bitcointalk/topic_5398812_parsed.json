Very strange how he is always correct in most situations.However you need to understand he invests his money everywhere. So maybe it’s just a coincidence why this happened. No idea if he knew there would be a food shortage a few years back. He knew about the pandemic because he said that the research funds were low and we were at risk of a pandemic which actually happened.",

Then if you save more you might buy mutual funds or put it in retirement funds etc. But when you have so much capital, it is normal on the one hand to diversify as adaseb has said and on the other hand you start thinking about buying raw materials and means of production. In other words, you go from being able to buy the shares of an oil company with $1K to buying the oil company to extract the oil yourself, or as would be the case of buying $1K of companies that produce food to buying land to produce the food yourself.",

Also he gets the first taste of many amazing technologies built by Microsoft which we haven't yet heard off. So it's not surprising that he has a super computer at his disposal. So with his kind of intellect coupled with a super computer, can do wonders. If you really want to know the power of business prediction and analytics, watch the case study of Asian Paints who has been a market leader since 70's in the paints industry despite steep competition with the help of data analysis.

The fact that you see store shelves bending with food does not mean there are no people who are starving. If you were working in food industry, you would knew that are products that we have in abundance, and there a group of products which makes harder and harder to produce. Ever heard of a climate changes and a story about a farmer who had no harvest due to lack of rains? Ever tried buying winter jacket and boots for the next year in Spring when there are huge discounts? Bill Gates does the same, just with greater recourses and opportunities.",

We've seen epidemics, wars, fuel crises, and food crises in the years to come... and all of this seems to have been meticulously planned and followed. consequences in society. Although I can also feel some of these bad things happening, I always wonder why we can't get out of that spiral, especially most of the people living on this earth, and whether the few are dominating everything in our present life. Is there a way for people to be aware of this? But the compulsion in their life, right from birth, we have learned all kinds of knowledge, but I don't understand how it helps in life. Is it the challenge in everyone's life? I think that right now is the time for us to be more serious about the problems in our current society and to take more practical measures to improve this life for the better. Hopefully, what will happen in the future will not be so bad that it will lead to bigger crises, especially since I feel that the issue of large-scale armed conflict will also happen soon and soon, such as involving leading powers, and is this a way to restore order on earth?",
