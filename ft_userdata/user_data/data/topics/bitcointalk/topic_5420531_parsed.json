Trusting someone blindly is never a good idea. You should try to learn the truths with your own mind. If you're ready to use Bitcoin digital currency, understanding what it is, how it works and why it's a good idea will help you make the right decisions.",

Need to learn the special things that you think are important, but believe me you will never be able to do them, the people you call special are already so strong in financial matters, they will never be affected by the bad conditions of the investment market, but when you follow their scheme, this will destroy the investment you are building.Never ignore the intelligence of the brain that we have, instincts and own thoughts are sometimes much better than following other people.",

There is still an impression that there's an easy money in this industry well in fact there's not. The market value of cryptos are naturally volatile.

Investing in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies involves risks, although this investment has made a lot of rich people around the world, you must realize the risks, learn technical analysis, and learn a lot of strategies. In addition, you must learn how to protect your wallets and secure yourself from scammers, There is no getting rich overnight, and don't trust strangers, no matter how experienced they are. This is my advice to you",
