      "body": "You're better off finding an existing mining farm who's going bankrupt and taking over the facility from them or buying them out. Sub 5-cent industrial power is hard to find these days after what happened to the natural gas market. Existing warehouses with 1MW of capacity installed are very hard to find for a reasonable rent.The best location I ever found was a former pork processing plant in Northern NJ with 1.25 MW of power at 6.5¢/kWh. The rent was $4000/month.",

We're looking for capital and/or partnerships to help get us up and running on several different locations as well as using flare gas/stranded natural gas for mining. I believe we have 3-4 on-grid locations with around 10MW, 2-3 locations on-grid with 2MW and several flare gas sites we could work with. It's just hard to make any promises ahead of time due to the amount of variables but our farm averages sub 5 cents at least. Not a fixed rate, averaged.",

We would be providing you sales-quality gas, which you can then turn into power on-site with generators. We're completing a 10 MW project with another client from China as we speak.Send me a PM and we can discuss further.Thanks!",

Use the Bitcoin Blockchain fuel saver on the diesel generator for better efficiency. Also keep your miners and camp away from the lake and generator.There will be a lot of challenges to overcome (permits, logistics etc.) and this is not for faint of heart.

This could be a community project. Get local restaurants to supply the waste oil and split the Bitcoin accordingly to costs and work involved. The fuel saver works pretty well so don't skip it! I use it in all of my diesel vehicles. Saves a ton of money! Farms and landfills are also a great source of renewable methane so don't count them out.",

      "body": "Problem is that few cents per kWh won't even cover the generator capex+maint even with free fuel. And waste oil is not free as there is considerable collections, storage, etc. costs. This is a very hard price which is almost impossible unless you have something in place already like a huge dam for 50+ years already so it is free (and you are still in race with other buyers), or a gas power plant with no customers and plenty of cheap gas, etc.Quote from: AndyGryffindor on January 26, 2023, 02:13:33 AMAlaska has a some methane releasing lakes and ponds.
