This event not only represent the halving of the reward for mining a block but also represents the fact that bitcoin has come from a long way all the way from been a reward of 50 bitcoin per block mined to where we now (6.25 bitcoin). The event also signifies the future of bitcoin because as more halving period comes the closer we are to having almost all bitcoin mined which signals bitcoin scarcity. It is this scarcity that causes FOMO which usually leads to a long prolong bull run in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. There are many topics you can come across on the forum itself to help prepare one for the halving approaching. A thread here by 1miau contains recent discussions of how the halving periods seems like for newbies",

New initiatives will emerge during the time the halving happens and the bull season will be expected from 3-6months after the halving. Some say it's okay to DCA until a period after the halving, others are hoping to acquire BTC then, while the wise traders who have witnessed other previous halving events and learnt how to take advantage of it, will do so gladly and make their profits.",

There is also a risk that, as the halving draws to a close, there will already be a significant boost to Bitcoin's market value before the bull run actually occurs.",

What defines the price isn't the total bitcoin, but the total bitcoin in circulation. There are thousands of bitcoin which are lost, but they exist as quantities. But, these aren't counted when defining the value, because there is no person offering to selling them in the market. So, indeed, bitcoin is not consumed as apples, but if the block reward gets less and less, there are less bitcoin that enter the circulation by miners. (Overtime, most bitcoin ends up in hodlers' wallets)",

I really hope this helps so many peopleTraditionally, Bitcoin halving events occur every four years, and as a result Bitcoin reward is reduced for its miners. The next Bitcoin halving event is likely to take place from six to seven months from now. It is important to note that, there are various factors those can influence the  exact timing of halving event including hash rate and difficulty of mining. The Bitcoin community is generally very optimistic anout the next halving, as historically these events have been historically associated with significant price hikes. Hopefully, Bitcoin will break its previous all time high (ATH) of around $69,000, and new ATH will be established.",

Everyone's somehow under the impression it will skyrocket a couple of months after the halving. Nobody knows what will happen. I think that price predictions are there for a reason. It won't turn into one million dollars overnight but the trend is, when halving happens, price increases and there are many reasons why that happens, I say that from my personal research and conclusion. I would say that it's still purely my speculation, can't claim that it's 100% what happens.Bitcoin halving means that mining reward decreases by 50% while mining difficulty remains the same. So, miners lose 50% of gross profit. Logically, some miners should leave the game and difficulty should decrease in order to have profitable mining but seems that doesn't happen, people prefer to mine even if they lose money. But here is the thing, big mining pools and companies probably prefer to hold coins and don't sell them to exchanges until price rises enough to make mining profitable again.Bitcoin halving happens once every four years, so, this is definitely a thing that attracts everyone's attention, including news media and people who actively post in social medias. At the same time, such an increased interest in bitcoin pushes businesses to adopt it because they see that competitors are actively building their businesses around bitcoin and with the increasing number of bitcoin users, are becoming competitors of fiat analogue businesses.",

I really hope this helps so many peopleDuring the halving the protocol changes reducing the amount of Bitcoin being pushed into circulation by half for the next 210,000 blocks before it will be cut in half again. Bitcoin does not change, it just functions as it was designed to. It is the market that changes.No one knows what will happen to the market after the halving. Using past events we all expect a price increase within 1-2 years of the halving. There is no guarantee of this or to what extent the increase can be, but there's a strong possibility it will happen due to market forces of demand and supply coming into play.The analogy the author fails to factor in that all other bitcoins produced are still in circulation (those not lost yet) forming the supply. And he gave price expectations going as high as $270k. Newbies lick up predictions like this and go into fomo mode.",

This is what I had in mind. The way we understand Bitcoin might not be the same way others particularly those newly into crypto would understand it. Let's talk about trading for instance. When someone new wants to trade we tend to tell them to start with Spot trading to understand the basics of trading. All of them still consist of buy and sell or we either tell them to use Copy trading. Major exchanges do have good traders for that. Little things like this would help those eager to learn to understand the foundation before diving into it",

Because of the consequence that occurs with the event of halving, bitcoin halving has become a household name in the bitcoin community. That is when miner’s payouts are halved and bitcoin holder’s portfolios are boosted by the latter action of bitcoin halving, which normally results in a bull run. One unique aspect of the halving is that it causes not only bitcoin but also alt coins to rise in price at the same time.
