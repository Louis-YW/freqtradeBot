Recieving funds first time from wallet own by member already catched for scamming is suspicious but without strong proof we cannot add review on any profile.Quote from: acroman08 on November 16, 2023, 08:12:41 PMfrom the looks of it, he can't, timelord deleted OP's post and told him that on that thread, newbies and jr members cannot post on the thread. Oh I missed that, OP have to be atleast member to report there. Anyway another thread is looking best suitable for such kind of reportNutildah's bounty cheaters & ban evaders threadQuote from: RTR~ on November 16, 2023, 05:39:37 PManyway, I feel like this thread should be on the reputation board only because I see posts like this being posted on the reputation board.Yes because there is no direct scam involved in this matter. Reported users broke only forum rules + compaign rules by using two or more accounts to get more reward from bounty and this thread should be on the reputation section. I am reporting moderator to transfer it.",
