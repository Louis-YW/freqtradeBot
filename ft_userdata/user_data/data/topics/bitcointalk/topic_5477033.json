You have to purchase shop and then you will receive offer with high price of 110$ or 120$ and then buy another shop and sell high. The work system is looking legit but I have not heard this marketing name before. My friend told me that this site working is same like Amazon and he already withdraw so many times. I doesn't like very good reward to the refer which feel me to think about it before investing. I ask Bitcointalk experts member to check this website and gives me suggestions that should I invest in this project or there is risk involved.Code:https://www.pec168.vip/Months ago my friend suggested me one site that working same as Amazon.. we have to deposit 100$ and then start shopping then we will have to put on sale and our item will be sold in three days. I was nearly ready to invest but one thing put doubt in my heart that why company giving referral reward and also I have not hear about such company before.Now my friend tell me that site has started scamming. First they stop withdraw and tells user that they are busy in Christmas and after some days site is not accessible now. THANKS Bitcointalk community who gives best suggestions and saved many people fund.

      "body": "When you see something that appears too good and the profit is questionable, there is a higher percentage of it becoming a scam, and whenever I come across posts and advertisements that have to do with referrals and their benefits, such a system is banned to fail, especially those with higher referral rewards because they can't keep that going for long.Â Then again, another question you need to ask is: Why do they want to sell something online to you and still want you to resell it back the same way online to another who is buying it? Is there truly a good or property in there that is being sold, or are they just pictures that are added there with a price tag on them? Or, as I see in such a service, is the Ponzi scheme in another form, trying to convince people they can make a whole lot by just putting a few dollars.",

I hope your friend learned a lesson from this incident and would be more cautious before investing in something.",

He is trolling, why create another thread for a site that is already not online, OP is a member rank with 357 posts he should know better what the purpose of creating another thread he did not follow the right format on the first thread, and again he's not following the right format here, and he's not checking if the link is online this is a scam accusation report, not a discussion only.",

He did ask about the scam site before from the community before of which most members gave him their opinions which were pointing it to be scam, that why he probably created this new thread.I have seen instances where this scam sites are online just for a few monthsThe site mentioned by OP was online some month back according to Wayback Machinehttps://web.archive.org/web/20230724010734/https://pec168.vip/",

Your friend wasn't necessarily trying to scam you as he could also be one of their victim and didn't realize it's a fraud.It looks like those websites, or at least most of them, are being run by the same group because as soon one of them dissappears, a new one appears but with a slightly different concept!The sad thing I have noticed is that many people know they are scams but they still use them hoping they will be able to cash out and make some profit before the website dissappears.not sure if this thread belongs to the scam accusation board, though.",

Well there is always the case of accessing some things with your common sense, meaning that most things we see in the internet are just to try the greed in us because they make to us huge offers and promise that almost certainly is impossible but still because we are blinded by greed we tend to out see the possibility that these offers are just mere scams and the scammers themselves know this and that's why they don't hesitate to use mouth watering offers to lure the weak minded into falling for their tricks.But notwithstanding the forum is a place where one can questions about such issue because there are lots of experience minds here that can guide you properly to avoid making such mistakes and besides someone who asks questions never get lost.",

We learn something new every day.Gives me joy that people are being saved from being victimized by these scummy investment schemes, that's been my mantra ever since I've first heard it in the 6th grade and understood what it meant, kind of reminds of too of that part of the Stairway to Heaven lyrics about all that glitters isn't gold but I digress, such a good thing that there's stuff like this happening once in a while in this board with all the negativity inducing topics here that involves scams, it's refreshing to the eyes to see positive effects of being a member of this forum. I hope that more people in the future will be like OP, report their findings after consulting here or asking questions.",
