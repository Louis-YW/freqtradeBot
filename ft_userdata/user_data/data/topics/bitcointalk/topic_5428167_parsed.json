So, while CZ is proactive for the last few issues which are recent more with FTX then here goes an issue for him.I'll just take time to watch and read more news about it and how he'll answer it.",

I’m not a conspiracy theorist but it seems plausible. By nuking FTX & creating the ‘crypto bad’ idea, it would allow the government room to hit the big exchanges hard. I don’t know but we may find out soon.",

Especially when binance withdraws its support to Ftx, which further undermines Ftx and SBF as its Founder.Also, Binance was not only investigated once, it happened many times and all of them were passed by binance, so I think binance will also pass it for sure.",

The real question is whether or not they will do real action/crackdown this time.Anyway, just for discussion, if you see today's Bitcoin pump, that can be because users are fleeing to BTC, trading their altcoins from Binance to BTC. And then, they will withdraw their BTC from Binance. Or it probably is a nothing burger, just business as usual.",

I just wanna know how long the press will try to blow up fake news that already made before. I do believe with binance. So far binance is the healthiest exchange site that i have ever seen compared with another exchange site. It seems like that those who hate binance must do that even harder to hit binance.

But my question is; since he has been arrested what will happen to the assets of his customers? Will they be refunded? Or will he compensate them for their losses? Those were some of the questions that came to my mind when I saw the article. I was lucky not to have used FTX.",

Binance is still trusted as of now and I hope they will remain like this because if not then it will be a disaster but no this won't put an end to the overall market. So many big and trusted exchanges have all fall down in the past but people have learned to move on later on.If there's one to blame here then it must be the exchange and not the cryptos itself. Some of the cryptos are still trusted as long as you store them on the wallet which you fully control. Fuds can disappear but there's a chance that it will come back again after some time.",

This news background has already had an impact and shattered the faith of users in this platform. Here it doesn't matter whether the problems are real or not, people panicked and withdraw their money. Panic never leads to anything good. The same applies to the bnb.
