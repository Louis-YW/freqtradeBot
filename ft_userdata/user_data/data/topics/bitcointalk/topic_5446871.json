Yes adoption is kicking in but not all accept it yet. There is a choice not to install mobile wallet and use only the card of your bank and only withdraw when you need the money. About monitoring its the same.",

Quote from: Sarah Azhari on March 30, 2023, 07:16:11 AMso be careful, start saving now, buy a laptop and create bitcoin wallet there, don't trust too much on your android because you being wathed by hacker.Having your wallet installed on laptop is not much safer than having it on phone as in both ways you can get hacked as long as laptop is connected to internet. It would be safer if instead using Windows you have linux or macOS as those are less prone to malware attacks.Best way to protect your crypto are hardware wallets so those who have money for laptop should have money for hardware wallets too.",

This means, for any need, he doesn't need to log into the wallet to check for new transactions. A simpler thing than traditional banking wallet.",
