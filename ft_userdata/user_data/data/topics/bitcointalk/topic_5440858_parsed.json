Probably a scamFirst, when the account is being created, there is an option to enter a memo which can only be used by the owner to recover the account. Buyer won't know about this.Account should also not be used by multiple users. This is against the TOS and could lead to the termination of the account.QuoteTerms of ServiceUser must not:    Use one account by multiple users; share account access to other users;",

      "body": "Do you mean when you created an account here on luxsock you paid 500$? Am I correct in my understanding? Who in their right mind would buy the account you are selling?    Then I discovered that the website you provided has a high chance of being a phishing site that you are selling an account to, possibly a phishing site. It is unfortunate for the ignorant person who buys that account, I suggest that you do not be tricked into transacting with OP because he is obviously a scammer or hacker, this is what appeared on my desktop. Good thing I have karspersky to detect if the website is suspicious or a phishing site or a threat to your computer.BEWARE of this site....",

Who in this terrible state of economy can just sacrifice $300 to just sell already activated accounts to internet strangers?Nobody, except a scammer, try to sell to you an imaginary account and imaginary USD.",

Su is an online marketplace claiming to sell luxury items, and it is unclear why someone would be selling accounts for this platform.",
