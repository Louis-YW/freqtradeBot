Everyone know that bitcoin mining is pretty good with the alternative of going green with renewable energy source, what is the important message Troy Cross is trying to pass or is it the usual thing we already know which is the lrice of beans and rice in the market, at least let's try create topics that are insightful with new thought, you may only wanted to attract traffic on your site through this.",

The only thing I remember is that some of the heat produces by bitcoin mining was that it is used as somewhat of heater. But this was when bitcoin can be mine at home and that the hardware is not that expensive. So I doubt that we will hear someone doing solo mining at the basement of his sound as then uses the heat or at least repurposing it. Or if there is a huge bitcoin mining near residence, perhaps they can do that as well specially in cold season.",

The podcast is long, and the philosopher uses philosophy to answer questions regarding bitcoin something that doesn't interest me. Probably trying to build a crypto audience and get some sponsors since a Philosophy degree pays shit. As for the development of renewable energy, Bitcoin mining is one of many thousand use cases for energy. And if you rank them all according to their capital then Bitcoin mining won't even be in top 1000. Emphasis on mining, as his argument involves around it and that's the only part where bitcoin required a substantial energy to function.Like I have already said, Bitcoin mining is just another use case. Widespread use of renewable and passive energy requires adoption from an entire sector to be of any effect(economically and environmentally). https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/Another thing, before we start blaming how people use their electricity(like for mining bitcoins), maybe we should focus on how that electricity is produced   Maybe this philosopher needs to attend middle school again lol",

On the contrary, just like many human activities, Bitcoin mining is actually contributing to climate change. And even if Bitcoin mining shifts entirely to the use of green energy it doesn't mean that it stops from emitting carbon dioxide. Bitcoin mining will always leave carbon footprint. I'm afraid there's really no alternative story to this. It is futile to counter it as if Bitcoin solves climate change. That would be ridiculous. Instead of creating another story, let's probably focus in explaining why Bitcoin needs to consume energy.",

I don't have the time now to check out the full podcast, so I am kinda confused, is it related to mining being done on renewables, or that somehow BTC mining will help renewables get pushed into more adoption? The second one is highly unlikely, BTC mining is such a small percentage of energy consumption in total that it will not push change for more renewable energy. As for mining switching to renewable energy, that makes sense, but it will do nothing for global climate change. We tend to forget that, in the grand scheme of things, crypto is still really down at the bottom of the list.",

Renewable energy is better than traditional fossil fuel because it incurs less carbon footprint than those but it doesn't mean that it doesn't incur any at all. Building resources specifically to cater to those operations will inevitably result in even more pollution than not having it at all. This is a rather weak argument because the entire profits of Bitcoin mining cannot possibly impact the development of renewable energy to a noticeable extent.Besides, miners gravitate to cheaper energy. If coal is cheaper than renewable energy, they will use coal or vice versa. All of the power plants have limited capacity and it would actually make far more sense to give those to the locals rather than for Bitcoin mining operations.",

He'll continue to do what's best to sell his cars. actually the decision was not about that.when inflation happens businesses know that the price of real world parts/products will increase in X months. so financially if they are sitting on a huge next egg of value. its savvi business to use that value to hoard parts while its cheap. to then not need to buy parts later.then using the next years income to not need parts, they can re invest that back into assets that hedge against inflation. and now you know why many businesses sold some coin. to pre-buy real life products before inflation hits those real life product prices. as for tesla's business plancars are big business. everyone has and needs a car. there is no point getting into the fossil fuel car business as thats short sighted business doomed to die in a decade or so. so wasting billions to start up a business and factories in fossil based is a waste of money.renewable is the future so starting an electric company is future proofing the business.also. sidenode by developing solar, boring, and tesla for the earth transport industry.. is also actually R&D for its space industryyep. moon buggies, drilling tunnels and solar is the tech space mining requires. so all the investment in the earth transport industry is R&D investment in the space projects, so again double future proof the business viability in the 15-100 year futureyou can spot this because of all the tech cross over between his earth projects and space projects. and dare i say it soon he will get into the water collection/desalination projects too, advertised as 'green project' but reality is to gather R&D funds from government grants for its space industry plans",
