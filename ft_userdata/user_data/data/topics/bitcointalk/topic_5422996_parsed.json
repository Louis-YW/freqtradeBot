What are you trying to seek actually? a simple custodial wallet or a way to maximise your anonymity/privacy?Without making a clear question any answer here will only be wandering around. Nevertheless, the key point is to use a self-custodial wallet and run your own Tron node. Avoid closed-source wallets like those mentioned in the above answer, e.g. Trust Wallet, Exodus, etc. And make sure you are using your own node RPC to connect to the network, within whatever wallet you are going to use.",

If you are a beginner or an expert, then the wallets that I will mention to you now will be good for you to store your USDT on the TRC20 network without KYC, then the best thing about these wallets is that they are simple and easy to use, and you can access all the information you need at a glance, and one of the best wallets on the phone It is Atomic Wallet, imToken, Trust Wallet, and also the most secure wallet that I recommend is Ledger Nano XKeep the recovery phrases or the secret key in a safe place on an external hard drive and do not share it with anyone, and keep a phone for your wallets away from personal use and downloading cracked applications.Quote from: Anonymusx on November 25, 2022, 03:17:24 PMThanks the answers, i enough fake name, so no want 100% anonym.

Do not worry, most of the fees for these wallets depend on the network used, and the Tron network has low fees, so try them and choose what you like",

You can take a look over https://tron.network/wallet?lng=en.There is a variety of wallets listed over there. TronLink Wallet is the one that seems the most popular for Tron, AFAIK. You did not have to put any personally identifiable information(PII) like address and name. Nevertheless, this wallet is not open source, if it's a concern for you, so, DYOR.There is no cheapest wallet, each Tron wallet will work the same in regard to transaction fees. A wallet should have an option or configuration that set the fee each you make a transaction, so just pick the cheapest gas fee that will be available in the occurrence.",

This is pseudonymous, not anonymous.I don't know if there's a decentralized exchange that support Tron network especially USDT TRC20, I think you can only use swap platforms that doesn't require KYC although it's closed source. QuoteAnd which is the cheapest fee ? If you're looking for cheapest fee, I think non custodial wallet that integrating with swap platform inside the wallet is the best choice (above users already mention this wallet). Although I disagree if you want to use it for long term holding since it's closed source wallet.",

There are no anonymous wallets in any blockchain for usdt. You have to settle for pseudonymity and hope that's enough. For most people it is, but at least when you try to cash out your cryptos you need KYC and most likely if the sum is large enough, you need to provide info how you got that money. I am not talking about hundreds of dollars but significant amounts. So just be prepared for that.",

As long as I use crypto, as far as I can remember, all wallets do not use KYC, because wallets that use KYC are not safe to hold our coins there. Crypto wallets must have high security standards. If the wallet can store Tron, then it is also possible to store TRC20.In general, exchanges ask for KYC, because there are external withdrawals, and they have a limit on the number of withdrawals at a certain time.Meanwhile, crypto wallets have no withdrawal limits. All assets are in your own wallet.",

There are various wallets available that support USDT-TRC20 without requiring KYC. Exodus and Atomic are two popular examples of such wallets. Remember, if you plan to store your assets for an extended period, it's advisable to use a hardware wallet like Ledger for enhanced security. Hardware wallets provide an extra layer of protection against hacks and unauthorized access.",
