That's basically one million USD, out of circulation.Quote from: https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-art-exhibition-argentina/The US Treasury provided the out-of-circulation dollars, while local discarded pesos were sourced from BCRA’s own refuseQuoteEchegaray’s installation features spheres that connect virtual assets to real-time valuation data, encouraging visitors to ponder the changing role of money.His work also delves into deeper socio-economic questions, critiquing society’s dependence on the dollar and the evolution of economic systems.",

It's not the case of Argentina and its central bank, so it's big surprise.As a government, it's smart to use available resources like electricity, paper money to invest in Bitcoin mining and get massive profit from it, like Bhutan.",

You need to educate people for them to understand this technology and eradicate the negative notion thrown to this market. Because if they are seeing it first-hand, they will surely change their mind. Do remember, some are having this sentiment - \"to see is to believe\". They should also see what mining is, or how mining works and how it can benefit to their society. Because not all people are well-versed on this technology, they need it to see to appreciate what's going on in this realm of market.",

But then they became more hostile for some years (2020-23). This may have been related to that during the pandemic a huge, cult-like shitcoin scam (Generación Zoe) had been discovered, but also due to growing inflationary pressure after the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the government change in late 2023 one could assume that they've adopted again a more favourable stance, although this has still not been reflected in measures. For example, there is still a ban for banks in place to acquire or facilitate the acquisition of crypto-assets. This ban came from the last government but has still not been lifted.This art exhibition may be a message to the pro-Bitcoin public, something like \"we're working on it\". Milei's government is not explicitly pro-Bitcoin, although some other members of his government and many of his voters are. Milei's opinion however is that there should be competition between currencies and means of payment.",

Contract law was also already flexibilized, allowing financial contracts in units different to the Argentine Peso, including Bitcoin.Bitcoin-related regulations were however never too strict in Argentina, with the exception of the ban for banks I mentioned, but that measure can be understood in the context of a year of financial instability (>150% inflation in 2023). But I don't expect Milei advancing in the direction of Bitcoin as a \"legal tender\" like in El Salvador. Simply because he probably doesn't support the concept of a legal tender at all, due to his ideology that all currencies should compete freely.Regarding reserves and mining, it's interesting that an argentine state company, the oil corporation YPF, already mines Bitcoins since 2022. It has recently announced to expand its mining activities. However, I have never seen announcements regarding holding these coins.Quote from: Lucius on November 13, 2024, 04:02:51 PMIf his opinion is that currencies should compete on the market, then Bitcoin does not have much of a chance considering that most people use it as an investment, not as a currency.Yes, it is likely that mainly the US dollar benefits from the \"free currency competition\" if it is finally introduced by the Milei government. Argentina is heavily dollarized since the 90s at least, most people use the USD to save money. The USDT and other dollar stablecoins have recently got some attention because their acquisition is much easier than of the USD. But Bitcoin is indeed more used for speculation, like elsewhere. However, there are businesses that accept Bitcoin and cryptos, above all in the tourism industry and in IT-related services.As in Argentina cryptos were mainly considered a means to circunvent the restrictions to acquire foreign currencies like the USD, it is unclear if the lifting of these restrictions (planned for 2025) will benefit Bitcoin or not. About 15-20% of Argentines hold or have held cryptocurrencies according to estimations by several sources (Triple-A, for example). However this includes the USDT, and USDT holdings will probably dramatically decrease once the restrictions are lifted.My prediction is that Bitcoin will benefit from the general more libertarian/liberal financial policy of the Milei government and also from the current attention it generates due to the bull market, but the percentage of people holding cryptos could lower to 10-15%. However, I think stablecoin-holding people aren't that important for Bitcoin adoption so this may not be actually a negative development.",

I had expected that he would have made more friendly policies that would begin to make Argentina a crypto hub. But we need to be patient with him because governance is different from election campaigns. However, the collaboration between the Central Bank of Argentina and Alberto Echegaray shows that the government has not lost sight of its campaign promises. It shows that the government recognizes that the crypto industry is a significant player in the financial system. As long as there is inflation and fiat keeps losing its value people will always depend on Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and the government recognizes this fact.",
