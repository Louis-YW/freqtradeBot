  "content": "Recently I had to explain to a friend what I was focusing in on financially speaking and I brought up crypto, specifically bitcoin. He was confused at first because he heard that it was unstable and risky. I knew that he already has a bad image of bitcoin so there was an urge to defend bitcoin but in the end I did not. Because it was true. Crypto is volatile and even though Bitcoin has proved itself to continue to rise even after each dip, its price is still unstable. I realized that this does not necessarily have to be a bad thing especially if you are knowledgeable enough to minimize these risks. It was easy to get defensive but, in the end, I just explained to that friend that that is why it requires much attention and studying. Do not lie to people about what crypto is just so they would not think of it as something not worthwhile. Rather explain eagerly. I did this so that my friend would not worry about my financial state and if he ends up becoming interested in bitcoin then I would be glad to continue teaching him.",

But remember there's an underlying technology, and that's also very important. For those who do not have mental and emotional control, Bitcoin investment will be a headache. Bitcoin investment requires more knowledge, as it relates to a wide range of Technology. Bitcoin will be a difficult investment for people who do not have the knowledge of today.

It is a good thing that your friend consulted you about what he heard about Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is indeed unstable and risky but beyond this being unstable and risky lies great opportunity.  Despite the good liquidity, we know that Bitcoin is highly volatile because of its market maturity.  Bitcoin is still discovering its price and due to its designed system (block halving), intensifies its speculative market.I agree that cryptocurrency is something worthwhile but we should do our best to research any cryptocurrency project we are interested in because most of them are created just for money grab.  If we have to choose the safest cryptocurrency investment, Bitcoin is leading by a mile.Quote from: Darker45 on August 19, 2024, 04:27:39 AMMy point is that the intention is to either inform and educate or convince somebody.

I can't agree more, it is better to educate people than convince them with the profit hype.  With giving the right information, we don't have to convince people into investing in Bitcoin.  People can decide themselves after seeing the history, data and market swings of Bitcoin market.  This way, we can keep ourselves from the troubles and blame of people.  It is their money, they decide what they see fit for them.

Just like everyone has already said, Bitcoin is volatile. volatility is a better word to describe the market. Something risky is something that's not to be trust as it could either be scam or a scheme of which Bitcoin isn't any. This is more reason why people should try their best to carry out enough research before investing on any new ideas they were introduced to. Sometimes it's their mindset that is actually wrong. They hear Bitcoin and think that they can become rich over night. That's not how it works. You can educate them about Bitcoin and tell them the difference from altcoins. Compared to Bitcoin, altcoins are more volatile in nature. 1% price dip in Bitcoin is a 100% for altcoins.",

In 2021 the price of Bitcoin reached $69k in Bullran and the market started to fall and in 2023 the price of Bitcoin dropped to $16k. But Bitcoin price recovered and broke the highest ATH and made a new ATH. So tell your friend that holding Bitcoin for long term is not risky, you can definitely profit. Investing in Bitcoin requires planning to hold Bitcoin for the long term. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose because you can't hold for the long term. So invest DCA method as per your ability and continue DCA for long term.",

But the future is something we cannot predict, so I think there will still be short-term as well as long-term risks. Therefore, when giving advice to others, we should still advise them to only invest within their ability, and not be subjective that in the long run bitcoin will never encounter any problems. Personally, I will still emphasize the risks of bitcoin every time someone asks me about bitcoin because, after all, bitcoin is only 15 years old and too new to claim that it is as safe as gold or other assets.",

When you introduce someone to Bitcoin telling him about how profitable it was in the past iether verbally or through showing them charts, the immediate expectation is that by investing they get to see that kind of returns immediately which gives them a wrong tone of starting off thier journey in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Agreed. For those who do not know how to control their emotions, investing in Bitcoin is difficult. Bitcoin is volatile and risky. Many people invest in Bitcoin without having proper knowledge about it, educating themselves, and getting rich in a short time. As a result, they fall to the ground in a sudden shock and have a negative perception of Bitcoin. Needless to say, the safest investment in crypto right now is investing in Bitcoin, but we also have to be prepared to lose. Before investing in Bitcoin, we need to have a correct understanding of the Bitcoin risk, the market, and whether false positives can be discounted.
