  "content": "Newbies, know that if you reveal your seed phrase to anyone, your wallet will be compromised and your coins will be stolen.I created this on technical support if there is anything that I am getting wrong, but this is not the first time I am creating a multisig wallet.I used two mobile phones, Electrum version 4.3.4 and the other with version 4.4.1I also used laptop with version 4.4.1. But it was on laptop that I have created multisig wallet before, until today when I saw this issue.Because of that, I tried this on Electrum 2FA wallet too. Same problem, just as with multisig wallet version 4.4.1.The standard wallet is working perfectly fine. No problem. The issue with 2FA and multisig on the latest version is that if you generate the seed phrase, or import 2FA or multisig seed phrase, the 'next' button is not working.Like this: That is a valid seed phrase which worked on version 4.3.4 (both on Android and Windows), but not working on version 4.4.1 and likely not working on version 4.4.0. No problem while creating standard wallet, the problem is when you want to create a 2FA or multisig wallet. No problem at all on version 4.3.4.",

But yes you can create a wallet when not using the word with a typo.@Charles-Tim were you having another issue and were testing or was this something else?-Dave",

Electrum on my mobile got updated to Version 4.4.2 and APK Version 4.4.2.0.The thing I don't like is you can send bitcoins only by scanning QR Code. I tried to find some solution to this and find out that its the only way in new version to send the coins.",
