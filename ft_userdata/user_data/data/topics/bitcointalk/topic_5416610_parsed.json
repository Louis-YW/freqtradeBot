Ops you need to differentiate between the various aspect that makes up the market.",

Well, speculations are just a normal thing in an unpredictable crypto market but if you are trying to invest relying completely from pure speculations, I’m afraid you’ll never end up making profits as it’s best to DYOR first and gain sufficient knowledge and skills for you to end up in a reliable decision that will make you profitable in the end.",

If I may know, what really makes you hate speculation. Because when it comes to price entry issues in the market, I think it's a very common thing for everyone who works as a trader, investor and the like, so there is definitely a price entry thing to get a profit.",

No one knows where the bottom will be, as a matter of fact we don't know what price bitcoin will be at on 15th November, 2022. The only way out is to continue to speculate. And people whose speculations are more accurate rules the industry. So, it is high time we began to deal with speculation, FUD, FOMO etc because they are part of the cryptocurrency industry and they will remain with it as long as it exists.",

It is time to start making assumptions and to join the crowd of people who have made money from this market by making speculations. It's better to do some research yourself rather than rely on other people's information. The Bitcoin market is still on very strong ground, and with the US economy turning, the dollar will depreciate, so investing in Bitcoin is a sound investment.",
