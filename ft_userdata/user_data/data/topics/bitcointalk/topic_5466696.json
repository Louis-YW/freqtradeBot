  "content": "Justbit.io has a very clear banner on their front page claiming no KYC for crypto players. I choose them just for this and of course for the selection of the sports on their website. I deposited crypto, won a small amount of money and now my account stand at 6.6 mbtc. I placed a withdrawal request last month but they refunded my money asking for...KYC. I was reluctant to do the procedure because I really I'm afraid to do so. But I did, I sent them what they wanted. After 1-2 days they responded to tell me for other documents. They are doing whatever they can to not pay you. Please be aware and stay away from this scammers",

The thread is 8 pages but I doubt that they ever responded there and if they did it won’t have been helpful for the thread to have gotten to that length.",

I just visited the site and I have not seen it anywhere.Almost every crypto casino will ask for KYC verification whenever they want, so do not be deceived with the promotional banners. Talk your time and read through their terms of service before you sign up.Also, always endeavor to DYOR before you use a service. Discovering a previous thread about such a similar situation through Google search could have avoided you from using justbit",

So even if the ToS says that they do require it, that is a textbook false advertising offence, in addition to fraud. In a regulated gambling house they wouldn't do that because they risk a big fine, but as they probably have a licence in Curaçao or similar, if they have a licence, (I can't access the site) they take advantage of it.",

They tell you that there is no KYC, and when you try to withdraw your winnings, they ask for a KYC or some documents under the pretext of verifying your suspicious activity.Even if they do not ask for KYC in their terms of service you should not trust them because these terms can change at any time and they will ask you for KYC and perhaps also some additional documents to verify the source of your funds.",

So this is more about keeping my money than KYC or no KYC on Justbit...Did they tell you the main reason for not processing your withdrawal even after sending the requested documents? Have you sent them the further documents which they had requested from you? They aren't going to pay you until the KYC verification is successfully completed. BTW, about the 'No KYC' drama. Don't trust the word of a licensed casino if they are advertising as 'No KYC' for some users (crypto users in this case). Check the terms before believing what they say. JustBit is owned by Casbit Group N.V. A casino has appeared in the forum recently which is operated by the same company. They are also advertising as 'No KYC for crypto players'. But the representative of the casino has confirmed that they will request KYC from crypto players if they find anything suspicious. Perhaps, JustBit has asked you to complete the KYC verification as they found something suspicious.",
