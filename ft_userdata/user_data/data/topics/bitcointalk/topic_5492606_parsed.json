      "body": "Maybe you are implying that after halving the mining reward of 3.125 BTC per block will be approximately equal to Pi of 3.14, right?But I did not understand what that meant and what it might affect the price or future movement of Bitcoin, if it has any relationship at all. Frankly, I do not understand why all this complexity. I think the issue is much simpler than that and people do not want all these complications.Simply, people do not want to bother with all these complicated calculations. They just want to know: Is this good or bad for the price in particular and for Bitcoin in general?",

Bitcoins lost are no longer in circulation, so we have probably already reached that percentage, but as we cannot calculate those lost with certainty we cannot speak with certainty about the percentage of Bitcoins in circulation. From CMC, over 19.68 million Bitcoin which is about 94% are already in circulation and I don't know if this included the lost Bitcoins. Accord to Investodia, 20% of all Bitcoin have been lost, a number consider too high for an innovation that is less than two decades. There is even a possibility that this number will go higher with time and even when it might seem good for HODLers, I see it as a general problem for Bitcoin as it further confirms the risk associated with Bitcoin.",
