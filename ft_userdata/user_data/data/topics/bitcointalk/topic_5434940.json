But there was 2 problems with it.1.-Time: Waiting for the block to see the bet result wasn't nice at all, it gives a bad experience to the users.2.-Double Spends: These casinos used to let the users get the reward before the transaction gets a confirmation, and if the bet loses then the attacker could do a double spend to avoid losing his coins.",

Still, they can be an option for gamblers who don't like registration like other casinos and only use their personal wallet to play gambling. This casino needs to make a promotion to make this casino more developed and can be more advanced and can get more members. But if they need more detailed information about that personal wallet, I don't think it's feasible unless we use a personal wallet that we specifically use to play gambling.",

I invested in casino bankrolls some time ago, and I found it profitable, but I see a problem with it, that you have to give up your private keys for an extra return, and although it worked out well for me, I don't know if it's worth the risk. Yesterday I talked about the Fun Token that freebitco.in promotes, giving you advantages for holding certain amounts, which at least for the first few months was less profitable than investing in bitcoin directly. The summary of everything is that I'm going to stop all this crap and I'm going to continue accumulating bitcoin, no tokens.",
