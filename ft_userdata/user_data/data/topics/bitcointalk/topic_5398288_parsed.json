I hope that major exchange site will be delisting this coin as soonm as possibleno one will trust this coins anymore since ust not pegged to $1 and luna minted more more to stabilize ust. If i may to said this is be die project now.  No more demand from market with this condition , only sell and sell that happen now.even binance will delist it from future market.",

The withdrawal process already being suspended a few days ago, there is no way you can withdraw LUNA and UST right now on Binance. The only brand news announcement they make is to delist LUNA margin trade.You can refer to: Binance Margin to Delist LUNA on Cross Margin and Isolated Margin and Withdrawals on Terra (LUNA) Network Temporarily Suspended.",
