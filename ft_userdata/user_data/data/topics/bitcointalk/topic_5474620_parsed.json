At Cryptoluck, we believe in creating an immersive gaming experience where users can not only indulge in their favorite games but also earn and utilize cryptocurrencies seamlessly within the platform.Here's what makes Cryptoluck stand out:üí∞ **Earn While You Play**: Engage in various gaming activities and earn cryptocurrencies as you progress.üîí **Secure Transactions**: Our platform ensures secure transactions and transparent operations, safeguarding your assets at all times.üéÅ **Rewarding Experience**: Get rewarded for your gaming skills and contributions within the Cryptoluck community.üåê **Global Accessibility**: Cryptoluck is accessible to gamers worldwide, offering a diverse range of games and opportunities for everyone.Cryptoluck also employs a halving system to regulate the issuance of new CL Coins, ensuring fairness and stability within the ecosystem. Here's how it works:**Halving System Overview:**- **Initial Subsidy (First 86,000 Blocks):** Miners will receive a fixed subsidy of 500 CL for each block mined during the initial period.- **First Halving (Blocks 86,000 to 126,000):** After the first 86,000 blocks, the subsidy will undergo the first halving event. The subsidy will be reduced to 250 CL for each block mined within the range of blocks 86,000 to 126,000.- **Second Halving (Blocks 126,000 to 136,000):** Following the first halving, there will be a second halving event. Miners will receive 25% less subsidy, resulting in 187.50 CL for each block mined within the range of blocks 126,000 to 136,000.- **Subsequent Halvings (Blocks 136,000 Onward):** After the second halving, the subsidy will continue to reduce by 5% every 15,000 blocks. This reduction will occur for each successive halving event.- **Post-Mining Era (Blocks 650,000 Onward):** Beyond block 650,000, the subsidy will be set to 0, indicating the end of new block rewards. Miners will then rely on transaction fees as their primary incentive.Join us in shaping the future of gaming with Cryptoluck!
