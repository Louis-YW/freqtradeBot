In fact, for small investments in advertising their projects, with the help of hunters, they become known to a large circle of people and potential investors. Now, for example, most use the Discord and Zealy platforms, the former crew3.",

But maybe focus improving on your content first if you are planning to get any of those. example: this is all the content from your latest topicQuoteQuote from: Jocuserious on April 13, 2023, 03:53:56 PMshere your option, why you want money now?? Now ask yourself, could you do better? Are you making an effort?And current topic has only few words and it's already a grammatical nightmare. I wouldn't even mind on that since english isn't your first language and it can be hard, but i can't see any real content either.For grammatical errors you can always use some spell / grammar checking services but if you don't want to write any decent content and put ton of more effort into that, why would anyone want to include their banner to your account?",
