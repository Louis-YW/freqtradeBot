When all the fees are added and subtracted, it comes out to about the same. Other services have lower card deposit fees but higher ATM and conversion fees, while you seem to be doing the opposite. You charge more on card deposits and apparently nothing on withdrawals. It's still worth mentioning that ATMs can apply their fees irrespective of you. In how many regions/countries and currencies have you tested your cards to confidently say there are absolutely no ATM fees at all?So it doesn't matter if I use an ATM in Asia, EU, non-EU, the Americas..., it's always with no extra fees? Are you working with interbank exchange rates or which rates are used for conversion? Do you have a source that shows the exchange rates your service uses?",

All the questions that were asked are legitimate and it makes no sense to publish about your project if you want to avoid discussion about it. This is a public forum!It would be good to continue the discussion with the members because this increases your credibility and helps people trust you with their money.Personally, I have not heard of your service, even though you have been on the market since 2019, and despite the fact that I consider myself a follower interested in all types of cards that can be loaded using crypto.Quote from: vipoligarch on April 01, 2023, 06:46:08 AMdownload the app:https://bitfree.usand register in the app using the VIP promocodedh6dOywhere \"O\" is the capital letter,use this code during registration and get the virtual card for as low as 49 USDT!The opportunity to use the promo code ends 01/04, meaning today. I mean, starting tomorrow, any subscriber must pay $200 to benefit from the service. This is very expensive and unfair because it does not make sense for this price if fees will be imposed on each activity that the user will perform..Do not expect that many people will use it, since it seems that no one has heard of the service, and I do not expect them to trust you just because you are posting here with a new account.",
