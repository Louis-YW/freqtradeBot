  "content": "From all stand point as Bitcoin keeps gaining more popularity and adoptions it won't be inaccurate to say the government are endlessly finding a way to do a complete regulation on Crypto currency specifically Bitcoin, Despite most times the word crypto currency might be used to address all crypto related digital asset but the main target remains Bitcoin due to it's decentralised and distributed network as well as been the major crypto asset.Why it is obvious getting full control of Bitcoin functionality and distribution seems impossible due the fact it has no central point of control one might expect stricter rules governing the use of custodian and non-custodian wallet, declaration of all cold wallet addresses, Setting up committee to monitor transactions on the blockchain public ledger, introduction of wallet trackers and ownership on different OS and maybe lots of wild experimentation to make regulation a possibility.Believe you me no matter how advanced bitcoin decentralisation might look or sound the government will never risk giving their citizens full control of their assets. The always want to be in charge and has long has they have this limitation of full custody stricter laws regarding Bitcoin usage might spring up. Technology is advancing",

This is already illegal here, and people who do that may be fined.Regulations will come like this, and over exchanges which are centralized and can be controlled",

The always want to be in charge and has long has they have this limitation of full custody stricter laws regarding Bitcoin usage might spring up. Technology is advancing As long as the government keeps claiming that Bitcoin is used for money laundering and it promotes illegal trade, there would always be regulations. The bitcoin industry is a multi-billion dollar sector and the government would always want to collect taxes through different avenues because it is clear that it would soon become a major source of revenue. In order to achieve their taxation goal regulation would become strict. But Bitcoin was not built to be a centralized currency, therefore it already has a built-in mechanism to overcome these regulations. But the government might want to criminalize the use of decentralized platforms to discourage people from using them. Currently, centralized crypto platforms account for almost 98% of cryptocurrency transactions which is a clear indication that government regulation IS here to stay.",

This doesn't mean that the government would put Bitcoin under their control but rather they'd only set some rules for merchants that accept Bitcoin as a payment method that would inevitably kill some of what makes Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin. In itself, I don't think the regulations could do much, such as p2p transactions but if it was a centralized group/merchant, such as exchanges, then it'd affect it to some extent.",

The ban or against cryptocurrencies seems to be showing signs of abating and is being replaced by regulations that are intended to tighten the use of cryptocurrencies as well as bring many benefits to the government such as taxes. I think regulation is inevitable, we always want cryptocurrencies to be mass-adopted then it will be impossible to avoid the government's attention. Let's not forget that we live in a world controlled by them, so don't think that there is something that will help us overcome their control. As long as the rules are not too strict we will have to follow and for those who still want to remain anonymous, we also have services like p2p, using mixers, so no need to stress.",

A government will not allow a separate store of value to mix with their own economy, unless they find a way to regulate it. This is a normal behaviour. It is also true that it is impossible for governments to gain full control of bitcoins due to its nature and structure. So primarily they will target the exchanges to bring them under some strict kyc and reporting rules. That's what is happening around the world. Not today, may not tomorrow, but day after tomorrow there will be some sort of regulatory framework available for us to follow.",

Dex always won't help is at all points. It seems to me that you are confused. You can fully regulate anything. In fact, there are more and more regulations. Look at how many regulations they were 100 and 1,000 years ago and you will see that there are more and more. Another thing is whether the regulations are effective in controlling all aspects, which seems to me to be what you are referring to. It is possible to make a regulation that requires all Bitcoin transactions to be identified with KYC, but it is another matter whether this can be implemented 100%.",

It's not a regulation anymore but a complete ban on bitcoin, I don't think things will go to such extremes. Bitcoin is not a killer disease or a social evil that destroys humanity that the government must severely punish. Human rights is what the world is increasingly moving towards, maybe it won't be completely free because that would create a very chaotic society but we will get some space, some privacy certain in today's modern world. Bitcoin is the technology of the future and represents a modern world, maybe regulations that will make bitcoin and cryptocurrencies regulated like securities will be what the government is aiming for. They want to collect taxes and control fraudulent activities in cryptocurrencies the way they are doing with securities.",
