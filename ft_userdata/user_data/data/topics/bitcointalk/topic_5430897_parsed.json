How did you find the site? Was it an ad or a search result or did someone/somewhere recommend them?",

And most of the product they sell looks like used units that do not exist. They are also selling Innosilicon units which don't have any support anymore.So there is a high chance that this website is scam.If you are looking for cheap units why not buy directly from Canaan they have pretty cheap units with the same hash rate.",

Just checked the site and almost all the brands have officlal online stores or verified resellers.My friend, prevention is better than cure.
