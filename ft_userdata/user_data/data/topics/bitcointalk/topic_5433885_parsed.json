  "content": "What is Vave?An online crypto casino is a type of online casino that allows players to gamble using cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin, instead of traditional fiat currencies like US dollars or Euros. Many online crypto casinos offer a wide range of games, including slots, table games, and live dealer games, and may also offer sports betting and other types of betting options. Because cryptocurrency transactions are generally fast, secure, and anonymous, they are a popular choice for online gambling.Similar to traditional online casinos, Vave crypto casinos operate online. Players can open an account, make a deposit, and play games to win crypto.

      "body": "Hi, Personal information is not required for deposits or withdrawals at VAVE. Operations through fiat money sometimes require personal information due to the existing regulations. For us at VAVE we do not perform KYC at all as well as we do not store any personal information about the user. If a crypto-exchanger asks for the KYC, we don’t have access for this information. Option “buy crypto” on our website just redirects you to the crypto-exchangers and you can choose one of them. If you want to save complete anonymity, you can deposit from your own crypto-wallet and in this case we will see only your wallet address and nothing more.Additionally, we need to add that we do not operate in FIAT currencies, and do only in Cryptocurrencies. As KYC procedure applies only if there are transactions in FIAT - we simply have no need for KYC to be there.-----------Note: Copper Membership sounds good to me.",

So the thing about kyc should be made clear, whether or not a casino is kyc compliant or not, for example if a casino claim to be a none kyc then it should be 100% so not that when a player want to make some certain amount of transaction they have to provide kyc. We still have some few casinos that allow huge amount running into millions of dollar without requesting for kyc even though they licensed but that is only possible with big casinos that are already reputable, but other newer casino will ask for kyc just for a few thousand of dollar transaction, so the difference should be either total decentralized none kyc vs centralized kyc let the players choose which one suit their privacy.",
