Do you agree with this unpopular opinion that women are more economical when it comes to money and are able to manage themselves and their homes better than men do?IMHO. I'll give you an example of why this shouldn't be a discussion for most. If we're going to check if men are the ones who can't control themselves and have bad spending habits, we check the top 10 richest persons in the world because all of them are men. In reality, there's no gender preference on this one because there are men who are good providers and at the same time, good at money management and the same goes for women. While we're talking about how good people are with their management skills in money and by being a responsible family person, there are people that are the opposite of it. It all sets in experience and where a person has grown up by learning all of those life lessons. That's why on this one, maybe in nature men can't be as good as a woman but even in ancient times, it's known that men are more powerful in many things than women. We're in the modern days today and these things are all changing.",

While for ladies, even when they are working, they still find favours from admirer's that send them money in addition to their salary, most times this admirer's do pay the entire bills of the woman, making her have much savings for herself. Though there are men, that are ordinarily financially reckless, that spend money extravagantly. But trust me, most men pay a lot of bills, from school fees, house rent just name it, yet they hardly get a dime if they don't work for it. The life of a man, isn't easy, we deserve more credit.",

There is priority to spend on different things, and Women understand it well and spends accordingly. With men this is different and they keep on spending in a random manner. This isn't the case with everyone, but most of the Women used to have this mentality.It is possible to see Women in our family having some savings that helps us in difficult situations. I've read more such stories during the covid as it had helped them in survival. Not on this, but more real incidents happening around us state women is better than men being economical.",

I think it's less just about the societal burden that was imposed upon women and men and more on its relation to the human brain biology really. I've heard that Women are born with bigger brains than men, which could be attributed back to when we were still cave dwellers, and women of the tribe are the ones tasked to collect crops, berries and stuff. They would need to be more analytical lest they risk eating poison and killing themselves along with their families. In modern times this analytical prowess is being used not for hunting/gathering anymore and instead to aid the family with budgeting and finances, which in a way is kind of similar to gathering as well cause you have to discern which is a bad purchase and which is not but I digress.",

In a way I might agree but, that would be in instances where the woman is the man. I’ll explain;Like you’ve rightly stated in OP, men a pushed to spending by a sense of responsibility. These responsibility can play out in ways of being responsible for your family, relatives, friends and the people around you which means, most of the things your to be spending on are a necessity, perhaps not all but being moved by a sense of duty makes it a need to do.Women on the other hand, they don’t just give a fvck. At times it’s more like I just need to get this done or buy this and that and they just do it. Although, the case is different when that woman is the man. When that woman don’t have a man at the apex of her affairs or when the man isn’t owning up to his responsibilities. That makes the woman very much a man and I tell you, she would understand how to scale her expenses even better than a man would. There, you can say the women becomes more economical and that’s because, the woman is out here thinking like a man.",

In most cultures, the women have a lesser burden to cater for, but it’s also difficult for women to develop a good saving habit when products and advertising target mostly women as their consumer.",

Lets get things right, saving money doesn't define being economical. And spending it doesn't mean a person is not economical. These things we must look at the perspective of business. And the most reason why women are not billionaires like you said. Women save and spend money wrongly. Lesser women give to the society than men do. A lot of men venture into businesses, which is giving to the society. Women hoard money and spend less believing that's being economical, still they end up broke. Being economical depends on how we spend and save our resources. A person may be spending a lot of money on the right thing, definitely they'll get a good return on the long run. While the other party would be saving gradually, without getting any good return. In economics it's better to spend properly than to save well. If we define economical as not spending money. Who would build the hotels and other infrastructures today? On the other flip, men put good use of money in the society. Few men waste their resources compared to women. In fact, if men had the most population as women, the economy of the world would have been increased better than it is. Only few women set up successful businesses. The other population of women, save their money and spend less. Thereby depending on their savings for survival. How else do you expect a person who depends on her savings to spend money. They'll definitely spend lesser money to increase the durability of the money at hand. Also, talking about who spends the most money in a family doesn't define being economical. It's about the society at large. How resources are being used. Wasted or properly invested to create more wealth. Men take the most risk, in business. That's why a lot of men succeed in it. Women take minimal risk, that's why a good number of them still depend on men for money.",

So what you mean by \"economical\" is the ability to control the urge to buy things? If that's the case, my experience is quite the opposite. You probably need to do a thorough research if you want to draw a conclusion. Basing it on one or two cases is way too small to make a judgment. Even though you can argue that traditionally women control their household spending, I don't think that applies to modern societies.",

That's why in most couples, the husband is responsible for making money and the wife is responsible for managing household expenses. But to be fair, to have a stable job and advance in your career, men need to communicate more so they will spend more, and sometimes when they are drunk they cannot control their spending. Expenditure management also depends on job characteristics, social level...and many related issues.",

There doesn't seem to be a uniform reality.On the one hand, it is usual to hear that household budgeting should be left to women because they know better. Husbands should just provide the money and they'd be amazed at how their wives would manage to keep everything financially in order at the end of the day however insufficient their income may seem. But, on the other hand, it isn't also unusual to hear that money should be kept away from women because they might just squander it shopping unnecessary stuff, visiting salons, and so on.So, I don't think being economical is something about sex or gender.",

Do you agree with this unpopular opinion that women are more economical when it comes to money and are able to manage themselves and their homes better than men do?I think this is because women are more organized and are good managers than men. But this is not to generalize, as we have different perspectives, and this is just my observations based on people I have known. Maybe this can be influenced by our social construct, that men provide for their family and women should stay at home. And if this is the case and the family is run by a patriarchal household, we can at least say that women are more economical than men because they have the responsibility to handle and budget the money given to them. But again, I don't think this is applicable up to this day because we are now detaching ourselves from the belief that men should work, and women should stay at home. But again, I don't think it’s good to compare people based on their gender as there now studies which tells us that gender has really nothing to do with such things.",

If you consider the various aspects of a man, it will be seen, he has friend circle, he runs his family, before going to office etc. Moreover, men spend a little more money. It takes a lot of money to run a family, which he earns through various means of income and he spends that money in various ways. Moreover, there are many men who spend money for no reason without thinking about anything.Above all, the reason women spend less money is that they don't always spend moneyIf not critical. So I don't know if it is right to call women thrifty. Finally, there is one thing to think about when spending money, whether a man or a woman. So that unnecessary money is not spent.",
