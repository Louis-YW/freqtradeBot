  "content": "Many useless coin projects emerged between 2019-21. Most of those projects are shelved in 2-3 months. I don't know whether this is because of bearish trend or people's awareness, the number of shitcoins projects are declining. I observed them various sites like coinhunter, coinvoter, gemfinder etc.. This is a good move. But if market gets bullish again, we have to see whether they born again out of nowhere. Even if they give a comeback when market picks up, I don't think they are going to succeed. Because people who are in already crypto realised the importance of utility.   People who are new to crypto should do little research. That's enough for them for not falling in the trap.  Few funny and shitty project examples : - The holders of coin earn for every transaction. That sounds nice. But they need to pay tax for every transaction. What does coin actually do? Nothing. They will say they make it as alternative for bitcoin. Oh really, with 15% tax on every transaction + gas fees, people really think your shitcoin is alternative to bitcoin- Charity tokens. These project want to donate for good cause. That's really good intention. But how does money come? They get it by selling coins. They sell it by saying they can earn by holding and staking? How? Again buy and sales tax comes into picture. Without proper utility how does it can survive? - Gaming token. They don't even have game yet. But they release the tokens first. We can understand they are using this tokens as raising for funds for development of game. But they don't even have a prototype. They just have a nicely edited video. Those game concepts are very silly. They don't expect whether people play it or not. They expect holders of those token to play. (I listened this dialogue from a project owner in a AMA).  Holders of the coin should invest in the project. He says holders will play as their money is involved in the project. There are many other shitty coins. Hundred different concepts. None of them has proper utility. Hope its a end of those shitcoins.",

Its all just empty promises and most of the time they end up as rug pulls.",

These developers are scammers. They didn't know how to make revenue from active product that can be used to burn the token. The developers that developed this kind of token was scammer",

But yet I don't agree with one thing. I think gaming tokens aren't shitcoins. There are many uses for gaming coins if developer is important one and if game is good. Costumes items themselves are whole digital market. So I think games will keep on adapting Blockchain tech and use alternative coins.",

The entire market is experiencing a roller coaster so, they can't depend on those investments so most investors of it start to dump before they even do it. The devs are already on their way to dumping what they've made, this is becoming a cycle for those devs that have been on this market and getting quick profits from the newbie investors. Someday, most investors will only rely on a very few cryptocurrencies and many will stop believing these shitcoins.",

People who seek to make profit by defrauding people to invest in these shitcoins will always exist and devise new means to make their shitcoins enticing to new investors, that unfortunately is the bitter truth.

Even though the bear market is a bad thing overall of course for everyone that is involved into crypto and that is holding some crypto assets, i agree with you that it also brings some positive developments with it. As you already said, now during the bear market the flood of useless shit-coins that get created each and every day has slowed down immensely, which is a great thing. I still remember a few months back, during the height of the bullrun and the meme-coin craze that literally hundreds of those shit-coins where created each and every day. That definitely hurt the market overall and was also one reason for this bear market. I hope the meme-coin craze never comes back.",

If we agreed that the definition shitcoins is a coin that has no utility, some cryptocurrency that exists right now could be categorized without an utility, I can safely say Dogecoin for example. An absurd economic mechanism is the trait of shitcoin you mentioned, but bear in mind, that those kinds of motives will evolved and rehashed in another year yet to come.And I don't think most people in cryptocurrencies communities are solely here for the utilitarian aspect, nor we can force people to use any token or coin for the utility factor. It might a reasonable thing to do. Nevertheless, some people just want to have fun, either playing with shitcoins or creating them.",

Because the benefits of blockchain can be individually programmed into a something that a certain business needs. Some businesses do not care about POW but would rather have POS. Others would rather treat their coin as a SNFT. And some want to create an entire ecosystem bubble for themselves and for their project case uses. So saying there is no need, is not right. But it remains to be said, unless you are the one bringing something new to blockchain, investing in Bitcoin would probably be a better road to take, financially.",

It’s not going to end, it’s just there and will remain to exist no matter which blockchain are they minted. Of course, there’s what we call short term, mid term and long term shitcoins. However, short term is the most common one because they only got momentum for weeks or just 2-3 months before the whales or traders gonna dump it (or devs might going to rug pull at some point). There are many coins and tokens that are way down below their initial value during the ICO or so, and most of them aren’t developing their products or so. However, we do acknowledge that there are projects who are still operating normally like a business even if their respective native tokens are way below its original value.",

The coin will grow once the bull market resumes.Also crypto market is very new and a lot of new coins are developed every day. A lot of these coins would be shitcoins but since this market is new, people will keep investing in the shitcoins too. The era of shitcoin won't end unless the crypto market matures.",
