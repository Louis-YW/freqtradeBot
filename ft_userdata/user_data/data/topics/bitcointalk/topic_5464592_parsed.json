You see something valued at $8 billion and assume that it must have such a value hidden somewhere. And the more the price increases, the greater the hidden value must be, right? It's just strange that it can't be proven tangibly, no one uses this crap, no one knows whats its for, but it must be there if the valuation is so high, right? Nothing could be further from the truth. The investor's role is to estimate value and potential and buy something whose valuation is below this value. I did this with BNB when it was @ $15 in 2019. I estimated Binance's profits in 2 different ways, the average deflation of the token, returns from various competitions (lauchpads/lauchpools), staking roi, compared it to the Nasdaq P/E and the average dividend on SP500 and I found it cheap so I invested. Try do it with shiba and doge or other 10 000 memecoins lauched in 2023. indicate the advantages that shiba has over 10,000 other meme coins apart from the high valuation.For me the estimated value of shiba is around $1,000,000 and dogecoin is around $50,000,000 and only because they have some momentum and recognition (people know what it is thanks to 2021 shameful bubble). Which means that shiba is probably overvalued 4,000 times and dogecoin 150 times and therefore they are not worth time and money. Prove me wrong.",

If valuation were on usefulness in exchange, then many other exchange tokens like MXC or OKX would have exploded by now.Or probably BNB is just the first to have this kind of native token, that really started everything, so yeah there could be an element of luck. And then those who have missed the boat, might have tried it with MXC or even OKX and it failed.I must admit that I also fall for this hype around 2018, invested on some exchanges project but it never took off.As for the potential on PulseChain, not really sure though, maybe if there is some element of luck again, or if you are one early investors, then maybe once it took off, you can have your profits later. Just like the early investors of Doge or Shiba.",

If valuation were on usefulness in exchange, then many other exchange tokens like MXC or OKX would have exploded by now.However, there is a difference between an industry leader and a junk exchange. Read my thread. It wasn't a pure luck like Pepe, which has nothing but a name. For example, binance had such a strong position that crypto projects paid millions for listings in the form of launchpads. Binance shared these tokens with bnb hodlers, which, when dumped on the day of listing, managed to bring 20% APY (in 2019 I overestimated it)Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on December 16, 2019, 01:21:47 PMI have dumped to BTC every token right after airdrop.JEX ~ 5$BNB ~ 17$NKN ~ 16$KAVA ~ 20$IOST ~ 0.5$CTXC ~ 22$QTUM ~ 0,6$TROY ~ 400$ - 200$ investment= 200$ profitVITE ~ 19$SUM = 300$ ~ 20 BNB - That's a return from holding 200 BNB for 2 months. 10% return in 2 months - 60% annuallyAnd all this on a token that is deflationary (around 7% annally) because Binance burns tokens for part of the profits. In 2019, bnb was fundamentally undervalued and I proved this in my thread. The same cannot be said about PEPE, because just making a token and coming up with a name takes 15 minutes of work and a maximum value of $50.",

Do you have a count for how many meme coins are created and published within a month? Or do you know how many meme coins were created at the time when Doge or Shiba were being hyped? I don't think you do, but if you say something like this, you need to have a general idea about these things. When there are thousands of them created and only a couple actually manage to get significant hype and popularity, it doesn't make them all good.Just because a few meme coins in all these years managed to gain some value and some people got significant profit from them you can't say that it is worth investing money or wasting time on a meme coin which god knows will get any hype or not and we all know that meme coins die without hype.",

Meme coin as the name implies, it is already under criticism and because if that name many do not like to even invest in them because as for them, it is a waste of time to invest in meme or shitcoins because they is no value in them. And if luck gone out from the investor, the project might even becomes a Ponzi Scheme (Scam Project) and you lost everything so because of all these untrustworthy nature of meme coins people run from them.If a meme coin has 420,000,000 as a start then it is good start but how genuine is the project and how long will the project last with that amount of money. Because many projects start with huge amount yet they collapsed. We should not rush to invest in any meme coin but make a thorough investigation before investing and even at that doesn't invest because big amount. \"Only invest what you can offer to lose and it will not pain you if happened\".",
