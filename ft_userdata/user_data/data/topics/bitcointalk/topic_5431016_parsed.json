  "content": "Hello everyone.Every once in a while I do some research here and there, to see which crypto projects are more hyped and talked about. Remember, I'm not saying these are good projects or have strong fundamentals, just that I believe they are more hyped than the others. So they can be a good investment, or a bad one.This time I found these:1. The obvious ones which are almost always hyped: BTC, ETH, BNB, Doge, Matic and ADA. We all know about them, so let's focus mostly on the others.2. Polkadot (DOT)3. ApeCoin (APE)4. Dash 2 Trade (D2T): This one's not still in exchanges, but supposedly it's a strong crypto platform, and hyped.5. The Graph (GRT)6. NEAR Protocol (NEAR)7. Decentraland (MANA)So which one of them do you think will perform better in future? If you have any opinion for (or against) anyone of those, I'll be glad to hear it. ================P.S: Please note that I know all about hype. I don't claim that crypto projects grow based on hype, like some thought. I just need info about these projects, or your opinion about any of them. Thanks.",

And that's why I think Apecoin will also have the same fate if this thing against SEC and its main project BAYC will not be solved.",

Avoid hyped shitcoins. Hypes comes hypes goes. Most often with price decline big time. 99% coins hyped in 2017 are dead now or underperformed during 2021 bull market (EOS, NEM, NEO, VET). Today, when 2022 is close to end, after 600 days of bear market, when we are close to recession, I suggest to skip all shitcoins. No matter how hyped are they. DCA bitcoin now. Thats the best strategy you can have now because if its not the end of bear market - BTC will dump less than shitcoins, if its the end of bear market and we about to start bull run - BTC will outperform alts in the first phase (before new ATH). Alts most often kicks in in the middle of cycle. so hold bitcoin and wait for new ATH, than flip to altcoins and check whats hyped right now.",

Just like others, Collecting fundamentally strong coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and others would be a great move headed towards the upcoming bull market. I also think it's pretty early to guess what kind of future does the hype coins will go in the future. Those hypecoins should be aligned with the trend for them to rise. The hype won't make a coin rise during the bear market.",

I don't usually invest because of hyped because i believe it is not a strong reason for investment, so many projects with lots of hype don't usually last before they become obsolete. So, it is better to invest in a project with utility and provides services that will be useful in the space, and I believe Near protocol will be that project.",

Though it's not much advisable to invest a lot of money into alts, I would be segregating small amounts in all of them along with big share in the bitcoin for the long term hodlings.

That's why as for the BAYC and Apecoin, we know that both of them are connected to each other so a bang of bad news for the other, hits the other and that's why I think Apecoin would be out of the choice if we're still talking about hype and pumps for next year.Also, the pump for these projects were done and we commonly see projects that have pumped already would unlikely to repeat by next year or so.",

I don't know if those are hyped projects. For me \"hyped\" means new and everyone is talking about it but the projects that you have listed are all big and established already so i think the hype-phase of them is already over, which is a good thing in my opinion. From the projects included in your list i only really took a look into NEAR and the Graph. Back then i even tried to get into the pre-sale of The Graph but sadly i failed to get an allocation. Back then the public sale price was 0,03 per token. At the moment we are at around 0,06$ per token so this could be a good entry point. Don't for get though that the seed sale price per graph was only 0,003$ per token, so those big VC's probably still have a heavy bag that they could dump anytime.",
