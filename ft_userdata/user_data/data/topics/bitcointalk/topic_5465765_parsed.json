I have 4G Internet on the mining farms in the village, and so looking through the logs, I see that all the farms did not work for 2-4 hours at the same time per week. The Internet has fallen off, but for mining this is not a big problem, especially now. And for the Ethereum node, you need a reliable Internet in order not to receive fines, so only large hosting companies guarantee a good such Internet.",

I mined gaga nodes but after every 5 or ten minutes it stopped automatically and I have to restart again. Ethereum node will be more heavier and I think high requirements to run. Do you think Normal Android phones 4g supported will be enough to mine full nodes ?Quote from: FP91G on September 06, 2023, 05:58:31 PMI have 4G Internet on the mining farms in the village, and so looking through the logs, I see that all the farms did not work for 2-4 hours at the same time per week.

And for the Ethereum node, you need a reliable Internet in order not to receive fines, so only large hosting companies guarantee a good such Internet.Same issue here and we have not reliable network in village. Only area with super high speed internet connection will run full nodes precisely while we will face so many connection error. Vitalik also expressed apprehension that at start they will face many problem and new challenges but they will try to solve all issue. This will be very high revolution in mining and idea of buying expensive nodes will be down. Every one will be able to strengthen the Ethereum network which i think will bring positive results in the future.",

      "body": "If internet is so poor you get better service on mobile perhaps you shouldn't be considering running a full node at all.And if you do you shouldn't use a phone, use a regular desktop with a mobile adapter. Using phones, or anything with a battery forany hard work is just a bad idea. The heat is a fire hazard and even if it doesn't go up in flames the battery will age faster.Quote from: AnonBitCoiner on September 07, 2023, 05:52:09 PM This will be very high revolution in mining and idea of buying expensive nodes will be down.

If a phone can do it you don't need \"expensive nodes\", an old PC will do fine.",

The time when the Internet is unavailable is much shorter, but a day it happens that the Internet is unavailable for 5-10 minutes, although the modem is working. Therefore, most likely you need to buy a new phone and connect it to the Wi-Fi network of the wired Internet.",
