  "content": "Rami has been traveling extensively in the past year to visit Bitcoin communities across the globe; visiting Baltic Honeybadger in Riga, the Bobspace people in Bangkok and the Freedom Festival in Boston/Mass.Late in 2023 the Bitcoin community in Vietnam was honoured to welcome Rami and our team took the opportunity to converse with him about his journey - in the physical and spiritual realm.Quote\"I left Iwa to work for this company called Playmysong. That led me to the US in SF.That was a time when all of the early bitcoin meetups were happening. Ironically, I was living in Soma just a few blocks away.(...)I have to say… I started going to these blockchain conferences in Dubai and Malta… and the more I spoke to these people, the less convinced I became. The excitement was there, but it was more how to make money as fast as possible. And in every blockchain conference, there were maybe 1 or 2 bitcoin people, and when you talk to them, it’s more calm and they talk about how Bitcoin specifically is a much bigger thing. This is about changing the world and not about short term gains or anything like that.Over time everything started to click. I had the tech background, I had the puck rock background. I started understanding bitcoin to the point of- Bitcoin Is The Most Important Thing. Everything else is secondary and in most cases harmful to people. By 2020 I went bitcoin only. (...)And with bitcoin culture, it’s exactly the same thing. There is distrust with the legacy organizations. Obviously, this “Don’t Trust. Verify.” principle is great. Sometimes you read something about bitcoin that is great – it makes sense, it’s well researched and accurate. But so often that is not the case and when they write about bitcoin, it’s so full of errors. Either ignorant or deliberate misinformation. A very similar kind of vibe to punk rock back in the day. Our full interview with Rami: https://bitcoinvn.io/news/bitcoin-is-punk/Some of Rami's Bitcoin songs can be listened to here: https://www.youtube.com/@the_higher_low",

You find them keeping these currencies in central platforms and rarely using an open source wallet and most of their spending is through Bitcoin debit cards.Yeah, I also haven't heard about him before but after visiting his YouTube channel I found that's he's a lover of Bitcoin and has some good songs related to Bitcoin. He isn't famous by any means but who knows he might get more fame by visiting such Bitcoin communities again and again.To be honest everyone these days care more about Bitcoin's value than it's real purpose. Most users find it a great asset and suggest others to hold it for long term if they want to be free from any financial problems. At least now it's more likely considered as an asset than a P2P payment solution.Yes, it's also true that most people keep their Bitcoin in centralized exchanges and they don't know much about personal wallets or to be specific open source wallets. Such people would go with any platform as far as they can use it with ease. Those are the people who end up crying when their coins get hacked or exchanges freeze their coins for no reason. I don't know if Rami is one of those or not but he seems to be a Bitcoin lover to me.",

      "body": "Totally agree with that statement, bitcoin challenges the status quo and spits on it's face, that's how punk is ever since and I do believe that bitcoin is the modern equivalent of that punk part, punk didn't die, it just evolved and adapted itself to criticize the current situation that needs a change. It's refreshing to see other people from outside the tech industry embroiled in crypto because I don't expect a lot of them to be enthusiastic about it but Rami is an exception to that rule.",

So it is nice to know that Rami Korhonen I promoting Bitcoin with his music. Many skeptics will be surprised at the level Bitcoin has reached because they believe that the coin would have died a long time ago. These anti-bitcoin forces did everything possible such as misinformation and the use of unfavorable policies to discourage people from adopting this uncommon innovation. Today Bitcoin is now an important part of the global financial system and some nations are even reversing some contrary laws that were enacted to stop its adoption. I am also glad to know that Rami Korhonen I living on only Bitcoin but achieving this feat will be difficult in some locations because Bitcoin I still facing some restrictions. However, we are looking forward to a better future where Bitcoin will be generally accepted and used as a legal tender.",

Many of them are giving bad statements about Bitcoin some say it is being used for money laundering which is an illegal activity and many have much other rubbish statements to make it unsuccessful which is going to be their failed statements. It seems like Bitcoin will surpass the Gold market cap in this Bull run which is going to be a very big achievement for it since the day it was born.couple of months ago I read a meme post on Instagram here it is  : source And here in 2023 he also likes the potential of bitcoin.",

But the point is that how many of them actually knows the integrals of Bitcoin besides buy low, wait for price to pump and sale, truth is that most people don't do further research besides knowing this basics. Example is most people who have been accumulating Bitcoin and had giving me lectures about it were still holding their Bitcoin in exchanges, I'm now the one that is now lecturing them about \"not your keys not your coins\", thanks to this forum. They didn't even know about none custodial wallets, and scam projects, yet they lectured without accurate knowledge.",

That's what they do without even trying to learn it properly.   Now, as the title implies, is Bitcoin Punk? Perhaps it all depends on how each individual interprets the situation in this forum. In terms of decentralization, Bitcoin's distributed ledger and absence of central control coincide with the punk concept of community-driven systems.",

As an entrepreneur, he gets involved in startups, he's interested in investments. But there's also a side of it that is specific to punk rock, namely that Bitcoin as a form of opposition to the traditional economic establishment, something smaller, more decentralized, and very different from typical assets or currencies. The similarity is also in energy, as Rami points out: the drive to create something important that would question the world order. This attitude seems fitting to me, although Bitcoin can, of course, be viewed from very different perspectives.",

The reason that they're changing how they see bitcoin is because they don't know much about it yet and at that time there's not a lot of information and data that can help them decide whether bitcoin's for the good or the bad of the people, sure some of them have selfish interests but they're definitely trying to be least considerate even just a liittle.",

Most investors invest in Bitcoin because of it is a decentralized digital currency. Dear, what kind of developments do you want that like it should be there in the Bitcoin ecosystem? well, you also know that the El Salvador government also has BTC for their country reservation and their people are using BTC for the business and I watched a video on Twitter where kinds were paying their bills using BTC it seems to be a good development like this country announced bitcoin as their legal currency.",
