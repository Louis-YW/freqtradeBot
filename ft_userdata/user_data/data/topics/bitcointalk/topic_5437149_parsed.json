Good luck.If are at the last hope of posting for a loan here, then you should at least provide all of the details. Saying that you can not provide anymore information does not help you. Unfortunately de to the size of the loan, even if you did add more details it is unlikely anyone will risk even a tenth of the amount on you. It does pain me to say this if you are truly in danger but that is the reality. I hope that you find a solution to your problem and that no collateral damage spills toward your family. It is a pity that you have put yourself in a situation where you have put them at risk to begin with. For this reason I do not think anyone could have sympathy for you, as it seems that this has been as a result of your own irresponsibility, recklessness and carelessness.

Again, it is unlikely that anyone will loan you due to the amount and because that you are brand new with no past successful business or meaningful contribution to the forum. Nonetheless it is mandatory for a lender to know these details.",
