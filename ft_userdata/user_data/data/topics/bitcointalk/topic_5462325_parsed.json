Add this in your OP https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/921977If I'm not wrong, removing that part is always a good idea to avoid tracking, but as recently said, it doesn't seem to be anything according to the rules of the forum in this particular case. Anyway, it's always better to prevent when in doubt.Back on topic, that copy-paste scam you talk about is not new and veterans here always double-check the pasted addresses before sending Bitcoin transactions. Newcomers should also take into account that just checking the first or last letters/numbers is not enough, because advanced tools can generate addresses with beginnings and endings similar to the original ones: it is better to check the digits in the middle of the address, when not every single one like it is advisable for large transactions.",

      "body": "This is a different type of clipboard malware that essentially works like any other versions. You copy an address and when you paste it, it gets replaced with one that belongs to the scammers. This should be easy to spot if you are careful and pay attention to where you send your coins. There is always a source where you copied the address from. If someone send you the address, compare the one you have pasted into your wallet to the one in the source. If you are sending to yourself, check and compare with your own wallet. If you are using a hardware wallet, the address will be displayed on the hardware wallet screen. Careful individuals shouldn't become victims of clipboard malware. The virus can't replace the address in the source, so always compare to that and stay vigilant.",

Especially all these fancy keyboards that offer some kind of special future that makes them appear to be better than others should also be avoided, including some games apps as well. In fact, anything that appears to be unnecessary on one's gadget shouldn't even be downloaded to that device for security reasons, especially on a device used to run financial transactions. I believe this is one of the reasons why LoyceV doesn't usually like anything that will lead to downloading an external app on its mobile device.",

Someone who is familiar with such cases (clipboard Virus) would already be aware of these trending malwares that can be used to steal one's assets without the victim's knowledge. Non the less, anyone who is copying a wallet should also be sure to cross-check the wallet before sending out funds to it because this malware is becoming a problem for crypto users and other internet users.

In cold wallet someone is sure that the system is secure and is free from any type of malware, and even if someone connects it back to internet in order to transfer the coins into another wallet this type of malware won't harm such users as their system has been offline and they haven't installed any software into it.Such type of hacks are often very hard for someone to notice because they change the address of the wallet and if someone is trying to send thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin then that user will face huge losses because of such malware. The only good option to be safe from such software is the cold wallet option and I recommend everyone to go for that if they are holding good amount in Bitcoin.Quote from: LoyceV on August 07, 2023, 05:54:48 PMQuote from: Nwada001 on August 07, 2023, 05:29:53 PMI believe this is one of the reasons why LoyceV doesn't usually like anything that will lead to downloading an external app on its mobile device.Not only on mobile  It's quite simple: there may or may not be malware in software, but if you don't install it, you're sure it's not on your system.I agree with you, the only safe option to be free from malware is to avoid installing the software or apps on a system where you store your online wallets. We must have to have some wallets that we use for transactions and for such wallets safety we should avoid installing any software or applications that could penetrate our system.",

I think it is less dangerous than other Trojans, as this CryptoShuffler trojan only affects the clipboard of the victim's computer, especially targeting crypto miners and people who download from torrent sites. This type of Trojan horse does not steal the victim's information or steal his files as a ransom, so what it only does is replace the pasted address while the victim copying and pastes his wallet address and press send; if the victim has enough focus and compares the address that was entered carefully, he will be able to differentiate between the hacker's address and his address and escape from this fraud. Suppose the victim's computer has a powerful antivirus running in the background, constantly scanning the device and the downloaded files. In that case, the antivirus program will be able to determine whether or not his computer has a Trojan horse called Trojan-Banker.Win32.CryptoShuffler.gen, block it and remove it, and the victim will be on the safe side, of course.",
