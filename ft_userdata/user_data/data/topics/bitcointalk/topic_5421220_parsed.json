      "body": "The approach taken in pmp and dmp is a scam so how do you claim to regulate it? You are not looking for a sign, for example, in the currency activity confirming that its price will increase or vice versa, but rather you are looking for a person who will use you either to deceive you with false promises or as part of an attack with the aim of withdrawing liquidity from the platform or creating fake liquidity.These activities should be stopped, not regulated.",

      "body": "What you forget is that signals are a bigger scam than the pump and dump itself. Nobody can predict the pumps beforehand to give you the signal to jump onboard and if they could they wouldn't tell others! Instead they need chumps to easily obey their orders to buy a certain shitcoin and create the pump themselves. In a way the \"signals\" are like the scam on top of another scam.The reason why you saw a signal and the price didn't go up was simply because the person giving the signal has already scammed a lot of people in the past that they know he is a scammer so they don't pay attention to his future \"signals\". Since nobody buys that shitcoin, the price doesn't go up.",

      "body": "You really think these signals groups are run by legitimate people? Think again. If it was easy to pump and dump a coin everyone would be doing that and making loads of money off the market. In reality these groups only give signals of coins they own so that on a pump signal, followers will start panic buying and they can make the money off them. It is a nice method to \"scam\" the followers, without leaving a trace and without being punished for.Of course regulations are a long way from here, we dont know if they will change the market manipulation or just add in how to tax crypto users.",

      "body": "After having a bad experience with the pump and exhaust group, I didn't want to rely on them anymore because it was a waste. They only use our money for their benefit while we bear the loss. They can indeed move people to buy and sell certain coins, but what drives the price is the people who are lured by the phrase \"pump and dump,\" so they try to keep up with the moment. After the price is at the peak of the price they want, the people who invite them to buy it will make the most profit and leave the people who bear the losses. So don't expect too much from the trading signal group; you better learn to analyze because it's for your own good.",

It should be just a guide on trading with basis from indicators through technical analysis but the current signal circulating on crypto is somehow mixed with ponzinomics because it doesn't have a actual signa coming from indicator but rather from the buy power of hype members that subscribed on that signal services. You are just fooling around and killing each other while paying whoever the guy behind the signal group to gave you shot call and at the same time feed there trade by your order.",

If you can think of that then write to social media channels that the pump and dump group are using to deceive people. Moreover this is more of greed for you to think riches come by just doing nothing. You have to strategize, do the appropriate thing and invest wisely. Bitcoin investment is better than relying on what adverts dished out in telegram group, they are not guarantee because all are speculation. If you buy bitcoin and hodl after halving you know price will increase.",

The amount of articles of people loosing lifetime savings thanks to listening to signals from there is overwhelming.We don't need regulations here. We need education. People should be able to write whatever they want. You should know not to make financial decision based on random person signal, especially if its pump and dump group made to scam members.",

Obviously there needs to be a complete stop on people giving such signals on twitter for free which is really harmful for a lot of folks who fall for such traps. But how can you regulate the people whom people pay to get such exclusive signals? After all it's their choice. It's you who has to become intelligent and understand there are no best trading signals provider. Only way to earn money in the market is to gain the knowledge of the market, learn trading and then start making some money.",

      "body": "The government funding aspect caught my attention, as funny as it is, you might though have a good point there. Signal providing is good, and monetary motivation might make people venture into unlocking the secret behind profitable trading. But frankly, this is a private sector business/hustle, the government will do nothing about it. Just imagine the government funding people to know how to do sports betting, this is not going to happen.Aside from that, there are still good speculators out there, and as a matter of fact, it is not easy to issue out signals based on the entry-level, direction, stop loss, and take profit. But it is easier to speculate the trend of the market in a whole day, which I did well in the thread below for free before I stopped due to lack of motivation. It was a dedicated program that was over 90% accurate altogether.Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410763.msg60799105#msg60799105You might as well learn how to trade yourself.",

These groups can disappear without a warning.Most of them are doing such activity to enrich themselves and screw gullible users. So regulating them is not an option. It now lies on the users how they will use these trading signal groups to their advantage. But in my opinion, better do your own trading rather than rely on these groups. I haven't seen any decent group that will truly help the traders.",
