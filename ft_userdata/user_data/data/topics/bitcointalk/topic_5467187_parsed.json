I think a game that needs a separate title will soon become a game whose capacity will increase when game methods such as PVE come. I was reading old comments and there were 2 thousand online players in 2021. Yes, I played at that time, it was really happening. Cliff, the founder of the game, has brought the game to a very good level now. Since the earning in the game is not in exchange for fiat money. Actually, of course, you can sell your NFTs and BC items, there are hundreds of great collectible items. it seems that the players have abandoned their interest for now. But things may change again during the bull season. I thought of opening this topic both as updates and as a guide.Lost Relics is a \"Play and Win\" (PaE) Action Role Playing Game similar to games like Diablo and PoE. The game is about exploring to level up and find blockchain (BC) items. BC items are very rare and are dropped randomly using the Random Number Generation (RNG) system. BC items can be dropped by monsters found in chests and a few other places. Depending on the adventure difficulty you choose, every player has an equal chance of finding BC items. Shadowstones (SS) are another aspect of winning in the game. SS is tied to the Enjin cryptocurrency and is also randomly dropped through the RNG system.Lost Relics Wiki Guide:- (Outdated) Newbies Guide: https://lostrelicsgame.fandom.com/wiki/Newbies_Guide- (Outdated) Weapon Damage Chart: https://lostrelicsgame.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Damage- (Outdated) Adventures: https://lostrelicsgame.fandom.com/wiki/Adventures- (Outdated) Monsterpedia: https://lostrelicsgame.fandom.com/wiki/Monsterpedia- (Outdated) Monster Counts: https://lostrelicsgame.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Counts- BC Weapons: https://lostrelicsgame.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons- BC Relics: https://lostrelicsgame.fandom.com/wiki/Effect_Items---------------------------------------------Lost Relics Community Video Guide- (Outdated) 5 Tips to Play Like a PRO! by @Goat_Master | TCH: https://youtu.be/vOjOGLocWDs- (Outdated) Guide For Newbies by @DragonGirlRider: https://youtu.be/9MnAuykmHAA- Where and How to Buy Weapons by @DragonGirlRider: https://youtu.be/ta9C_6i8jy4Â Arrow Crafting Guide by @thehiddenhiro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8Ku5AfHSVYGame mechanics coming soon;4 player PVE (co-op) Arenainverdhenpet progressionq Mechanics to be added later:HousingBosses4 player PVE Adventures4 player PVP ArenaLast update https://medium.com/lost-relics/echoes-of-ascension-6eeae043b99cEchoes of Ascension",
