  "content": "Great article where human rights advocates fire back after “prominent” group of technologists write letter to US congress bashing cryptocurrency/blockchain ( https://concerned.tech/ ). What do you guys think about the letter written to US congress bashing cryptocurrency, as well as the human rights advocates support of bitcoin? “ A week after prominent technologists publicly slammed crypto for being too risky and unproven in a letter to Congress, human rights advocates from around the world have sent a rebuttal to U.S. lawmakers defending digital assets for the access they provide to people in countries where “local currencies are collapsing, broken, or cut off from the outside world.”Some 21 human rights supporters from 20 different countries said in the letter that they’ve relied on bitcoin and stablecoins, which allow the trading in and out of crypto without going through a bank, “as have tens of millions of others living under authoritarian regimes or unstable economies.Bitcoin provides financial inclusion and empowerment because it is open and permissionless,” the latest letter said. “We are not industry financiers or professional lobbyists but humanitarians and democracy advocates who have used bitcoin to assist people at risk when other options have failed.”https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/human-rights-advocates-say-bitcoin-critical-in-authoritarian-countries.html",

It is a good thing the more people and organization are fighting for bitcoin and the whole cryptocurrency. With the effects of inability of other countries such as Nigeria, Turkey and Argentina to their local currencies, Cryptocurrencies was able to provide assistance for them as well as with the current war happening with Ukraine and Russia. Whereas, Ukraine was able to receive was financial assistance through cryptocurrency. However, the crypto critics also has their own reason such as the significant volatility on various crypto and NFTs. Also, with various hacking issues that have rose in the past few years which doubt them with the technology of crypto.Anyways, I fully support crypto and I hope that the Congress won't make irrational decision of restricting access on cryptocurrencies as it will make a huge impact with its citizens.",

So basically USA has to be a crypto-friendly country, because millions of people around the world live in countries where:Quote“local currencies are collapsing, broken, or cut off from the outside world.”And also:Quote tens of millions of others living under authoritarian regimes or unstable economies.This doesn't make any sense. USA isn't some global empire(despite being the actual global empire). The US legislation is NOT global legislation.The cryptocurrency regulations in the USA have nothing to do with the millions of poor, oppressed people, who are living under totalitarian regimes. The countries with authoritarian regimes have their own laws and regulations.The people, who are living in countries with weak national currencies and political oppression can still use cryptocurrencies illegally.",

Far stretched they can only impose few regulations now and then where it could be tax related, or perma ban. However, crypto still works under tunnel through p2p network. So loop holes will always be there. It’s better they should act humanly and let us use it as and when required. On bigger timeline there is not much impact on the centralised system so not sure why are they scared of?",

It would also help if they gave specific facts and examples (for example, in context of Ukraine they could mention that both the government and non-governmental foundations raise money to help end the war in cryptos, and that they've raised at least tens of millions this way).",

It's hugh time to declare their stand on it.Unfortunately banks do not fund governments, it is the other way around, governments fund banks. We have seen plenty of times when banks are not doing that well, and the government ends up helping them out and save them because they are getting bribed heavily by those banks. Hell even in 2008 crisis caused by banks, they gave out 800+ billion dollars worth of \"loan\" to them, and did they profited from it?Sure they did, but if I ever bankrupt like that, I can bet you that government wouldn't just save me and give me a huge loan, and neither would any bank? Because if something is bankrupted, it's bankrupted, no need to save it for free, you either buy it out completely, or just let it die.",

For example AFAIK bitcoin is not illegal in Afghanistan, in fact many of them are using bitcoin freely and it is not solving the real problems they are facing such as terrorism which is sadly sometimes funded by the same \"human rights\" foundations!Which is why I'm hesitant about being happy about these people suddenly advocating bitcoin in this context.",

I don't think so, and I am not sure why in the name of criminal activities, environmental hampering, they are always behind bitcoin's ban plot.Good to see how these activists are bashing it.
