Core does not yet support the ability to send Segwit transactions. Hopefully, things will improve after the next major release.",

I think we should just learn to be patient whenever there is a congestion, our transactions will still push through, it will just take a long time for confirmations.",

So if we are true to bitcoins sovereignty we will not trade our bitcoin and so the market will not be clogged? Alternatively you could say that if we are true supporters of bitcoin we will use it often for its true purpose which is to transfer funds, thus contributing to the network slowdown.",

I mean, to an extent, there is a fair amount of onus on the user to actually understand what is going on, but it's not like there's a lot that can be used to convince people to not send transactions and wait for the network to decongest a bit. I'm somewhat surprised that the network inflated another 50k transactions but in another way I'm not, there's a lot of people that are trying to move their Bitcoin for one reason or another and that number won't be slowing down as the community grows in size.It's good to see the total unconfirmed count slowly dropping, but it's going to be a lot of blocks before that number is manageable. Maybe 2MB blocks wouldn't be bad for the network.",

Own the private keys and make back ups. Lots of users fault at this. Like I said user responsibility goes further than just holding bitcoin and the private keys.As much as the people on this panel want to say it doesn't deal with mining or running nodes it does. The reg person relied on companies and wallet providers to uphold the dignity of this community, then Roger Ver bcash and bigger block talks start swirling around, then the plug is pulled, leaving the users to pay 20 USD to move money.Now he looks like a genius even in actuality he just pulled the SUPPORT away, leaving a hole for the ref users to fill so just saying holding your private keys isn't enough, bc you have ppl in undeveloped parts of the world dying to get and use bitcoin. This is a open source community so instead if relying on companies and others to fix the issue, I feel it's on the user's to educate themselves in the proper field to get this ship moving again bc right 2018 isn't looking that good for the average person and bitcoin.",

I think it has a great bit if dealing with the fact that most of these companies aren't on board with #segwit",

It’s a very good question what will be the responsibilities of bitcoin users for bitcoin I think first of all we need to teach bitcoin to it's newbie and also we need to support them and secondly I think the most important thing is that we need to do advertisement of bitcoin through different resources if we start advertisement of bitcoin through social media or on TV or in newspapers  so think it's mean we are doing our responsibilities for bitcoin because without all these bitcoin is trying to change our life so now it’s a time to do something for bitcoin.",
