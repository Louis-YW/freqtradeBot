Although if you experience a losing streak and leaves you having no balance or fund at all, you will be back at zero having to deposit an amount that could last you probably around several bets and plays that will satisfy you without breaking the bank. But to be fair, that's the point. You win some, you enjoy some, and then you save some for the future or use it for something that is important and could add value to your life.",

But it's going to be very difficult, even if winning or losing, it's hard to quit and not continue to play to chase your losses or look for more win. The approach of the OP is good, no question about it, however, it is really applicable to the majority of the gamblers here?What if you are in a losing streak? Will you just take a break and stop? or will continue to deposit for more and recoup (this is the mindset of the gambler). Unless you really have total control of your minds and emotions, which again very very hard to do. I just for the majority, if the money that you play is nothing, then just go and enjoy the game without making things complicated on you, specially your mentality.",

This is a practical case of strategy that works! The aspect of taking a break after a major win is the secret to sustaining the money because many people give it all back by increasing their staking power and number of bets; it is truly a major mistake. I also apply your principle with the only difference being that I don't go on a break but I reduce my staking amount significantly whenever I have major win after withdrawing 90% of the money won.",

Do you think this is a good idea? Do you have a better idea?Lets have it!This would have been a very good idea if only it worked all the time and for everyone..before I proceed, one question I will love to ask is, after withdrawing the supposed 80 plus 5 percent of your winnings to your account for personal spending, which leaves you with just 15 percent of the fund on your casino account to continue gambling with, what do you do if luck is not on your side and you end up losing the remaining 15 percent of the fund, do you make another deposit to continue gambling or do you just forget about gambling altogether?Like i said before, what you shared would have been a good idea if only it would work for everyone all the time, and I also wish I had a better idea of what really works, But one certain in gambling is that, what ever strategy we implore to help either win or save what we have won, we still need luck, for without luck, it is difficult to come out of gambling profitable at the end the day.",

Also, it isn't always easy to just cash out when winning as most of us tends to continue betting even when winning significant amount until you notice you're losing and stop playing to cash out the remainder of your winnings. Lastly, losing streaks are much more common to happen than winning which is the sad truth on gambling.",

True!  I experience not hitting a single bonus round in slots in many of my sessions.  So automatically, the idea of @OP can't be applied in this situation.  Although @OP gives a good way to manage winnings, it does not assure us that it can be sustainable, because if one gamble's regularly, he will have to top up the funds (obviously from his previous winnings) in order to continue playing the next day.  Imagine if we suffer consecutive losing sessions, then more probably that we have to put more funds to continue after exhausting our previous winnings.",

Do you think this is a good idea? Do you have a better idea?Lets have it!Easy to say but really that hard to be done when you are already there or simply on the time or moment that you are really that making some money with your gambling session on which it would really be creating out that kind of impulsive emotion or approach on which you would really be thinking that playing even more would really might be giving that more chance for you to make money or winnings and this what urges you to play even more and then losing those winning amounts back at the casino.Its good that you do really have that kind of self control since not all would really be having that kind of tolerance when it comes to things because if you do really find yourself that not setting out some goals then most likely you would really be just playing until you do bust all of your bankroll which this is always the case.Its true that moderation is really that something needed when dealing up with gambling because if you do find yourself to be that impulsive then it would really be that impossible for someone to follow up this kind of routing specially pulling 80% of winnings and intended for the next day gambling session and remain some 15% and then 5% your own spending or reward.I could say its a good allocation but not all people would really be able to do or follow this one.
