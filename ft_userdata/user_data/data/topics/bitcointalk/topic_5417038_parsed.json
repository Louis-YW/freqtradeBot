Its near to the same price.The main difference is inflation.Which to a degree makes commodities inflation protected assets if you can find a way to HODL them.If it were possible to HODL 10,000 cups of coffee for 5 years. Its value would trend with inflation. Protecting your wealth from devaluation.Wheat could be a better option than coffee (or coffee beans) as I think it can be stored for 20+ years if prepared correctly.Commodities were the go to option many turned to when inflation 1st became a concern, for these reasons.",

No matter how much market conditions change. The price of a cup of coffee. A bushel of wheat. Kilograms of gold, steel or aluminum. These things tend to remain the same.Although i do agree with this, but Investors should use caution while dealing in commodities because of its high volatility before making an investment. Due to the dependence of commodities on supply and demand factors, even a small shift in supply brought on by geopolitical tensions or conflicts can have a negative impact on commodity prices.I believe that one of the best asset which is being protected from recession is a Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)Companies that hold and manage properties with an income stream are known as real estate investment trusts (REITs). When inflation rises, property values and rental revenue typically increase as well. A group of properties make up a REIT, which distributes dividends to its investors. Consider the Vanguard Real Estate ETF if you want broad exposure to real estate together with a low expense ratio.But just like every other investment, REITs have significant disadvantages, such as their vulnerability to the market for other high-yield assets. Treasury assets often gain appeal as interest rates climb. The share prices of REITs may decline as a result of this withdrawal of capital.There are other assets that is also being protected from inflation. For example A 60/40 Stock/Bond Portfolio and The Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index",

However, I just want to say that I will not be too aggressive in investing when the economic conditions are bad other than requiring cash funds to survive. As I said in yesterday's post and have a significant relationship. The thread is here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5411363.msg61117829#msg61117829It may be a little confusing, but in the recession that comes to our mind, we are trying our best to survive the bad economic conditions. People like me who don't have much in reserve to survive, of course see the recession from a pretty dire angle. Because we only depend on daily sources of livelihood. And when the recession hit, it was feared that centrally-based banks and investment service providers could potentially close, so our assets were stuck there. Therefore I need the cash even though its value is reduced.",

Probably not. China has cheap manufacturing at the expensive of slave labor wages. The developed world seemingly accepts this, lapses ethical consideration, for cheap goods.Plus, the higher energy costs don't just affect China (that is to say, if they decide not to purchase cheap Russian oil which isn't an assumption that can be made), it's affecting local manufactures. I've seen too many businesses in Europe post their energy bills and accepting their economic fate. It's becoming impossible to operate with current energy prices.",

I understand Ukrainian wheat if all is well, they could produce it cheaper than your nation normally, but when things go wrong, your own local wheat farmers should be able to cover it, maybe with just a little difference but not something huge. If they can't, that means you do not have enough wheat farmers and that’s a big problem.All these items that go up so much during the inflation period showed that they were not made properly in a protected situation, they all depended on something and that’s a big problem that needs to be solved eventually, and this inflation period should be a lesson.",
