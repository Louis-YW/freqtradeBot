Also quite important to research existing ad networks that are alive on the mark right now. Seems Pmalek give you some list and you have to verify then and choose accordingly. Feel free to share your idea about your project. So we might suggest something from our past experience.",

Or probably publish articles on to other's website to advertise his project.  Pmalek has given you a link of list of crypto sites, He can contact the owners of the websites by going into their contact details.  Some users in the forum are very discreet to which website they own. If he accepts medium.com blogs, there are lots of them here. Check the bounty spreadsheets.",

This will actually work if op will be working to those website blog that is in the growing stage. Coz I doubt he will get any good feedback working on those website say in this list[1] which is suggested above unless he will pay their thousands of dollar rate for article publishing or ads.[1] https://blog.feedspot.com/cryptocurrency_blogs/",

That's what I think as well so I gave him lists with loads of crypto news sites. Each respectable site has a contact form, email, or social media account where you can contact the owners, marketing team, or the writers directly and propose whatever you want. He also mentioned in the end of his OP that \"we could also help each other grow\". To me, that sounds like mutual promotion of each other's sites, maybe banners, backlinks, etc.",

I really don't like spamming content if it's not relevant.Alternatively, if you really feel you're a good writer and have unique perspectives, I'd go for Hackernoon, and if you get 10 or more published or have a good rate of 90% approval, then you network from within. Doesn't give you crypto really like steemit did but exposure.",
