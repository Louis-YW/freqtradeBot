Since you said, you have contacted them, and they are yet to reply, I will ask: How long have you dropped their Support a Message? If it's not that long or up to 48 hours, which most Supports takes up to, before they reply to a Message, due to the gravity of the Complaints they receive on a daily basis, I will advice you to stay patient with them and see the result or what their reply will look like. I don't know their rules in terms of voiding a game, but I'm pretty sure game voids all the time, ok, casino, but with a valid reason to why it was done. So I will advice you to exercise a little patience and see their reason why. You will update the thread with and other, who are experienced, will also look into the matter. Sorry for that bad experience. I know, how it feels when you have already seen and are sure of the game result and going in the casino with the intention of seeing a green welcome page congratulating you of your winning, instead you saw a voided game, it's really painful. Use the Scam report format to make your report more decent.

I think your decision was rather too hasty, this could just be a minor technical malfunction which happens all the time and could easily be rectified by just bringing it to their notice. I've observed similar cases in the past which were resolved amicably. So for now, you've raised a false alarm because you're not yet sure if you were scammed.",

When he said he won, I think he meant to say he's sure he won because he knew he placed a bet for Al Fayha, but not exactly know whether the bet was already canceled or not.",

      "body": "Hello everyone, First of all, Rollbit Support still didn’t gave me an explanation why bet was cancelled. As all of you can see. I placed bet 5 days before match, was watching game live, logged in 20 minutes after match finished and saw bet is cancelled. To be honest with you all, I am not that surprised because of that void, I saw before on this forum users got void won bets after match result is known on Rollbit (as well at other casinos that use same sportsbook provider - bc, betfury, owl and others). I am not sure, who decided to void winning bet, is it sportsbook provider or Rollbit. But I placed bet at Rollbit site, and I see them as responsible. As it should be in every other honest sportsbook site. So, for all you who wondering why did I opened scam accusation right after I saw it got voided, it is because I saw other users had same situations on Rollbit site, and above mentioned sites who use same provider. However, I will still wait an explanation from Rollbit team. This is not so big money, but my intention was to other potential bettors can see what can happen if you win a bet on their site. Nevertheless, it doesn’t mater if you bet on big market or small - they simply can void every winning bet. Very sustainable business, so on this way everyone can have their own betting site. Void winning bets, leave losing bets as they are = you rich.If Rollbit corrects this stupidity, and marks the bet as winning as it should be, I am ready to donate the entire winnings for humanitarian purposes to the site proposed here and post a screenshot and invoice.",

If that is the very first time you noticed that the bet was voided, it means you have literally no idea when Rollbit made it void. It could have happened at any time in the interim period from when you placed the bet onwards.Can you recall the specific last date/time you logged in after you placed the bet and saw that it was not voided and as far as you were concerned it was an active bet?",

It turns out that OP was right, it was value indeed as line before match went to -2.00.So, it’s even not that important when they did voided it, because OP cleary had a value, although I am sure it is after match because I had same situation with them in past, and their excuse was “provider’s decision, we can do nothing about that” if I remember well. Shameful practice of any bookmaker to do so. At such bookmakers you first need to be lucky to win bet, then you need to be lucky to they settle your bet as won.",
