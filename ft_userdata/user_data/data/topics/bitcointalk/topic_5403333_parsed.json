  "content": "I was reading the book blockchain wars and ran across this sentence. “ Bitcoin is decentralized enough to never be broken or sued but does not have the perfect decentralization that would degrade system design qualities.” I read it three times and don’t understand the second part of the sentence. Can someone explain it in a different way? I think that there is God, and then Bitcoin. But this passage might make me wrong. Lol",

These changes are called BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals), and there are 3 types of BIPs:Standards Track BIPs - Changes to the network protocol, block or transaction validation, or anything affecting interoperability.Informational BIPs - Design issues, general guidelines. This type of BIP is NOT for proposing new features and do not represent community consensusProcess BIPs - Describes or proposes a change in the process. Similar to Standards BIPs but apply outside the Bitcoin protocol.And this is why its decentralization can't degrade or destroy the design qualities as the book mention.If you want to learn more about this, I leave the wiki link here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals",

The Bitcoin Core developers are no close to dictators, which is what you make it sound like. If someone has an idea, they're free and welcomed to propose it. If there's consensus found on the idea, the developers will start implementing it.And a developer has no power over me. If they want to enforce their idea by implementing it themselves without further discussion, I'll simply deny to run their software. Simple as that.Quote from: franky1 on June 20, 2022, 11:09:24 AMand to try to force the outsider into making an alt rather than integrate the scaling into bitcoinYou're the only person who sees \"outsiders\" and \"alts\". I only see people who've understood there's no further future for scaling on-chain, and try to accomplish it off-chain. One advantage of SegWit was to increase transaction capacity per block, but it was never intended to completely solve scaling. If you have an idea on how to solve scaling, feel free to say it. But, to catch up with you, changing the block size makes no difference to scaling.",

You called blabber, our magnificent consensus; fork off!i can find more examples. but you get the pointscrew it i know your going to be belligerent and dare me.. so heres just another of many posts that reveal how you dont want anyone apart from core devs making the decisions, and prefer everyone else to make a new altcoin/altnetQuote from: BlackHatCoiner on March 13, 2021, 02:59:30 PMIt seems that it's just my opinion, but I don't believe that users should have the freedom to choose what is defined as Bitcoin. They have the freedom to experiment with it, to use it, to create new things on top of it, but not to change it. Satoshi chose these consensus rules and every person who refuses to accept them is free to follow a different chain.YOU are a altnet admirer and majority user.i use the bitcoin network and want the bitcoin network to grow.. but you think you are the bitcoiner and i am the competing altnet admirer..try to learn the roles are the opposite to what you think.. YOU are the small \"community\" that want to aspire to grow altnets, by stifling bitcoin design and functionality to promote your altnet..i can name your \"community majority\" off by heart i know you cant name the ACTUAL bitcoin community majority of thousands/millions of users that want bitcoin network scaling off by heart (i know your tempted to waste hours trawling through thousands of topics to copy and paste name just to pretend you have good memory, pretending you didnt trawl them all and instead just remembered them).. but by posting so many names you are proving my point..  the point is the real community is wider than your fan club",

We as a network can react to things when necessary, this is not a dictatorship.and if there was a bit of bad nefarious code in say version 24. where majority updated and activated some timebomb bug.. .. where are they going to get a version 25 from?who would you trust to code version 25? where is the alternative dev group to diversify and decentralise the options of what node software to run to protect the network (and no im not talking about lite wallets)anyways lets give the history lesson of the politics at playthe 2016-17 segwit saga...they proposed a thing that would offer fee discounts...people thought great legacy addresses finally getting fee's below a couple pennies.... nope. instead the game was to not give discounts. but to math cludge the code whereby new formats people had to move funds into paid normal rates and legacy was to be treated as 4x more expensivehttps://api.blockchain.info/charts/preview/fees-usd-per-transaction.png?timespan=all&h=600&w=1200check out the flat line and then in the middle the 2017 event. see how the transaction prices then are not flat line cheap... ask yourself whyalso they said they solved malleability. again legacy formats were not solved. again new format people had to move funds into would benefit. but its was not solving malleability it was getting people to have to migrate to malleability free formats.(theres a difference)these new formats did not offer any transaction count increases to blocks. https://api.blockchain.info/charts/preview/n-transactions-per-block.png?timespan=all&h=405&w=720if you look the transaction count has been stagnant below the 2500 for the last 5 yearsyet they did want to allow more blockspace to use for cludgy scripts(witness/signatures) of the new format.. which proves that more blockspace is indeed safe for the network... BUT they wanted to still lock up and hinder and **not allow legacy transactions to use the extra space. and forced legacy to stay within the 1mb block size.**.. so it released their agenda code in november 2016.. and the devs got all excited thinking by chiristmas 2016 it would activate because they thought everyone loved it.. ..... um... may 2017 came around not even 50% were liking it.. it wasnt really looking like it was going to activate.so the politics moved in to change the code and add in some code(MANDATED ACTIVATION) that would force it to activate by ignoring any miner that was not flagging acceptance of it https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...shaolinfry:bip-segwit-flagday#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R1829. this mandated date forced it in.. and so by summer 2017. it activated..and yet 5 years later. not everyone is using segwit. 5 years later the transaction count has not seen any big increase even though they pretend to offer (but cludge up the offer) of upto 4x more blockspace. (hindered by limiting legacy utility to not be able to use that space.)and so.. that shows the dictator politics over ruled the actual community that wanted actual changes but didnt get what was truly promised.which is why after 5 years there are still hundreds/thousands of topic comments from different people asking about scaling bitcoin.",

      "body": "Quote from: franky1 on June 20, 2022, 08:50:45 PMthere are thousands of topics from thousands of people wanting bitcoin scaling.And yet, there's no better proposal than Lightning, as much as you hate it. People might want scaling, but that's the best we have, whether they like it or not. If they want bigger blocks (which doesn't mean they want scaling) they can have them. The fact most don't is because they don't form the majority. The Bitcoin Cash team attempted to make this change and failed miserably.Quote from: franky1 on June 20, 2022, 08:50:45 PMyour \"community\" consists of core devs and their loyal fan clubNo, it doesn't. It's consisted of people who run the code. Period. If the Core developers make a change we disapprove of, there's nothing changed.Quote from: franky1 on June 20, 2022, 08:50:45 PMnow go do a topic count on how many people ask and talk about BITCOIN scaling and how many are involved in your altnet solutionYou avoid the big picture. Topics do not take part in bitcoin. Topics don't tell me what I'm allowed to propagate and what not. Running a bitcoin full node does. And if I don't agree with propagating 10 MB blocks, it doesn't matter what the topics say, nor what you're years whining about; I'll simply reject them. Oh, and my \"altnet\" solution, which is neither mine nor of an alternative network, makes things scale. Raising the block size doesn't. The transaction capacity per megabyte remains the same.Quote from: franky1 on June 20, 2022, 08:50:45 PMi can find more examples. but you get the pointI'll skip the fact that you quoted me in a humorous post, no surprise you have zero sense of that either. I have never said that if you have a different, innovative idea, you should fork off. But, raising the block size, which was my reference there, has only proved to make things work weaker, and does contributes nothing to scaling. If you, though, still want to raise the block size, even if you're part of a small minority, you have the power to do it. But, you're forked off. That's the beauty of decentralized systems I was saying.",

What you forget is that the dev group isn’t homogeneous, they have differing views and so on, they’re not sitting in a back room together somewhere. And in the case you mentioned, where some nefarious code would be injected, they would split into different groups and then you have the alternative dev group, it forms naturally.The probability that this change would go unnoticed is extremely low and that no devs would step up to open a different repository, even lower. There will always be an amount of honest devs that can be relied upon, that’s the beauty of decentralization, because there can be bad actors, but we can just go around them, they will never get control over the majority.There’s also a big amount of coders, that didn’t work on core yet, so even if someone controls all core devs(which will never happen). There will never be a shortage of honest actors, even in the worst case. The majority will just go to them, because it wouldn’t make sense for them to keep running a broken version. It will never make sense for the majority to run a version that works against them. There’s just no scenario where people couldn’t react to this. That’s what makes decentralization different from centralization.Quoteanyways lets give the history lesson of the politics at playI’ll research about this, i wasn’t around at that time, so im not qualified to speak on it.",
