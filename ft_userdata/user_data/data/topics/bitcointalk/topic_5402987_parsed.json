Perhaps the easiest would be to use this view:https://public.tableau.com/views/BitcointalkMeritDashboard/ReceivedMeritSubsectionIII?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_linkOn the above tab, you can change the time scale granularity to show the data from year through to day grouping (use the Date Level Selector). You can include or exclude boards/local boards (subsection selector) for comparison purposes.Bear in mind that the data is updated only one per week, generally on Fridays.",

OP is the one who can answer that but in my own opinion maybe you are right but I think he/she wants to learn a lot about merit statistics of her/his local boards so that he/she can post and update I think or there's other reason why he/she do that. OP you can try to visit what our forum mates provide above that links so helpful to you on or main purpose. But always remember do not break any rules to avoid serious mistake.",

If I say from my side \"I don't really understand why these types of questions arise in your mind\". DdmrDdmr and few others who are scrapping the public data can help you in this. In fact DdmrDdmr already gave you the link to pull data for you. You can start from there. I just checked your post history and I am guessing you are looking for the data to use it on the only thread you have in your language. I could be wrong though?",

For each merit you earn, you will get 0.50 smerit. So, for each 2 merit earned, you will get 1 smerit which you can share with other.If you don't have smerit to share but you think a post deserves merit, make sure you report the post to LoyceV thread- [self-moderated] Report unmerited good posts to Merit Source",

Here, things are a bit different, you have to have smerit to be able to give it out.HOW DO YOU EARN SMERIT?First, it starts by making good and quality posts, good posts come in different forms, it can come as a question, it can come as an answer to a question, it can be a suggestion, advice, market analysis, news, warning, it can be just about anything but must make sense and users must find it merit worthy to be able to merit the post.For a comprehensive breakdown of how to make quality merit worthy posts, i recommend you visit https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5098333.0, Read the entire post, it might teach you alot of things you dont already know.Goodluck.",
