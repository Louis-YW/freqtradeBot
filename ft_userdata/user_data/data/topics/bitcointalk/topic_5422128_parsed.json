      "body": "\"bitcoin core maintainers\" the main guys that have commit/merge privilege MaintainersProject maintainers have commit access and are responsible for merging patches from contributors. They also act as a final check to ensure that patches are safe and in line with the project goals. ContributersEveryone is free to propose code changes and to test, review and comment on open Pull Requests. Anyone who contributes code, review, test, translation or documentation to the Bitcoin Core project is considered a contributor. The release notes for each Bitcoin Core software release contain a credits section to recognize all those who have contributed to the project over the previous release cycle...contributers can propose stuff(suggest code edits or spell checking comments). but that does not mean their stuff gets added to the core roadmap plan of what features or functions will get added. its the maintainers that do, though some maintainers do listen and some dont listen to contributers thoughts or proposed code.. the project is controlled by the maintainers and what the maintainers decide is the roadmap for bitcoins future direction",

What is necessary to add new people in the master-pushers and what is needed to remove someone?This should answer it:Quote from: achow101 on February 01, 2017, 10:19:06 PMAnother interesting fact is that the giving out of commit access has become more strict. It is now a privilege held by those given maintainer positions and those whose privilege was grandfathered in (i.e. they had it previously and kept it, until otherwise revoked). Previously it was simply given out to those who contributed frequently and revoked after they stopped contributing. This appears to be no longer the case, although there are still multiple people who can commit to the repository so that there is not any reliance on one person. The maintainers are still given to frequent contributors as the maintainers are frequent contributors to the set of functionality for which they are maintainers of. They received the positions because of frequent contributions to those functionalities. Of those whose commit access was grandfathered, only Pieter Wuille remains - the rest were revoked eventually primarily for the lack of contributions (see each individual for their specific reason).",

(like it was a done deal)maintainers are now mostly paid by 3 business brands chaincodelabs, brinks and blockstreamits worth knowing most funding of all 3 companies come from the same DCG groupthe same corporation portfolio and dev pool(famous faces) sponsored to bring you the segwit/taproot features that altnets like liquid and LN want and need(you know the ones. the ones that promise more onchain transaction counts but 5 years later no tx count rise)(you kn ow the ones that want people to offramp utility to altnets)in short it was a hierarchical top level maintainer vote to get her in..not a low level contributor vote by masses of independent contributorsits worth mentioning that Wlad (lead maintainer in recent years) and even achowe admit that bitcoin dev team of maintainers privilege is becoming more centralised and hierarchical",
