  "content": "Rollbit = SCAM Casino - not honoring their Terms & Conditions.Hi, fellow Bitcointalk members. I am writing because of a serious incident with Rollbit.com casino.It is merely about their immoral and dishonest business practices - namely the way they treated me, by seizing my whole deposit of $10,000 USD.Hopefully, I can get some attention from them here and we can solve it. Because, on their website, they just ignored it and were unable to give me any explanations.Please give me my funds back, and let's call it a day.What happened?Rollbit launched its sportsbook a while ago. I'm sure I'm not the only punter who raised some eyebrows seeing this, because as most know they allow multi-accounting & IP masking.I waited for the release and checked their ToC carefully - to be sure it was just not a mistake on their side regarding multi-accounting and IP masking. So I waited for quite some time before starting, but they never updated their terms. I even asked the support and the chat and they all said it is fine to multi-account and that the usage of VPNs/Proxies is not against their rules. Obviously, I saw an opportunity there to gamble with bigger amounts even if I do get limited. In case I did get limited, I just created a new account.3 Days ago, I created another account and deposited 10.000$ in bitcoin (which for me is a big amount). When I wanted to place a bet, I noticed that my account had been already limited. I couldn't wager a single dollar on anything. Obviously, I went to withdraw it all. However, due to the AML laws, you have to wager your deposits at least once, so they declined my withdrawal (which is fine and honest of course). After waiting for a day or two, I asked them what was going on and why the AML investigation was taking so long. They just ignored me. I even offered that I can just wager the whole amount through in slots just so I can get at least some of my money back (which they, of course, ignored).The whole process took them until today. I kept asking for more information and further updates, but my messages were never read. After that, I decided to make my case public in their live chat. The admin \"Razer\" started replying to me in public chat saying that he was familiar with my case and will speed things up. 1 hour later he messaged me over the support with the following sarcastic message:As you can see - he was just mocking me, Rollbit admitting to scamming me, and just taking my own deposited money from me without any reason. The thing is - I was just betting on NBA and some soccer here & there. It was a fair way to punt and I could have hit the wrong end of the variance as well and lost it all. But for them, it's 'abusing' their system. I am deeply disappointed.Again, I'm not denying multi-accounting at all. But as I said before, nothing in their ToC is stating that it's not allowed to create new accounts or \"abuse\" their sportsbook (which I haven't).\"abuse our bonus, coupon, and chat features\" have nothing to do with me gambling on multiple accounts.I wanna underline once again that the money they are scamming here, is 100% my own money. Not a cent is from any winning on this account. Just my own deposit.EDIT: added proof from live chat for the ones who are too lazy to scan the whole thread:QuoteScammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3067300Amount Scammed: 0.48534854 BTC Payment Method: BTC Proof of Payment: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/3754cce9b49beeddceb726e5ea77083102a94984725de40d429d9f02c3889461I really hope that I can get it solved, please Staff of Rollbit - do something about it!",

I am looking at their FAQ and the part you mentioned about alt-accounts. Yes, they do allow it, but you are forgetting the most important part of that rule. You can use alt accounts as long as you have not created another account for nefarious purposes.  https://rollbit.com/faqIf your first account got limited, and you aren't allowed to place bets above a certain threshold, creating multiple accounts to avoid this restriction can be seen as a \"nefarious purpose\".If your betting limit is $1.000/day or per match, that doesn't give you the right to create 4 more accounts, so that you can wager a total of $5.000, for example. It might sound harsh, but that's the way they are going to look at it. You are abusing the limits placed on you as an individual.And when you did that, Rollbit did this:QuoteTERMINATIONWe may terminate or suspend Your Account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately. If You wish to terminate Your Account, You may simply discontinue using the Service.https://rollbit.com/terms-and-conditionsUsing multiple accounts to undo set betting limitations can be a reason for termination because of \"Any reason whatsoever\".

That can mean any actions such as depositing, wagering, withdrawing, etc.I wish you could get your money back, but I am skeptical about it.
