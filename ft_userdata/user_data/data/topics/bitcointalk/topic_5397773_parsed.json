My personal opinion, you need to be clear that you have not managed a campaign.Before this Ann thread was created I study how others create their own without any issues and with no misleading. Yes, the promoted campaign are projects I once and currently work for under another manager which is the reason why it was tagged \"Promoted Campaigns\" not \"Manage Campaigns\"",

In your place I would correct that, that is, delete the \"promoted campaign\" because it is not in any relation to the management.",

A lot of CM used promoted campaign. I never got what's the relation between promoted campaign and CM.",
