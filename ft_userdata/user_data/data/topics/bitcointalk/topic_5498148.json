Let's try to calculate and check if this is true.My friend has a property (apartment) in one of the most expensive cities in the world* (Moscow) with an area of ​​~65 sq.m (three-room). The market value of this property is approximately ~$170,000. Such an apartment can be rented out for approximately $500-700 per month. This will bring a profit of $6000-8500 per year.

This does not take into account inflation, changes in the value of real estate (the “body” of the deposit) and the cost of rent (“interest” on the deposit).Of course, profitability may differ when choosing residential or commercial real estate. Commercial rent will be more profitable, but with such rent many problems arise, such as finding a long-term tenant, because with every downtime in finding a new (short-term) tenant, money is lost. The next “headache” is the repair costs (which will certainly arise) and again drain money from you.

One thing that you didn't mention is that real estate is for the rich people, a poor man or an average man will not be able to save over a long period of time to build an estate. His money will depreciates overtime.Bitcoin can be bought with a little amount and bitcoin has given an opportunity to the poor to also take part in investing. A poor man can DCA withis disposable income at end end of every month, and do this for 4-10 consecutive years and before you will know it, your bitcoin portfolio will have a significant size and only that will bring a good profit to that investor due to the compounding effect of his bitcoin portfolio. This is what makes bitcoin more superior in profit generation, its compounding value overtime.",

That's not really the point anyway, let them see what bitcoin does outside and see us enjoy all of the profits that we've made because there's no way that you'd want to miss out despite all of the evidence pointing out that you can make huge money with bitcoin. You're correct with your concerns but if you're in the bitcoin market for the long-term, are you really going to care so much about price fluctuations and dips because I don't think you'll have to care for it given that it's going to be a temporary thing and you're in bitcoin investment for the long-term. A bit of vigilance when it comes to digital scams is the key, just keep on learning and you'd be fine.",

Well-located homes can appreciate at 10% per annum.Bitcoin, however, has quite a few advantages over real estate, and Michael Saylor is one who would tell you it is much better. What happens is that the explanation you give, although long, is not entirely accurate. For me it is not contradictory. Investing in bitcoin and housing should be complementary. At the very least I recommend investing in, buying, the house you live in, unless you move a lot for work, moving every 5 years or less.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 29, 2024, 12:50:27 PMThe reason why people think real estate is the best investment are because of two reasons:1.

This would actually be a bias to say that investing in bitcoin is more comfortable and secure than real estate. We should be fair and need to accept the fact that there is no asset that is both safe and can bring high profits and vice versa, low profits, low risks.I believe most people know that real estate is the best investment and everyone's dream but because we are bitcoin investors and we don't have too much money to own real estate, we are trying to fool ourselves that bitcoin is better. To be honest, I don't feel comfortable investing large amounts of money in bitcoin but I feel very safe owning real estate and generating passive income from it.  It is true that investing in bitcoin will bring much better returns than any investment, not only real estate but everything has its price and the higher the return, the higher the risk.",

In some countries, the rent is just too cheap, so it's hard to make a lot of profit and/or make it fact with real estate. It can be a source of regular passive income, which is great, but it can indeed take decades to even repay the invested amount. However, when people buy real estate, selling in the future is considered as well, so if purchasing prices grow over time, then the monthly rent is just a nice bonus, while the real opportunity is in long-term holding and subsequent selling. But I do agree that it can also be hard to do, people should account for taxes and paperwork (as op pointed out), etc. So I do agree that Bitcoin is a better investment because it's easier, more flexible, and probably more profitable in the long run unless one becomes particularly lucky with real estate.",

But traditionally, there is no doubt that real estate is also a good investment. So, whichever you prefer means that you have done your research very well. Whilst Bitcoin isn't tangible, real estate is tangible and the investor or owner can live there if they don't want to rent it out. Otherwise, it's sole purpose is to be rented out and as it gives passive income, the value of it appreciates over time. IMHO, there is no need to compare these two.

The location of the property is important, as well as the conditions of the country at a particular time. In countries that are experiencing a population explosion, the price of houses can skyrocket, and a person can make a profit. A country in Africa is experiencing a boom in the real estate sector because crude oil and some precious stones have just been discovered. So it has led to the influx of foreign workers, which has also led to an increase in house demands.But on average, I think holding Bitcoin for a long time will be better than investing in real estate. Both of them have both merits and demerits but I will prefer Bitcoin. Bitcoin is more convenient and more predictable for me.",

      "body": "Personally, i see investing into real estate as same as saving your your money or rather, berrying your money. Real estate investment takes a lot of time before you can possible get the initial capital you used  in making such investment. There are somany variables to be considered when when going into real estate but even after putting all those factors into consideration, what you get at the end of each year rjr making such investment is in most cases too small.in my region, what's needed to build a five room apartment could be at least $31k,  and if you're estimating what you will take as house rent for the apartment in a year,  you should be looking at $1k which means that it will take you approximately 31 years to get back the capital of $31k and that's even if we assume that nothing comes along the way in form of maintenance or so.If you on the other hand invest the $31k into Bitcoin now and in the next two years, Bitcoin just only gets to $100k, it means that your Bitcoin investments has given you a lot more than you will even get if you're in real estate for at least a period of five years. I even prefer to rent an apartment rather than going into real estate. If fie any reason  I'm building a personal apartment, ur should be to own a space that's 100% my own and not necessarily an investment that's supposed to yield any serious incentives along the way. Bitcoin suppases real estate investment any day, anytime.",

      "body": "You have compiled a good post, I liked it, as it clearly gives us the idea of which investment opportunity is best, buying a place, or property, or buying BTC. To be honest, this post just fits best on my situation, as a few days ago I came to know the price of 1 Marla in my place, and in Pakistan according to Google, 1 Marla is equal to 20.9 square meters. 1 Marla = 20.9sq.m So the price I heard is around 1.5 lac at the moment. I started to have thoughts that I could buy 1 Marla or maybe a little more, but should I keep my funds in BTC or invest those funds in Marla? My plan is not to rent the place, as first I have to buy the property and then have to build a house on it, overall the cost would be a lot, my plan is to just buy the place, and leave it free. And with time its value will increase.For example last year the price of 1 Marla near my house was 60k pkr, and after 1 year as of now, it is around 1.99x in its price, 1.5 Lac. So, according to you, it will take 10 years to cover the 2x if we will rent the place, but you did not consider the fact that, before making an investment proper research is made, if you are buying a property near no community, like totally in ruine then obviously you will not going to make 2x in a year, but if you buy a place near a growing area then the place value will be more than 2x in a year, so you can easily make 2x to 5x in real estate without renting the place. But still, I prefer to hold my BTC as it require me less documentations and burden, while real estate in my place comes with real problems, like many bad actors try to do bad things while making deal with you over a property.",

A person who has been around Bitcoin for a couple of years may know that Bitcoin will gain what it's lost, it will recover eventually. But, you won't be able to convince others who do not know much about Bitcoin or who have just heard about Bitcoin. If you talk about me, I know that Bitcoin will give multiple x profits in the long run, still, I am afraid to invest all my wealth because of security reasons. But people do the same thing (Invest their last penny) in other business like Real estate. Bitcoin is here for over a decade. But we cannot really say which one will be the lowest price of Bitcoin this year and what will be the highest price.",

If you want an active flow of income, you can buy a property and rent it. Some people think that it's such a headache because renting it to people since they need to meet different people and keep maintaining the property. Compared to if you just sell it to one person, you get the money and that's it.QuoteBitcoin investment is good, and real estate is not only for the old. It's just that younger generations are more knowledgeable about crypto and bitcoin but I still see people even with younger people interested in real estate.",
