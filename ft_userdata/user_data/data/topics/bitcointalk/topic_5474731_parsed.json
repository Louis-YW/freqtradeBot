What are your thoughts ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­In bull market, you can not see price rises day by day, forever. There are green and red days even you are in a big bull run. If you were in this market when Bitcoin was $69,000 and hoped to get cheaper prices to buy it. Yes, you fortunately got many chances with many cheaper prices that are even under $16,000 and if till now you are still hesitating to buy Bitcoin, I am sure, you will regret and have a same hope when Bitcoin crosses $69,000 or hit $100,000.Bear market is a great chance to buy Bitcoin because if history repeats itself, Bitcoin will make a new all time high in a next halving and a consequent new bull run.",

But this doesnâ€™t mean that Bitcoin will not suffer any correction because thereâ€™s no such thing as continuous green day since some trader that purchased on lower price will take profit. One thing is for sure and itâ€™s that the price is more on the positive side after we break important resistance that keeps the trend on previous bear market.",

The prospect of the upcoming halving and the soon-to-be-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs also help the anticipation. 37k is pretty steep price to drop from in case the bear is still not over and I don't think it's been a thing that has happened before to bitcoin so I am sure that bitcoin probably way past that bear season and I hope that the bitcoin price will stay here for long because it's a comfortable spot to buy bitcoin and be chill that the price won't go any lower. It's a guarantee that halving will affect bitcoin and I'm almost certain that it's going to be a big pump but I still hold reservations that after halving, the pump in prices will probably take some time but I'm all for the waiting anyways.",

What are your thoughts ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­No one knows what will happen in the future, anything can happen. So you need to have your own investment plan, always plan for the worst situations, don't be too subjective because we all know bitcoin's fluctuations are unpredictable.Â  I have been consulting with various investors on several social media platforms, some say we are in the pre-bullish phase and we will not drop below $30k again. But there are also some opinions that bitcoin will still have another round of dumping and could fall below $20k once again. In the market there are always two opposing sides and we will not know who is right and who is wrong. Therefore, you should do your own research and make your own decisions instead of following other people's advice because no expert can predict the future.",

What are your thoughts ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­Well, It's actually possible that the bear market for Bitcoin is coming to an end but the short answer to your question is that no one can say for sure if the bear market for Bitcoin is over because no one can predict the future of the market with 100% accuracy. It's possible that the recent price increase is a sign that the market is turning around but it's also possible that it's just a temporary rally and only time will tell whether the bear market is truly over.Â  The only thing I can tell you is to accumulate more as you can if you have the means to avoid had I know in the end. Because if you keep on waiting for the price to drop further before you take action, you might wait longer and possibly miss the opportunity. Whether bear is over or not should not be the center of our discussion but rather how we can accumulate more into our wallet and wait for result after.",

For now as long as the the halving hasnâ€™t happened I would say this swing of the market is bull trap. Right now the support level is at $34,500 to $35,000 while the resistance level seem to be at $37,200 to $37,800. This changes will remain until next where we will get the fate of ETF, should it be delayed more by the SEC I think we will see a large pull out by short time holders. For now I am in till 2025",
