Baltics Will be not touched and northern Europe not interesting for Putin.Go? meaning what? Throw whatever T90s they have left at them? Moldova is weak and could be taken over, but at the current state of the Russian military, even if Poland wasn't a NATO member, I doubt they'd be able to fight it, while having a large part of their forces tied in Ukraine. Basically, if there was no NATO and Russia attacked Moldova and Poland in 2023, and these countries would only get military aid the way Ukraine is, Russia would lose all of its forces. It gets even better with Germany in the mix. I really doubt that Russia would be able to defeat Germany 1 on 1 without the use of nuclear weapons simply because of the path its forces would have to take to get there. The first thing Poland would do is blow up bridges and Russians would get stuck without reinforcements. Also, there's no way Finland and Sweden would just watch as Russians attack members of the EU. In no scenario does Russia win this, even if there was no NATO. Since there is NATO and Russia has lost a third of its ground forces this year, if they move significant forces towards Moldova or Poland, they can expect Ukraine to move towards Crimea. Even if we did the math in March 2022, Russia would lose vs the rest of Europe, even if the US was not involved. They simply don't have the manpower to overpower and hold so many countries at the same time. Especially countries that have strong air strike capabilities that Ukraine was lacking. They wouldn't be fighting old Mig-29 that Ukrainians have but Eurofighters, Gripens, Rafales and so on...",

Yet he is bragging about his grant of $200 million to a China company to build batteries.So, who is our enemy? Russia? Biden? China? Or maybe it is the elite world bankers.Biden regime issues $200 million grant to battery manufacturer based in ChinaQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-12-09-biden-200-million-grant-battery-manufacturer-china.html#The Department of Energy (DoE) under fake president Joe Biden is bragging about a new $200 million grant that was given to a lithium battery company called Microvast, the claim being that it will help to expand domestic sources of green energy. The problem is that Microvast “primarily” operates in communist China.Despite claiming to be based in Texas, Microvast conducts most of its business overseas in the world’s largest dictatorship. The Biden regime conveniently failed to mention this in touting the “bipartisan,” taxpayer-funded cash payout as a supposed boon for domestic “green” energy expansion.Back in October when the Infrastructure Law grants were first announced, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm claimed that all such payouts were for “American-made” products. This was clearly a lie, based on what has since been uncovered.“This is truly a remarkable time for manufacturing in America, as President Biden’s agenda and historic investments supercharge the private sector to ensure our clean energy future is American-made,” Granholm read from a script.“Producing advanced batteries and components here at home will accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to meet the strong demand for electric vehicles, creating more good-paying jobs across the country. (Related: Biden’s climate agenda is entirely China-centric.)Microvast recently added to SEC watchlist of Chinese companies slated for delisting from NASDAQ for failing to comply with U.S. auditing requirementsIn the announcement for this specific grant, the DoE claimed that Microvast is a “majority U.S.-owned company, traded on NASDAQ” that is “headquartered in Stafford, Texas,” with additional locations in Tennessee, Florida, and Colorado.A closer look at the financial records of Microvast tells quite a different story, though. We now know that the company operates mostly out of China, and Microvast itself says that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities and may intervene, at any time and with no notice.”...",

The sort of stalemate it looks in now depicts it more like an attempt to showcase it's power and intent to safeguard it's territory and nothing else.

The Germany Defense Ministry has publicly stated it could only sustain a war for one week due to shortages in supplies and soldiers, reports AsiaTimes.com. What’s even more astonishing is that a German lawmaker says that’s too optimistic. The real duration of what Germany is capable of sustaining in a war is just two days.If war is announced on Monday, in other words, Germany is finished by Wednesday and forced to surrender.“NATO countries running out of ammunition as Germany left with ‘2 days’ of stocks,” blares the headline from Express.co.UK:Germany has been facing pressure to maintain its defence commitment to NATO while providing Ukraine with the necessary weaponry to fight back against Russia. According to local reports, the German Army has been left with only “two days” worth of ammunition to sustain active combat if necessary.While Russia is reportedly firing 20,000 artillery rounds per day — which implies they are able to manufacture something close to 20,000 rounds per day — NATO countries like Germany have near-zero ability to manufacture much of anything needed to sustain a war.In Germany’s case, that’s due to their reliance on cotton linters from China — a component used in artillery munitions. Apparently, Germany sources this material exclusively from China, and China turns out to be nine months behind schedule on shipping cotton linters.Capol.in explains why cotton linters matter in war:Bleached Cotton Linters are being used by our Ordinance Factories for production of propellants used for gun ammunition & also various missiles. For production of propellants, one of the basic explosive is Nitrocellulose(NC). Basic raw material for production of Nitrocellulose(NC) is Bleached Cotton Linters(BCL) which is produced out of raw cotton linters after processing.By faking covid lockdowns, China creates artificial supply chain shortages affecting enemies of Russia...",

How many grammar mistakes are there ?  I guess a third-grade student can do a better job than this. Even now we just ignore the grammar errors, let's pay attention to his lack of logic : if WW3 were coming, how come it were only in Europe ?  Since when did people accept this low standard of expression ?
