  "content": "About 5 or 6 years ago a friend of mine was helping get into Bitcoin. He generated a paper wallet and ask me a passphrase to encrypt. I put some fraction of a Bitcoin on and totally forgot about it. Fast forward to last week, I’m packing up to move into my new place and found this wallet. Decided to check it out and not only are the bitcoins are still there, but now they are worth a whole lot more. Enough to pay for 2 months rent, which I could really use. Problem is I can’t remember the passphrase I used and have been trying everything I could think of. Is there another way to access the coins or am I just out of luck?",

My guess is the passphrase is likely 8 characters (max) with 1 uppercase and 1 number.Think i'll give https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover a try. Looks like it uses graphics card acceleration and I have an old i7 with a GTX570 I can setup and let run. Even if it takes a year, it's still worth it in the end.Any idea how many attempts per minute can be made with what I have?Also, after some research the paper wallet was created on https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/ which looks like it has a sketchy past. Funds are still there, so that's a plus.",

Your only option will be to attempt to brute force the password.Personally, I would try using btcrecover to do this: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/You would need to either set up a passwordlist file, which is simply a list of possible passwords you might have used, or a tokenlist file, which tells btcrecover how to generate potential passwords from a set of rules you define (such as 5 lowercase characters followed by 1 number, or something along those lines).Quote from: Bitcoin_Loser on October 04, 2022, 01:00:16 PMAny idea how many attempts per minute can be made with what I have?GPUs don't offer much benefit for BIP38 unless you have lots of them. More likely you will be limited to a few dozen guesses a seconds by your CPU.Quote from: Bitcoin_Loser on October 04, 2022, 01:00:16 PMAlso, after some research the paper wallet was created on https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/ which looks like it has a sketchy past. Funds are still there, so that's a plus.It used to be legit prior to it being sold in 2018, so your wallet from 5-6 years ago is probably OK if the funds have not been moved. Since it was sold in 2018 it has turned in to a scam site.",
