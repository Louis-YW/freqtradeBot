      "body": "In as much as Trezor poses a higher questionable risk of identity vulnerability than your phrase backup to an online cloud,\" I think it's still highly advisable for you to avoid connecting your hardware wallet to an online wallet, which seems like a lite version of your already existing wallet. This is for you to be on the safer side and avoid being a victim of any kind of hack in case any of your gadgets are already compromised. It's just a safety precaution since you have chosen a hardware wallet, which means that you don't have to be worried about those online wallets, either web or mobile, so just maintain it, unless you want to fully go back to online wallet usage and the risks associated with it.",

Thanks Sharing the public key does not involve any risk, in fact it is also used to receive payments.  However, keep in mind never to share your private key or seed (12 or 24 words) because it is used to access the wallet and control it.  I hope it is clear as I wrote.  cheer",

If the application is from Trezor you can put your public there. But do not share the private key/key phrases with Trezor or anyone, for that you can lose your assets and risk your wallet.The public key (XPUB) is only related to privacy, not associated with the security of the hardware wallet.Even though sharing a public key is not risky, for the XPUB (Extended Public) Key, I suggest not sharing it publicly because other people can see all of your wallet's transaction history, and it can reduce privacy.Download the application from the official link (https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-trezor-suite-lite) because many fake applications are on Google Play or the App Store.",

However, since their lite version for mobile is only made for monitoring your wallet only use it to monitor your wallet addresses and transactions.And take note this app is new and currently does not have open-source yet so we do not know how safe the app is.",

Thanks It's just a public key and there's no problem with that broadcasting on the problem. But as it's a public key and still, I wouldn't be broadcasting it anywhere. Someone will know that it's you with what you're doing with your transactions and if you're okay with that, then that's not really a problem. Not really a risk but someone in the public might know what your transactions coming in and out with that public key.",
