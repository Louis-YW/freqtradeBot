What are prerequisites for compatibility of LayerZero with existing or future blockchain networks?2) > LayerZero is a communication protocolWho is supposed to use this protocol? Could you list all groups of participants based on their role? What data they should poses in order to be able to play their role in the network? 3) > Its core function is to ensure \"valid delivery.\" This means the receiving chain correctly matches and verifies transactions from the sender chain, eliminating the need for middlemen.What it means to \"verify the transaction\"? What verification steps can LayerZero support and what steps it can't support?4) > The protocol implements generic messaging that provides trustless valid delivery of arbitrary data.What means \"trustless valid delivery of arbitrary data\"?",

Information on how to run your own Executor is available here.Unified Semantics: OApp and OFT contracts enable developers to build applications and tokens that work the same across every blockchain V2 has an endpoint on.V1 Compatibility: ​​Migration options exist for V1 applications. If already deployed on V1, applications can utilize the new security and execution model via ULN 301. More information can be found here.\"",
