If fees make it non-viable for middle class, how can it reach mass adoption?There's no solution other than using an L2, unfortunately. And I get it, the most developed one right now, LN, is sometimes ugly and expensive to use, but there is more development on L2 that make use of lightning, like this one: https://arkdev.info/. Divided possession of an UTXO is one way to improve scaling drastically.",

You lock your Bitcoins in scripts which become Lightning channels, so they are stored there safely with Bitcoin's L1 guarantees.If the channel is unidirectional and you are at the end of a Lightning \"spoke\", i.e. if you only use it to pay and not to receive money, then there is also no risk for the channel state to get \"rewinded\" to an earlier state. This means that in this case, there is no security tradeoff. Basically, you only \"bundle your own transactions\". If you open a LN channel with $10000 in it and pay $100 fees, Bitcoin is still competitive.But even if you do participate actively in the Lightning routing (opining several channels in both directions), the security guarantees are still those of the Bitcoin consensus and you only have to monitor the state regularly to be able to initiate a channel close. There is no \"middleman\" like in the currently existing Ethereum rollups for example.",

I often paid a fee of a few dollars, only to wait +30 minutes for it. Just can not see what makes BTC, in its present form, a superior currency than for instance LTC.Should fees rise even further, (as it was once $15-ish) I find it unlikely people will continue to rely on BTC as a viable payment method.",

      "body": "The logic is quite simple as adoption increases so also will price follow and that simply means that smaller unit of SATs will have bigger values and this would also mean that smaller amount of SATs will be paid as fees or transaction fees rather to miners. Layer 2 upgrade will not be a problem in fact it was a fork fix to improve efficiency of transaction by saving block space and as a result reducing congestion. The only reason I see or fees becoming bigger is if congestion later becomes an issue and I really don't see that happening anytime soon besides there is always room for an upgrade. Little random congestions is quite normal sometimes but a general long session of congestion like something similar to what happened around 2017 and 2018 will be a little difficult.",

Just like I believe Bitcoin price is undervalued Bitcoin didn't necessarily deviate from its intended purpose It's more like it evolved and added as a store of value And yes though Development has been slow and cautious it's price payed for security. Scalabilty is been solved by Layer 2 network and in the future we can see something better than LN. All cryptocurrencies are speculative in nature and it wouldn't be easy for any to take over Bitcoin as the pioneer of the cryptocurrency. It's true that many are buying Bitcoin as a speculative asset but many isn't allAnd as time goes on they would understand the flaw of the Fiat system.

But that doesn't mean it deviates from its original purpose, you can still use it as a payment method if you want regardless of what other people use it for. Just like gold was used as currency in the past but over time it has been used as jewelry, investment or store of value...is gold straying from its original purpose? Bitcoin is still Bitcoin, the only difference is that people use it for their different purposes.If you consider bitcoin as just a currency or payment method then you are right in saying that bitcoin is overvalued, but if you consider it as an asset, an investment.
