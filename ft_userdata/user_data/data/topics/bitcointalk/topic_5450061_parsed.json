      "body": "Why not buy crypto using your PayPal account directly? The last time I checked PayPal support the purchase of Bitcoin and other fee coin's using there service. So why look for someone to pay $300 to get Bitcoin why you can do it yourself. I advise you edit your title, 300 BTC is different from $300 worth of BTC",

Given that your account was registered a few minutes ago just to post this offer, you are likely not going to get any offers here because of this;Quote from: theymos on June 10, 2011, 05:47:35 PMMoney sent through PayPal and any other money transfer service that accepts credit cards can be easily reversed by the sender, even after several weeks. Therefore, you should only accept PayPal in trades with people you trust very highly.This is why newbies are not likely to sell their PayPal USD for bitcoins successfully.Some other services that are not totally safe:- Bank transfers (ACH, etc.) except wire transfers- Most gift cards.- Moneypak- AlertPay- Paysafecards- Dwolla- Western Union (they reportedly will sue the recipient to recover money in some cases)Only a trusted member would have a chance to trade off the PayPal for Bitcoins, minus the trade partners getting worried that they could be fleeced.",

I would not have bothered but looking at your profile, I had to as you are a newbie here. Since you have been given a link here already I commend that but I will advise you to always use an escrow when dealing so as to avoid being scammed as there are scammers everywhere looking for who will fall prey to their activities. Carefully use a reputable high-rank member here as an escrow.Lastly, I would want to know why you never bothered wanting to use the cex for fast, secured, easy and safe transaction. Atleast there are lots of cex here and an example of the is Binance .",

It's far too risky to accept PayPal from a new account, you'll have to find another way to pay that's less prone to charge-backs if you want to deal with honest sellers.Quote from: CryptSafe on April 25, 2023, 03:24:01 AMI would not have bothered but looking at your profile, I had to as you are a newbie here.
