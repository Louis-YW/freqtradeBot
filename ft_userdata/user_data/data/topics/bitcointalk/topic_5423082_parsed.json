Early physical bitcoin represents a moment in time which only a few saw the inevitable path. Your coins are symbolic of time before everything changed. They are much more than metal and a hologram. They are belief in a better world, belief that the average man can have a voice, and belief that the chains of greed can be broken. These are the greatest collectables the world has ever known.",
