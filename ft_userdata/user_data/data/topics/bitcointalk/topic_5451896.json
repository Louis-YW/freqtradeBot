Foss expressed his support for “hard assets” such as real estate, gold, and bitcoin. He believes that bitcoin, the leading crypto asset, is one of the best hard assets available. According to Foss, bitcoin provides insurance against “the failure of a basket of fiat currencies.”Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-provides-insurance-against-fiat-currency-failure-says-validus-power-corp-s-greg-foss/",

Other than this, BTC has all the other characteristics of Hard assets. That's why Bitcoin Enthusiasts used to say \"BTC provides a hedge against Inflation\" Many people do not accept this statement as they have short-term research but if they look at the long run then they will understand BTC has proved itself the best hard asset or hedge against inflation. As, someone has already stated the effect of the Debt ceiling on BTC, and these two terms (Debt Ceiling, Inflation of Fiat currency/inflation) if collided then no wonder the economy of US will drop along with the ones having US dollar in Reserve.",

If majority of holders are just traders who buy and sell it all the time, then it won't have any such properties, it will be crashing hard because dumping when the crash is just starting is a smart thing to do, even at a loss, as you will rebuy later at the bottom.And I have a feeling that many of the people who are publicly saying that Bitcoin will protect them from inflation don't actually believe in that, they just try to pump their investment so they can dump it at higher price.",

As much as we want, hope and try to see bitcoin to be, it would only be if majority of we the people see it to be or place it in a position of being that which we intend for it.Fiat has got issues and those to whom authorises or backs it up but, bitcoin has got just the people. The whales, petty traders and holders combined. The more people get to buy in the idea, the more value it adds to itself.It's been seen to serve as, you can't just issue new coins to serve an inflationary purpose or withdraw it from the system and the reverse results. It works solely based on how the masses perceives the dynamics that happens on the market. This makes it more better in serving public interest than we can say for fiat.",
