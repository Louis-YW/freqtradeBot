  "content": "Another bullish news alongside the speculation that a bitcoin spot ETF is coming.This should appear to us that what everyone calls the smart money are preparing for the next bull market which the cryptospace might already be on the starting line. Does everyone remember the chart where they marked the different market stages with euphoria, fear, capitulation, depression, hope and disbelief? We might be in disbelief hehehehe.Many people in the forum say that we are still not in a bull market, however, the actions of Blackrock and big mining companies like Riot Platforms tell us that it is now the right time to invest.Riot Platforms—one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the world—is set to boost its hashrate capacity to new heights after purchasing 33,280 mining rigs from MicroBT, a leading manufacturer of the machines needed to mine new coins. The Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) order adds up to $162.9 million, making it a standout purchase even among a slew of similar investments from competing firms this year. The machines themselves, however, aren’t scheduled for delivery until December 2023, and won’t be deployed until the first quarter of 2024.Source https://decrypt.co/146308/bitcoin-mining-firm-riot-secures-33000-new-rigs-for-162-million",

Now the SEC fud was dissolve and replace with the bullish news of bitcoin spot etf and even this new one shared by OP. I guess the company see a huge upside with the application and decided to throw some of their funds to work. Considering mining is quite expensive due to equipment needed. A move must be done and now this will be another catalyst for an epic bull run.",

Or maybe i am being to pessimistic which generally i am not.I disagree that halvings always help Bitcoin to make new all time highs. Effects of Bitcoin halvings will reduce with time when block rewards become smaller and smaller in next 3 or 4 halvings.Like in previous bear markets, Bitcoin did not fall under its previous all time high but in this bear market, Bitcoin fell under $19,000 which is the 2017 all time high. Price even fell to under $16,000 which is far below 2017 all time high.Everything can happen in this market and if you have this suspicious mind, you will have more careful investment plan. You will not do high risk bet like selling your house and use all money to invest in Bitcoin.",

So about $16.5 million monthly. This means if they keep selling Bitcoin at this rate for the next twelve months or so, they'll make almost $200 million, so they may or may not break even with their $162m asic investment depending on their operating costs, the bitcoins they sell (assuming they don't consider their Held Bitcoins sellable), and exactly how early the halving comes.Let's say all this stuff pushes their 12-month revenue down to $160 million, they'll still be mostly even. But the problem with this is that they're not making a profit this way, especially since the new rigs are arriving next year. So they might actually suffer a loss in the next year if blocks don't go their way.",

Kudos to Riot for working on this ignoring all the FUD.But don't forget the opportunity cost of money.If Amazon can spend $1 mining to make $1.10 it's good.If Amazon can spend $1 building a new data center for their cloud services and make $1.25 it's better.Mining is not Amazons or Googles or IBMs main business, so there is a good chance they DID look at it and say, 'we can make more money doing something else'For Riot and others mining is their business. But lets be honest, if for some reason someone went to them and gave them a really good business proposal showing that they should drop all their miners in a dumpster and reconfigure their data centers to house a toothpaste manufacturing facility because instead of $16.5 million a month they would be making $25 million a month. Two things would happen. (1) We would all be dumpster diving to get the miners and (2) everyone at Riot would have nice and bright white teeth. Joking example but it's a business they follow the money. If you think Riot or anyone else is mining in these major facilities for the good of BTC instead to the pursuit of profit then you don't follow business.-Dave",

On Blackrock's ETF application, I was also skeptical about it because why were the cryptonews media again using an old storyline from 2021? However, it also made me think, why would Blackrock apply for an ETF during Gensler's crackdown on the cryptospace? This might be because they know for certain that the whole cryptospace market will not dump anymore.",

I believe the biggest reason behind that is the legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies all the time, and SEC doing everything it can to suppress the adoption of blockchain technology within the US.However, I believe all these tech giants will some day realize what an opportunity they have missed, and they might even enter the market but they will be pretty late unless they decide to create something of their own which will obviously not reach the level of Bitcoin but might gain some popularity as well.",
