  "content": "Considering that improper maintenance or bad maintenance culture can shorten the life span of machines, I think it is useful to share and discuss tips on how to maintain our mining equipment for a longer time. But before talking about maintenance we also need to highlight some of the major causes of damage to equipment which are;QuoteLittle or no airflow: ASIC miners release a considerable amount of heat, so it is crucial to keep and run them in a well-ventilated location that keeps air moving and refreshing to avoid overheating.Humid, damp, or moist environments: Like any other electronic device, ASICs’ internal components are damaged by humidity, which can cause rust and corrosion.Extreme temperatures: When the temperature is extremely hot, it can shorten your hardware’s lifespan by chipping away its internal components. Cold tends to be less critical, as ASICs release heat that can counter-balance it. However, quick swings from below-zero to warm temperatures can cause condensation, provoking irreversible damage.To keep your equipment in good condition for a longer time, some tips are;QuoteChoosing a suitable location- A dry room with good, constant airflow, so wide and open spaces should be the first choice. Mitigate the heatRegular removal of accumulated dust - Ideally, you’d have an air compressor/gun to blow the dust from the ASIC fans and interior. However, you can also disassemble the miner and brush the fans manually — if you do this, remember to be extra careful!These are tips from - https://medium.com/lumerin-blog/how-to-prolong-your-asic-miners-lifespan-360b68140a04My personal tips are;-keep food, soda drinks or anything that can spill away from your equipment.-If you have a space at home where you keep and use your equipment, don't let your kids or pets play in that space if you have kids or pets or both.- If possible you can cover equipment when not in use to avoid dust from settling inside.",

If other tips and guides are not mentioned in your link above I suggest use the guide from Bitmain you can check the guide from this link below- Antminer Operation and Maintenance Guide",

Actually, Bitmain units already have a default temperature limit if one of the hashboard reaches the limit it will automatically shut down other units of Bitmain will stay running it but that hashboard will stop mining. All Bitmain units have temp protection so if you see an abnormal reboot or other hashboard of the miner stop mining then restart the unit and monitor the temp. If you have a room with proper air circulation you don't need to worry about overheating and if you can bring the hot air out of the room I'm sure you have healthy units except if you use overclocked firmware.",
