Bitcoin is going to over $100000 before 2026.Should I say I'll think about it? Still finding it difficult to give it a try too soon, let's see how it will be like by the end of this year.Now you have your own prediction, should I believe that by 2026 Bitcoin will get to $100,000? I can't say anything about that, my question is what are you saying about this year?Hold on a minute did you just say by 2026, it's that a long time to wait?Don't want investors to keep relying on this predictions unless they see it happening, if not it will be a heart break for them.",

      "body": "A forecast = prediction is a guess, we only estimate the probability of its occurrence in the future. Surely, everyone has their own prediction because they will predict it according to their own approach, their own point of view, and their own research. I'm not surprised if there are too many predictions made by people related to the potential price of Bitcoin in 2023, 2024, or 2025. However, I believe that the price in the next bullrun season (2025), the price should be above $69,000. We can count it based on the price history of each BTC ATH in the previous bullrun seasons.The maximum BTC price yearly, according to the  link:Quote2023    $31,0002024    $31,0002025    $53,0002030    $100,000It is very doubtful that the maximum price will be only around $31,000 for 2 years (2023-2024). And in 2025, how can the price will be $53,000, below its current ATH. If it happens, the BTC halving means to have less impact on the demand. As far as I know, BTC always created a new ATH every 4 years. It implies a bigger price in 2025, it should be above $68,000-$69,000. BTC highest price every 4 year cycles2010   $0.40 (starting)2013   $1,163 (first bullrun)2017   $19,892 (second bullrun)2021   $68,789 (third bullrun)2025    -------- (fourth bullrun)Reference: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-price-history",

      "body": "Bitcoin future value is unpredictable and the highest spectators could do is to speculate the future price of Bitcoin without any form of accuracy, is normal for investors to be anxious about bitcoin future value since there are events line up  in the next coming months/years such as the bitcoin haven and the rest,  this events will push bitcoin price to rise significantly but when that price increase (ATH) will be is what is uncertain for all of us. So the highest we can do right now is t only speculate the possible future price of Bitcoin,  and doing so,  it means we must beer I mind that there is a high chances that our predictions may not work according to how we except them to be and that is why,  holding Bitcoin should be done with a long term mentality to avoid any possible panic action whenever the opposites to our predictions happen I the market.",

This is possible to predict but the assurance of the price to effect as what they had predicted is where the problems lays.There are series of tells about bitcoin price although same came to pass while some didn't yield any fruit to it because it doesn't work they way it was predicted. Like few post above did said \"Life himself is a probability\" and the probability for an event to effect and take place is still Zero or One, as a learned investor or smart crypto enthusiast you should be able to hold knowing too well how the system independently operates even though we found it to be driven by information and possible some positive news although it could be negative news as well but it doesn't mean there will be no changes in the global cryptocurrency market. That's why those who missing the track of the train always which for the train to find its way back the previous position so that they could hop in, to take their moved, that's why is always advisable to fill your bag as little as you can to be able to enjoy the free rides when the time comes.",

CLICK HERE With all these being said I feel is time we face the reality that all these are just predictions, is under probability.If you're going to think about it, all of it is just speculation, prediction, etc. There's no actual way to predict the market accurately so, I mean yes we believed in what Bitcoin can do, and probably believed that it is going to reach the market price of 100k$ but we aren't sure about that since we do not know what could happen in the future. I mean if world war III starts tomorrow are 100k$ on Bitcoin still going to be a thing, I really doubt that and I don't know if it is going to happen, since as we analyze in the last when people speculate because of the war the market price drop significantly.A prediction is just a prediction so that wouldn't really make any impact, there was no proof of it that it is going to happen, If you invest in some meme coins, for example, you could predict that it's going to reach 1$ in the future like what happened to dogecoin but that didn't really happen. So I wouldn't rely on predictions, what you could do is analyze the market and the Bitcoin study technology, news, timelines, etc. then start to speculate. You could relay on facts and history, it was accurate but there was a proof.",

And it's going to be a hit or miss even if they presented solid and strong facts a why the price will go this X in the next bull run.",

That made me to only see it come to pass before buying that idea/prediction of happening and when I see such predictions again I just don't believe it will happen.",

For example, saying that Bitcoin will return to 30,000 is an acceptable expectation, and saying that we will break the $100,000 is an acceptable expectation. , And to say that the price will be one million dollars is an unlikely prediction in the short term.If we know with 100% certainty that the price will go to 100,000 after about 6 months, then we will all be rich, as we will sell our homes and everything we own, buy bitcoin, wait 6 months, and welcome more than 3 times the wealth in a short time, but it is uncertainty and risk that makes us invest With caution it makes for our valuable investment.",
