  "content": "Sparrow and Paul joined this forum a few months after the covid-19.  After a year of posting in the forum, Sparrow got ranked up to the senior member, but Paul remained a junior member. Paul was angry, which lead him to develop a sense of jealousy, but continued posting in the forum anyway.One day Paul just felt that the best thing to do is to give up, he could not continue with his posting anymore. He's just thinking of giving up on the rules and regulations that are not favouring him. But before he gives up on the forum, he private chats a legendary member, complaining that nobody in the forum values his posting strength, but merits only the favoured members!The bounty managers that Paul has promoted the campaigns they have handled knew that Paul does make complete tasks given to him; even posts on all the forum boards than Sparrow and therefore he deserved to be ranked up to higher ranks. So to help Paul to realize the mistake he has been doing in the forum, the legendary member of the forum decided to add both Paul and Sparrow to a telegram group. He starts by asking Paul a simple question on telegram.\"What's bitcoin and what's the motive behind its lead creation?”Paul replied by saying that bitcoin is a digital currency and the reason for bitcoin creation is to store it up as an asset and to trade it.The legendary member asked him again, \"who created bitcoin?\" Paul replied by saying is Satoshi.The legendary member asked Sparrow the same question he asked Paul. The legendary member told Paul to pay good close attention to his response.Sparrow starts by saying, bitcoin is known as a digital currency, it is invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in the year 2009. After the creation of bitcoin by Satoshi, nobody has seen or knows him. Although there are speculations of people claiming to be him.At the initial stage of bitcoin, many people don't believe in bitcoin, they thought is a bubble that will soon burst. As time goes on, bitcoin began to amass momentum and spread across the globe, although in some countries bitcoin is illegal. The unique nature of bitcoin is that it can't be controlled by anyone or the government.There is speculation that it will hit $100k in the halving. Bitcoin halving does happen once in four years. We have the bull season and the bearish season in crypto. Bitcoin is the king of all crypto. Bitcoin is the first coin that comes into people's minds before any other altcoin. The crypto market is volatile and unpredictable.The reason behind bitcoin's creation is to make everyone financial independent, keep their financial status anonymous, store up their assets, for easy and fast transactions in the comfort of their home, and exchange goods and services:In the end, Paul was very impressed and realized the difference between himself and Peter. He decided not to give up so quickly but to learn from Sparrow how to post. As we continue to post in this forum as learners, let this story help us to bear in mind the significance of going an additional mile in all our efforts in the forum.You won't be merited for not posting and commenting well. Be able to ask or give solutions to topics treated here. You're only rewarded for making your suggestions clear and understandable. Performing beyond expectations.  To be more successful in this forum, you must be observant, proactive and willing to post more,  think more, have a more good perspective and go beyond just posting.",

Anything didactic is welcomed, nothing bad about it. Sharing an analogy makes a lesson or teaching stick better that when it isn't used. It's a kudos to the OP for me.From the picture OP painted, I would easily merit the Sparrow dude than Paul. Sparrow's method of teaching appealed to me as it went deeper beyond the surface. Not just because it has more words in it but because it showed effort and input more than what Paul did. However, I still won't be shocked if someone merited Paul because as I kept saying that merit is a subjective thing. It depends on the perception of the user who is sending the merit across.",

Yes, I can say that I had some distrust of you. A too-respectful attitude toward everyone sometimes arouses suspicion of sycophancy. But I was wrong. And also, not always \"stroking the head\" motivates a person to open up and show their talents. Sometimes criticism also works so that someone who is stronger than the offense can prove that the first opinion can be wrong. Which is what you did. And I'm very happy with your changes, and this can be a good example for everyone who thinks it's very difficult to get recognition on the forum.",

Your story is not realistic because the legendary member is not a councilor and has no business with both of them. Even the Sparrow has nothing affiliated to Paul's failure to gain merits. Another wrong aspect of your story is the notion that Paul is leaving the forum because he got no merits. Nobody should stay or leave the forum because of merits we are here to learn or earn from sharing information or offering services. They are many usage of this forum. Merit and activities system is here to fight spam. In terms of money many earn in this forum with lesser merit, no signature but their goods and services fetch them a good amount of funds.

I actually didn't mind it. It's not impressive by any means or great, but it still required an effort to write. Hopefully it's not copy-pasted from somewhere. I have the feeling that some members believe they have to rank up sooner or later. That's simply not true. You might just not have the quality for it. Just because members A and B became hero and legendary members, it doesn't mean user C will as well one day. Maybe Jr. Member or Member is the maximum you can do based on the knowledge you have and the amount of work you put in. So what? Do the best with what you got.We start school on equal terms, but some graduate with top grades and others barely make it through. Two people can get the same entry-level jobs and one ends up becoming a General Manager of the company in a few years while the other remains at the bottom. Etc., etc.    Honesty is what is missing. People aren't honest to themselves. Can I really be measured and compared with the best or do I lack certain qualities? Is the world simple unfair or are other people better than me? Honest people shouldn't have troubles answering these questions.",

More than that creates complexity and invites confusion.Keep paragraphs short        - Look at any newspaper and notice the short paragraphs.           That’s done to make reading easier, because our brains take in information better when it’s broken into small chunks.          Straight to the point       - Save the readers time, because time is a precious thing.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5135800.0 All that is needed is the quality content and the idea that has some taughts.",
