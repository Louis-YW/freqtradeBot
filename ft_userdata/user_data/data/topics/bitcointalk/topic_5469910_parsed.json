Even though U.S. citizens were killed, it would be a mistake for the U.S. to be involved in any direct/indirect manner, Biden administration recognizes this and they've chosen their words carefully to reflect that. They've moved military forces near the region, but won't diploy. Israel has received more than enough aid to properly defend their nation.",

Democrats know that deploying forces in favor of Israel defense would likely only escalate the situation and further degenerate into more violence, the precense of those troops and the carriers near the coasts of Israel is a basic symbolic gesture of Washington to demonstrate their standing. Though, in the very rare scenario of Israel forced getting overwhelmed, I would not be surprised if USA decided to actually deploy reinforcements to secure the situation in Gaza. But we already know the situation is getting under control from the perspective of Israel. After this attack those who are going to suffer the most are going to be those civilians trapped in Gaza and being directly or indirectly struck by bombs.",
