For example Jade, OneKey, Keystone...and more.Prices start from 49$, even 39$ with promo code.Many of them look beautifully with great looking design, some are thin, some of them have large touch screen...Offering 24/7 support. All that promises convenience, smooth ride and also aesthetics and ergonomics. The question is: where is the catch?Why are they less popular than say Trezor or ColdCard which are more expensive, less convenient and not very beautifully designed? For example, if you guys were choosing a new wallet now, and came to a shop where all open source hardware wallets are represented, would you purchase an inexpensive convenient beautiful \"exotic\" wallet? Or would you purchase one of the same wallets you used to consider, like Trezor/Coldcard/Bitbox02 ? Why?",

Open source is important, but that is not all.An \"exotic\" hardware wallet for 30 bucks that no one knows might be very insecure.Ledger may not be fully open source, but it is safe. It is very tested. Many hackers and professionals tried to hack it, but had no success.  The same with Trezor and coldcard.Another point is the group of developers that are working in the device to keep it up to date with the newest security techniques. Ledger and Trezor have a nice budget to accomplish that.So, it is a good idea to be conservative here. Keep your main funds in a good and tested hardware wallet. Try small funds with exotic ones first.",

But I would look more at features than aesthetics. In the end, no one wants a hard-to-use or uncomfortable wallet, regardless of how polished or pretty it might look. The most important thing in a hardware wallet is that it is secure. Trezor is the most well-known hardware wallet, it is been around for a while, has a reputation for quality and security, and is endorsed by many cryptocurrency experts.",

There is no catch.I think the catch of those cheap devices is that they're often built from off-the-shelf hardware, closed-source and insecure. There were 'hardware wallets' in the past that were literally outdated, dumbed-down smartphones.But what makes them bad is not the fact that they're exotic / new / unpopular, it's the fact that there is no serious team behind it and security is not their main focus.One could honestly label Foundation Devices as 'exotic'; after all, until a couple months ago, they had only sold and shipped 1000 devices (their Passport 'Founders Edition' - it was limited to 1000 units).While it's not cheap, it's pretty secure. So I do think price and security+quality are conflicting goals.I wouldn't buy anything that's not reproducible, for instance. Because that means the device runs code that is not available to the public.Quote from: https://walletscrutiny.com/?verdict=reproducible&platform=hardwareAs you can see though, as of right now, the reviews are marked 'outdated' since the latest release has not yet been verified. I encourage anyone who benefitted from their service to give them a small donation (Lightning accepted) at least, as a motivation to update those verdicts..",

I'd always recommend to spin up a node with electrs on it and connect to that. If you think it's too expensive: is your privacy worth less than $50 to you? If so, maybe at least find someone you trust and ask them to share their Electrum server's Tor URL.",

      "body": "Thank you very much for your replies! After I made my research and after I read and thought about your replies, Here are my own conclusions about disadvantages of buying exotic hardware wallets even if they are cheap and even if they are open source: 1. Too few users means too few feed backs about how well it works. You just cannot rely on other people experience when choosing this wallet because there is too little of such experience to find on the internet.Does the wallet have bugs? Is it assembled on high quality level? Are the chips inside it good? You don't know and often cannot find out. So you run the risk that the model itself is \"bad\". Not just your device but the model itself. 2. There are manufacturers who replace defective wallets only if you send them the defective wallet first.I don't have answers to the questions like:- Who pays for sending out defective wallet?- What happens if you discovered it is defective AFTER you set it up with your seed, and cannot wipe/reset it?- How long does it take to send it to manufacturer and get replacement? But these questions must be answered BEFORE you buy the wallet. 3. There are some wallets which you can order solely from Asia. If you don't live in Asia yourself, it may happen that customs in your country is suspisious concerning parcels from Asia (I have heard it is so in some contries). Then they may unpack your wallet to check what is inside the package. And you may never feel secure if you receive the wallet that was unpacked. 4. Some wallets may have features which are not known to users and which are something really unusual and at the same time dangerous if you treat your wallet just like you used to from your past experience with other wallets.An example that I found on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/snryqo/warning_flaw_in_blockstream_jade_hardware_wallet/ 5. Some companies manufacturing hardware wallets are very young, small and have indefinite future. You never know how long their support will dure. May be the company will  disappear tomorrow? And yes, some manufacturers websites look like if the company were dieing and didn't care much about its product anymore. Though it continue selling it. 6. Some well promoted and great looking hardware wallets are not so good devices as they seem to be.According to users experience if you succeed to find it on the intermet.They still may be inconvenient and dangerous due to lack of proper support of their software. 7. A small manufacturer may not have enough financial resources which are necessary for spending them on creating proper security updates of device. So the device may be insecure just because manufacturer has no money to constantly make updates. 8. Well known open source brands are constantly checked by many independent checkers. Little known brands may be not checked at all. And if the first one who checks it is a hacker it could be very bad for users. So an advice which I would give to myself:I you want a toy and can afford it, then buy whatever exotic hardware wallet you like and play with it.If you want a real thing and are serious about safety of your funds, then buy a well known  and well tested model from a manufacturer whose business feel great.What do you think guys?",

Ledger works with native apps (I assume those are built in-house by their team) and 3rd-party apps built by the development communities of those digital assets. No idea if the creators need to pay a fee to get their coin supported by Ledger, but there is an official listing process that people can fill out and request for their tokens to be supported. After that, they should eventually check the requests and add those they agree with with the next Ledger Live update.Quote from: Gorilla22 on October 13, 2022, 11:57:53 AM2.

It's hard to tell in which cases the device needs to go back to them and when it doesn't. That's something that needs to be discussed with the support. If you are asked to send the HW back, you should get a refund if they determine it's defective.",

If you can't fix the problem, they might offer you a free replacement immediately or you will be asked to return the HW. Obviously, you have to pay for the shipping if that happens. It's hard to tell in which cases the device needs to go back to them and when it doesn't. That's something that needs to be discussed with the support. If you are asked to send the HW back, you should get a refund if they determine it's defective.    Why is it obvious that the customer needs to pay for shipping back a defective product / shipping a replacement product? To me, that's not obvious; if it's a hardware fault, the manufacturer better send a replacement including shipping for free, such that customers don't pay a single extra dime over someone who got sent a good product in the first place.",

If they establish their is a problem with the device based on the information you gave them, you will get a free replacement as we saw in Maus0728's case that m2017 linked to in this thread. Maus0728 wasn't required to return the faulty product and he still got a new one. But there are surely situations in which the customer doesn't provide the necessary information, their support team can't be certain of what happened, or the problems with the device might not be covered by the warranty agreement because of the way the HW was used. That's when you might be asked to have it returned and pay the shipping costs. After they inspect the device and find out what happened, you will either get a new one and shipping costs refunded (if you have a valid claim) or you won't. People often lie or don't tell the whole truth to get what they want. My HW just stopped working all of a sudden. This is unbelievable. I had it less than a month. What they don't mention is they dropped it in their soft drink and that's why it's dead.",
