For more information, read the post made by theymos, before. I knew that post of theymos. Such cases that have username changed, not only display name changed is very rare.I don't know what are such cases honestly. Lot of donators or VIP members have display names changed. You can check there in Stats on active & merit status of Donators & VIPsAdditionally, in rare cases, you don't have to achieve good net effect to be approved by theymos. One case (about 2 or 3 years ago) just woke up, and made a request, then it was approved a few hours later. Reasons are because of personal identity, dox as I recalled. That user has its name changed to a random one, and abandoned that account too.",

It better he open a new account since he's a newbie.It's one of bonus when you donate 50 BTC to the forum. It should not be a reason for your donation.I believe the admins have strong reasons to not allow users change username easily. It can result in more scams when scammers can change usernames around. Not only in the forum but also in other platforms, if they allow users to change account usersnames, it should be only one chance, after you create your account and is given a random name. After you change it once, no more change to change it. Same reasons, to avoid scam exploitation.",

Your problem (and most others') is that you don't consider Bitcoin a currency, which is its primary function, and people who once paid 50 BTC or 10 000 BTC were obviously not in it all just for profit.If in 10 years 1 BTC will be worth xx times more, does it make sense to pay anything with it today, or will we also be classified as unreasonable people because we didn't know how to save what is valuable?",

According the the admin, the forum can operate conveniently with the revenue generated and doesn't need more money.The only way now to change one's display name is by making a formal request to the admin. Fom the accepted requests, it needs to be for a salient reason before it gets considered, so you can't just ask for a name change, cause you like a new name.",

Now imagine you been used to a particular user, certified to be trusted and then, the user changes there name. Same goes to tagged users.

The donations in the past was possible because of the relatively low prices for bitcoin but now it's way too much to acquire that VIP tag anc custom title and if you want to see the past donators you can see them here  Having multiple accounts on forum is allowed but following the forum guidelines that they must not violate any rule is important so tell him about this also.There have been some instances where users have edited their username on the forum without donation and that's only by convincing @theymos with a valid reason like this one :Changed username from Coolcryptovator to COOLCRYPTOVATORSo you can try but don't think it will help a newbie account and it's needed at all.",
