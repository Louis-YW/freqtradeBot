  "content": "After the recent FTX dilemma, we need to rethink on our decision to keep our funds at exchanges at all or not. All this has actually impacted the markets' trading volume a lot already, which shows that traders are not interesting in trading too much and they are taking out their money at non-custodial wallets. I came across a news that says:'A third-party vendor linked to the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange has suffered a data breach. The breach happened on or before December 13. The hackers gained access to 5,701,649 lines of information associated with the Gemini exchange customers. The obtained details include the email addresses and some of the phone numbers of these customers.' More available at sourceThis shows that sometimes, even not being guilty, the place where we put our trust and money may get compromised due to the services it is using or attached to, same as in this case where Gemini was not at fault but the third party vendor got hacked and there was a huge data breach of that exchange. Should we worry on every small aspect now that we know that these places are also vulnerable to get attacked not directly but indirectly through the services or various other departments they are involved with?",

Only submit your personal information to a central service only when totally necessary. This applies to platforms inside and outside the cryptocurrency space.https://cryptosec.info/exchange-hacks",

The threat is clear from outsiders and sometimes insiders. Should you be worried? It also depends on your concern for the valuable things above.Let's just say this concern is bound to happen given that no system is truly secure, it's only a matter of time. Use them when you really \"have to\", not just when you \"can to\".",

We don't know what they are doing with our data, do we? How do you know that Gemini didn't sell the database? When you are submitting your data to 3rd party, you are making a reason to be worried.Quote from: 2double0 on December 15, 2022, 01:46:11 PMAfter the recent FTX dilemma, we need to rethink on our decision to keep our funds at exchanges at all or not.This was always the same; why only after the FTX dilemma, we have to rethink?

A hack in the exchange's hot wallet could happen anytime. Or the malicious intention could come from the inside itself. Users' funds could have been risked elsewhere and lost. And then there's also mismanagement. Or a trusted staff could have leaked vital information leading to a successful breach. Since there are also third parties involved, the attack or failure could also come from them. In other words, there are a hundred possible ways that a centralized exchange could collapse anytime.",

Am I the only one wishing that the top exchanges in the industry are all DEX but is unlikely to happen because investors are into so many coins and the lack of liquidity makes them turn to centralized exchanges because these centralized exchanges are good at manipulating the price and adding liquidity to attract users to trade on their platform, we either choose DEX or there should be regulation that will monitor the behavior of these centralized exchanges.A centralized exchange is a necessary evil in this industry whether we like it or not.",

But are we really going to suffer due to this then the answer is not if you know what you're doing whether it comes to internet so you can get rid of phishing attacks and most commonly known threats. But one who really want their privacy at top priority should never ever disclose any personal data to others even its highly popular and trusted exchange.",

The exchange would even exempt themselves from any wrongdoing because it was a breach of their system that was beyond their control.If an exchange platform files for bankruptcy, information about the exchange is made public to the court, some of these information includes users private data, it happened when Celsius filed for bankrptcy some months ago, that is the extent to which centralized exchanges carry a privacy risk, because there are many ways your data can be exposed to the public.",

Their database is not secure and can easily get accessed once the exchange is hacked. I don't see any difference, CEX is 100 percent operating like the banks.

What i always said is that as a smart user over here, if you are not trading or converting your to fiat or from fiat to cryptocurrency don't leave your funds on exchange.
