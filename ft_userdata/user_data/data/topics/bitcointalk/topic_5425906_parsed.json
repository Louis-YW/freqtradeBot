I have been maintaining my selling thread on Bitcointalk since from 2019 with 100% positive feedback vouches from members,moonyjope demolish my reputation without any reason, proof/evidence, so due to these bad words and statements from him, my all efforts went into the vein, to sustain and maintained my credibility on the Bitcointalk as a seller or member. I cannot remove his comment (which is posted in my thread), so please kindly take some action or issue him warning, if he has some legit proof against me, please show the proof in the front of whole community, but if there is no proof against me, why did he spoil my thread with non sense argument. I request please take some serious action or notice because in future, no one can spoil the reputation of credible and reputed member without any proof or evidence.Proof of my credibility:1. moonyjope don't buy anything from me.

I challenge moonyjope, if he shows single proof/evidence of my scamming, I will delete my selling thread and stop selling.Real Face of moonyjope:1. He is writing the same word scamming on each and every seller almost.Read here: https://i.imgur.com/U4wuZSM.png2.

I can understand that you are upset, but if you are a legit seller this shouldn't bother you much as so far its nothing but a piss in the wind.

No , Don't worry Palnica89, I will try my best to reveal more you. You have many vpn services like Windscribe. NordVPN, and plenty of others to hide your face.",

I hope I answer the questionFirst of all, Please notice 1 thing. Palinca89 is not fool guy who can use same email of (steamproject) Scalapota2@gmail.com on Palinca89 selling thread of Bitcointalk, because he already have red flag on steamproject (Scalapota2@gmail.com) which was given by hilariousandco Global moderator (Alt of marius aka steamproject aka tberty aka Dorkslayz who uses an army of dozens of alts to fake vouch or spam bump his threads of hacked torrent invites.

So he created new email of Palinca89@protonmail.com for his new selling thread on Bitcointalk, but on Facebook, he was using that email scalapota2@gmail.com in 2021, because he loved that email and forget to remove this old post, he can't even dream it, somebody will catch him like that.",

My above discussion was about Palinca89 and steamproject, because he was asking for proof in above post.Buddy, I tried my best to reveal at least Palinca89 is the same guy steamproject (Scalapota2@gmail.com), For moonyjope it's not really hard to understand for us, he is spreading fake news about every seller is scammer (except Palinca89), so that shitty guy should be ban/red flag for behaving like that.As you said earlier, moonyjope and Palinca89 both are on the same Romanian local board, why this happens you know? Because this Scalapota2 is from Romania. Earlier you said to me, My evidence is little flimy, but yeah if you think deeply you can understand my point that, all these Palinca89, moonyjope, Scalapota2 are interlinked with these things, tell me who write like that kind of words? ( , ) means Space,SpaceCheck common things between all these moonyjope, Palinca89, Torrent Invites (Scalapota2@gmail.com)Torrent Invites: https://i.imgur.com/pGSVbAe.pngmoonyjope: https://i.imgur.com/XAc6FPy.pngPalinca89: https://i.imgur.com/itj2sYs.pngmoonyjope is obviously not using same email of Scalapota2@gmail.com, Palinca89@protonmail.com, So I think it would be hard to find email connection between this shitty user, because he is much clever. but I caught him on several points by providing several proofs, I tried my best to reveal, I already wasted much of my time on this disgusting guy.",
