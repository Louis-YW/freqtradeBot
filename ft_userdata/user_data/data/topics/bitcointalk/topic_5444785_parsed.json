I tittle it a pyramids scaling price because today is at $24k and tomorrow it will returns to $23k but the pyramids will vanish soon for overflow tanks and ocean price.I think the right term here is \"volatility\",QuoteDefinitionVolatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset has moved up or down over time. Generally, the more volatile an asset is, the riskier it’s considered to be as an investment — and the more potential it has to offer either higher returns or higher losses over shorter periods of time than comparatively less volatile assets.https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-volatilityAnd this what separates newbies from those who have seen a lot of ups and downs throughout bitcoin's history. I would advise you not to check the price like every hour or even every day.The price will fluctuate no matter what, it's either you take advantage of it, like in the last couple of days ago, the price goes below $20k. And if you bought around that price then you might have profited by today as it is above $24k now.",

Because they are not the same in any way. LolWhile the trading with enough skills could yield even daily profits( with a risk of loss as well of course ), for a long term profit you need to do that \"holding for long\", otherwise there is no room for you in crypto as an investor, if you want profit, go learn day trading but be ready for +50% losses in a day as well, since day trading is the same as gambling.",

Regardless of what you have heard about it and pyramids, I guess you should start learning about the coin afresh, and you would realize that it's nothing like a pyramid.Bitcoin is an asset, it's listed and its price fluctuates like any other listed valuable asset, so nothing like a pyramid here but a market practice that is being adjusted by conditions and prevailing market sentiment.However, if anyhow is introducing you to a pyramid scheme in the name of Bitcoin, my brother, flee, they will scam you.",

You have to keep it simple and you will don't have to fight against the market.Buy Bitcoin, hodl it and don't complicate your chart reading too much. Zoom out to have very wide view and you will have a long term vision for your investment. Pyramid pattern, what edge is not matter with you. Those things are for daily traders who are mostly losers not winners in the market.Learn about Psychology market cycles",

Bitcoin INVESTMENT should be for the long term however if you really think you are good at trading then take a go at it but until you understand HODLing will give you less worry, you will continue to wake up to that feeling at least for now.",

      "body": "According to a data (by Kaiko)[1], the bitcoin market depth on the top exchanges has hit its lowest level since may 2022. This resulted in rapid fluctuations because ppl are more interested in market buying/selling rather than increasing the depth of orderbook by putting limit orders. Also the USDC and svb tension got added to the volatility which is why we saw a straight dump to under 20k then shot back up due to forced buying pressure ( institutions and even exchanges themselves converting their large portion of stables into BTC).But dont worry, its just one side of BTC, it will again get stable somewhere and give us another chance to think.  Btw, I see ppl complaining more during times of silence by btc lol. You must be excited that btc is moving like this. Easy trades in between.[1]",

However, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"deep strategy\" changing prices.Pyramid sounds like pyramid, Ponzi scheme.Bitcoin has its up trend since 2009 and I don't see pyramid on its chart. Yearly price is very bullish.See https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/stats/yearly-candles/Pyramid? No, it is parabolic.",
