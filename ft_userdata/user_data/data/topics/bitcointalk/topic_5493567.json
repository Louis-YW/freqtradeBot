Therefore, even if the price dump occurs, traders will not lose much and may compensate for their loss before the end of the world.In the last week, Bitcoin dives to price from $59,000 to $60,000 many times and if people did not buy these dips, they only can look at themselves and analyze why they hesitated to buy cheap bitcoins.If they want to invest in Bitcoin and get profit, if they believe Bitcoin will make $100,000 or higher, price around $60,000 is very good for entry. Now, they still have chance to do that, from $60,000 to $64,000, it's not too much different and does not mean too much to bargain $4,000 in price if they can earn like $30,000 or $40,000 in profit if Bitcoin hits $100,000.",

I think the only ones who hold bitcoin would be those people who have lots of money and where those who doesn't have must be forced to sell because if they won't then they will lose some of their money just for the fees itself. I would do the same as those people because I won't be able to afford the fee and won't have any bitcoin left at all when transferring to another wallet.",

Some miners will be completely cut off due to the huge fees required to buy the equipment and keep it running with extreme low electricity costs.Currently there will be $30M in less BTC added daily at the current prices. If bitcoin doubles that will be able $60M, so it will make a difference overall. The less people that are selling means that there is less resistance. But you get caught up in the hype and expect it to pump right after the halving. Could take months and months. Right now BTC and most risk-on markets have too much geopolitcal risks like we saw twice in the last 7 days.",

And even though this is very small in terms of price correction percentage, you also have to accept the fact that Bitcoin is getting stronger at this time and is also quite different from before.",
