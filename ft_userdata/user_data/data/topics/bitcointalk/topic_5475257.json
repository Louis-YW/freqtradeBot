  "content": "So I intend to invest 20k in a few cryptos. I'm located in Belgium and I am currently looking up information about taxation on crypto profits.It looks like our government is changing tax declaration forms, with a subdivision \"diverse holdings\" in which these have to be declared.The Belgian government developed 3 categories of speculators, and the way we are treated depends on the category in which we fall.1) amateur2) occasional trader3) professional traderObviously the government has made vague, subjective guidelines to categorize us such as \"not taking many risks\" and \"doing it as a hobby\".It says that category 1 are long term holders who don't trade a lot.Category 2 has to declare crypto holdings on the tax sheet and is exposed to a 33% tax (!!!) upon any withdrawal.Category 3 are people who mainly trade for a living and they are taxed 50% (!!!) upon withdrawals. They are also forced to pay other taxes for health insurance. I'm in this category with my regular job and about 60% of my gross wage vanishes in taxes.This kind of wealth confiscation reminds me of my time as an online poker player.Governments want a huge cut of withdrawals, but they give you 0 compensation on losses.It is simply not possible to become profitable with such a system and it is not fair.This withdrawn money serves to reinvest later, but we can't do that if each withdrawal is taxed. Imagine that BTC goes up 10x and then a crash is expected. I have to withdraw but can't leave money on the exchange (all of them in legal fights). I can't withdraw to a bank because it leads to enormous taxation. Is there any way to preserve profits without withdrawing to any bank? For example by buying other assets directly in BTC and not declaring them (jewelry). I think that this is legal.I'm concerned that simply because of the amount I wish to invest, I will not be seen as an amateur. While in reality I am. Governments obviously want to put us in category 2 and 3. An option I thought about is to make a crypto account for my wife, who is Brazilian. Brazil has lower taxes on crypto withdrawals.",

Tax people who've been in the industry for so long but make it so vague that people wouldn't have the slightest clue what it means to be a category three trader in Belgium? What an utter joke. The first thing you should make sure, when proposing a new ordinance or a law is to make sure that no one misconstrues it, so as to not make people liable for violating it get away under vague grounds. Not that taxing people for crypto usage is a massive movement in the first place, but it just grinds my gears that they propose such a particular law under super vague terms. It's frustrating honestly.",

In as much as I do not support shitcoins or other cryptocurrencies I will still make a suggestion that can help you in this kind of situation. Your idea of using your wife's identity from another country might also be good for you if only it will work but if it may not be successful you can consider diversifying your bitcoin instead of losing when the price is bearish, can withdraw you profits into stable coins like usdt or any other coin that is attached to the price of a currency. This method you can be quite safe from government taxation for the time being.",

The taxing system varies for each countries I believe, because it would be quite a serious business and more people will prefer to just stick to the traditional white collar jobs, instead of seeking for an alternative source of income or probably mainstream income in trading or HoDling BTC.",

It's frustrating honestly. I know this same system from when I played online poker (about 12 years ago) and it is the reason why I never got involved before.I was interested with BTC at $200 and of course I regret not getting involved. But I always knew that eventually this would happen. I just expected it sooner.I'm also self employed (health care) and the fear of all of us is getting a visit from a tax inspector. We're supposed to keep all files regarding tax returns of the last 3 years, and if you get a visit of them they are guaranteed to find something to make you pay. And we are already one of the most heavily taxed countries on earth.Getting involved with crypto is probably like sending an open invitation (through the bank, who will flag us) to have a tax inspector come over and rob us for every euro they can. I just don't see how they can verify exactly which cryptos we hold, because we take them off of the exchange into cold storage. My goal was always to keep all profits out of the banking sector. Because it will inevitably lead to confiscation.",

I guess those people in your local that does the same have been doing some things that can be suggested to you.We are a socialist nation. Free stuff for everyone at the cost of enormous taxes. 60% of my gross (pre tax) wage vanishes in 1) rent to the owner of the building in which I work, 2) income tax and 3) social contribution which is another tax, specifically for health care plans. Basically we don't work for ourselves. I always enjoyed the quality education here but I can make more money in much less taxed countries. An osteopath in the USA makes 4 to 5 times more per year. I think I'd be welcome there, with a green card.Belgium was always seen as a good example of the world's wealthiest middle class through socialism. But this is because of huge tax collection + the fact that our government has spent so much money that debt vs GDP has spiralled out of control (107%). We are now at the point where inflation is so bad that we can't afford to live this way anymore. Far too many people exploited the system with unlimited unemployment benefits. The end of that road is near.Keep in mind that banks hate crypto. Fighting back with huge taxes serves at least 2 goals:1) It discourages people to leave their fake money system2) Governments get a huge cut",
