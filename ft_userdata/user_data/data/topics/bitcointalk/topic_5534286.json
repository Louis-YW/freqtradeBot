Well first and foremost to answer your question,(NO). Basically for any coin to become a threat to Bitcoin it means it has to beat the Bitcoin network which is going to be near impossible to happen. The strength of the bitcoin network is unmatched by any other ranging from value, to Blockchain security to even supply and circulation. To put it into perspective the Bitcoin network is unique. In addition to all these it actually has more enthusiastic investors and more adopters than every other cryptocurrency. I think it's even safer to say bitcoin is the only coin with a creator without a core drive of profit",

Because when you look at the altcoin market, they seem like a mess, a place for gambling, speculation...instead of focusing on building products with use cases, real applications...like bitcoin. The purpose of creating bitcoin and altcoins is very different and that may be why bitcoin is the most trusted and secure coin on the market.",

Why you still can't see a competition? Bitcoin has the first mover advantage and a huge base of supporters. However, if many governments start adding Bitcoin to their reserve, then I foresee Bitcoin becoming too centralized. That may drive out some people from Bitcoin. But that has nothing to do with other cryptos.",

If that is what you are think then you are wrong. No altcoin is a threat to Bitcoin not even altcoins that are under the Bitcoin blockchain network. It will be a crime to compare Bitcoin to other altcoin talk more of saying an altcoin is a threat to Bitcoin. Did you see how altcoins were shaking when Bitcoin price dropped these few days. Every single movement Bitcoin made has been affecting altcoins in general. So you see Bitcoin controls the market that means it is a threat to other altcoins because it can displace any altcoin anytime any day.",

Some altcoins have received attacks from the government and some of them rightfully so.

More ironically, those altcoins killed themselves and died with time without any threat from Bitcoin.The market is a fair referee and can help you to assess this fact very transparently and correctly. Altcoins died, even top altcoins and they did not die because of any pressure or competitiveness from Bitcoin. Main reasons are altcoin projects are zero or low quality, and their founders mostly abandoned their projects after months or years.Ethereum lost its value in ETH/BTC pair, and it's not a threat to Bitcoin.Don't buy altcoins because they are top altcoins.",
