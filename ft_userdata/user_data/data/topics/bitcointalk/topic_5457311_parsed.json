  "content": "Hey All,Question on a Makers and Takers fees as apparently I'm missing something. I'm trading on Bybit Derivatives Perpetual, mostly using Market prices meaning (per my understanding) I'm Taker. I use relatively small amounts and I've notice my PNL after transaction is done significantly differs from the one I see on the Trading view when closing transaction. Sometimes I see like 2 $ profit and after Market order to sell in order history I see 0.20$ PNL. I thought this is % base and according to Bybit it's Taker Fee: Order Value × Taker Fee Rate (0.06%) so should not be that much of a difference.  Yes I also know that it also depends on the price by which the order was filled in, but still I'm puzzled by % difference. Also Bybit Order history page which shows only basic info on sell  from top menu Orders -> Unified Trading Account -> USDT Perpetual  does not show transaction fee amounts, or am I missing something ?Thanks for your advicesM",

Here is an example of buy and sell order 0.06% fee on bybit account:You can see the fee paid. Assuming the fee charged is 0.06% and you opened a position, the fee would be deducted. Did you know that another fee would be deducted for closing position? You have to calculate the fee for opening and closing position. You can take advantage of the market maker fee which is 0.01% for closing position. You can do that by setting take profit at a particular price. Also stop loss will make the position close as a market maker. Instead of closing it yourself at a market price. But the choice is yours as a scalp trader.",

Better yet  re-calculate your trading history with their fee calculation formula.",

Additionally this must add to the impression \"unrealized P&L does not include trading fee and funding fee but closed P&L (realized) does, that is why losses = bigger losses, profits = lesser profits. \"BTW @oorman0  - I'm impressed how fast you have found this old tweet Thanks again",

When your order is executed you will pay a fee and if you close your order you will aso pay a fee. Meaning you have to pay for fee twice when you trade. That's why if you're consistent in losing, your funds will be disappear very quickly. In this case, I would check the crypto that cost a higher fees in the trading history and I will try to avoid trading with them in the future.",

Without these fees exchanger won’t even survive for few weeks or months may be depending on how much owner is willing to pay through their pockets. Lol. These fees will get as high as you could imagine when you start futures and options, staking, derivatives etc. Imagine how much they must be earning with this. Binance 24 hour volume stays around $9,027,807,078 and they take anywhere between 0.01% to 0.50% in fees on every trade (maker and taker). You can reduce the fees by owning the exchangers token. Most of them have it as utility for you. Just research and save more out of it.",

If the taker fee is 0.02%, you must charge 0.02% for all trading pairs, and the same is true for the maker fee. However, the charge is based on the cryptocurrency you're trading rather than USDT, which is why there are times when the fee is extremely high if you convert, particularly when there is network congestion. That was true when I was still dealing in Ethereum.",

The fees depends on the platform, spread for ask/bid price relative to the order value. So preferably, instead of paying fees for makers/takers, you can instead do leave a limit sell or buy orders.",
