  "content": "They say the ETH Spot ETF won't pass because Wall Street firms don't know how to solve the staking reward problem... The SEC could say no for many reasons, but staking is definitely not one of them, as none of the proposals mention staking at all.When I was in school, everyone was encouraged to read the Wall Street Journal because it showed that I was an intellectual. Now, why do you read the Wall Street Journal? Don't you have Google at home to verify information? Why does the Wall Street Journal hate crypto so much?FUD to collect goods  . What's interesting is that some crypto fans like to share false information about other chains, as long as it benefits them...As the saying goes, if you put 100 black ants and 100 red ants in a jar and then shake the jar, they will start fighting.Never forget that the real enemy is not another type of ant but the person shaking the jar.",

      "body": "I understand you are worry about the Wall Street Journal and how they talking about crypto. It is important to be careful when reading these kind of news and check information from different places like Google. Some news sources may have their own opinions so it is good to know the facts and not what they think. Some people who like crypto can spread fear and doubt to trick others for their own benefit which not good. Your analogy about ants in a jar is interesting because it remind us to be careful of people who try to create problems for their own gain.",

      "body": "Staking is a gray area, as SEC will find issues, they did the same with Bitcoin ETF which is POW. Not every article can be doomed and considered as a FUD. It is a genuine problem and it is not that easy to get an ETF of Ethereum, when the SEC is still struggling with Bitcoin ETFs that work on POW. Ethereum ETF would happen after Bitcoin ETF. After the Bitcoin ETF gets approved consider such problems as a welcome signal. In the end it might take time and eventually it would be okayed by the SEC.",
