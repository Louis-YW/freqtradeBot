      "body": "I agree with the saying that the higher the liquidity, the higher the volatility. Bitcoin is only possible to undergo all the price change at the speed it is because it’s liquid, hence it’s easy to cash it out. But what if the liquidity was reduced to half or even quarter of what it is currently? I think because of that, the price shouldn’t see any significant changes compared to when the liquidity is normal. However, in as much as Bitcoin has good liquidity, the volatility doesn’t show as much as most other cryptocurrencies.",

Yes, they are liquid but not necessarily non-volatile. Can I, therefore, conclude that the higher the liquidity of an asset, the higher its volatility?Quick question, does Bitcoin have more liquidity than the Forex market? I know your answer is No so why then do you think the more liquidity of an asset, the higher the volatility?. When there's more liquidity the market tends to be less volatile that's why the Forex market is less volatile than that of Bitcoin. Volatility comes from a market that can be easily manipulate like the crypto market (in this discussion, Bitcoin market). There are other factors that's making Bitcoin volatile which lack of regulation is one of them and that the assets is still a new one (having less traders as other market). There are some amount of trade that if they're carried out on exchanges, the exchange won't have the liquidity to handle them and would cause a force maintenance for the exchange. Volatility of Bitcoin comes from the fact that Bitcoin is a free market so irrespective of the liquidity, the market will be volatile for that reasons but as more liquidity and institutional investors comes into the industry, the price would begin to be more stable than it usually is. When there's no liquidity that's why an asset can be manipulated and it becomes more volatile so don't think high liquidity equals to more volatility, it's the other way around.",

When liquidity is high, meaning there are many buyers and sellers, it tends to dampen volatility as it’s easier to execute trades without significantly impacting prices. Low liquidity often leads to higher volatility as even small trades can have a larger impact on prices. Other things can also influence volatility like market sentiment, economic events & geopolitical factors.",

Another one was that I was tracking one newly listed coin on Binance some weeks ago, and when I saw the coin, it only had a $44 million dollar liquity and was trading around $0.02. Later the next day, I saw that for that same coin, the liquidity was $150+ million and it was trading around $0.58.What I know is that Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency is a much more volatile asset than gold, real estate, and other businesses that you have mentioned. The crypto market is only and takes place at the same time by different calibers of people (whales are also involved), and demand is high, but since gold and real estate are done more traditionally, I feel it's very slow compared to the cryptocurrency market, and that's because crypto is more volatile and liquidity has an influence on the volatile nature.",

The higher liquidity means the lower the volatility since the big sell and buy pressure can be absorbed by the available liquidity without resulting a huge price impact. DEX is the best example on this case since it decentralized, The higher the liquidity pool is the lower volatility happening on a certain token assuming that price action on CEX is excluded.The reason why crypto is too volatile despite we have huge liquidity is because CEX manipulating the price with their automated market maker. It reacts to the price trend happening across all exchange and create an order accordingly.",

Can I, therefore, conclude that the higher the liquidity of an asset, the higher its volatility?It's very easy to explain volatility and liquidity using bitcoin. Sometimes, it's possible that the bitcoin market will experience low volatility but you will still get high liquidity but the liquidity is dependent on how large the quantity of the bitcoin you have in your possession. With 100, it will be very to easily converted all that into other currency like usdt or any other type of stable coins but if an institutional investors want to convert there bitcoin into cash, it will be very difficult. Just like Microstrategy btc, even if the bitcoin volatility are high, it's impossible for such bitcoin to be liquid in a single transaction because the market is still young.However, the market is better and more liquid of bitcoin to other altcoins, there are some altcoins even with high volatility, you will get nothing but zero value, if you even attempt to liquidate assets from such altcoins, the project will die immediately with -99% without a second thought. This is one of the challenges of investing in altcoins, they don't have much liquidity to handle sells pressure.",

I think they are two different concepts in crypto and finance but you can understand both if them side by side.Basically liquidity is how easy you can turn it into cash and that doesn't automatically mean it's a rollercoaster in value or volatile. Take Bitcoin that is super easy to sell that makes it liquid but it can be all over the place in terms of price then volatile.",

Yes, more liquidity leads to higher volatility, but only if the asset is scarce and the supply of that asset is limited. If Bitcoin was abundant on the markets(which is the opposite of scarce) the BTC volatility would be way lower, even though there's enough market liquidity.There's an army of BTC HODLers, who help in keeping the BTC price high(because they don't sell their BTC). The Bitcoin price would collapse, if they decide to mass sell everything they have. I can't agree that Bitcoin market liquidity exists on the same level 24/7. I think that the liquidity is closely connected to the market demand for BTC.Sometimes, there's higher liquidity and there are periods when the market liquidity goes down.",

But in my opinion, the only essential factor that would really decide whether a crypto is \"volatile\" or not is whether it's designed to be that way, lapses on the coding, etc., or not. Take bitcoin for example. Its 21 million supply should in theory not induce some sort of volatility, I mean for crying out loud the amount's pretty low for a global currency in the first place, but Satoshi forgot, or perhaps deliberately made it so that bitcoin's allowed some form of volatility for profit. until it snowballed into this billion-dollar industry that we're now enjoying every single penny out of.

For example, BTC no doubt has high liquidity and high volatility but USD dollars or any other forex token also have high liquidity but they are not so volatile. I hope this will be of some help. If still not then try to think of it from another angle.Which is, when BTC has high liquidity it means the trades can be made seamlessly without any stop, it means one can sell 100 BTC even if there are no 100 BTC buyers at the other hand due to the liquidity pools of exchanges. And when that happens the demand and supply ratio is disturbed. Like when 100 BTC is sold and the buying pressure is lower then there will be more supply than demand and we all know BTC prices make changes based on demand and supply as it is a decentralized coin.Therefore, high liquidity might mean high volatility in terms of BTC but for stocks and forex, it might not be so true.",

      "body": "IMO, yes. Liquidity and volatility are connected, and I believe they can be divided into three categories in general view(my opinion).# Low liquidity (i can say frozen) usually involves small transaction volumes, and asset owners may struggle to sell their assets due to a lack of interest from market and buyer. During periods of low liquidity, there are typically no significant price changes as investors are skeptical about its developments that still baby. This often occurs in the early stages when an asset enters unpopular exchanges (e.g in the crypto world).# Medium liquidity involves a decent transaction volume but not a substantial one. Selling assets is relatively easy, but the moderate volume contributes to heightened volatility. I think this stage to have the highest volatility. This is usually a transitional phase where many significant investors begin to notice the asset. Some have already entered the market, while others are monitoring its movements.# High liquidity (more liquid) , on the other hand, involves very high transaction volumes and people easy to convert their assets. Even large quantities of assets cannot significantly impact prices. Volatility decreases, and it takes longer for significant price changes to occur. This stage is characterized by stability and is reached when an asset has gained widespread recognition and acceptance.Exactly, in my personal view, it's the medium liquidity level that makes an asset more volatile. This is because, at this stage, there is a decent transaction volume, making it relatively easy to sell assets. However, the moderate volume contributes to increased volatility, making price movements more erratic and unpredictable.",
