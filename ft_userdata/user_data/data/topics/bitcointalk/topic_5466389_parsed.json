I want to know. Online and offline casinos certainly create different gambling experience. With online, you will have more convenience playing with your favorite games at the comfort of your home or wherever you are. There are more variety of games listed and there are higher number of rewards and promotions that you can receive. However, with offline casinos, what you will gained is definitely an authentic experience. What you see is what you get. Though there are less variety of games compared to online, but the experience is still worthwhile. And if you prefer to mostly engage with physical casinos, the chances to be scam is very rare compared to the scam cases that are so rampant in online.",

Gambling is legal in my country but land based casinos are located in highly developed cities. That makes land based casinos not to be for everyone for frequent accessing.Only what that is required for you to access online casinos is just a good device like phone, tablet or computer.Quote from: Tuturtinular on September 11, 2023, 09:15:10 AMDo you have experience playing at real casinos and online gambling sites?

But if you want privacy, you may not like it. It is a light inside a dark room that may not let you know fast that time has gone or that it is night already. And you can drink so that you can waste money more on gambling if you are not determined enough to discipline yourself.",

But maybe when we invite friends to play at a real casino, maybe the winnings we get will be used up to party with them. And coming home without any money, does something like that happen often? but it's a fun way to relieve the boredom of work. In contrast to playing at online casinos, I always play alone and lament my fate alone if I lose, and that is very bad for my mental healthQuote from: Queentoshi on September 11, 2023, 10:10:14 AMPlayed on a slot machine once while I was out with friends, and from this forum, I have visited a few online casinos and even registered just to see how these websites function.

Yes, I agree with you, playing online gambling is easier to get addicted because deposits are easy. Just use mobile banking and we can immediately start gambling, as you said, it is the ease of playing on online gambling sites that makes gambling addiction difficult to stop.",

I think what you'll notice first is the ambiance of the real on site casinos. The sounds are tremendous and they're encouraging to gamble more and well, there's a psychology behind so that you'll be excited and wanting to gamble more.Your adrenaline is really the target of the ambiance of the on site casinos and that's no doubt why many gamblers are hooked with it. But if you're just like the chill gambler, sitting while being at home is also a gold experience as you gamble.",

Even though offline casinos are hidden, their existence will still be discovered and then closed, but in online casinos, even though the government prohibits it, everyone can still gamble with a VPN.I think people nowadays are turning more towards online casinos because as time goes by, offline casinos are not very popular now, especially in today's increasingly modern digital world, I guarantee that because I see a lot of offline casinos nowadays are quiet because most people people are turning to online casinos and they are easier to use just using a cell phone, but besides always remembering whatever the differences between the two, gamble wisely and responsibly so that you don't become addicted.",

So for that,  even though gambling is illegal or legal in your jurisdictions you still have the chance to gamble with any test of a physical casino, In my country gambling is not banned but the presence of a of physical casinos is almost zero and that shows how gamblers value privacy in my country.",

I want to know.in online casinos you can carry out your gambling activities while lying down or in the toilet, but in physical casinos you have to be there and chat with other people, of course the experience is different, here some offline casinos sometimes give bonuses to players (day-to-day events certain) if there is a cigarette or drink sponsor then all players at the offline casino will be given a bonus but with the terms and conditions they apply.but the thing that i really don't like in offline casinos, we often deal with damn/shit people, they always ask for a little part when we win, ask for our cigarettes and sometimes borrow money, even so you have to be smart to get away from them, well they are all i mention that it is a toxic gamblers type that is always present in every offline casino.",

You can hold the slot machine for real, while in online casinos, you cannot hold it for real and only see the images spinning.Apart from that, to play in a real casino, you need to bring money from home to exchange for chips provided by the casino and then you can gamble.
