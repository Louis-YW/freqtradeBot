I just want to know to do things right.You should use strong and unique password for our forum account that was never used before.Maybe think about using new email account have 2fa protection that is connected only with bitcointalk account and nothing else.Never click on any links you receive in forum messages, that is one of the main phishing attacks, and sign a message with Bitcoin address to prove your ownership.Doing this will be enough to protect you account, but you can also limit IP addresses in settings if you want to go hard core (I don't suggest doing that).",

      "body": "Other than signing an address, and having it either publicly posted or personal messaged to a forum controlled account. Then, it's pretty simple; randomly generated password, which is backed up locally. Just like you would with a Bitcoin wallet. Then, a secure email; one that you owe is actually better than relying on a service that might not be around all the time, and having that email secured by another password which is entirely different from your forum password. Again, generated randomly, and backed up locally. That will prevent most direct attacks, then it's just keeping your wits about you, and avoiding social engineering attacks. If the forum database got breached, the passwords would be hashed, and having a complex enough password would mean you're pretty safe right after learning that it's been breached, and you could just change the passwords to something else, which would effectively make that compromised database useless. Honestly, you can't really go wrong much from there.",

I just want to know to do things right.So you have links to various sources pointing out how to recover your forum account if it gets hacked by any chance like you have to sign a message to verify your account and email you use to registered on the forum so you can have a detailed look at them first of all to understand it clearly.I would also say that if possible don't enable a always stay logged in because by any chance if you lost your device where you have done it and if gone to some wrong hands they can misuse your account so be sure about it.But also follow the useful advice given to you like following the original link which you can bookmark and login safely.",
