      "body": "Anonymity Mining campaign is live!What is Anonymity Mining, how does it work and why is it needed?In order to achieve privacy, Whirlwind uses a multi-sig that acts as a pool and consolidates all deposited Bitcoin. Once funds are withdrawn by a completely new address from this pool, the on-chain link between the source and destination is severed, thus anonymising the withdrawn Bitcoin.The goal of this pattern is to aggregate different deposits into a single pool, such that distinguishing between them becomes unfeasible. The only factor to keep in mind is that this pattern is useless if there are not many deposits of varying sizes, such that the set of probable suspects is too small. We aim to overcome this issue by launching the Anonymity Mining campaign. The more people use Whirlwind, the more secure it becomes for everyone. We will consider the bootstrapping phase over when the Anonymity Set crosses 10,000 deposits.Anonymity mining is an incentive to increase the level of privacy Whirlwind offers by rewarding participants with Bitcoin dependent on the deposited amount and how long they keep their assets in the pool. The campaign will run for a limited time until the Anonymity Set hits 10,000 deposits and it will be structured in the following way: In return for increasing the Anonymity Set Whirlwind rewards all funded Notes with 1% monthly interest on their balance. The rewards will be paid out automatically on a daily basis and they are withdrawable anytime. All you need to do in order to participate in the campaign is make a deposit and wait for as long as you want to accrue rewards before withdrawing.Example: If the multi-sig’s average balance during a month is 100BTC Whirlwind will pay out 1BTC in rewards during that month on a daily basis. 1BTC/30 days = 0.03333BTC paid out daily. If you have a Note with a balance of 1BTC you will receive 1% of 0.03333BTC which is 0.000333BTC every day.It’s important to emphasize that the rewards will be paid out from our personal reserve and only for a limited amount of time until the Anonymity set passes the 10,000 deposits threshold, at which point incentives won’t be needed anymore. We will monitor the progress and make adjustments if needed.",

Please keep in mind that we are not using cloudflare/ddos guard and never will since we believe it's inappropriate for a platform of this type (regardless if we assume the end-user takes proper security precautions), so the clearnet link may be down at times. We implemented a custom protection, but there is only so much you can do without a CDN. If the clearnet link is unavailable please use the Tor version, there shouldn't be any issues with that at any point unless we announce maintenance beforehand.Quote from: MusaMohamed on March 28, 2023, 02:49:55 AMI checked your website with onion site. You have two options to select the deposit type: Fast and Note.With Fast option, there is a Receiver's BTC address. Why not implement it similarly as with Note. May you explain about it, differences between Fast and Note options and why only with Fast option, there is an entry box for Receiver's BTC address. Can both use same method as Note?With receiver's BTC address and user login data (I guess your platform will store that data before one mixing is completed and even after that), it can be a risk factor for user privacy.With Fast mode you select all parameters (receiver BTC address, delay, % distribution for each receiver address) from the beginning, and once you send BTC to our address the system will automatically distribute the BTC according to your inputs without requiring any further action from your side.With Note mode you only need to send BTC to our address, and then at any point in time later you can go to \"Withdraw Note\", select all parameters (receiver BTC address, delay, % distribution for each receiver address) and then the system will automatically distribute the BTC according to your inputs.We recommend using Note mode because it's more versatile and it helps strenghten the privacy set for the whole mixer. Our competitors only offer a fixed maximum delay (<200 hours) from the moment you deposited to the outgoing transaction, and that makes it easier to track addresses using blockchain analysis. Also with our competitors as far as I am aware it's not possible to have outputs bigger than inputs, which again makes it easier to track things. We don't have these limitations thanks to the Note mode, there is no \"expiration date\" and you can combine 2 or more Notes to add up their balances together (for example you can deposit 0.1BTC from an address, 0.1BTC from another address, combine the notes, and then withdraw 0.2BTC to a new address.) With these additions from blockchain analysis perspective any outgoing transaction from Whirlwind could have originated from any deposit to Whirlwind, so the privacy will only become stronger as time goes on.Quote from: SatoPrincess on March 28, 2023, 07:47:03 AMI love the simplicity of the website. I would like if there was more information in the FAQ like is there a minimum deposit amount? What’s the log policy? I will be checking for future updates and I hope this mixer can build a good reputation in this bitcoin community.Minimum deposit is 0.001BTCFor Fast mode we keep logs for the first 24 hours (while the deposit address is active), after those hours pass everything is deleted. Even if your outgoing transaction exceeds the 24 hour period, we only know where to send the BTC, but not where they came from.For Note mode we only keep the public key and the amount, nothing about where the deposit originates from or where the balance gets sent to.There is no way for me to prove what I just said about logs, and neither can any other competitor, so that's why we came up with a solution to this problem. The only issue with it is that it requires some help from the community, I am willing to take steps in that direction as soon as it becomes possible to do so.

I haven't seen any such info on the website. Good to see that you haven't set cloudfare on the clearnet.It depends how you look at it. If you want to get your BTC back fast (0-200 hours), then you need to consider how much BTC is held in the pool. I don't expect to get any big transactions in the first days at least so this amount is around 1.5BTC right now and will get up to 5-10BTC in a matter of hours which should be enough  while users test the service. We will increase this again once we start to see some transactions happening.On the other hand if you don't care about getting your BTC back fast, but care more about privacy, then you can deposit and get a Note, which you could withdraw at a later time. And for that I don't necessarily think there is a limit since you can withdraw little by little over whatever period you want. Of course trust will play a big role here especially because we are new, so this is why at the same time I will also be looking for trusted members to add to the multi-sig in order to make the service trustless.
