You can use things like Google. Trends to check on your country/city/state’s crypto-related Google searches.",

Is the people of crypto ecosystem are really interest to buy crypto merchandise stuff?You don't need to prepare stock of goods in advance as a business start if you don't know the potential. I think you can use the pre order method by only preparing previews of the t-shirt or at least you have mastered graphic design to accept custom design orders.And obviously you have to have a t-shirt manufacturer standing by to meet demand on time.",

Perhaps that is something you wanna consider as well.However, as with any business, the product quality and how you market your brand are big contributing factors. I highly suggest coming up with original designs instead of something people have seen a lot of times already like a big ass coin symbol slapped on a shirt/hoodie.

That’s good data, but let’s not forget that women and children(obviously) are far less likely to be interested in bitcoin and other highly-volatile assets; so the data might not be that relevant for this case.Wouldn’t hurt to try though, as Bitcoiner dads might buy Bitcoin-related shirts for their children(obviously a dumb idea due to security reasons).",

But don't know about the market potential. Is the people of crypto ecosystem are really interest to buy crypto merchandise stuff?The process is quite straightforward. First, create your crypto design and utilize platforms like Etsy, Shopify, and others to sell your goods. You can use Printify or Printful for print-on-demand services. Alternatively, you can search for lesser-known but more affordable and superior options and connect them to Etsy or Shopify. While it may seem challenging at first, you'll quickly adapt and be able to sell your products.Next, conducting keyword research is crucial. There are numerous tools available to help you optimize your SEO, making it easier for people to find your product.If you prefer a simpler approach, consider using Spreadshirt. This platform allows you to directly place your design on a multitude of different products for sale. They handle everything, from production to shipping, and you get paid every 15th of the month. All you need to do is specify how much you want to earn from each product.However, there are a few drawbacks. For instance, it takes at least a month to receive your first payment. In my experience, Etsy withheld 75% of my first payout, which I hadn't factored into my calculations.That sucked horseballs for me. But I´m used to it. Have been in this kind of situations so many times. A lot of ups and a lot of downs.But I think you have a good niche, I did some reseacrh and if you want to I can help a bit.Unless we're completely misunderstanding each other and talking about two different things. That happens to me here sometimes.",

Making online shop nowadays is easy thing. But if Bitcoin isn't popular in your place, maybe it's not even worth to begin.Onerandom though - maybe it would be good to offer something more than just T-shirt to give more choice for potential customers.

That happens to me here sometimes.This method is technically still possible to do, but it’s such a saturated method that it’s likely to not work. It’s not like back then when you can just post mockups(not actual photos) and get sales, but today you’d have to up the marketing — take actual real and great photos of your apparel. At that point you might just as well print the actual shirts yourself for more quality control, more media control, and higher profit margins.",
