Dont waste ur life and time learn futures trading;)Have you thought about the fact that some people are simply more suited for a corporate job than others, and that not everyone is made to take even the slightest risk in life?Sure, trading stocks, cryptocurrencies, or forex can provide a living, but before anyone can do that, they must be able to put in countless hours studying charts and constantly work on their psychology to combat the negative effects of losing trades. This requires a lot of discipline, and the majority of people are completely pissed off by it as a result of an industrialized 16–18–year education that includes significant struggle.That is why some people aren't build to do this kind of job because their brain is hardwired to build a resume, follow someone else's instructions and get paid.You also need to understand that not everyone can afford to attend another type of educational program where scammers and so-called trading gurus have tarnished the trading industry as yet another \"get-rich-quick\" scheme, leaving them with no choice but to learn trading on their own, which would again necessitate a lot of experimentation and resources, just like they did during their education, but with no manuals and strict written rules to follow.While I know that being a consistent profitable trader is possible, there are a lot of realities that a person need to take into account and that's just how it is.",
