  "content": "Yes, you've heard it correctly! Bitcoin's next halving is only 1 year away. https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/halving/What's an halving? Miners are getting rewarded for finding new Bitcoin blocks, a new block is created every ⁓10 minutes by miners engaging in Proof-of-Work. Finding a block for miners means getting a blockreward of valuable BTC, too. And these block rewards, attached to each Bitcoin block, are decreasing over time by getting halved. It's part of Bitcoin as a scarce asset because as we all know, Bitcoin is limited to 21M coins. Each 210.000 mined Bitcoin blocks, rewards are getting halved (= Halving). 210.000 Bitcoin blocks are roughly 4 years but it depends on how fast all 210.000 blocks are mined. When Satoshi launched Bitcoin, block rewards have been at 50 BTC per block. Here's an overview: We are still earlyAfter Bitcoin's block rewards were halved the last time in May 2020 from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC per Block, we'll see a new halving in 2024 (expected to be in April 2024), decreasing Bitcoin's block reward from 6.25 BTC (which is valid actually) to 3.125 BTC per block. And honestly, we need to admit that 3.125 BTC per block is very low: Bitcoin's halving is reminding everyone once more, how truly scare Bitcoin really is.  So, important reminder for everyone how close we are already to Bitcoin's Halving. Only 1 year to go.",

It would then be a question of how long it takes before mining regards would be negligible and relatively lower than transaction fees attached to the blocks.When the mining reward becomes much lower would that also lower the effect of the halving on the price and the sentiments of traders?",

      "body": "The most known effect of halving is the dividing the miner fees into two, and increasing its value due to supply and demand, halving after halving. By seeing the diagram looks like miners will be in loss maybe after 1-2 halving. Even let's say they still can collect the transaction fees. And with today's price it still struggling and still more than 50% loss compared to last ATH. So yeah, we might see downsizing of mining businesses soon.",

See the percentage limit, it is on the 96% of Bitcoin supply.  This means Bitcoin is almost mined up.  And that is not an indication of early period in terms of mining and block rewards.",

The impression only was made with what happened before but since things does not actually repeat in this market, we might really see changes;could be a bigger lift with the price, smaller, or none. The only thing that would prove is once 'it' already happen. Not all fork are creating a huge wave in terms of market price; example was with Ethereum. Would be good to invest early but be sure to manage the risks involved especially with the amount because anything could happen before, during, and after this anticipated halving.",

Satoshi creates Bitcoin to repair the deficiency of fiat and gold. And, Actually, if supply reduces (halving), and demand increases, the price will follow a basic economics lesson. Yes, we cannot ignore that 4 years of facts if Bitcoin knows the basic principles of economics.but, there are still many hypocrites who do unbelieve even have followed it 13 years ago.

We just need to look up the number how much volume of Bitcoin is traded daily on exchanges and how much is mined daily. Currently (6.25 BTC x (6 (Blocks per hour) x 24 hours x 28k / BTC) = 25 000 000 USD of BTC mined daily). It's a very tiny amount. And even then, we haven't taken into consideration that some Bitcoin are traded P2P, which doesn't reflect on exchange volumes. Halving is already mostly a psycological event.

But 12 years is a very long time and Bitcoin's price has increased a lot since Bitcoin had 50 BTC / block. In 12 years from now, I expect Bitcoin's price to be much higher compared to where it is now. And Block rewards will get replaced by transactions fees over time, where transaction fees will become the main source of revenue for miners.",

One year away.During the next halving cycle Bitcoin will pass 20 million bitcoin....the last time the supply hits an even million number (since the supply cap is a couple thousand Sats under 21 million)! It's crazy to think how few Bitcoin there are left to be mined. Within a few cycles the halving probably won't have that much of an effect because its just going to be one constant supply crunch happening all the time rather than just for a year or so after each halving.Annual inflation on the supply after the halving is gonna be under 1%. It'll finally be under Gold's inflation which is pretty stable around 1.5% annually. We all best be loading up on Bitcoin this year!!Get ready for 6 figure bitcoin prices to become the norm, though we'll probably get a year's worth of 5 figure prices again during the next bear market before they are gone forever.",

On the one hand because of the reduction in supply and on the other because of the expansion of the money supply, which, however much it has ups and downs, is going to continue to expand, increasingly devaluing fiat currencies. For after the next halving the most likely scenario is that the price will clearly pass $100k (after several attempts) and my doubt is whether it will pass $200k, which I think is unlikely. But I also think that the most likely scenario is as you say that in the next bear market we will return to sub $100k levels.What we have to keep in mind is that Bitcoin is becoming increasingly scarce and fiat currencies are becoming increasingly junk.",
