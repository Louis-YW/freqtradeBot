      "body": "It is good to make proposals like this and I have made some myself but I guess we are aware that theymos is not very given to changing things on the forum.Going to the point, I don't see many posts with poor English grammar. There are some, yes, but I don't see a big problem. I don't know if it is because we usually visit different sections of the forum because I don't see you very much.Also, I would say that the problem is going improve naturally because nowadays online translators work quite decently and will continue to improve in the future, so I think that users who write in English and are not native speakers will use them more and more. Even professional translators use automatic translators and what they do is to revise the text afterwards, making small changes (unless they are translating poetry for example).",

      "body": "Interesting idea, and I can't say I've every seen it suggested before (though I think there have been similar proposals).Problem:  Theymos doesn't seem to be inclined to make any sort of changes like this.  He's very much a freedom of expression type of person, and I'm assuming part of that means giving a lot of latitude when it comes to members not being great writers.  Even hitting a 70% score on either grammar/spelling or both would just lead to a lot of complaints and frustration--and though it might cut down on bots and spammers, the resulting outcry of displeasure would probably outweigh the benefits.Another problem: There are a lot of members who have a lot of trouble with English, yet they're very valuable to the community.  I wouldn't want to see their contributions erased simply because of a language barrier.  I don't think your proposal would help them, either, not if all they got was a message saying their post didn't hit the arbitrary threshold set by the forum.Is Jet Cash still around?  He used to be really into helping members with their English, and a couple of years ago he had a website devoted to that and invited everyone who was interested....and IIRC, he didn't get many takers.",

      "body": "I don't think it's good idea to make such limitation because theymos already stated it's not need to be perfect English, I think 70% score is considered well written since they need to look at the grammar, not misspelled or using an incorrect words. I'd say it's better if they check the misspelled and try to use more appropriate words, because some people blatantly using google translate from their local language to English and that's make the sentence is odds.I'm example of not a perfect English and I try my best to express my own opinion, I think even my grammar is bad, you can still understand what I'm trying to say it's? At least it doesn't make you confuse.Just let you know, everyday when I have free time I always try to learn English to write more correctly, but I'm not sure where's the problem since I still couldn't write like a native, perhaps it take times.Quote from: theymos on September 23, 2018, 08:58:25 PMLanguagesIf you are fluent in any language other than English, then it is highly encouraged for you to post in your local board. These boards often have tight-knit communities which will be able to help you, and in some ways you might be at an advantage compared to English-only posters.In the English sections, only English is allowed. It is not necessary to speak perfect English, though you should be understandable. Try your best. If you're unsure whether your English is good enough, ask in your local board or in the Beginners & Help sectionHowever this kind idea is similar like newbie jail where theymos disagree about it and would damage the forum nature.Quote from: theymos on June 25, 2018, 03:16:59 AMLimiting newbie participation is very harmful for a community. Newbie jail will never return: I consider the newbie-jail period to have been extremely damaging to the forum. When barriers to participation are too high, then the best people often just won't go to the trouble of joining, and the people who are willing to jump through the hoops are often people who aren't good for the community: people with nothing better to do, scammers, get-rick-quickers, etc. Having a permanent newbie jail policy would improve things a lot in the short-term, but would end up being a fatal poison to the community.",

It might take a different line but ends in rating to enable posting and that doesn't seat well with me, given the fact that some users are at advantage than others. Those who have finished college, went to better schools, not from poor countries and have English as there official language.It entertains bias and you don't start a rating on all with such and we've also got local board posting to consider too!Quote from: eddie13 on June 25, 2022, 01:44:30 PMWould put a good dent in rapid posting shitposters too..

In addition to concerns about not needing to speak perfect English that others have mentioned, enforcing this type of rule would effectively give Grammarly veto power over what people can post. There are also certain circumstances in which people write that are generally accepted as being \"correct\" on the forum, but may be \"read\" as incorrect by Grammarly. One example of this may be when someone is describing the amount of their bitcoin -- they may say \"...all of my bitcoin...\" while Grammarly may want the word \"bitcoin\" to be plural.",

Now to your question, it is advised that you invest what you know you can afford to loose and secondly you should as well know that crypto market is volatile.
