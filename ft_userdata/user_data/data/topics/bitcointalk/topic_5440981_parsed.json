      "body": "We are excited to announce changes in the reward methods for DNX mining at our pool. Now there are three of them: PROP, FPPS and SOLO.If you have enough patience and you want to get the maximum income - choose PROP. At a short distance, you can get less than the estimated number of coins if most of the blocks are mined with increased effort (more than 100%). But then there will be a series of blocks with reduced effort and you will be rewarded for your patience in full. It is important to remember that over a long distance (more than a week), the average effort will tend to 100%, that is, to the calculated value shown in our calculator.If you are impatient and want to receive coins here and now, regardless of luck and the frequency of receiving blocks by the pool, the FPPS reward method is for you. Here you will continuously receive income for each of your shares accepted by the pool. The commission for this method is slightly higher, this is due to the pool's costs of paying for the shares during periods of blocks with big effort.If you have large hashrate and you like to work alone, the SOLO reward method is for you. It is highly recommended before connecting to SOLO to find out in our calculator how much with your hashrate you need to wait for a block. And remember that you can wait significantly longer than the calculated value if you get a block with a big effort!",
