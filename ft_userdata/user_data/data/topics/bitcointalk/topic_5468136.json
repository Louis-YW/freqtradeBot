We have seen a lot of newbie accounts come to forum and make a post like this and claim they are so interested in bitcoin and want to learn about it but in the end they are all empty claims and after a while we stop seeing them around so OP i hope your case would be different. Before embarking on your journey you should familiarize yourself with the rules of the forum and how things are done here if you’re interested in growing here in the forum but if you’re not you can always come to the forums and acquire the bitcoin knowledge you seek as an invisible member who never contributes to the forum.

It's an incredible book. Good recommendations guys.To the OP, I need to give a more general advice since all the posts above are more specific. Bitcoin is a complex subject, as it combines Mathematics, Cryptography, Finance, Computer Science etc. Therefore, you need to remember 2 things:1. baby steps. Learn little by little and avoid sprinting. Just find a pace that suits you and try to learn in-depth.2. beware of bad advices. In general, if something looks suspicious to you, make sure to avoid it, or ask here. Never share ANY info if you are not sure. If you are anxious about something, take deep breaths and ask here.",
