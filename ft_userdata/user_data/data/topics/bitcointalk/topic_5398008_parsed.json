You never know about that, and it could happen like in China, they built some of their cities so fast from zero that people didn't have enough time to move in them.They even have ghost cities almost without people living in them like Tianducheng in Hangzhou that has smaller replica of the Eiffel Tower in typical chinse copycat style.I am not saying this will happen with Bukele's Bitcoin City view, unless they hire Chinese workers. PSCity model looks very cool and futuristic.Next thing they could do is some 3d presentation with animation.",

I think the city looks great and it's awesome to know that lots of high paid government employees are putting a ton of work into creating this city.  I wish them the best of luck and I know they'll need it.  This has to be the biggest and most ambitious project in Bitcoin's short history.  Sort of makes the old days of wanting to buy an oil platform seem a bit ridiculous in hindsight, but I don't think anyone expected nation state adoption so quickly.",

Yeah, it drew my attention too, seems like the one that designed that terminal thought airplanes are like cars and you paint the whole thing like a car park. If you look at any airport from La guardian to Charles de Gaule you will see there is no square in which you park your plane, nor are that different size for mini cars or trucks, nobody is going to park a second plane behind the one in the terminal.All terminals have taxiways that are marked with a central line, not square parking spots.As for the funding, it seems that the 1 billion will be for the next geothermal powerplant and half will be for buying the dip again, so the funds will be probably won in a lottery.Quote from: NeuroticFish on May 10, 2022, 09:51:32 AMI really hope that the color will not be so... uniform.Eh, somebody had a ton of merci pralines that were going to expire so they've said, let's recycle them and build a diorama!If you look closer you will see that the heat was too much and started melting, some of the skyscrapers are leaning toward each other.",

For example, the highest paid one will probably be the airport and that could be done under 20 billion dollars, if you want to make it a bit smaller, and not luxury place you could get it done for like 5-10 at maximum and that it is the most expensive one.Building one apartment costs anywhere between 100k to 1 million dollars depending on the building, sure you can build one for 150 million if you want, but why? Why would you do that?So, basically this project could be done under 30-40 billion dollars easily, without a doubt and I am sure you can get it done for 20 billion if you cut corners from some things. Considering some of them will be sold beforehand and during the construction, I am sure it will cost half of that. Is that a lot for them? Yes. Is it impossible to do? No.",

Because there is not a single $ in bitcoin, you have 19 million coins and that's it, there are no billions of dollars hiding in safeboxes under CZ or Do Wong ass, as you have clearly seen from what happened these days. In order to get 20 billion from the bitcoin market cap, you will need somebody to buy 20 billion worth of coins and you would need those who sold their coins to invest in Bukele's fantasy, and why would you do that?So, how much of your BTC do you plan on selling to invest in this giant pinata? Oh, and BTW, Salvador's GDP is 24 billion, building a city that costs your annual GDP and 4 times your entire annual government budget is madness.",
