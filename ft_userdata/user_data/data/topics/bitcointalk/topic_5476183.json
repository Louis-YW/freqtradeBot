Let us see if bitcoin will break $40000 before the end of this year. If I should predict this month price, honestly I do not know.Most people choose the $30 to $40k and it seems that will be right guess because personal I don’t see bitcoin breaking the $40k resistance and the $30k support levels. There are many who predict a correction after the $38k resistance was broken although I will agree with them but it would pass down below $35k. With bitcoin halving imminent and the hyped ETF approval also rumored to occur next year January most people will hold on to their bags and we will only see a heavy correction if the ETF approval is postponed yet again again. For this month the price will be between the $35k to $40k region.",

I don't intend to create fuds but I have been in the space for a while and it's my personal observation and I usually refrain from investing into Bitcoin during first half of the December because mostly the correct phase starts from second half of the month. Don't take this as a financial advice I am just sharing my experience and others might have different views as well.",

      "body": "December at the end of this year was the most surprising Bitcoin price closing in my opinion because rumors of a bitcoin spot etf would have quite a big impact if it was approved early. Yes, I think Bitcoin will be able to pass $40k or will close the end of this year at $43k. As far as I can see the buying wall is starting to thicken and that is one of the strongest incentives if buyers start accumulating Bitcoin to hold while waiting for the approval of the Bitcoin spot etf.From the chart you uploaded, of course I see that there is a strong point in market sentiment that will move upwards and break through the $40k wall. It's true that nothing is exact and everything is just an uncertain prediction, but seeing many big events at the beginning of next year is why we have to think more about Bitcoin price changes.And yes, I found a Bitcoin chart in December which is probably quite popular at the moment because it is all over social media which is valid in December. From this chart we can compare that the movement chart will bounce high upwards and hope that it will come true. But still stick to each other's opinions because this is all just a comparison for the price of Bitcoin in December.Source : https://twitter.com/StockmoneyL/status/1730538736000082019?t=xm1lGsQHFNobli-Vhht1FQ&s=19",

Not that it's a loss of optimism we should be realistic sometimes even as we express optimism.  The corrections are necessary so  it will put bitcoin price in the uptrend direct by next year 2024 as we all expects. AFAIK, in this month of December bitcoin price won't surpass 40k because the resistance at the current point is still strong therefore price  will be experiencing a lot of consolidation building momentum for breakthrough either at the middle of January or by the end of January.

Or at least there will be a jump specially a week before the Christmas holiday, maybe a good increase and then follow by a small dump, in which we could only reason that people are selling to take profits for this season.Same with New Year, increased then follow by some selling. Nevertheless, overall I feel that we will end the year with at least above $40k levels. This is round number and it's better to break that kind of price because for me it's a mental barrier. But once we broke it, we could be sailing to $45k.",

I think it will go up too, it looks like its doing fine and to be fair its historically known as doing great at December months as well. I am %99 sure that 40k+ will be reached, there is very very little amount left, and that should be easy, the only situation that's risky would be the price start dropping down from here and not get there, but I think its not going to be all that crazy. Hopefully, we are going to end up with a huge increase if you ask me, its going to end up being 43-44k range by the end of the month, maybe as high as 45k.",

This month is my birth month, and one of my wishes is to end this year with Bitcoin surpassing the $40,000 price or even the $45,000 if possible.
