  "content": "I have 30,211$ stuck on Rollbit that i have been trying to withdraw for 6 weeks now. I have msged Rollbit and all members of support and even the boss who is Razer and there is zero help. Recently I have been only ignored and none of my messages are being answered and you can see this in the below screenshots.They give me same answer every single time and that is to \"list my other accounts\". I have told them at least 50 times now that I don't have any other accounts and I dont know what else to say or do. I have given all my documents and full KYC. I have deposited 6 ETH without any issue. Only when I win and try to cash out and they tell me I cannot cashout out. They cannot answer me which other accounts are linked to me so I can help them. They ignore everything I say and just say to list my other accounts. I do not have any other accounts except this one. I do not know what else to do. I thought they were a trustworthy site and have enough money to not scam their users but now I see there are many users scammed by Rollbit on Google.I have screenshots below of my account, my KYC and my ignored messages for over a month. I just want to withdraw my funds at this point.  https://pasteboard.co/QT2f7NXQAMXE.pnghttps://pasteboard.co/avpazbZLeSJG.png",

It would be necessary to see how they argue it, but for the moment I do not have enough evidence to say that they are a scam, even less with the amount of time they have been operating, although it sounds to me that there have been some similar cases already. But accusations of scam to casinos that are advertised on the forum that later have come to nothing or that it was the accuser who had cheated there are plenty.",

Has anyone else ever faced this issue?i carefully read the chat you had with rollbit support and you said you needed funds because you wanted to return a loan from your colleague but you must understand that gambling sites have a good detection system and their algorithms can detect violations committed by users, here are a few things which i took from Google, which is usually banned by large gambling sites;QuoteSome common violations that can lead to account closure on gambling sites include:Use of a fake account or fake identity: Using fake information or trying to hide your real identity to create an account on a gambling site may result in account closure.Use of illegal or fraudulent software: Using software or fraudulent schemes to increase your winning chances or damage the integrity of the game is a serious offence.Age restriction violations: If you have not reached the legal age to gamble in the jurisdiction where you live, attempting to register and play at gambling sites may result in account termination.Security breach: Attempts to illegally hack or access another person's account or gambling site's security system may result in account closure and legal action.Violation of game rules: If you do not follow the game rules set by the gambling site, your account may be closed.Money laundering: Using gambling sites to launder money resulting from illegal activities is a serious offense that may result in account closure.Other detrimental acts: Actions such as flooding or disrupting site services, committing fraud, or otherwise breaking the law in the context of gambling may result in account termination.so long the conversation you made but the rollbit support team only wants you to expose honestly how many accounts you have, it's true if they can see all your accounts your honesty is needed.",

I do not play on rollbit so I have no clue what sort of bonus system they have in place. If it's rakeback based on bets and you deposited your money to make those bets, seems that should be ok, but according to their terms it probably is not and unfortunately you agree to their terms upon signing up.You leave a fingerprint everytime you log onto a site, i'm sure they have proof or they wouldn't accuse you of it.

About the other accusations, you can find them here at scam accusations, at reddit as well as other forums.And last but not least, the spam emails they sent to existing stake players. I also got it.They had the email addresses and vip level of stake users and offered certain bonus amounts according to you stake vip level.These were discussed in the rollbit thread and stake community:https://stakecommunity.com/topic/69379-stake-data-leaked-did-you-get-a-bonus-email-for-another-casino/#comment-1482333https://stakecommunity.com/topic/69364-email-from-diffrente-casino-anyone-else-got-it/#comment-1482119",

The topics are interesting and it seems that the mods on Stake want to save face or just doesn't know what is happening with the community. Receiving unsolicited emails and mentioned on the topic there coming from Rollbit, makes it questionable. How'd they get the data of the big players and sending emails for bonuses etc. Let's see what they would say about this.",

Now when you join any casino they have all your information, there is a chance you will be caught doing something against their rules and that is what is happening to you. Rollbit rep replied to your accusation, they are still talking about multiple accounts. Now to solve this you need to prove that you don't have multiple accounts in that casino. On the other hand, I hope Rollbit resolves this accusation as best way they can. Because Rollbit has quite a good reputation on this forum, they don't want to ruin their reputation.",

If the OP doesn't favor it then they can go on mediator.",

      "body": "It is better that rollbit should tell OP his alt account in their site,so that OP will know if it is true or not,so that he doesn't get worried about withdrawing his funds back. If Rollbit can't prove to him that he has an alternative,then there is no need for them to deprive him from withdrawal since,OP didn't accept that he has an alt account in their site. Nobody can tell who is faulty here because Raze doesn't want to show prove and OP isn't also accepting the fingers pointed at him. This can be resloved amicably with proves,instead of making us get trap at the middle so that we can know where to start from.",
