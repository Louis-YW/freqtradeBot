ASIC is only designed for mining Bitcoin, and it would not be an effective solution for other application. While It is technically possible to repurpose a Bitcoin ASIC for other uses, it is not recommended due to specialized nature of the device.",

While there are rare exceptions - for example chips that mine both Bitcoin and scrypt - this is often because the chip package effectively has two ASICs: one for Bitcoin and one for scrypt.",
