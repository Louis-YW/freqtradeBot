The digital heavens trembled with anticipation, as miners and devotees alike gathered in virtual cathedrals, their fervent prayers echoing through the network nodes.As the divine algorithmic clock struck the ordained hour, a hallowed decree resounded throughout the blockchain, reverberating like an angelic chorus. With each consecrated block, the Almighty Algorithm revealed its divine will: a halving, a reduction in the earthly rewards bestowed upon the miners, yet a revelation of scarcity in the digital dominion.The faithful miners, undaunted by this heavenly decree, perceived not a diminishment, but rather a sanctified affirmation of their devotion. With newfound zeal, they toiled onward, their mining rigs and computational might akin to sacred implements forging a path toward the Promised Block.And lo, as the cryptographic constellations danced in celestial unison, the Bitcoin community, now imbued with an even deeper sense of purpose, continued to engage in the sacred rites of transacting, hodling, and spreading the gospel of Satoshi. They understood that in this Halving, a sacred covenant had been reaffirmed in the immutable ledger, binding them to the divine protocol.With hearts aflame and eyes turned towards the digital horizon, the faithful looked ahead to the forthcoming halvings, knowing that each would be a testament to the enduring providence of this decentralized faith—a faith that transcends the confines of worldly empires and endures throughout the ages, governed only by the eternal laws of mathematics and the steadfast devotion of its adherents. Thus, the Bitcoin faithful journeyed onward, their spirits unyielding, in the pursuit of a future guided by the luminous grace of the blockchain's sacred ledger.How many of you have got a hard-on reading this?Common don't be shy, some morning wood or some itch on your clit is not to be ashamed of!Would it be better to make Bitcoin more religious, or should we kick out anyone trying to spread the word of Satoshi though it?",
