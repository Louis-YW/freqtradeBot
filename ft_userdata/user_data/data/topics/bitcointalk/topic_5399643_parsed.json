      "body": "Regardless of whatever pox or flu they push next to try and scare everyone into more stimulus, they're going to have a hard time.  After this covid hoax and spending ten trillion dollars to fight the flu, only to produce a vaccine that was 1% effective after the first week, then finding out that contracting covid naturally leads to far better immune resistance...  I honestly don't see how anyone could trust the government when it comes to health issues ever again.  The fact is that every single person who took the vaccine is worse off going forward than had they caught covid.  Now they are already starting this vaccinate against everything push...  The people who fall for this stuff are going to be sickly the rest of their lives probably.  Meanwhile the tinfoil hat wearers who avoided this stuff can just go right on living normally like mankind always has...",

The only people pushing this as a possibility are imbeciles who don't understand facts (or who can't be bothered to do any research).On a related note, did you know that vaccination against smallpox was demonstrated through several observational studies to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox? Presumably you would also have been anti-smallpox jab in the time before it was eradicated (by jab)?",

Media is quite shameless that they will terrify the public with a new virus to as long as it keeps them engaged.Many persons are very unconcerned about any news of a new outbreak; Some people are yet to recover from the economic hardship COVID forced on them so do not care much about living, life is already hell for them. Also because many have lost trust in the media as they now have little autonomy from government and the news they give can easily be manipulated/influenced by the government as they wish, so sometimes even countries were there are no outbreaks, or where there are very few cases... Corrupt government officials can capitalize on the situation to embezzle public funds.",

And if by some chance, a contagious one surfaces again and the governments or media decides to hype the issue, the majority are most likely to panic again and easily take just about any type of drug out there that could \"potentially\" keep them safe.

It doesn't seem as though it's a dangerous sickness, so ideally they won't start another lock down.     Thanks for this reliable details about monkey pox, but I'm hoping us to that we will not be lock down again cause it's very difficult ,we can not sustain easily are food in every day and don't have enough supply.",
