Even though you both have very negative trust ratings and like to hide behind self moderation, I would advise against trusting OgNasty.   In my experience, he has broken every agreement he made with myself or other forum members, stole thousands of bitcoin in a ponzi and caused irreversible damage to my health just for fun.   His actions may appear kindred, but only if they benefit him.Going forward, I'm sensitive to mental illness and I am willing to converse with you.  You are only doing yourself an injustice by grouping me with others you dislike just because I noticed something obvious.  I've been on this forum's default trust list since the start, something no other member (or staff member even) can claim.  There is a reason for that",
