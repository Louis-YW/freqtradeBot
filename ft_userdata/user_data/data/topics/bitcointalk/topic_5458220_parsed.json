  "content": "This is an entirely new ideology that I was just parsing while reading the study of DNA and how Satellite DNA fingerprinting works. DNA fingerprinting is a major role when it comes to identifying the biological parents, crime identification, and much more applications in the field of biology. However, mother nature can teach us many things, and by referring to this we could create astounding technological advances. In the current era, crypto space is booming but the crime rates are also rising up. Stealing information, misleading the world with their own identity, singing messages, showing the authenticity of the user and much more you name it. All we can do is have signature messages and link that to the person who is holding the private key for the same. How about moving further with this technology and creating something referred to as a Variable Number of Seed Repeats? In this technology, we can implement an algorithm that will be able to track down the seeds generated from all types of transactions for a particular address and thus for a particular person for the instance. Let us consider, John is holding an address bc1XXXXXXXXXXXX ultimately holding the private key for the same. Now let's consider that John has made some 50 transactions which he sent to different addresses. Whenever he will broadcast the transaction a seed will be generated and this seed will be associated with some sort of \"primer\". For easy understanding let's assume it is a virtual file with seed info, transaction info, and a unique primer that is stored on it. This file won't be accessible by anyone but would be stored on the local device itself in an inaccessible folder for higher safety. The only program that would be able to read and write would be VNSR.Linking to the Owners Genome: Now everyone must be thinking how is this even possible? Well, there are some tests that are approved by the FDA that can be done by the end-user at home to identify a few mutations in the genes and thus have some understanding of ancestry based diseases that might arise. Since to date, we are able to produce such tests, it could easily give us piece of readable information that can be encoded in the binary system and included in our so-called VNSR file. Now this will be one of the \"primers\" that will be tagged to every transaction that we do through seed generation and thus form a unique signature for us. What VNSR would do is, increase the confidence level of that device, address and other validation factors whenever more and more seeds are generated. Since a seed would be \"unique\" generated text, it will only be created once in the entire lifetime of anyone using crypto space but will have added identified that is our primer readable through VNSR.As VNSR will grow from computer to computer, a complex network will form giving birth to the directory of millions of addresses and their owners. VNSR Analyzer:VNSR analyzer would be a decentralized processor linked to the blockchain and understanding the directory as it grows. To this point, there is no breach of any sort of centralized system so we are all good. How would someone be able to prove the ownership of the address?Let's imagine a day when John is holding thousands of bitcoins and someone challenges them that they are the owner of a particular wallet. Maybe they got hacked, and they had legal disputes. OR some other example that you might be able to imagine, maybe prove ownership in Bitcointalk forum for that matter. All we can ask for the user is to take a \"direct-to-consumer\" test at their homes. Once the data is generated, just put it in binary and submit it through the VNSR analyzer. This would be then analyzed by the VNSR and should be able to send out info such as who submitted the correct binary thus confirming their ownership. It can lay out info such as the device that was mostly used along with the IMEI information of the device. Moreover, there won't be any cheating in this system since everyone can submit the particular binary code from their homes with a complex method of creating binary data that take-home tests. Obviously, this is just initial thought, someone might have a brighter idea than this. But it is sparkling for me that something like this could really work as a protective force against fraud prevention.",

If John owns the private key of the address, why not simply using that as proof of ownership? Similarly, if John is hacked, and the private key now is owned by the hacker, why isn't it reasonable to assume they compromised John's VNSR file as well?From my understanding, the goal of this idea is to expand the range of fingerprinting sources for the user. This way, if their private keys are compromised, they can provide evidence to prove their identity and minimize any doubts. What I don't understand is: who's the recipient of that evidence? The Bitcoin network understands only concrete, cryptographic evidence. And if the recipient isn't the Bitcoin network, how can that affect the Bitcoin network?",

The Bitcoin network understands only concrete, cryptographic evidence. And if the recipient isn't the Bitcoin network, how can that affect the Bitcoin network?Well yes this would be for increasing the conformity of the identity. VNSR file would be complex data with seeds and primer coupling so no one would ever understand it except the analyser and its linkages with the blockchain. It would be like a file with no doors at all. Imagine the level of security. The witness of identity would be blockchain data itself. If you read carefully then I have explained how seed and primer forms the unique combination for identification. This also makes sure there is no human verification in this one. For example, if I sign a message and somebody wants to verify it then they would do it manually at their end. But in case of VNSR, it’s auto responder. This might sound way primordial idea but it’s already happening satellite DNA fingerprinting.",
