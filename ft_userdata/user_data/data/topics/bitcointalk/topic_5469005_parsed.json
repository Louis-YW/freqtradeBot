  "content": "Isn't it a bit ridiculous that the EU is supposedly an Ally of Armenia and even has sent strongly worded warnings to Azeri leadership over their advances in Nagorno Karabakh, but yet still buy azeri gas? The hypocrisy of the EU goes much further though. Just a short time after the 2020 Azerbaijan - Armenia war ended, the TANAP pipeline was opened, passing just a few miles off Nagorno Karabakh borders. Image of pipelines:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/TAP_TANAP_SCP_Schah_Denis.pngSo as much as the EU would like to pretend to care about human life, as much as they'd like to pretend to be against conflict... The EU is directly responsible for funding Azerbaijan's participation in this bloody conflict. If this teaches is anything, is that the powers that be will never care about the human factor. All that matters is money and conserving the status quo. Just to follow NATO's direction of sanctions to Russia the EU directly funded another war which resulted in the displacement of people.",
