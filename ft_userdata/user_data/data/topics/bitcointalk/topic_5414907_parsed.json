In some cases, this may result in compatibility issues, but such instances are very rare. To avoid any surprises, it's best to do a complete test of your RAM with MemTest86 or something similar.",

      "body": "I believe the RAM speed will be limited to 2400 since that's the lowest of all the RAM sticks you have, if the lowest is 1600 speed then the whole sticks will work at 1600, hope you understand now.",

The memory frequency does not have much effect on the mining of the main coins for video cards. My mining farms have DDR3 installed and some have mixed memory of 1333Mhz and 1600Mhz.",

      "body": "I remember years ago I would always try and get the same brand and same frequency of memory sticks. I would do benchmark after benchmark. And my conclusion was that if the frequency is a little bit off or its a different brand, it makes almost no difference.Maybe its shown in a benchmark, however the different is negligable. You will not notice it. Especially when doing desktop work. There will be a bigger performance issue if you don't have enough ram rather than ram which has different frequencies.",

The only issue with mixed memoryis it will operate at the speed of the slowest stick, except for rare cases of incompatibility.As long as it boots up and all mem is recognized you're good for CPU or GPU mining.",
