  "content": "Hello! I am a college student looking to set up a cloud mining service in my dorm room. I am looking to buy a bitman s19j pro and sell shares of the profit to lower my upfront cost. Since my electricity is free in my dorm there will be no electricity fees making it more profitable. I take summer semesters so mining will happen year round I will be selling 100 shares for $70 each. If you are interested email me at dormroombtc@gmail.com or reply to me here.  Since there are thousands of scams on this forums I will dox myself, show proof of enrollment and we can find a way for me to offer collateral for the initial investment(unfortunately I’m broke or I would give collateral in btc).",
