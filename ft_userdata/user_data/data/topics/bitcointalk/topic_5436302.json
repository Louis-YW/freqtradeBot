  "content": "I have often times found myself in the midst of persons who have titles of a leadership position, in a place of worship, online, school, work, but care too little to show up or act accordingly when needed.  A leader is supposed to be matured enough to be responsible for himself and others around. If one who claims to be a leader fails in this aspect, he or she is either delegating the most important task to others or avoiding them, rather than leading by example.As regards this forum, Bitcointalk, it stems from the excellence of Nakamoto Satoshi's whitepaper of Bitcoin and is the one knowledge and wisdom that is responsible for the workflow and other services herein.In recent times due to economic downturns and people losing their jobs, those who have become familiar with Bitcoin somehow found it a haven of sort, because they made profits or learnt how to and are loving it everyday. A good leader would develop others around him/her, who are lacking financially by teaching them financial knowledge, also academically or otherwise, rather than watch these persons wallow in poverty and penury, fail abysmally in exams or test or even pick up harmful habits that drain cash like smoking, gambling, womanizing and other vices that one might pick up when in the wrong company of persons.A good leader would always be earlier than everyone and more updated and current than others.For me CEO of Bitcoin, Dennis Jarvis and his team has proven over time that he is a true leader with great vision of economic freedom, which is a result of  breakthrough in cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology, as well as web3 wallet, news, exchange, games and other products they have and are developing, that the world and I benefit from.What other qualities would a leader possess to make you follow them?Does ones interest define the kind of leader he/she should follow?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin.com",

Of course, like @Yatsan noted, two important traits a leader must possess is honesty and commitment but then it goes beyond that. He has to also be a good decision maker, a motivator and should be one with integrity.   Taking the leadership case of China before they became a world power is something I'd characterize as leadership with an economic vision since before Deng Xiaoping,  China's economy was not on the world map as they were seen as third world countries alongside India.",

What a leader can do in this regard is to put measures that will make it difficult for the person to exhibit those habits freely. Such measures include to monitor the environment with the security etc and if he is able to do this, the people can be more productive and contribute to the economic vision of the country.",

One example can be a family, in a family usually, the woman of the family is responsible for economic stuff and got the economic vision, while even she can make mistakes so maybe It's better to have discussions with other members regarding economic stuff.",

To me, a leader needs to be kind, always willing to provide a hand to those who are struggling monetarily or academically. A leader should have a solid education in addition to their extensive market experience and awareness of the latest developments.True pioneers in the realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, I think that Dennis Jarvis and the Bitcoin team deserve credit for their work. Many individuals, including myself, have benefited from their news platform and web3 wallet, among other products and services, and they represent an uplifting aspiration for financial autonomy.It's also important to keep in mind that everyone has various interests and goals, so a leader who appeals to one individual may not be the ideal choice for another. I believe it's critical that each person evaluates the traits they value in a leader for themselves and looks for individuals who share those beliefs.",

No matter how far one has gone in life, someone at some point was instrumental in pushing or giving the nudge that one required to move up. While we may not really call the person a leader, whatever principles we adopted or hoped to learn for our betterment from such person, made that person sort of a leader. It depends on what qualities or vision we see in the person we hold in esteem as a leader, and if our interests do align. So I gathered.",

How can the CEO help the OP develop? And even more so, to prevent the OP from plunging into bad habits and stuff? These people you look up to can be called your \"ideals\" or \"idols.\" And you must maintain contact with the leaders; they can listen to you and be very social and confident, leading forward by setting a positive example.We ourselves choose our leaders, and it must be admitted that leaders can not always lead to the right paths. Take teenagers, for example. They are very easy to manipulate due to their youth and inexperience, so you always need to keep your finger on the pulse so as not to fall for the bait of experienced manipulators who claim leadership.",
