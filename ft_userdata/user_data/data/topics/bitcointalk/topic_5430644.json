What a stupid scam attempt..I mean they even quoted each person's prediction and then edit that person's prediction by themselves (as only they could edit their own post of course) so they can't even claim that what they did was just a mistake Spiroll looked dodgy right from the beginning with their unrealistically high jackpot, and this just confirms that this is a deliberate scam. If casino can't afford $50 reward, imagine what will happen if anyone wins any bigger amount of there? What I don't understand though is why they even edited that post as from what I can see, Heibo would win anyway as Paxsells prediction wasn't accepted in the first place.",

Yep, fact that @Spiroll edited his post at 6:23:42 and @Heibo at 6:24:40 is a proof that both those accounts are controlled by the same people.Quote from: Apocollapse on December 21, 2022, 06:07:59 AMThe one who should win is this account, the last block number is 450 and he's predict 455, while Heibo is predict 472.Paxells wasn't accepted (Spiroll didn't quote his prediction) but that poses a question why they even bothered with editing posts since from what I can see, @Heibo's initial prediction was indeed the closest.

It is unfortunate that we find these methods of cheating in the amount of $ 50, if you do not have enough integrity to promote your platform fairly, how will the community trust you?",

If casino can't afford $50 reward, imagine what will happen if anyone wins any bigger amount of there?I left them neutral feedback weeks earlier, warning it's a scam waiting to happen. It's good to see not many people joined their \"contest\".This is actually quite good, now their negative feedback will be a much stronger warning to stop a bigger scam.They haven't been online since this scam accusation was posted in their contest thread, so it looks like they've left Bitcointalk (at least on this account). If someone creates a Newbie warning Flag, that would be the final nail in their coffin.Also worth noting: they never paid the fake winner's address.They had a $5 million jackpot, and claimed to have a $250,000 bankroll. That was a scam waiting to happen already. They never gave proof of their (small) bankroll, now it turns out they don't have $50. Lol.Quote from: Spiroll on December 17, 2022, 04:26:52 PMYour withdrawable balance is not enough. You need to play roulette or you need to win in other games.Roulette: amount of your bet = wagerCrash: profit of your win bet = wagerDice: profit of your win bet = wagerI've never seen this before. \"Wager\" by definition is the amount you bet, not the profit. They're literally changing the meaning of a word. What's next: replace both \"win\" and \"lose\" by \"aladeen\"?",
