The process can be enjoyable but it will take a long period of time before this can be achieved.Are there members on this forum that are not merit sources that have earned over 5000 merits.I am thinking that someone like cygan has been there but I do not know if he is a merit source. hosseinimr93 is almost about to get there before 3 to 6 months time passes by. Is there a way I can know non merit sources and their rank in number of merits?",

Is there a way I can know non merit sources and their rank in number of merits?I speak based on stats, cygan isn't a merit source because he sent 2841 merits and have 6767 merits the amount he sent isn't more than two times than his total merits.While hosseinimr93 is a merit source because he sent 4316 merits and have 4697 merits.So that's the key if you want to check the merit source or non merit source, although there's a possibility merit source not use his sMerits source.",

I believe that many members who are above 3k merits are also mostly merit sources. I won't say that there aren't normal members having that many merits but I guess that out of 10 there 7 would be merit sources.",

Thanks anywayYes they are actually airdropped extra smerits for distribution to my guess it is monthly, the number of smerits distributed to the merit sources varies maybe because of the boards they are assigned (merits sources are assigned to different boards). The merit sources are actually hand picked by Theymos through their applications, here is how to apply to be a merit source Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMIf you want to be a merit source: 1. Be a somewhat established member. 2. Collect TEN posts written in the last couple of months by other people that have not received nearly enough merit for how good they are, and post quotes for them all in a new Meta thread. The point of this is to demonstrate your ability to give out merit usefully. 3. We will take a look at your history and maybe make you a source.",

A thread like this one created and maintained by Coin-1 will help you figure out who the merit sources are: TOP 200 merit senders.It's in Russian, but you shouldn't have difficulties to understand the data in the tables. It's a top list of users who distribute the most merits each month. Since merit sources have the most merits, it's only logical to conclude they will be at top of such a list. You can also make a quick manual check. If you suspect someone to be a merit source, just check their profile on BPIP. If there is a significant different in the number of merits they send compared to what they receive, it's also a sign that they might be a merit source.",

Anyway, thanks for the info.The merit sources are those members of the forum who get free sMerits on their accounts. If I'm not wrong then they get monthly a set or a variable amount of sMerits that they can send to the members who make good and contributive posts on this forum.

A merit source is basically someone who gets Smerits out of thin-air but other users have to get two merits in order to have 1 sMerit. I hope now you understand that who the merit sources are and why they are present on this forum. For absolute clarity, it's important to distinguish two types of merits: sMerits and source merits. They are not the same thing. An sMerit is a sendable merit. Two received merits generate one sMerit that you can send to another account. Source merits aren't sMerits. It's a unique balance of merits that only merit sources have. So if my monthly allocation of source merits is 200, the merits I give to other users will first be taken from that balance. My sMerits balance remains untouched until I have allocated all my source merits. It's actually quite common that a merit source who receives a lot of merits ends up with hundreds or thousands of sMerits because he isn't in the best position to spend those due to his source merit allocation. I think LoyceV mentioned he has over a thousand of sMerits at one time in the past. I am guessing it's several thousands now. @LoyceV have you reached 5000 unallocated sMerits yet?",

I thought that the merits the merit sources get is same as sMerit that we gain when someone sends us 2 merits but now I know that the merit sources can have two types of merits that they can send. Although, the receiver can't know that the merits he/she receives are from a merit source's monthly allocation or from sMerits that he/she has earned because of his/her contribution. But, I'm pretty sure it's a good information for us to know and I'm happy to hear that from you. I truly appreciate it!",
