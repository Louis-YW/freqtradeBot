Are there any pros and cons between these 2 addresses?I know how it work:With receiving address I send 0.05btc and get 0.01btc back to my receiving address and can continue to pay directly with it.With changing address I send 0.05 btc and get 0.01 btc back to my chaning address but can't do anything with it until it has been confirmed.That's why I see the chaning address as a disadvantage, but it must also have some advantages that you don't have with the receiving addressBest regards",

(If you don't see \"Addresses\" tab, click on \"View\" at top of the window and select \"Show addresses\". Every time you request a new address on \"Receive\" tab, electrum gives you a new address which is one of the receiving addresses shows on \"Addresses\" tab.",
