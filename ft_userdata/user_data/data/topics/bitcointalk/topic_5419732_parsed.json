  "content": "HiI noticed seven of my remote s9 miners were off online and when i looked up there was an internet fault in the area that lasted 14 hurs outage. (Virgin Media) and never had problems before)I have just been to location and some were just ticking over/not mining, some where totally dead so i checked main 13a fuses and they had blown?I replaced them/tried new leads and had 3 go BANG when the PSU's blew?I now have 2 miners that i am running, but both are just ticking over and getting tuner failed, there is not any voltage being displayed on monitir screen when it tries to tune either?Plus sometimes i get this error message -'Hashchain refused to start I2C error', sometimes i do not, plus its random on 2 miners.All are running BrainsOS+ and are a mixture of cards that i know brains does not like......But i updated them to Brains a few weeks ago and all has seen fine since this outage.I have brought 5 miners to my location on my network now and i'm fetting the same results??Any ideas?I'm running one now at mine at its TUNER FAILED but it did not even display any hashrate/voltage/frequency/asics???Don't knwo where to start here tbh... But i know Brains does not like mixing control boards/cards and this is what these miners are....I have older model control bards here and i bet the one i'm thinking that if i fit an old board with old Bitmain FW it would boot up...Anyone help please....Thanks",

      "body": "Are you sure it was an internet fault due to your ISP and not a power issue in the area?In our old location we had times where the power was on but WAY undervoltage and it was causing all kinds of issues for equipment, some printers were even destroyed. I would think the power supplies and miners would be tolerant but if the power supplies were trying to keep the voltage steady and the actual line voltage was bouncing as they were trying to fix something I could see something bad happening. The issue we had was it was just over the cutoff for the generator and UPS units and only 1 leg so it turned into a real disaster. -Dave",

Here check this link below - FLASHING A FACTORY FIRMWAREMy thinking that the older FW i have (you label it stock -pre brains) is a .tar file and not an image file like Brains.Brains therefore i can easily flash via SD card, the .tar older FW requires command line or some other process to flash (i'm talking pre BrainsOS 2017 FW etc, the old type Bitmain Fw)I honestly don't understand how to do it via the 'commands', i presume i use command prompt and manually enter details as it describes, plus i somehow create an image of the .tar file to insert in this command line?Brains FW already is an image file, so it's easily created to put on an SD card.Quote from: hZti on November 14, 2022, 02:18:18 PMSince so many devices are affected, I would suspect that the there was some kind of voltage peak or similar at your location that damaged your miners. What you now need to find out is what parts are damaged.It was water damage by the looks, i can now see it and the last two miners i opened that are nearest the cold air input tip garage they are in are were wet, we did have a big storm, power outages etc and a fine mist of water ha entered.They have sat as they are running for years until this, hence my first thinking was some sort of spike in current/network etc as it was all over the news/social media of big outages locally to me.Quote from: Artemis3 on November 12, 2022, 02:51:59 PMQuote from: BBitcoin92 on November 10, 2022, 12:31:42 PMThat's way to much work for me...I just wish there was a way to downgrade from Brains to the old Bitmain FW, can't do it no matter how i try as some  2 cards work on the older 2017/2018/2019 FW?There must be a way, i stupidly presumed that when i upgraded to brains that my SSH locked boards that i had to flash to NAND with SD card removed the lock, hence allowing you to downgrade if needed.I can't find/see a way to remove Brains?That's what bos-toolbox uninstall does, it puts factory fw from 2018 (which has ssh unlocked). sd recovery also works with the S9 family only.From what you describe, you have a hardware issue.
