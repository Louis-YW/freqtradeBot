Even if the family is rich/poor, the issue of material wealth should not be considered the thing that determines the consciousness of success. Of course, if the previous generation is the one who values ​​material things as a priority in society, it is easy to understand that they will stumble in the process of development if failure at work causes them much more pain. With material things, we should only consider a small part of the perfect cognitive development of a person. I learned many things about them educating their children to express that all these possessions are worthy things that they have obtained after much effort, and those things will also be given away to unite everyone's happiness.If you only evaluate material things, I think one day your children will also leave you from a material point of view, they may earn more money than you or be further away from the limits of restraint. There may be different perspectives and life situations, but in general, human moral values ​​need to be promoted rather than hiding the nature of material things.",

This is because the pressure on you to attend to the financial needs of family members will be overwhelming, you'll realize that in the process of trying to please every one of them, will probably make you poor like them. If you attend to the financial needs of some and leaves others, it'd surprise you that you'll create unnecessary enmity for yourself. So to avoid all the emotional hatreds, it's best not to let extended family members to truly know your financial position. Help family and friends financially, but never make the mistake of letting them know your true worth, otherwise the wicked ones will still be coming back for more, until they're sure that they've rendered you poor to be like them, then they'll mock you.",

But if I think from my place to respond to the financial needs of the family, then I think that making a specific budget can determine the financial status and keep control over the financial needs. This budget should set out monthly income, expenses, savings, responsibilities and any money allocated for investments. To meet the financial needs of the family or to plan on basic expenses. If there is a previous loan, the repaid loan is reviewed according to the relative financial budget and if necessary, the loan is continued. Checking household weekly or monthly income and expenses. If I can think of ways to increase the monthly/yearly income requirements. Advancing based on the type and timing of investments if the situation arises. Above all, maintaining a healthy financial balance for oneself as well as managing family expenses and problems effectively.

Avoiding responsiblies sounds funny, you don't need to run from responsiblies the issue is when you can't afford your needs you can't afford someone else needs. It's not best to run after others needs cause no one can completely finish his/her needs.Talking about the wealthy ones like the super rich it's best to find job opportunities for them, alot of rich men have influence so it's best to create a job for their younger ones",

It's not an easy situation when people know how much you're earning. You will find this sense of entitlement in them and when you are unable to make up with their demands, they will tag you as a bad and selfish person.You've just said the whole truth when you said that one shouldn't allow his relative to know how much he is earning. Allow them to make assumptions and occasionally make complaints about how things are not always easy. People are looking for who they will drag down with them and as long as they feel that you are earning more than them, they feel you should be the one taking care of their bills.Some will even go to the extent of giving birth to more children with the intention that you will take care of them with your funds.",

Where is the bond in the family if the family members begin to hide things and vital information from themselves? Family is all about sharing but if the financial burden is too much on whoever provides for the family, then other members of the family should as well be empowered to work and earn money too. Most times, people just get too entitled to other people's finances and want to be catered for from where they did not work from. If this is the case in your family,  it means they were not taught how to be responsible early enough, especially in matters that concern finance.I do not know the approach that works for your family but every member of your family who can work should be encouraged to get jobs or businesses so the financial burden will lessen. While doing these for them, still support them in your little way because family will always be family.",

You cannot run away from these responsibilities unless you decide to leave the country or hide from them. This is prevalent in poor nations where there are high rates of unemployment and low standard of living. As an individual, you cannot watch your parents or poor relatives die of hunger when you have money to support them. My mother is currently sick and I have to bear the cost of her medical bills because the government has no health scheme for senior citizens. I have also learned not to burden myself too much with other people's responsibilities. One has to plan his life because the future is unpredictable. Currently, I have a budget that has funds allocated to cover the needs of my relatives. Once I exhaust the money in the purse, every other need will have to wait till the next month. I will not borrow or take a loan because of anybody's needs and I have to also save and invest for my future. So there is need to control your expenses to avoid regrets in the future.",

The moment you stand to understand that you have responsibilities to stick to, then you will realize the shits of relenting and wasting of opportunities at any given timeMost times responsibilities energizes so one doesn't have to settle for less. You just have to utilize every useful of your times like you are not only hustling yourself but also the families.Your parents has tried to bring you up right from the womb til you became an adult While they grows old and loosing energies to work further and keep taking care of the family.So then Tou grows up you have to take the steering (control in-charge).Before your parents depends on you, then you are either invested the families funds on to push you to a certain height were they finds difficult to get others on or you a just a gracious one.The families Invested in you because they believed in you right from a certain promising period of you.Yeah. It is frustrating where one in a numerous number of people in a family overloads one with one or two ways demands.That personally causes development delays whereas one would always have a target but can't reach to it due to family demands.Scaling through this situation is not to avoid your responsibilities with the family neither is it of ignoring them.Of you are at a better position, you can also invest in some of the family members so to ease the load in you how as they could be independent to their selves.I am not talking about the luxurious investment in them but how ever minimal.You can invest in them either by sharing available opportunities, financially or offering recommendations to considering job offers.You can put them on either weekly or monthly upkeeps budgets depending on your income ratei. This is so they don't get to distabilize your energy at inspirations or distabilizing your financial plans.You can better keep a distance from them not because you want to create a bridge of relationship with them but you needed that undistractive moments at when you are active to chasing the rhythms to better life",

Family is the first step in socialisation; they raised you and shaped you into the person you are today.

You're not a superhero although your family members are looking up to you as if you're one. You cannot help them at all times but as a family member, I know that the feeling is there and you can't resist helping them for every problem that they need to solve. You're not helping them even if the slightest problem that they deal with is going to be dependent on you, it shouldn't be like that.You need to help them to survive on their own and that's why it's important that you shouldn't help them at all times. There are certain times that you have to help them because it is a matter of urgency but again, not all of the problems they need to face will get helped. Because if so, they'll be hoping for you at all times and can't stand on their own when needed.",

The best way to respond to family financial needs is to be disciplined with your spending, be it with your immediate family or extended family. The truth is, respect the humble and diligent spender of money. Approaching your family with a pretend act is not the best way; rather, with an open mind, state the reason and the advantage behind your actions to them. Give them, but have a limit to which you respond to their needs. Learn not to overplay your role or do too extra much all the time, people will be fine without you, Unless it is your parents, which we need to honor every time because some of them really sacrificed a pot for us.",
