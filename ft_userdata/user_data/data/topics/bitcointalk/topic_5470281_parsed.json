The forum is guided with rules, you can read the links above. I will like to add the Beginners and Help Encyclopedia, it encompasses almost all the useful topics on the forum you can go through them gradually. Secondly this a forum where you can ask just any questions related to bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large but since the forum is almost a decade old most of this questions might have been discussed before so the right way is to use the search function first before proceeding to create any thread about your question. Here is how to effectively use the search function, this way you don’t get to spam the forum with repeated threads",

When you are new to bitcoin talk forums, it is natural that everything seems difficult for you. If you find everything difficult and get frustrated, you will drop out of this forum. So you try to take things easy without finding everything so difficult, first you try to skip the topics which you find difficult in this forum, you keep doing those which are easy, no one will force you to learn the difficult topics.  First start with easy topics and slowly when you try to learn about difficult topics, things will be much easier for you so there is no need to be disappointed beforehand. Links of some important posts have been shared in the previous comments. Please enter those links and try to read those pin posts well. I hope you will find the difficult topics easy.",

You just need to join the threads you are interested in and share your opinions and ideas regarding the issues being discussed.However, if you have other goals such as increasing rankings, participating in signature campaigns, and earning bitcoins on forums, of course you need to read a lot of forum rules. But all of this can be achieved if we discuss it. So basically this is a discussion forum so get discussing",

I don't remember seeing people asking questions like this in the various other forums I have been to and still visit from time to time.

In other words, if you want to learn to swim without getting wet, you're in trouble. I would understand more if in this section newbies would ask questions after doing some digging. Like simple questions about block mining or the 21 million cap, things like that, but questions like \"what is this forum about\", \"tell me what I have to do to succeed in this forum\" and the like I think are tolerated in a very benevolent way with newbies that in other parts of the forum would be deleted for low value.",

Also all post are authentic its just you need to get those idea coming from different people so that you can learn on bigger scale. It doesn't mean they show some great ideas here you will follow them but rather take those other opinion and make all of it as a basis so that you became more better forum member and have more knowledge about crypto. Beginners help will be the best section regarding on newbie discussions but for other altcoin go to altcoin section so familiarized the forum and each section so you can go directly on the board if you are searching for some information's.",

Because joining this forum is your first step. Then the next step, you just need to read the regulations that apply to this forum. Once you read the rules on this forum, I'm sure the next steps you take will be easier. Because more or less you will understand more about this BTT forum. Then, once you understand all the rules in this forum, all you have to do is decide which board you want to study on. Do you have an interest in investing in bitcoin, or do you have an interest in trading altcoins, or do you want to explore other things available on this forum (discuss). So in essence, your steps after reading the rules in this forum will indeed be easier.And for more details, you can read the thread below.
