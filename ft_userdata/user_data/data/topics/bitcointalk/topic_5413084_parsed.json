Why do people feel the need to go out of topic, near instantlyThe topic is about the money scammers are making. Not about scam1 is a copy of mixerabcd and scam2 is a copy of mixer1234@dhru9Yep, you got it right. The niche is so small that it's easy to make a scam and make money. The worst part is that they could do more money if their service was legitimate.  edit:@Little MouseTo be honest, it's just a theory but I'm pretty sure there are legitimate mixers that create scams. Doing this to attract more customers to them.- mixer 1 is legit- mixer 2 is legitmixer1 creates a clone of mixer2 and scams people. People complain about mixer2 on the web. And people decide to use mixer1.Disgusting, but I wouldn't be surprised. I've seen something that looked very much like it before. But it's impossible to provide undeniable proof of course.",

It requires a lot of money. Maybe they are preparing themselves for launching a legit mixer lol. It's also very much possible that some of the real owners are also creating all these phishing site just to same other people.",

Having transactions on a mixer's \"deposit here\" address does more bad than good to the credibility. If the mixer only gives everyone the same static address then it is obviously a scam, otherwise how would it know who sent the coins and be able to forward them to the right person?",

Yes to be legit it has to be unique adress.  when many people send same adress is just indication that it's a scam.",

Doing this to attract more customers to them.I tend to agree with this and it seems they're the one who creates scams or clone websites, but that's just a theory that we can't conclude. Also, I'm annoyed by a mixer that has a different URL to follow with the same owner, for example (.io, .eu, .net) are the same which could be misled people who will use this mixer.There are already 5 clone scam websites on [banned mixer] on this thread ⚠️ List of Bitcoin Mixer or tumbler SCAM/CLONE websites ⚠️.  It might be good if OP updated this thread and add this clone scam website of [banned mixer].",

If anyone check the transactions, they would definitely avoid using this regardless of their legitimacy. The system is used for some of the noobs who don't give a lot of attention to the details.",
