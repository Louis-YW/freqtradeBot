  "content": "Alik BakhshiThe moral side of the grain deal            In the expression \"grain deal\" there is a subtext of something not entirely legal and secret. On the other hand, the word \"deal\" can be replaced by the more correct word \"agreement\", which in this case carries the same semantic load. However, I still think it is not without reason that the word “deal” is used in the agreement on the export of Ukrainian grain, concluded between Russia, Turkey and the UN. The fact is that there is an element of blackmail here. So, Ukraine sells its grain to countries interested in buying it, that is, a normal international trade operation, but Russia, which has nothing to do with this, puts forward a condition, and not to Ukraine, but to the West, which must lift anti-Russian sanctions, otherwise Russia does not guarantee the safety of ships entering the ports of Ukraine. There is the most gangster blackmail that Russia has already used, if we recall the “gas blackmail” against the EU. However, what can be expected from the St. Petersburg bandit Putin, for whom \"roofing\", and this is exactly what Russia's demand in the concluded grain deal looks like, adequate to the usual gangster protection. Putin does not care that his African friends will be left without much-needed grain. By the way, Ukrainian grain is also supplied to China, Russia's strategic ally.        I must say, in this case, the threat is quite real, given that Russia is at war with Ukraine. It is necessary to pay attention to some very important nuances in legal terms. Russia does not recognize that it is at war with Ukraine. So why on earth are Ukraine being targeted with rocket attacks on its grain warehouses and port facilities if Ukraine is not a party to this deal. Moreover, if there is no officially recognized war on the part of Russia, then its missile strikes on the entire territory of Ukraine are interpreted only as terrorist. No wonder Russia is recognized as a sponsor of terrorism. Along with strikes against Ukraine and its territorial waters, Russia also intends to sink merchant ships in the neutral waters of the Black Sea, which is a violation of international shipping standards. In principle, ships with grain may not use neutral waters, but use the territorial waters of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, following the coasts of these countries, which are also NATO members. It is unlikely that Russia will dare to sink ships in the Black Sea waters of NATO countries. The only vulnerable place for transport ships is actually Ukrainian ports and territorial waters of Ukraine.        It is very interesting what will be the reaction of Turkey as the most active party to this grain deal. What will Erdogan do if Russia still starts sinking ships with grain. Erdogan has several options here. Turkey, which has a powerful navy that surpasses Russia's, can take over the security of shipping instead of Russia, which was the guarantor of security for the duration of the grain deal. It should be taken into account that Türkiye will not violate any international norms in this case. Its ships will not be located in the territorial waters of Russia, including the occupied Crimea. It is unlikely that a Russian ship or plane will dare to fire a shot towards the Turkish fleet, which does not violate the boundaries of the territorial waters of Russia, no doubt, it will suffer the fate of a Russian plane that somehow flew into Turkey. The second option is that Turkey will abandon all economic projects with Russia, which will make the latter lose a lot. And the third - Turkey will close the Black Sea straits for Russian ships, with all the ensuing catastrophic consequences for Russia.       The Russian Fuhrer, with his insane revanchism, put Russia in the position of a pariah in front of the entire world community, and Russia's behavior in the grain deal well demonstrates the moral inferiority of Putin's Russia.      07/21/2023",
