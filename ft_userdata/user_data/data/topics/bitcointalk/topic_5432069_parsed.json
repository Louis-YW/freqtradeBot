  "content": "We want to try a new model of NFT collection:Name of the NFT collection: WeFoundThePasswordNumber of items: 333Listing: 0.007 ETH eachNetwork: PolygonOpenSea link: https://opensea.io/collection/wefoundthepasswordWhat is different here?It is not only about art. It is also a puzzle, game, competition ...LEVEL1 (reward 1 ETH):After all 333 NFTs are sold, an Ethereum block number that lies in the future will be chosen .. the hash of this block number will reveal the NFT # that will get the reward .. the NFT # will be calculated as follows: [hash of the chosen block number] modulo 333 .. the result is a number between 0 and 332 .. the holder of the NFT with that number will get the reward .. if the result is 0, then the holder of NFT #333 will get the reward.example:Ethereum block 16258727hash: 0x785fc40b932a93b57277b91760e0d4b0292cb6aba910c570e297206b3929bf87hash modulo 333 = 174 .. NFT #174 would get the 1 ETH rewardThereafter the developers will introduce LEVEL2 ... watch out!",

No, it's not a lottery because our intention is to implement the remaining part (you calculated it Â  minus fees) into the next LEVELs. We wouldn't earn from LEVEL 1. It will be a challenging task for the developers to create next LEVELs. But it depends on the participants (whether they're interested in this type of NFT game) too.And don't forget the value of the NFTs.Quote from: digaran on December 27, 2022, 10:49:24 PM*Also not to sound like a beggar, but do you have any bounty/airdrop?Ps, I can't find your onlyfans link anywhere on op.lolWe don't have bounty/airdrop/onlyfans link ... it's a new concept ... watch out!",
