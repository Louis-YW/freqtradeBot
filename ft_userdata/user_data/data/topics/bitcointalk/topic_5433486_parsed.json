  "content": "Hello there, dear community.I'm sure some of you guys have been fooled by your friends and possibly all of this nonsense journalism.Some people believe Bitcoin is dead, and others believe the process is slow. Let me tell you, those forks have duped you.I'm not saying this to inspire you or anything. The point of writing this is to inform all of you fiat bros and sissies that Bitcoin is the hope.Let me explain why you should stop being skeptical of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not centralized (it does not have a central authority).\"I knew the majority of your friends would have called it a Ponzi scheme!\" They'd say that's why I don't invest in it. Look at it, everything is going to zero. Many Bitcoin supporters hold opposing views on the currency. Some people invest in it, most likely because they hear good things about bitcoin. I'd like to tell you that Bitcoin is the antidote to money corruption. Perhaps because it is something completely new and amazing, but people fail to recognize it as a means of eradicating corruption in our society. There is no cause for alarm, most likely because they have no knowledge of how the network was implemented. They are easily misled. So let me tell you the most amazing thing about Bitcoin. You can travel anywhere in the world with just 12 words stored in your brain. We have money that is visible to everyone on the planet. Everyone can keep track of any transaction,very secure and does not involve a third party. Bitcoin held by someone else is not yours. So, no manipulation or corruption.That is why you must trust the system and refrain from being fooled by friends.",

There's hope for the future of Bitcoin but we'd still have to allow the time for everyone to face its fate -- everyone that's IN already -- not some new, blindfolded folks, that gets desperate based on your already exaggerated theories.Bitcoin has fallen several times; in it's cryptographical analysis, it's called the DIP --a time where we'd have alot of peeps buying them to HODL. Things to note: always TRYYY to let anyone know the intricacies in it; most especially when they're ready to invest 'em funds.

You need to listen to the advice of experts. As often happens, among friends, few people are well aware of btc. More often than not, many of them have heard of btc and see it as just a speculative tool.It is better to write down 24 words, not 12. For reliability. It's not recommended to keep this in mind, but your idea that you can travel the world with btc and be financially independent sounds great. This adds a very painful element of freedom, both movement and action.Well, I would not say that the availability of a database of all transactions is a good thing, but bitcoin's system is built that way and nothing can be changed from a technical point of view. But even here, if desired, options are possible. For example, mixers.",

Infact it dies almost every year but the death of 2017 was a higher death. But after the death bitcoin also resurrects. I don't know if it is nice to say that bitcoin is immortal.
