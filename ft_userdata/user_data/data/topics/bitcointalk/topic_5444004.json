If your point is that this wallet that owns by Binance is hacked I don't think they are hacked according to what I heard before they gradually moved some funds to other wallets to ensure the security of their users' funds and to reduce the risk from hacks and security breaches.It is likely they are moving the funds from the hot wallet to the cold wallet and they periodically transfer funds back to the hot wallet when the funds are exhausted.",

The subsidiary will reach more users in different countries, of course, it will make the parent stronger. Likewise with its business collaborations with several other brand exchanges in various countries.I thought that was what CZ had been doing all along, but then again CZ wasn't Satoshi.",

There are better ways to spend one‚Äôs time perhaps you should try crossword puzzles. Those can be fun. Also there‚Äôs nothing mysterious about the wallet address or its content. Binance is one of the biggest exchanges in the world today, it‚Äôs no surprise that kind of volume is being moved through Binance.",

      "body": "You're jumping from one conclusion to another without any solid basis. Why would a wallet that has transferred many bitcoin mean that CZ or whoever owns that wallet is satoshi? Not to mention the age of that wallet is not that old, and the number of people or groups who have the ability to transfer that many are not limited to Binance/CZ either.Quote from: Last Effort on March 08, 2023, 01:33:03 PMhow it could be the heaviest transaction all time than other wallet..still can't figure it out...total in and out with spectacular transaction.Check out other exchange addresses and you'll see more or less similar behavior. The number of BTC might be lower of course, but that doesn't really matter considering the number of Binance users is likely higher too. Unless you find an address that has solid transaction history to old satoshi addresses, it won't be enough to convince people that the address is owned by satoshi, especially if it is owned by an exchange.",
