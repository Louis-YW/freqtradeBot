And this is the nice part of bitcoin and criptos, anyone can be his own broker and invest in whatever they feel is better. To take the best decisions for your investments just follow the recent news, that way you will get some hints about where to invest your money.",

Here in cryptocurrency, we don't use the word broker, instead we use exchanges fir a trading sites like Binance, and other similar trading websites.

Is anyone here active on a particular site and can give a recommendation?If I may advise you to gamble, especially in betting brokers, third-party intermediaries or bookies, it's better if you do it yourself, what's so difficult for you to make some of your own accounts, if you want to place bets directly, as long as you follow the rules of certain gambling sites, instead of you having to pay a fee or commission to the dealer / brokerage service.You need to be aware that if you are not right in choosing a broker agent, it can be fatal for you. Remember, what you are looking for is all the internet, unwanted things can happen at any time, Using a broker agent can have an impact on your bets, as far as I know I haven't found a brokerage agent here who is really good to recommend, you should do direct betting yourself, don't easily trust third parties on the internet.",

As this is a Crypto platform, you saying about broker means you are referring to forex Â which does not align with our activities here in anyways. For your quick understanding, there are centralised and decentralized exchange for which you can buy and sell your Crypto assets and also you can trade on Crypto currencies there too. Then for am escrow, you can contact any reputable member here to stand in for you for transparency and credibility. There are lots of exchange online there that can you can find reliable based in their reviews but Do Your Own Research so you can reduce the risks involved in getting into the wrong hands thinking you got it all right. Scammers can take advantage of you as you have raised this topic of inquiry as to show that you have no idea what you are into.",

However, I would like to inform you that in the crypto market, you don't need any broker or trader. You can be one for own self. Just invest in the authentic and good reputed platform and must learn every required thing before making any further steps.",

So if there's such thing in gambling, it might be the bookmakers he's trying to point out or those whoch are managing fixed betting (hopefully it is not). But still, I don't get its relevance with this industry wherein a player could simply bet on sports without the need of such specific person given that gambling sites has their own team to run the betting procedures.",
