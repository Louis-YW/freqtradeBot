Because that amount alone is big enough to set someone up for life in any country of his choice.¬†There must be some benefit to having such an offer because it's not a small amount of money, and that offer is not even for the common people. If there is more to be achieved when you are a citizen of that country, then many investors will take that offer, as they can rest assured that with time they will make more than that with the opportunity they will get to explore the country.¬†But left to me alone, I can't spend that much just to acquire a citizenship passport or visa. Well, let me just say this is my level of thinking based on my current financial status. If I have more, I will definitely think big, but still, the money is too high. Something between $100 and $500k is a little more considerate.",

It's not a heaven paradise here on earth, I don't see any reason why anyone should do this, $1M dollars is a lot of money if I convert it into my local currency, I will live like a king in many countries that are better than El Salvador.If it's possible to buy a Plot of land on Satoshis island I would probably do this, but I guess the lands on there are just for rent on time bases, I wish, hehe, mind you, in coming years if things go very well with Bitcoin and crypto I believe that few countries will fully embrace crypto just like El Salvador is doing right now. If I have $1M dollars right now I would invest most of that into Bitcoin and wait for a pleasing cash out by 4th quarter of 2024, or when I see Bitcoin reach over 80k in value, good luck üé≤ .",

If nothing just a passport and citizenship for sure no people will think about paying such huge amount of money. Although they are rank 38 in the world in terms of that still I doubt there's someone will get an interest on what they offer not unless if they want to do some business there. But for people who doesn't give any importance with that for sure they rather create a business out of that huge amount of money rather paying it for things that doesn't make sense at all. If US or Canada offer that maybe I will consider to get that but in other country will I might choose to have a local passport on my country since I can still use it to travel anywhere.",

They're requiring less than that amount and I think that they've got more powerful visa than El Salvador.

Personally if I have that amount or preferably more than that I will just consider going to one of these places that less economical or let me say middle class countries. El Salvador is just the top country talked about in crypto because of its laws to use bitcoin as a legal tender but it is not the only country that has a relaxed law when it comes to bitcoin and cryptocurrency usage. Even Central Africa Republic can be a place to go not to talk about great places with decent weather. This amount to be a Salvadoran os just too much",

If I converted the money needed then it will take a very long time before I can reach the said amount. It's around 55 million in my fiat currency and that alone is the deposit amount only and how much more if you add the fee $999 or let's put it to $1000. I think there are more expenses since you have to go through KYC and stuff so that means I need to pay money to get the documents needed for the verification. My answer in short is NO.
