You must not be in the forum to own bitcoins, there are people who do not know about this forum but have bitcoins, yours becomes an Extra advantage, you have capital to invest, and you know this forum and what you get from here, information wise.",

Get the guaranteed job, steady income & work on, buy & save bitcoin in your spare time. You can definitely make time for both, the forum isn't important but you can definitely make time to study bitcoin & buy some when you are not working hard in your regular job.",

At the end of the day being active in the forum or trading is also a way for you to get Bitcoin. You might not spend your money but you definitely trade your time for it. I've been doing a similar thing in the past months, and although it doesn't last that long since I work on a temporary job, I still buy Bitcoin regularly when I did that. In short, it doesn't really affect the way you obtain Bitcoin, it might even help you if your new job allows you to dump $1k regularly into crypto while having a good life.",

I think you've got the answer to your question right there; it's best to stick with the paying job. And I'd take @Joniboni's advice any day because the way you sounded, you didn't want to lose either of the two so this gives a balanced equation and a win win situation for you.",

These are the possible things you can do at this point1. Considering your family, you can take the job and forfeit investing in crypto for the time being.2. You can reject the job and seek for other paying jobs that will allow you invest in crypto3. You can also start up your own business so that you can have all the time you desire.",

The anti-Bitcoin sentiments should convince you that people who hate Bitcoin are scummy ass scum who have no place in decent society. The anti-Bitcoin people should therefore convince you that Bitcoin is much better than the USD. I have created a cryptocurrency called Circcash, and the anti-Circcash sentiment runs very deep because people are too fucking stupid to understand it. And all that does is convince me that Circcash is the answer and that all these anti-Circcash chlurmcklets are science hating braindead baffoons who should be locked up. In fact, since the Bitcoiners on this site seem to hate Circcash very much, I am convinced that most Bitcoiners are fucking stupid ass pieces of shit who should be locked up and treated like the subhuman scum that they are.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Creator of Circcash",

It doesn’t worth it when you ignore a good paying opportunity for a low income task. Some jobs doesn’t worth the time and stress at all, whereby bitcoin trading/investment will get you in just one day triple income of what the job will offer you as salary at the end of the month. Most employers are users, they would rather prefer using their employees in such a way that their workers won’t have time for any other opportunities and avenue to explore better progression. The world is advancing and many thanks to cryptocurrency for elevating millions of people out of poverty, most salary jobs will take people nowhere compared to millions of opportunities that awaits you in cryptocurrency. There is nothing that beats being independently established, once you dedicate yourself, time and commitment on bitcoin and you remain focused on it, with time, you will get to understand how it works and in no time you will start making your money.",

Consider the potential career growth, stability, and financial security that the job could offer versus the time and opportunity cost of stepping away from your bitcoin endeavors. It's also worth exploring if there are any compromises or alternatives that could allow you to pursue both options. Be wise.",

      "body": "I think you should consider the pros and cons of both options carefully. Bitcoin is a great project and has a lot of potential, but it is also very volatile and risky. You never know when the price will go up or down, or when the market will crash or boom. You also need to have enough knowledge, skills, and resources to trade, invest, and mine Bitcoin successfully. If you rely solely on Bitcoin for your income, you may face a lot of uncertainty and stress.On the other hand, a good-paying job can provide you with a stable and secure income, as well as other benefits such as health insurance, retirement plan, etc. You can also use some of your earnings to buy and hold Bitcoin for the long term, without having to worry about short-term fluctuations. You can also learn more about Bitcoin and the crypto system in your spare time, and maybe find ways to integrate it with your job or career.Of course, you should also consider your passion, interest, and goals in life. If you really love Bitcoin and want to dedicate your time and energy to it, then maybe you should stick with it. But if you are not sure or confident about it, then maybe you should take the job offer. Ultimately, the choice is yours, but I think you should always have a backup for income because of Bitcoin’s volatility. You don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket and regret it later.",

Besides, such work makes you happy, which is why it's recommended to do the kind of work you love or have passion for.\"You cannot serve GOD and money.\" Doing the right work or serving the role you were created to serve really well is part of serving your CREATOR\"No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.
