Tether part is speculation and can burst at any second (and it usually does in crypto winter).On the other hand, the fact that the supply is fixed comes with acknowledging that bitcoin is very scarce, hence inviting the ones smart enough to invest in it. And from there the price grows in a correct, organic manner.However, you may not care about this, or maybe you just want to troll.

During crashes a lot of bitcoin is being exchange for it and this puts things more or less in balance. If it's so bad, why do people escape to it and not to USD? The answer is again the government and stupid tax laws that influence the market. Without these laws people wouldn't have to use Tether but could freely and with no limits turn bitcoin into fiat money.",
