We can go back on it every time we replace it with a new one. Quote from: Bananington on March 20, 2023, 07:51:32 PMIs it possible that old strategies may work in the future again?Yes, very possible. They may seem to look old but strategies are just there and they'll never be obsolete unless the market entirely changes but it seems not. That's why these old strategies if ever you've got one might still work and thus, you can't just forget about it when it has come to the point of time that it has helped you a lot from your trades.",

If you are talking about trading, then I believe strategies in trading can always be the same since indicators are not changing as well, all you have to look for is for the perfect timing and perfect combination of indicators.",

Trading strategies never change in any kind of trading whether it's Crypto or stocks, Market behaves according to the demand and supplies a common mechanism. So it's not wrong to say that Tadring's strategies never get old but they modify themselves with the progression. Some of the approaches never even change after many many years such as Hold, All In, and All Out on different instances. Trading is all about the uncertainty of the market price if you know when and where to enter and exit you can be a successful trader and these skills develop after good experience you cant learn it but you can experience it.",

Is it possible that old strategies may work in the future again?They still might be working but are less effective. They'll somehow become obsolete due to the change in market behavior which is why we also have to do some upgrades and discover new strategies to fit the current situation, otherwise, it was hard to make a profit. Meanwhile, we can still use some of those old strategies but not really often. I'd say it was less effective due to the fact that we can't rely on them as we need to look for other strategies that would really work efficiently.",

Yes,we do know that this market is really that hard to handle it out due to unpredictability and this is why as a trader who do deal off with moving prices on active manner then it isnt something that simple to deal with.You would really be needing for yourself to be that versatile so that you could really make out adjustmentsbasing up on the market condition which it would really be that typical.",

There are very few new trading strategies.That’s good about trading, it never gets old and if there’s a new one you can easily adjust since you already know fundamentals of trading. You can have the old one, and it can still work to other cryptos just try to set-up a new approach and you can be good. Trading strategies should adopt the current trend, its ok to have the old one as long as it works for you, analyze is your best preparation trading in the market.",

The game just repeats itself over time because market participants don't change their psychology over time. Generally things don't change but applying strategies successfully depends on each person.",

If you've the strategy written down, as (is) advisable, then there won't be any point in throwing it away or completely forget it. It's there on paper, you only need to revisit it to remember what it's like. You can retest it even years later when you think the one you replaced it with had become faulty.QuoteIf you have experienced this before; has any old trading strategy that you decided to apply work for you?

I would've wait patiently for it to catch a few movements. I revisited it years later and discovered my trading was better with it.",

Is it possible that old strategies may work in the future again?Believe or not, I am following the same set of strategies for more than 6 years for crypto trading and fortunately I am into profit side till date. Probably the traders who are making use of only one strategy might keep changing their strategy more frequently but I am doing technical analysis with 4+ strategies and I take positions only when at least 3 of my strategies say same thing. This helps me to filter out short term trends. I always prefer riding on trends which might be the another reason why the same set of strategies are always working for me for longer duration.In my opinion, a strategy may turn inefficient when market gets more volatility. To handle this, we might either need to stay away from trading or need to fine-tune the strategy by adjusting the parameters. I mean switching over to new strategy does not sound good or as a working approach (in long term perspective) to me.",

I use high leverage which I thought was good but landed me in liquidations. Newbie traders will learn and they will move on. It is like promoting from a lower class to an upper class in school, you move up and you move on.Quote from: Bananington on March 20, 2023, 07:51:32 PMIf you have experienced this before; has any old trading strategy that you decided to apply work for you? Is it possible that old strategies may work in the future again?The strategies you apply can be as old as time and old for you because you have known about it many years ago, but the strategy is never old for you because you still use it. I see old strategies in this context as the strategies that you have abandoned before. I can not use the strategies I have abandoned before, I abandoned the strategies because they were faling me.Quote from: xCryptoManiaX on March 20, 2023, 09:12:14 PMThere isn't a one stratefy to rule them all.

If a trader is patient, using very low leverage or using just 1x leverage, adapting to market condition for trading is very profitable.",

The old trading strategies can fill the void while you search for something permanent that you'll be using for your trading sessions. Some new trading strategies only works for a certain amount of time like in bull market, during this time everything seems to pump so the strategies you can use for that period mightn't be the same that you'll use when the market aren't in a pumping stage. All strategy can be reused since the market is in a circle.",

If you have experienced this before; has any old trading strategy that you decided to apply work for you? Is it possible that old strategies may work in the future again?My calculations are way simpler. I am going with the flow and if it is working for me then I am not changing it sooner. If the market situation starts changing dramatically then yes I adapt accordingly. In many instances, I do stop trading as well. The later stage comes in my life if I am losing too much money on trading and I am not getting hold of the market by doing any sort of changes. For example, changing the trade timing, portfolio upgrade, TA at different chart points, and much more. However, I am mostly trying to be the long-term holder and it makes me realize that it is what keeps me risk-free. I have read on the forum itself somewhere, unless and until you are not selling your portfolio you are not going into the losses. So any of the methodologies is not working as mentioned above then I am simply not selling and holding until dust settles.",

Trading is about profiting and if you have a strategy that you are comfortable with because it is giving you profit, then you let go the one not working and move with that working. There is no hard rule about this because we all desire to make profit in trading.
