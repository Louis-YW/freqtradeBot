The bad publicity that comes with alts definitely negatively impacts bitcoin. It’s such an easy article for lazy journalism, to lump bitcoin in the minefield of scams & unscrupulous behaviour carried out by alt devs & their communities.Alts take capital & liquidity away from bitcoin. New investors don’t want 0.01 bitcoin. They want 1,000,000,000 shitcoins for the same price. People think they’ve missed the boat on bitcoin & try to get inventive to make up for it, which usually ends up in awful failure.",

Some being developed under the POS and we all know they end up not being able to correct bitcoin and follow its trend which actually defeats it purpose. When you see a new altcoin trending then it is certainly for people who looking for a quick rich scheme.In the area of adoption I think Altcoins has actually drive people away from cryptocurrency due to the growing number of scam coins. You find it hard to convince someone who has less knowledge about crypto and has loose funds to this shit coins that bitcoin is by far different to this Alticoins. Also for those who have sufficient knowledge about cryptocurrency, altcoin doesn’t provide competition to bitcoin",

However, the formation of bitcoin has greatly impacted on people despite the creation of other coin and there's no way bitcoin would be in competition with altcoin which can never happened. Bitcoin is more secure, reliable and trustworthy and moreover, has no central authority from any governmental agency meaning it is a decentralized currency which operates independently.",

Like you mentioned, this brought about public awareness and interest to the extent of knowing that there exists a currency that is fully decentralized aka \"financial freedom.\"I doubt that there was any competition at all when ETH and other famous altcoins were made. The basis would always be the price and liquidity in the market. Moreover, the creation of altcoins further boosted the price of BTC in the market which had more positive impact than negative.",

It is pretty easy to verify too, look at what happens to altcoins each time bitcoin price moves: They get dumped.

But the new altcoins at this time of course still can't be said to be a competitor to bitcoin. Older altcoins such as Ethereum, BNB, ADA, etc. are sometimes the choice of investors as their second investment besides bitcoin.Even though bitcoin has a high market cap, some assets are still diversified with other altcoins.Competition between Bitcoin and altcoins can also affect the price and demand for both. If investors profit from altcoins and start selling their Bitcoins, this can affect the price of Bitcoins. many investors still view Bitcoin as a stable and safe asset, and keep their investment in it.Quote from: justdimin on February 17, 2023, 08:40:14 PM-snip-Just realize that we can't do anything about the current situation and how many new tokens are pumped into the market everyday, and we need to learn to ignore them until they give us a reason not to.

But if you want fast money, buy early and sell when it's high. My Launchpad follows some of them and provides bigger returns, but with some fairly small allocations. But even so, a tremendous pump will occur once the coin is listed on some DEX exchanges, whoever is quick to sell it will have a lot to gain.New altcoins are only as speculative and only as a pump-and-dump practice not really affect bitcoin completely. Bitcoin adoption will continue with time, regardless of altcoin growth or not. The main investment remains in the bitcoin",
