People are starting to realize what it is all about.And what's the difference from web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. The overwhelming demand on it possibly will come when the bull run comes. P2E, I guess they're all done.There could be a massive hype again on it in the future but only for the few projects that will remain standing or else, it will be the same as the hype that it has got before and will only attract more scam projects.",

Layer 2 projects 5. NFTs first of all, Metaverse never left so I don't know why you referred to it in your list as a trend that is no longer in existence. A lot of metaverse projects are being launched all the time, you should go check Seedify launchpad and see how many metaverse projects they have launched recently likewise other similar launchpads. That being said, with the rate at which web 3 info is flying around on the internet, lots of ads on web 3 lately I think it will be the next big trend (i won't say hype) that will be very popular.",

The market is not returning to old technologies, but constantly trying to invent something new or past hypes are diligently modernized, as it was in the case of ICO, which after 4 years evolved into IDO. Since the industry itself is young, it can still generate new technologies and due to that attract more and more investors. So I do not exclude that in 2-3 years altcoin hype will be built around a completely new business model.",

Web 3.0 is something interesting, though people can't still grasp what it really is. It would be rather interesting for coin creators to make people fully understand what Web 3.0 is, and not sell their coin by saying random jargons to make it look like it's extremely technical.",

Agreed, it is clear that layer 2 projects are very powerful and have been developing very rapidly in recent years. Trends metaverse, web3, NFTs I can't predict, their future is a question mark. But with layer 2 projects it is different, they are considered an indispensable solution in supporting layer 1. Investing in layer2 projects is something that should be taken care of from now on.",
