      "body": "One way to measure love is showing empathy to the people of Nigeria. You cannot claim to love a people yet you are divisive and insensitive to our unity in diversity. Â So far we have listened to the candidates and have seen their actions and inactions. Therefore, I believe we all know who love the country and the citizens more and genuinely want to help salvage the deplorable situation of the country.",
