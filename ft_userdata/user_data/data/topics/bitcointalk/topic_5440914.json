  "content": "Building is erecting a lasting structures or project. And bitcoin has two basics structures for buildings known as buildings blocks for blockchain, it contains two most outstanding points here \"the header data\" and the body \" the header data contains the information of blocks while body contains the general concept of bitcoin transactions.How do you Build's bitcoin? Some folks hates everyday transactions of sending one piece of bitcoin to another person. Rather they prefers buildings block of it and by this we time to time heeping of bitcoin showing details transactions of spent history and updates or top up history for long term without having going through the checks and balances of several transactions felt and losses incurs.The more this records are clearly shown in your data you drives an agenda of long term investment outside bitcoin history with bitcoin buildings history. People don't rush to sell or do every minutes transactions when you're on building mission because you have a target to achieved certain goals with bitcoin and it comes a point you realizes the income strength you have built for the future.This picture below is just an examples of hash history of building bitcoin from the head to the body in good period of core values.",

      "body": "Just like having a targeted saving in fiat, there is nothing bad in building your Bitcoin base, it's good and it's a way to be dedicated to something but must be determined to do it. I've realized that there is a lot of money we waste regularly, if committed to something painstakingly, it will be a value to be appreciated over time.Sending it based on your capacity is a good thing, but it is more reasonable when this could be optimally achieved when the coin is at a low price. The return will be so much and I don't think that anyone trusting Bitcoin for long-term investment will lose in the end.",

The return will be so much and I don't think that anyone trusting Bitcoin for long-term investment will lose in the end.Buying bitcoin gradually like you are saving fiat in bank saving is good. It helps you to restrict yourself against unnecessary spendings and increase total capital you spend to buy bitcoin.\"Will not lose in the end\", I don't know but if they don't lose their bitcoin, they will probably get profit for long term investment.Because it is a long term investment, they will have to know safely ways and have good practice to create their wallets, store their bitcoins, backups and protect their backups.Leaving your coins on exchanges is bad but it is more terrible if you self storing your bitcoin and don't have backups or lose backups at the end.",
