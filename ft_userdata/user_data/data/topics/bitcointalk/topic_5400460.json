Look at his prediction on June 2021, why Bitcoin price was increase and not dump? answer this question.",

If my second assumption is correct, then people should believe crystal ball predictions more than this person so far as not owning any bitcoins at all. He can dispense with speculation freely by tying the latest negative fundamental news to each of his forecasts even though it is not really a significant influence on volatility.",

Look around, everyone was talking about adoptions and Bitcoin was in the mainstream and it's already mature that could be possible many countries will announce soon Bitcoin becomes legal tender in their place.  That's what I have seen here and I will never listen to him, he is a crypto hater too.",

You don't expect that the value of your coin will be steady while price is dropping so you can better sell it now and buy more now if you believe in the prediction but if you don't, hodl tight to what you have. Such price for me is going to be devastating to hodlers but with bitcoin anything can happen to the price.",

My question is this – How are you going to sell off when its price is finally down and then buy back? I know your operating word is a  condition with \"if\" but if you're ever contemplating it, now is the best time for you to sell off into a stablecoin and wait for Bitcoin dump to buy back more units with same amount.Don't feel too shocked if $8k happens to Bitcoin.
