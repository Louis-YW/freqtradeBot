After all, your token was in a strong exchange, unless you don't trust the Binance exchange, do you have doubts about this exchange?But if you are determined to transfer your ICP token, you can try this Bitfinity Wallet apart from STOIC Wallet as far as I know ICP is not listed in Trust wallet.",

If you intend to store it in a mobile application, you can use Earth Wallet or Plug Wallet, their applications are already available on Playstore and App Store. Sorry to be a little off topic, but I'm curious, why are you holding $ICP? do you see great potential in this coin?",

Even an unstoppable wallet does not support ICP. I don't know what is the reason for this as both trust wallet and unstoppable wallet store thousands of coins, then why not ICP?It's no use to transfer ICP to another centralized wallet, so guess I have only option to keep them in binance and hope that binance does not scam until the next bull market.Quote from: MAAManda on March 04, 2023, 08:11:16 AMSorry to be a little off topic, but I'm curious, why are you holding $ICP? do you see great potential in this coin?I don't see any great potential in this coin but the problem is that I bought this coin in the last bull market at the peak of the bull season and did not use any stop loss.

So, if you would invest 500$ in it, it will be worth less than 50$ now. So even if the price may seems down right now, if it reaches my buying price, it will be worth a reasonable money. My reason for keeping my ICP still in binance is that i am unable to find a wallet to move them.",

You buy because you believe in this project right? there should be specific reasons why you buy and believe in this project. Since the beginning of this project, I was actually skeptical about the journey that this project would go through. Indeed, I haven't specifically searched further, therefore I would like to know the opinion of $ICP holders. I was also quite surprised when I saw the price comparison of ATH ($750) and the current price which is only around $5, how could this happen?",

I bought it along with many other coins because all the coins were pumping no matter what the price. I got stuck in this coin because it was dumped after my buying and never reached my buying price again.Quote from: MAAManda on March 04, 2023, 06:31:54 PMI was also quite surprised when I saw the price comparison of ATH ($750) and the current price which is only around $5, how could this happen?Anything can happen in the crypto world, there are coins which even go to zero, so expect the unexpected in this crypto world.However i know this coin will never reach 750$ again but i would be happy if it reaches only 50$",

My reason for keeping my ICP still in binance is that i am unable to find a wallet to move them.There are many wallets to store ICP, one of the wallets that most people in my local use to store is https://plugwallet.ooo/, all wallets everyone recommends to you are good wallets to store ICP.In my own judgment, Binance is safe until the next bull season, you don't need to worry too much about storing ICP on it. Because I have too little ICP, if you have a lot, I think you should stake at Binance to increase the coin rather than withdraw to your wallet because their value has also decreased too much, and its future is not very bright. FTX crash doesn't mean Binance will crash, look at the coinbase, it's been standing for 11 years despite the previous Mt.gox crash.",

I totally understand distrusting blindly to something so complex.So my guess is that trust wallet team want's to wait until ICP is more battle tested.",
