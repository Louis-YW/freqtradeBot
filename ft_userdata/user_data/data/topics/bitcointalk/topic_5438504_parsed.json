I noticed some altcoins like GRT, AGIX, FET, FSX and OCEAN to have increased significantly recently, even when bitcoin is not increasing. If you use the 4 hours candle stick, it is like the market may still decreased, but that depend on bitcoin too and indicator can fail. If bitcoin start another bull run, those coins can increase more, but slight decrease in bitcoin will result to massive decrease on those coins. But some traders will still prefer to sell it.",

If you watch some of the youtube guys they always come up with a pattern after it confirms and when they come up with a pattern before the confirmation it's a shot in the dark. When it doesn't work they even delete the videos or change them so it looks like they were more consistent and leave only videos that confirmed. Go to 12 h chart on bitcoin between June and September 2022 and you'll find a perfect example of rising waves pattern which in your link is bullish and ends with a buy signal but in bitcoin it crashed down. I don't trade anymore but if you ask me if you should buy or sell now it means you're scared and holding bitcoin. If that makes you uncomfortable and you have a profit of more than 10% just sell and wait until you gain more confidence. Better be safe than sorry.",

Most of the time they are misleading.Yes, the pattern can be misleading, I know of a guy that short APT recently at $17, the coin increased from $3.03 to $20.03, the guy short it at $17, thinking the price will start to decrease. Only what he noticed was that the coin increased from $17 to $20.03 and he close the trade at $19. Although, the coin later in days dropped from $20.3 to $14.4 yesterday, but the market was very volatile and made him panicked and he lost. There are sometimes that someone can think it is bear market for a coin already, but the coin might continue to increase in price, a massive bull run can make bears asset to continue to liquidate.",

It becomes a lot easier to find new ones that work well if you can teach yourself how to spot them and test they'll be successful (only going off what you have seen in the past - don't try to randomly guess things it's a skill that takes a long time to develop).In this example I wonder why you've called it a pennant and not a \"measured move up\", they would both act very similar but I think the latter would be easier to trade because you're not waiting to a lower low like the pennant implies.",

If it was just as simple as looking at a pattern, wouldn’t everybody do it ?It doesn’t work that way. You need to use more indicators and sentiment. When we are very bullish then there is a good chance a bullish pattern will work. If we are bearish then most likely a bullish pattern won’t work and vice versa. You need to get a general sense of what the market is doing and then use TA to enter a trade.",

It means from 6.25 after the block halving the block reward will be 3.125BTC so supply will drop and I believe the demand may increase due to the block halving which can lead to a Bitcoin price skyrocketing.I don't know exactly how long but if you already made a profit then make sure to gradually exchange them into USDT until you reach the new ATH.",

If your goal is just to make a profit regardless of how low or high it is, you could sell when the market recovers but if you want to gain a bigger profit, just hold and wait for the bullish season to approach.

They also do trading on the side because for them, time is money so they won't just sit and wait there for their Bitcoin investment to grow but they must move on and find extra hustles to boost their income.For the newbies in the scene, it would be better if they start at short-term first so that once they feel good about the profits that they get, they will now be addicted with it and they will eventually try long-term because they also want to know how it's like to sell bitcoin at $100k or above. Another reason why is that newbies are excited and lacks of patience.",
