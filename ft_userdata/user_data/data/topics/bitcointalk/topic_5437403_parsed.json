Are you running your own server?e.g.: \"Electrum Personal Server\", \"Electrs\", \"ElectrumX\", etc.For the setup, follow this tutorial from Electrum's official documentation: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tor.html",

Electrum is not supposed to connect to Bitcoin Core directly.Electrum is supposed to connect to an Electrum compatible server (ElectrumX, Electrs, EPS, and some others), and this Electrum server connects/works with a Bitcoin Core node.So, if you want to connect to your local Bitcoin Core node with your Electrum, you will need to install an Electrum server too.Or ... I think that Sparrow Wallet may be able to connect directly to Bitcoin node and it's not that different from Electrum.",

If it's not a public node, and only 1 person or a few people are hitting it a configuration like that will let you do core & electrum server & LN with no issues.Biggest bottleneck would be the drive or bandwidth depending on your internet connection. Could probably still go from bare to fully synced in under 5 days.And depending on where you live refurbished machines with those or better specifications are under $150-Dave",

So are you saying im missing an electrum server and this will resolve?You've missed something from there:Quote from: https://armantheparman.com/connect-electrum-desktop-wallet-to-your-bitcoin-node/I will show you how to connect an Electrum Desktop Wallet to your Bitcoin Node. First, you will need an Electrum Server running. There are many types of Electrum Servers. In my articles above, I include instructions on how to install Electrum Personal Server, but there is also Electrum Server in Rust, and Electrum X/Spesmilo.The articles above also take you through the installation of the Electrum Desktop Wallet.Whichever Electrum Server you have, this article will apply.Unfortunately you have none, hence, yes, after you install an electrum server (and leave it running for a while to build its database), you should be OK.That same guy has a tutorial for Electrum Personal Server. But if you want a smarter server where you can use Electrum with multiple wallets and also (optionally) a blockchain explorer, I have a tutorial too (for Windows users) here on this forum.",

      "body": "Also, if you don't want to do it yourself following the guide that NeuroticFish has there are a few pre-done nodes in a box that you can setup as a VM if you don't want to dedicate hardware to it:https://umbrel.com/#startorhttps://mynodebtc.com/downloadThey are the 2 more popular ones, there are a bunch of other options, but if you are looking to be supported sticking with the more popular setups will save you a bit of time if you need to go to their communities for support with an issue.-Dave",

I have a linux laptop with bitcoin core on it that i was using for bitcoin banking purposes only, same laptop trying to connect electrum to. Looks like solution has been found. thank you all for suggestions, and apologies i overlooked something so silly. I appreciate your time",
