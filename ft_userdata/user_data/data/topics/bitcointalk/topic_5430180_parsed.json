      "body": "Did you wanna say that if a player wanna try to win the world cup trophy and then he must be joining with PSG to be able to win the world cup trophy? I think that's only coincidence. People might think if that was make a sense but i personally would be disagreed with it. The thing that i believe if the result from world cup would be giving impact to the bookies over PSG. It seems like that PSG's odd will be affecting when it will be facing bayern in the last 16 of champion league as mbappe and messi are on the same club.",

Maybe this has happened by chance that the two players are from one club. Messi is lucky maybe if he was still in Barcelona the cup would not get to him in his lifetime.",

But it is true that PSG looking for talent is the best, they always bring experienced people to the club, the history of players will be important for club. Neymar Messi but for Mbappe I think they are lucky to have this guy, he was offered to move Real Madrid but he chose PSG. At PSG playing with the seniors of football made this man very perfect his young age.",

Also, players of the highest caliber would naturally want to join a club that can pay them the highest amount of $$$, and what other clubs can offer that all the while ensuring that the career of the player is preserved due to their reputation? I think Messi isn't lucky; he has worked so hard to be where he is right now, and that to me is dedication and talent, not just luck.",

When the opportunity opened up, Al-Khelaifi was willing to fulfill Messi's wishes in his contract.PSG is the best club and is also supported by very strong finances, so that any player he thinks is good can be brought in by PSG.",

Nice to see that it was spread over different countries. Di Maria, Neymar, Mbappe all from 3 different countries. And now I will no doubt forget a few more who also participated. The owner of PSG is also from Qatar and is very wealthy. The club is made up of money, you can see that in the players. They've gotten better in recent years.",

Although you are right that psg has  good class of players and individually these players have achieved enough in their football careers but the main point here is that all the above mentioned players won the world cup after they sign and played for psg.But what baffles me most about this psg club is that with all the great players that have played for psg, they still  haven't won the uefa champions league which is truly a dissapointment for such a big club like psg.",
