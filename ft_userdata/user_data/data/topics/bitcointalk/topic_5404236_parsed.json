The browser did always brought up many news about cryptocurrencies, most of the news I read are about DeFi, NFTs, but most especially DAO, nothing more that I was reading than DAO hacks and the money stolen are in millions of dollars, I was thinking probably they were repeating old hack news because the news popping up were to many related to DAO hack, but when I investigated further, the hack were all recent to that time and true.There is nothing special about altcoins, they are not decentralized, from centralized, ponzi, pump and dump ICOs to IDOs, DeFi, NFTs and others. They are all not decentralized. The name is decentralized from DAO, but they are all centralized. Also about DeFi, name is decentralized but it is also centralized. Do not be deceived.",

It simply means everyone or anyone can have the power to vote without interference from centralized authorities. The problem with the current set up is that teams still have some power to influence the result of the voting. An example is the fact that token owners have to pass some eligibility test like a holding period before they can vote.",

Altcoins they themselves are centralized, because behind the project there is a team of developers who can use various techniques, from pre-mining to changes in the code or backdoors or obey regulators.",

If you see 100 DAO/DEFI projects out there, only 1 to 5 of them have legit decentralization and all others are managed by the team that created it.This is why I have to say that the best thing we could do about the current situation right now is the fact that we should be staying away from most of them and only focus on the few that does it well enough. So all in all, this isn't a warning towards \"all\" projects, because some are legit and owned by everyone, this is about telling people how the market is filled with scam ones and be careful about those.",
