  "content": "Motivated by recent events [1-2], I decided to compile a list of sensible advice that forum users can take to improve their privacy. More suggestions are of course welcome!To be clear: Bitcointalk is a centralized forum, whose operator(s) may or may not [3] have to hand out IP addresses and other personally identifiable information in the worst case. Full IP addresses and geolocation data retained for months or even years. Your posts are [4-6] archived basically forever. Do not post privately identifiable information about yourself. Do not post information that ties your Bitcointalk identity to other online identities. Use a dedicated Email address for your Bitcointalk account. Opt into limited IP retention. Use Tor Browser to access Bitcointalk. Bookmark your personal Captcha Bypass URL to avoid JavaScript and connection to Google (as well as the hassle of solving those). Stake your Bitcoin address for account recovery (since IP-based won't work now). Ironically: mix, tumble, CoinJoin or submarine-swap your campaign funds to a Lightning wallet. Anything that improves your on-chain privacy.I am aware that Tor is not perfect and not entirely untraceable and that better privacy measures do exist, but these should provide you with relatively good privacy at little 'extra cost'. Especially with that captcha code, and the lightweight nature of the forum without lots of fancy, big graphics, it is extremely usable through Tor.Tor Browser exists for Windows, MacOS, Linux, but also Android!https://www.torproject.org/download/#androidFor iOS, 'Onion Browser' exists and is recommended by the Tor Project:https://onionbrowser.com/[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1935179.msg61920144#msg61920144[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1935098.msg61916953#msg61916953[3] https://bitcointalk.org/privacy.php[4] https://ninjastic.space/search[5] https://loyce.club/archive/posts/[6] https://archive.today",

      "body": "Well, too late  And that's the thing with privacy: once it's gone, you can't get it back.When I started with Bitcoin, I was bright enough to use a random generator to create a username. But I now realize that isn't enough, and I never expected to use it this long. By now I've also used it on other sites. I can't take that back without giving up everything I've done in the past 8 years, and being a Newbie again. So having a reputation doesn't go with having privacy.",

What I mean by that: your primary email address may change, your physical location may change, the list goes on. A record of your personal information from 2019 may be mostly worthless today. The information may all be wrong by now.Quote from: Findingnemo on March 19, 2023, 05:13:50 PMPrivacy is not my ultimate priority but who really needs should practice all the points mentioned by OP to achieve it.I noticed that you are advertising for Roobet; a mostly unregulated crypto casino registered in Curacao. It may be desirable for your real identity not to be linked to Roobet, due to obvious reasons.Quote from: Ratimov on March 19, 2023, 05:38:04 PMTOR is terribly inconvenient, I'd rather continue to use Opera. Most users do not need it at all, as well as its useI disagree; you should try it out. In my experience, websites did load pretty slowly a few years back. But nowadays, it has gotten a lot better, especially if the website doesn't need JavaScript and doesn't use lots of graphics (like Bitcointalk).Quote from: Ratimov on March 19, 2023, 05:38:04 PMthis option is more suitable for those who are completely turned on privacy or those who have something to hide.Everyone has something to hide. For example their affiliation with crypto casinos. Others earn money online without declaring it to the taxman. And even others post their opinions freely on here, meanwhile those opinions aren't legal to post in the country they're living in. Lots of reasons, scenarios and risk profiles. In general, you probably want to better be safe than sorry. Quote from: Ratimov on March 19, 2023, 05:38:04 PMThere is a strong opinion that privacy is a myth, and if really want to, will still find you.I'm not arguing that my recommendations fully protect you if you are a highly sought-after criminal, but it's a 'bare minimum' that can go a long way.Quote from: Ratimov on March 19, 2023, 05:38:04 PMI don't understand how this relates to privacy. How does this relate to my privacy? It's more of a security issue.If you hide your IP and use the privacy measures mentioned, you cannot restore your password by e.g. sending a message from the IP you last logged in with. I think that's what the warning in the Bitcointalk account settings hints at, so I wanted to present an alternative in case that ever happens to someone.",

I work more on my mobile device on this forum, I tested the Tor browser, it loads this forum fast (I may update the desktop version to test it too). But one of the reasons I prefer my browser is because it does not log me out, it keeps the tabs I have opened before intact and also the dark mode. I like the dark mode at night. But if privacy is advised on this forum, I think it is a good thing. Ways to privacy is not easy, but people that are very rich in bitcoin or other crypto should be concerned about privacy.

Most of them look like \"(f#L!{p[oKGzz[2aV$'[P6!n$\", and I'm not even going to try to remember them.That's the type of password everyone should be using. It's your choice if you try to remember them or not but believe me, if you try, that's not difficult to remember. Type that hard password frequently for months, for a year and then you'll realize that you have memorized it so well that you can type it with your eyes closed.Quote from: n0nce on March 20, 2023, 11:30:04 AMQuote from: Synchronice on March 19, 2023, 07:44:44 PMQuote from: n0nce on March 19, 2023, 04:42:24 PM Use Tor Browser to access Bitcointalk.Tor without VPN is a bad idea, you should hide your Tor activity from your ISP. It's always good idea to use Qubes OS, a Linux distribution instead of Windows and combine it with good VPN and Tor. I'll use this moment and share a List of VPN Service Providers - 2023A VPN is a central point of failure potential spying, so that's why I do not blanketly recommendÂ  using VPNs. They have their use cases, but may not be a good idea for everyone.Is it better idea to show your ISP that you are using Tor? Don't you think it's alarming? You may use tor just for your privacy but a lot of people use it for illegal activities, your ISP doesn't care what your actual purpose is, your are under their radar.",

Â Nor does Chipmixer even stand out in my mind as anything special in terms of crypto debacles aside from the fact that I and many others didn't know what was *apparently* happening, or what would happen.Part of me thinks this has become such a big deal on the forum because their signature campaign was extremely selective and had a lot of not only excellent posters but trusted members as well, and they like to see them get a sort-of comeuppance. Â Like Schadenfreude, you know?Or maybe that's me just being my misanthropic self again. Â Nasty mindset to get out of, let me tell you.",

You don't know who you are sending your address to.In my opinion, being careful on the forum is not especially necessary (even if I actively support the principle you defend in this post), because I am sure that a lot of members can be already linked to a deposit/withdrawal made from a CEX via an address they posted here. Even with all the effort, the CEX will cooperate with law enforcement if necessary, and the efforts to protect themselves here will have been for nothing.",
