I was advised to update the drivers to make it make more (before 83mh) updated drivers and exit malfunction",

Only the 3080 is not working?Other cards are working and mining?If you give more details, it will be easy to try to help youI suggest you to install a fresh new HiveOS, with all the cards together, maybe you're using only AMDs and somehow drivers crashed or didn't installed properlyIf you already checked riser and psu cables, try to change the position of card too",

I have already replaced riser, changed power supply cables etc.If your motherboard is broken, then why are you changing the raiser and power cable?I first disconnect all video cards, check the processor socket, install a test video card, such as a GT 220, and test the motherboard on a tested power supply.",

If you use AMD or Nvidia 1000-2000 series, then you probably won't need to update drivers and hive OS. For new video cards, new miners came out with a decrease in consumption, but in reality this is imperceptible.",
