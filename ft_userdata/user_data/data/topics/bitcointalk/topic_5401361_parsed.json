What about you what's your take.I have been many times in the event when I have lost a lot of money as I was chasing bonus round in some slots.Once I lost everything before getting the bonus round not once I immediately quit and think to not get back in gambling.Then a few days or a couple of weeks pass without gambling and I think to myself maybe I did the wrong thing to quit as the bonus round maybe was just behind the corner so I get back trying again and sometimes I win this way.However in both cases I have learned to control myself and in both cases I quit gambling whichever the case,win or lose,this has helped me to not dive deep down in the dark areas of addiction.",

That's why I don't 'push' my luck very often because it always ends up in disappointments if I tried to play for the win even though I know that it's certainly an L in the end. When something feels good all of a sudden, especially if your luck suddenly turned, stop while your ahead, and call it a day.",

But gambling never left me. I came back to gambling again after exactly 2-1 days. And I have won a lot. Now gambling is in the blood.  No human can survive without blood.  It is difficult for gamblers to survive without such gambling",

Wanting to take back what we think was originally ours  (in reality it isn't anymore since we lost it to the casino) is a rather normal mindset, especially if we consider how this thing we think of is well, money. Sometimes it's a great experience since we're able to take it back, sometimes it's just worse than hell.",

What about you what's your take.Countless how many times the loss is obtained, but as with gambling, we must remain controlled and as healthy as possible with the simple logic of playing in controlled conditions. Putting forward the desire to get a bigger bonus profit in fact made me not really in a state of self-control. Little by little learn not to fall every day. Reduce the betting schedule once a week. Until it got to the point where I really just entertained myself.",

This is probably not a good idea if you feel like quitting why not take a walk for some time before running back to try your luck just play to have fun.",

I know it is usually a cross road deciding at that point if to continue or call it quits for the day, but it is usually more responsible to take earnings for that day.

What about you what's your take.Luck is not always there and sometimes when it comes I just take advantage of it to carry on to some extent. If you managed to win today's $2K bet from $200 capital then there's no harm in trying to keep betting for some $$$ just to try some more luck. We never know what the maximum win of the day will be if we don't try, but you should stop when you feel it's time.It's a little greedy to keep betting after you've won something that seems big, but it's okay if you have a limit on going out and coming back the next day. It's just about a lucky day but you should consider stopping and enjoying the win.",
