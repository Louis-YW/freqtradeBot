  "content": "Why are some lawmakers bitter towards Bitcoin. Whenever a bank collapses, they quickly attribute it to Bitcoin. If there is hyperinflation, they say it is Bitcoin that caused it. I am terribly sick and tired of this. For example, Johan Van Overtveldt, a member of the European Parliament and the former Minister of Finance of Belgium, said in a tweet that Crypto(with bitcoin being the chief of them) should be banned in the same way that governments ban drugs1. Bitcoin didn't do nothing. Instead, it is the terrible policies of the politicians and their bad leadership that cause these financial institutions to fail. Imagine if they were in control of bitcoin, it wouldn't have gone past 5 years.The article mentioned that soon, members of parliament would vote on regulating digital assets licensing for the European Union. I don't even know how to feel about this if it falls through.How do you feel whenever you read stuff like this on the internet?Do you agree that bitcoiners should compile a record of politicians who oppose it? So that when elections come around, they will have the knowledge necessary to select only candidates who support crypto as suggested by Charles Hoskinson?What do you think would happen to bitcoin if the European Parliament votes against revolutionary digital asset licensing regulations for the European Union1. https://bitcoinist.com/on-crypto-drugs/",
