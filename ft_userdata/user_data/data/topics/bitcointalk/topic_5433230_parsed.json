You know how malware is a big problem when it comes to things involving money, especially crypto.1. According to your announcement, you didn't list so good p2p marketplaces like bisq, hodlhodl. Any plans to include them in your platform?2. I only see a windows application, are you going to make apps for the MacOS and Linux versions? How about mobile apps?Thanks for your comments!1. Sure. There's no problem to add any marketplace if it has API. We'll add all the exchanges our customers ask for, including those. The priority to add a marketplace depends on how often the clients ask to add one.2. I believe it should work on MacOs and Linux. We just never tested it yet, hence just wrote about Windows¬†  All the current users work on Windows; if it turns out that say MacOs is requested and it doesn't work, we'll fix this. P2PTrader.Pro is Electron app based on Chromium so it's multi-platform by design.As for the worry about malware etc, I understand the concern. But honestly, even if malware would have no legal and other risks, it just makes no sense to spend time creating a fake app for such a limited market. I believe all the malware creators would prefer apps targeted for waaay wider audience.",
