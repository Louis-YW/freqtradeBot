  "content": "That being said we know everything about tokens or coins. But we don't know much about how these tokens are created. Today we will all learn how to create a project token. As I will say, you can also create a new token by working this way. Hope you understand.A token can be created in two ways:1. By coding.2. Through a simple site.I will show you now the easy way because coding takes a lot of time. And if you want to do it through code, you have to learn the complete system of code. So I will use the simple method.A coin or token is of two types namely:1. Mainnet2. TestnetMainnet and testnet token generation rules are same. I will create testnet because dollar will be needed to create mainnet token. And for testnet I can take free dollar.To generate tokens first you need to install metamask wallet on your computer or mobile.Then add testnet account from main account. Then testnet bnb should be brought to this account.I added bnb. Just follow the picture.https://www.smartcontracts.tools/token-generator/bsc/After that, if you come down a little, you will get these options.After that, if you come down a little, you will get these options.It will take some time to be successful, please wait. After success click on transaction hash.Then entry to Metamask wallet again.Since the post is too long, I have not mentioned the two steps here:1. How to add testnet account from mainnet account.2. How to add testnet BNB to wallet.I will make another post about these two topics, I hope you don't mind.",
