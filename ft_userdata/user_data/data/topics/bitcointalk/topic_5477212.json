  "content": "I came across this post at the reputation section captioned \"Goodbye bitcointalk\" and after he posted he locked the thread whereby no one will be able to comment or asked him/her questions about his action and final decision to take his walk away from here. Now lemme brief it down, when I started here as a beginner and as someone who is trying to make things more better and changing to increase in quality posting and ways of becoming more helpful I have took BlackHatCoiner as a personal friend (Role model) and some others as persons whom I do look into their profile to keep myself courageous., Now that he has decided to take a walk away from bitcointalk did he know that he is a role model to people secretly and, how positively or negatively is he affecting to those who loves him or wanting to increase their ways by choosing someone to as a role model despite they aren't interacting in any ways or whatsoever. Currently I do not keep to follow anyone or even having to act as them, the truth is everyone should learn to be strong enough to developed their ways of learning and posting I am only posting this due to how I have been able to scale true through their footsteps and keeping myself busy then with their ways of contribution I can say they are steppingstone to my journey here. I can't list them all but I know some of them I have added o my Trustlist due to how they are helpful to me. However, I can't question him or anyone who has chosen a better parts of their life's or has decided to take a walk out of here because they finds something more remunerative. What just touched my soul was his goodbye message. I know he is not from my local but to me it seems we loose someone very helpful to people because many newbies and upcoming users has everyone they fancy (Love).Now what happened to his or her account Locked or Deactivate?",

Maybe you wanted to write your own remark about how inspiring he was to you. You should have adjusted the topic in a way that looks more on point than leaving it the way it is. At my first glance, I was thinking I would be seeing something totally different from what I've read so far and your topic almost portray something different entire. I believe what has a beginning will surely have an end so we only have some time to spend in this forum and that's the major main reason why we have to be positive and create straight and remarkable presence here.

Learning to be self dependent and reliance count the most because whenever you are used to such nature and ways of doing things when your favorite user takes a leave (quit) using the forum they won't find any weakness.",

You make it sound like we are only here for signature campaigns, and only leave when there is more money to be made elsewhere. BlackHatCoiner already made it public that he was taking a break from the forum for personal reasons and I would like to think he locked the thread to avoid these kind of discussions. Like OP, I will miss him but I don’t think it’s right to pry or make assumptions on the reason why he left.Quote from: SmartGold01 on December 09, 2023, 07:17:36 PMNow what happened to his or her account Locked or Deactivated?

Bitcointalk is just like every other site where people meet interact and shares common ideas together when you don't find it interesting anymore it's assume either they are tired of staying around here or age is no longer on their sides to have decided to work on their existence for them to further expand their lives. There are people who don't work here as signature benefits rather this guy's only focuses on WO, while those who chooses to advertise projects may not finds it interesting to continue whatever adverts they are running but doesn't mean he ran away because of sig no no far away from that already these guys already made it life can decide to focused on utilizing their businesses out there.",

I guess Blackhatcoiner may also return in the future, or he's retired and decides to live the rest of his life outside the forum. It could be any reason, but whatever it is, we could still make reference to any of his useful topics. The account status has been shown by SatoPrincess; it may be abandoned, but you can still visit topics and comments made by him on his profile. If he is your role model, then you still have his profile to look through.If I could guess why Blackhatcoiner had to lock that topic you share, it's obviously because he or she doesn't want any further discussion about him, but here we go, wondering why he left. Meanwhile, he has said he would not mention his reason and never wanted anyone to drop a comment, so he had to lock the topic.",

I've been here for years, and though I didn't interact with BlackHatCoiner all that much I agree with you that it sucks when a relative old-timer (there's not many true ones left from the early years) leaves, especially when they've had an effect on you.  I felt the same thing when Vod left, and even Lauda too, despite all the controversy surrounding the latter.  They both supported me early on, and it's strange to think about some faceless internet persona being able to evoke any kind of feeling--but I'm a creature born well before the internet was created, so that's probably why it seems strange.But hey, BlackHatCoiner might return.  Seems like when people say goodbye to the forum, they usually can't stay gone permanently.",
