I'm not convinced that it would serve the forum's own interests.I'm not against your idea of creating a kycnot.me clone, but I think that associating it with the forum could indirectly cause problems for the forum and its community.What's more, kycnot.me is extremely efficient, and as for the current (but minor) updating problems, o_e_l_e_o's reply has already provided all the necessary explanations.I also think you'll have a hard time turning kycnot.me users away from this site, since they've already been established for a long time, people trust them, and they're a reference in the field. I personally think it would be better to support this team already in place, either by simply using their services, or by making a donation. I think this would be more in favor of the general interest than creating a new website providing the same service.",

As you said, making website is easiest part, but maintaining ot and making updates is more difficult. Probably it would be nice to have such kind of website runed by community. By saying runed by community I mean that it would be managed by few people from Bitcointalk. It's ok when people notify you about changes, but you still will have to make updates on site alone.

Back then when I used your website, I was looking for SMS service, googled all of them and only one or two was trustworthy, the rest of the listed websites were scam.That's what I try. Every service that's been tested personally by me has a double blue check mark, indicating that I have verified that it works manually: https://kycnot.me/about#verificationBut that's not a forever-verification. Services can change, so I try to regularly check services, but that's a very time-consuming task, and also I have to put my money in risk every time I test them out. For this, it would be great if anyÂ  user that encounters some valuable information about a service (like you did with some SMS services) sends that information to me, by an issue, or commenting the service's issue: https://gitlab.com/kycnot/services/-/issues.
