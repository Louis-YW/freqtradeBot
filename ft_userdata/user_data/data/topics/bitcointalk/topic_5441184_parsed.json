Whether I'm right or not, I think it would be nice to have the info about the country you're talking about in the original post. I haven't heard of this company before. Is it a centralized payment service for crypto transactions? Does it convert the funds into fiat for merchants, or does it help them accept Bitcoin specifically (without converting it into fiat)? I'm happy that Bitcoin payments are spreading in your country, and in a way I understand why people turn to third-party services for that: while people could send Bitcoin directly to a specific address, that could also take a while, and a centralized service is, I imagine, working instantly.",

After all, Moneybees partnered with all tam bunting pawnshops.Most of the Tambunting branches are scattered in different places in the Philippines, Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao have it, so the community can easily become familiar with crypto when it is taught properly and correctly.",

Do you mean you can pay your mortgage in bitcoin or is it converted into local currency previously?Good question. As far as I can tell, there is no explicit mention that their partners will accept crypto. Not to mention it is basically an OTC/exchange service. Their partnership nature is not clear either. Do you find other news/mentions from those websites regarding this issue? I can't find one on Monebeeys website. On their terms[1] page, If I understood it correctly, partners just refer to those who have business partnerships and most of them are related to offering a spot for OTC transactions[1].

I can't find one on Monebeeys website.Therefore, I believe it was an exaggerated statement born out of enthusiasm. The fact that bitcoin would be accepted directly to make mortgage payments should have been relevant news that would have travelled the world, at least the digital media specialising in cryptocurrencies, and some of the general media, but if we are talking about converting bitcoin to fiat and using that fiat to pay the mortgage, that's another matter.",

Do you mean you can pay your mortgage in bitcoin or is it converted into local currency previously?-   Not like that mate, the assessment of yours is wrong. It's like this, for example you go to Tambunting, and you want to buy bitcoin for ₱10,000 worth of BTC, what Tambunting will do is they will give you a quotation how much BTC you will get from your ₱10,000 then you will provide them a BTC address Or QR code.Because the price of Bitcoin that you will buy at Tambunting Pawnshop will be based on the value listed in Moneybees. But the Bitcoin you buy here cannot be used to pay the mortgages you redeem if ever you have a jewelry or whatever that is pawn to this branch. I hope I have answered your question.....",

It also creates the impression that Bitcoin is indeed something acceptable, that it isn't a Ponzi scheme or any kind of illegal investment scam. That's at least a significant improvement from the old public perception of Bitcoin. After all, this business is duly registered under the country's central bank. I've read that OTC transactions do not charge fees. I just hope the spread is not that predatory. However, it should be noted that KYC is certainly required.",
