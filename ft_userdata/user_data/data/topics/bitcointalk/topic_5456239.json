The CPI Data was released at 4% and it's good enough, even lower than expected from my side but I don't know if Bitcoin will benefit from this.Smart Bitcoin traders om here, haven't Bitcoin lost the strong support of the 200MA already or are we still on track? Because if it's lost then we are going down to 21k or close to 21k, unless a miracle transpires.",

The judge in the sec case declined a temporary restraining order which would have frozen company assets. But now it can still conduct its business even as it is being sued. I think we still have a long ways to go before this mess is over with.

This is good development to be heard since we can see the law on US is fair to anyone and now its up for binance to do their part to show to the guy stopping them that he us erong and binance is innocent on accusations to them.",
