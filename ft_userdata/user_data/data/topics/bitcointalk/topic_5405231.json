  "content": "Paper money is a country's official fiat that is circulated for the transaction of goods and services. It's emergence in the US dates back to 1690 https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/paper-money-usa.asp&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjcldGcieH4AhXaS0EAHX9AC0QQFXoECAQQAg&usg=AOvVaw3OU2oUH8VxEOCtN21yemS6  and was used to represent bills of credit and IOUs. Paper currency is cheap to produce and also easy to use but can be fragile and subject to loss in value due to inflation and change in public opinion. July 4th, or the fourth of July, 2022 marks the US 246th independence in 1776, and admist the pop and fun fare, it is noteworthy to include the important role BTC has played in helping citizens to gain monetary independence from their local Fiat.Thomas Jefferson gave the best illustration of paper money in his quote and I've never agreed better.   \"paper is poverty, that it is the ghostof money, and not the money itself\" Thomas JeffersonBy saving in BTC and holding private keys, you become liberated from the flawed financial system of a country. It has proven severally of possessing the ability to bring about freedom. Many argue that it has no use case and no value but in Afghanistan, women have been using it to build financial freedom, and this a place where women are banned from doing so with normal Fiat. In a recent incidence where the head of State of a country tried locking down accounts of peaceful protesters in a bid to scatter the protest failed due to Bitcoin crowdfunding, his efforts were  beaten. In essence, BTC is the ideal hedge against tyranny. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/on-july-4th-use-bitcoin-and-protect-freedom.",

Many users store their Bitcoins on centralized exchanges which can always freeze or limit you from making withdrawals; hence you are depending on a third party to gain access to your assets.By combining a non custodian wallet (like electrum) and a P2P decentralized exchange (like bisq), you can fully use Bitcoin freely.There are other steps you can take like running your own node, using coin mixers etc to achieve higher levels of privacy.",

Bitcoin was programmed to give individuals control over their funds and the choice to how the utilize theirs is completely dependent on them just like you don't tell the owner of a car when to drive them same way you don't suggest to a private key holder how to spend their coin. One interesting thing that will accompany Bitcoin if it ever gain global adoption is steady electricity is developing countries because of it power consumption",

      "body": "In my opinion, I feel it is well said that \"bitcoin is a freedom money\" just simply because of its cryptographic nature and the liberty it gives its users compared to that of Fiat currency, but even in the midst of these, Fiat currency is still far adopted in many countries till date and the possibility that Cryptocurrency would be fully adopted by many nations of the world is very slim. So while bitcoin is a freedom money, the ones in power do not want people to have that financial freedom, therefore preventing people from legally having access to the freedom money (Bitcoin).",

I continue to maintain that Bitcoin indirectly draws it's value from fiat, whether we want to admit it or not. Isn't that why whatever value Bitcoin is, is measured in fiat? Of course, it's. Whether we are exchanging it for goods and services or noting its price, we always have it in fiat equivalent. Even right here in this forum, BTC campaign participants get paid in dollar that's Bitcoin equivalent.OP, I truly don't get what you mean by \"freedom money\". One would think that Bitcoin is randomly dropped into people's wallets by your assertion. I've been in this crypto industry since 2017 and I haven't experienced any such thing as free money. People get to work for the Bitcoin they earn. No free money anywhere. If there's, you should suspect that something is fishy.",

The whole idea has been to remain decentralized and it is decentralized not until you add a 3rd party which in turn takes your place and execute commands on your behalf. Centralized exchanges has been a cross to the freedom one can derive from bitcoin as opposed to government institutes that could hodl fiat, print more or print less to create inflation and others, exchanges could do the same. Lock your coin, close down your account, claim your coins and more then, you come to realise that you've relinquished your freedom to the exchange.This is some of the parts bitcoin needs to cross in order to be a more perfect currency by having an actual use case where you don't need exchanges to swap for fiat and spend as need be. General accordance needs to step in and we are sure to enjoy it at its most. Good thing the LighteningNetwork has step in to speed up transaction rates.
