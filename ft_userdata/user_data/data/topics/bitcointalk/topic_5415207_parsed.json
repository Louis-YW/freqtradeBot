And then we have the NFT's and Metaverse hype still up in the air. And the the merge by Ethereum, XRP recently has a good run when there were speculations that they might win their case against SEC.This is the only thing that is on the top of my heard right now.

Commenting on bounty is something different. But even for this, at least there are comments that contribute to the forum. At least people are not after this kind of blogging.

The title of the article posted by the OP is \"Top 6 cryptocurrency trends 2022\", not \"Top 6 cryptocurrency in 2022\".
