  "content": "Every one has different ways of seeing things on their own sides and their are persons who don't know the importance of quality post and how it helps on the forum especially so I want to share a new topic about it because is of help to this forum, I want to drop it here because plenty of people come here to ask questions (beginners & help board).IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY POST: It helps to improve the knowledge of other users especially the newbie, a quality post is very easy to understand and also relate with.If a post is not QUALITY enough a lot of bitcointalkers will not make a comment on the post and the discussion will not be interesting as well, if people fines it difficult to relate to your post you will be ignored for a while or even for ever, so new users should try and make posts quality so it can be easy to relate with. I just feel like sharing these.THANKS.",

It's good to educate others on something, especially newbies who are new to the system, but to me, I see you as someone who also needs correction in some areas. Newbies are not just newly registered people on the forum; they may look like newbies based on their Rank title, but their contributions and ways of reasoning will say otherwise. You are already on the member rank, which means I believe you have little experience on the forum, but I will still advise you to go through this thread . Newbies: Stop Teaching When You Need To Learn.  by GiftedMAN. Post quality is not just achieved by creating threads; comments should also be considered quality posts. If you are the type that takes correction, I believe you will work on yourself too and figure out areas in which you should really work on yourself.There was one of your threads that I dropped a comment on, and although it was a little hatch, it seems to me that the thread has been deleted, which is not the best way to do things. People learn from correction where necessary.",

      "body": "Many new members on the forum don't understand the basic forum rules and netiquette or how to behave online. I think it's because the younger generation is not familiar with the old-school forums that came from Usenet.Today, social media and instant messaging are more popular than traditional forums. Younger people are used to instant and casual interactions, so they may find forums strange or old-fashioned. In my opinion, this is one of the main reasons why people write low-quality threads and posts. When they are not aware of the guidelines, they end up posting low quality stuff that lacks substance or respect. Especially the younger generation, who grew up with different types of social platforms, may not understand traditional forums. They are used to fast and immediate interaction, so they may not know how to lead a proper discussion on the forum or how to create interesting and high-quality content that engages the discussion.",

This is not harsh but the pour truth on the subject matter because I don't see this thread as necessary if you truly looked at it closely because thos subject matters have been discussed before in multiple topics related tothe  quality posting.

For me, when I see a newbie making some random post, I don't see it as merit fishing unless they constantly keep on doing it; that's when it might become offensive and I could consider it a merit fishing post. There are also a lot of posts that newbies make that have previously been discussed, but in those previously made posts, more light can still be added, as there are always possible gaps that could be discovered in already concluded content. In cases like that, other authors can cover those areas that seem to need more light.",

Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who will leave their comments even on a completely meaningless post because they just want to add another post because of their signature campaign or activity points. What is true is that such users are very likely to end up on the ignore list of many other users, but I prefer to report such posts because hiding the problem under the carpet is not something that benefits the forum, but only individuals.In addition, the quality of posts is not something we can precisely determine because members have different criteria, and beginners are often confused when they see someone rewarding a post of just a few words or one sentence - but the thing is that it is not always the quality that is crucial, but the post can be funny or sarcastic, and some members will want to reward it.Quality is important, but there are some other factors that should not be forgotten, because after all this distinguishes us from artificial intelligence, which is increasingly present on the forum.",
