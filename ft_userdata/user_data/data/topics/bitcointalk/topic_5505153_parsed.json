Indeed, the success of Bitcoin depends not only on the behavior of market participants, but also on its unique supply mechanism. Moreover, I think that over time, after the total supply of Bitcoin reaches 21 million, the value of Bitcoin will be more like a collection value. This non-renewable feature makes it have the characteristics of digital gold to a certain extent.",

But why is it that now, when cryptocurrency has gradually been widely known by many people and applied to life, there are still so many people who are resisted? Is this an intolerance or resistance to new things?There are many reasons why Bitcoin is not in every home. For example, many countries have very strict regulations regarding cryptocurrencies, in many it is even completely prohibited. Not everyone has to be interested in it, it is even recommended for those who do not understand some basics of Bitcoin, and blockchain not to enter it until they learn at least the basics.By the way, every person in the world knows about gold and that it has value, but again, the vast majority do not keep their assets in gold. And that has little to do with any resistance.Quote2.

Is this so? If so, how does the exchange ensure the security of funds in independent wallets?I would not comment much on how exchanges store coins, as far as I know, they have hot and cold wallets. Again, as I said earlier, exchanges are not intended for storing coins, but for trading. This is my final answer to all your doubts, if you are thinking about a wallet where you will hold assets, no exchange is good enough for that.Not to mention a hack as a potential risk, almost every exchange has faced it at least once, look at the case of FTX exchange, which went bankrupt and of course left with all the funds of its users. Quote3. Yes, my access rights were lost. I bought nearly 900 bitcoins in the early days, but the mnemonic of the wallet could not be retrieved for login. Secondly, for these bitcoins with lost access rights, will they never be accessible?Sorry to hear that. I suggest you present the whole problem here, do you have any wallet file or something, I am sure you will get the best advice, and maybe you will get lucky with access to coins.Without access to the wallet (whether you or someone else), your 900 BTC will be there forever.",

Which statement is more convincing?The value of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. Because the number of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million, when the number of Bitcoins in circulation is very large, approaching the total number, the determination of the value of Bitcoin as a digital currency can be due to scarcity and cannot be counterfeited, such as increasing the number or reducing the number.Why is the value of Bitcoin associated with the law of supply and demand? It can be found in many articles because I am also not very good at explaining to you to avoid mistakes that can have a bad impact on me.Bitcoin is a currency that can survive in the long term that cannot be controlled by third parties.Why does every fiat currency experience a decrease in value?

Is this an intolerance or resistance to new things?You are missing the point.  Supply and demand influence value, thats true. But thats not the only factor.  There are also trust, security, and regulation that are crucial for any asset, especially a digital one.  Cryptocurrencies lack some of these fundamentals, making them highly volatile and risky.  Many people are cautious about investing in something so unstable and unregulated.  It is not just resistance to new things; it is somewhat a common sense as well. Quote from: annie1286 on August 04, 2024, 06:34:37 PM2.

Is this so? If so, how does the exchange ensure the security of funds in independent wallets?I can only speak in general terms here as each exchange may apply different security techniques and methods.  Storing a portion of user funds in independent wallets for each individual user is not a universal practice.  Exchanges typically maintain two types of wallets: hot and cold storage. A hot wallet holds a portion of user funds for quick deposits and withdrawals. The majority of user funds are stored in a cold wallet, which is offline and secured through measures like multi-signature wallets and offline key storage.  Exchanges frequently move funds between hot and cold wallets to facilitate user transactions, maintain liquidity, and manage risk.

But why is it that now, when cryptocurrency has gradually been widely known by many people and applied to life, there are still so many people who are resisted? Is this an intolerance or resistance to new things?That's not a very good example. Collectibles like antique coins are a very different kind of thing. They are valued only as collectibles, not for utility, because they have no utility - that's kinda the whole definition of a collectible, something whose value derives not from any utility but just from the desire of collecting enthusiasts. Meanwhile Bitcoin is a highly useful global digital currency. Bitcoin is valued for its utility and its scarcity, there is nothing \"collectible\" about it because its just a fungible digital currency so there is nothing to \"collect\" physically or digitally.Yes probably like 98% of people resist the idea of Bitcoin. It is because it is a new and different thing from anything that has existed before and so people don't understand what it is. It'll be a long slow path of educating people on Bitcoin before they accept it as something useful and good.",

The main aim of crypto exchange is for trading, changing your crypto to fiat etc. Anything beyond this is risky and that is why it’s not advisable to leave your funds there if it is just for this purpose. The inability of you to get access to your seed phrase from the exchange is a sign that they can’t be dependable on and you can lose your funds at anything if anything goes wrong with the exchange in the future. Save your bitcoins in a wallet that you have access to a mnemonic seed phrase which you can access at anytime and the security of it is your hands ultimately.Quote3. Yes, my access rights were lost. I bought nearly 900 bitcoins in the early days, but the mnemonic of the wallet could not be retrieved for login. Secondly, for these bitcoins with lost access rights, will they never be accessible?Once your access right is lost, those bitcoins will never be accessible and you can only see them in the wallet as read only. This is the reason why you should keep your seed phrase safe and never allow it to be compromised by anyone because that’s given them full access to your funds which can be catered away by them. No one can keep your bitcoins safer than you, so hold it well.",

Which statement is more convincing?It's quite simple.The value of Bitcoin has come from its Supply and Demand. Just like the US dollar, but Satoshi created a limited supply for Bitcoin, which proved to be very effective in creating value. Beside that Bitcoin's unique concept also forced people to invest. In other words, due to qualities like unmutability, decentralization, and limited supply (Scarcity), Bitcoin has created its value through its users.Quote2. If there are tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, are they stored in hardware wallets, hot wallets, or exchanges? Which is safer?Hmm, this point is very good. You did well to ask where it is better to store Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a valuable asset and thus malicious people are eager to get hold of it and rob you at the slightest mistake. So it is better to store Bitcoin in a hardware wallet instead of Exchange because Exchanges can also get hacked very easily and you can lose your funds in front of his eyes. So be careful with these kinds of things.Anyway if you don't have any ideas about which wallet is best to stor Bitcoin, Here in this thread you can read about it.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0Quote3.

They're lost forever if no one has the private keys for those Bitcoins. That makes our Bitcoins scarcer and as satoshi said, treat them as donation to the community.",

Which statement is more convincing?The value comes from the market, if you see bitcoin at $64,000 that mean the buy orders are under $64k while the sell orderers are over $64k, in the markets you will fined buy orders and sales orders, and some orders are in the extreme, you well find people trying to buy bitcoin for $1, or people trying to sell bitcoin for $1M, any one can decide where to place the orders, but if you want a fast trade then you must accept the current market price.Quote from: annie1286 on August 04, 2024, 05:42:37 PM2. If there are tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, are they stored in hardware wallets, hot wallets, or exchanges? Which is safer?Some coins are lost, but not all of them are stored. And not all users have a hardware wallet. I would say a big part of them are stored in online wallets and exchanges, even if it's a terrible idea to do it.",
