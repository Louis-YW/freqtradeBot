  "content": "Hi. My friend CHATGPT help me out: I wanted to share my experience as a Rollbit user. It appears that Rollbit somehow acquired my information, possibly from my previous involvement with Stake. As a Diamond-level player on stake, Rollbit unexpectedly awarded me 6k for free. This made me quite profitable since I hadn't deposited any of my own funds, and I managed to cash out between 50-80k in the past year.However, my Rollbit account was recently disabled without any prior notice. Fortunately, I had already withdrawn my balance as a precaution. When I reached out to inquire about the reason behind the ban, I received only a brief response: \"Banned permanently for abuse.\" They didn't offer any further explanation.My activities on Rollbit mainly involved participating in their crash game and placing bets on various sports events. Occasionally, I made 1.01 bets in pursuit of their Level up bonus. If such bets were not allowed, it raises the question of why Rollbit offered those odds in the first place.I'm not deeply attached to my Rollbit account, but it seems they may have grown weary of not seeing a return on the money they awarded me. In total, I received 14K in bonuses without ever depositing my \"own\" money.My intention in sharing this story is to caution all of you to approach Rollbit  with caution. It's essential to be aware of the risks, especially when they involve receiving unexpected bonuses or promotions from them.  I hope none of you have to endure the disappointment of having your funds confiscated. Stay safe",

      "body": "Well, let me first of all state that you are very lucky, I mean who wouldn't want such a bonus?, Rollbits giving you a total of 14k in bonus, how were they expecting to get a return from that money?, were they expecting you to play recklessly since its free money, then loss it all, then you deposit your own which you probably would play recklessly with as well and lose?..Anyways, good thing that you were knowledgeable enough to make good use of the opportunity to make good money for yourself, gamblers mustn't always be the ones to lose to the casinos all the time, some time, the casinos should also lose to the gamblers, it is commonly said in my place that Dog's play is, if one fall for the other, the other will also fall for the one..I would have suggested you continue to reach out to their customer care to try to find out what actually is the reason they banned your account, I mean, like what you did wrong to make them believe you were abusing their system, but then, you don't seem like you are still interested in playing on Rollbits, and good thing for you that you already withdrew all your money in the account before this issue came up, else, you probably would have lost it all.This is another good reason gambler should never leave any reasonable amount of money on their casino account, no matter the casino , it is very risky, for aside hacks and theft, one never can tell the day the casino will wake up and come up with an issue just like this..Anyways, happy for you though.",

Not totally an abused such as cheating but rather an abused to their promotion for using a safe bet to complete which they didn’t anticipate as loop hole to claim their prize in sure manner.It’s like when you find a bug on a software and you didn’t report. This is the reason for banning you because you already earned a lot from their bonus without risking any of your money. It’s their fault for counting wager from low odds bet but they have the right to ban your abusing the promotion. This is the reason why you still manage to withdraw because they are not aware on your method. You already got profit saw I don’t see the need to create this thread? You are hurt that you can’t do the same trick to earn profit because casino ain’t charity. They will surely ban the user who’s continuously cashing out without risking money in the casino.",

Promotion is to make user engage on gambling by claiming the reward.

Because most if your post are about a fake/scam site specifically about gambling sites.Hmm not sure if you are serious? “Rollbit will surely colmunicate with you”.  If they did that, i would have had a reason for the ban. People here needs to understand that the promotion was a sign up bonus, which i could have cashed out instantly since there was no strings attached. To odds on a 1.01 bet is not abusive at all, and it maybe happend like 10-20 times out of a thousand bets. Its normal for people who wants to climb the ranks to bet like that. I do that on Stake as well, and thats totally ok. Its not unusal that people also lose on odds 1.01, that happend to me as well.   Like Chelsea is up 3-1 in 80 minute, you place a odds 1.01 and the other team scores 2 goals the next 10 minutes.. It happends often! Its like betting on Crash and cash it out on 1.01, is that abusive as well? People needs to understand that such bets is ok! You can climb the ranks faster but you lose big money when it fails. Its normal and totally ok. I dont intend to speak fore to them.. Im fine with that being closed for good when they ban people without explanation, and i leave with good profit. I just want to make people aware that they can’t trust them at all.. Getting banned without knowing the reason is crazy and i wish for nobody to have balance in there while this happend. Also remember that Rollbit is non transparent at all. No names on owners, all support/admins uses nicknames and they decide the communication.. if they dont want to discuss with you, they stop answeing. Thats how they do.",

I am confident that this method is completely safe, especially if you're aiming to gain the experience required to level up your account. You can strategically place small bets, minimizing the risk of losing significantly. The advantage for the player is that they can make progress towards leveling up with minimal risk. However, it's important to note that this approach could be considered an abuse of the promotion in question, from a technical standpoint.OP, I am curious hoe ChatGPT \"helped\" you with this.",

If you are a casino owner, Are you happy that someone taking advantage to your promotion by playing safe and not actually normally gambling. It’s clearly taking advantage on the promotion. The OP here is accusing casino as scam for banning him after successfully clearing a promotion reward. He is not a scam victim instead he wants to get some more. The casino action is more on limiting players that is not profitable to them.

Are you happy that someone placing that kind of bet which he will not normally do without any promotion involved? This is why I said above if you read it that promotion is not intended that way. It’s an extra reward for your normal bets.Maybe everyone forget here the premise of this thread. The OP got ban after clearing the promotion and withdrawn his balance. I’m just telling that it’s the way of the casino to limit user like OP that is not profitable to them by doing strategy to abused promotion. I’m not justifying the promotion rules or the way it can be claim. I’m giving only an insight on why the OP get banned.",

Thats it? I dont go into a discussion about it. People here talk to much about the promotion. I got those 6k like 8-9 months ago, and cashed them out the same day. Did spend the same money on daily/Weekly deposits where i also won very big. Stop talking about that promotion. I only mentionened it to make people understand i was a winning player since they never got any of my “own” money. All deposits made from me is from cashouts made from that account. I just believe they look at the ROI and saw they lost too much on me and then came up with such excuse. I just want to warn others who might be in profit to take your money out, and only deposit money you wont cry about if they confiscate.

I asked him for advices, and Thats what He came up with. Rollbit once started to send out bonus promotions to several stake users. I think they bought a hacked e-mail list for all stake users. Some got 100€ and some like me got 6k. You can see many users were contacted here: https://stakecommunity.com/topic/69364-email-from-diffrente-casino-anyone-else-got-it/#comment-1482952I work in the affiliate business and often gets contacted by shady people asking if we want to buy list of data for players - like usernames, e-mails, vip status and loss/winnings. Of course i say no to such things, but Rollbit seems to have taken the chance.",

If such bets were not allowed, it raises the question of why Rollbit offered those odds in the first place.I'm not deeply attached to my Rollbit account, but it seems they may have grown weary of not seeing a return on the money they awarded me. In total, I received 14K in bonuses without ever depositing my \"own\" money.This is probably not the first time that I've seen someone with this issue. It seems Rollbit will restrict any account that attempt to do this type of bet. Wagering on their sportsbook will be counted as 3x of your wager so its pretty easy to level up your account with this type of 1.01 bet. I cant really find any fine print regarding this but I guess they dont really want to scare people around by putting that in their T&C and suchConsidering that Rollbit gives alot of bonuses, I'd say they are losing pretty deep there if alot of people start doing this therefore they will nuke anyone that tried this",

It probably depend on who is managing the casino. Lets just say its under new management and they noticed your account doing all these to rank up and get benefits.I'm wondering how you relate this where the casino got your info from Stake. Did stake also locked your account and now its rollbit doing the same thing?  IF this is the case then you really have done the same abuse.I personally do not see it as abuse at all. If they do not want players placing those types of bets, then they shouldn't offer them. A person can just as easily lose that bet, so they can ask for a refund if it loses? Obviously a casino is not going to refund your bet if you lose, but saying a player is abusing them for betting x1.01 is kinda crazy IMO. They should either remove those bets or disallow them to count towards promotions. Solves the issue.",
