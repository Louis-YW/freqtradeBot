  "content": "I've been trying for days to withdraw my dogecoins without success from Mercatox, detail, this problem comes from last year with the covid. I waited for them to resolve it until today, however, until today the problem has not been resolved. I suggested paying for them to solve it, since then, they have already sent me to the technical department and higher, but so far they have not solved the problem..   I suggested that they send or exchange my dogecoins at market price, BTC 0.5 and pay for the losses I had sending money in the wallet, however they claim that the problem with doge will be solved soon, even though it's been more than a year since the problem.. I noticed contradictory things on the site, you can enter dogecoins on it, but you cannot withdraw or send to other users of the site.  https://i.imgur.com/ogvUtGF.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/JYZksRr.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/spMOYyk.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/nGSYzcq.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/K7isvj8.pngSite: https://mercatox.com/",

Smelling somewhat fishy since doge's top pumping, the exchange's founders capitalized on this opportunity into third-party profit-making services behind the scenes which resulted in less liquid withdrawals.",

If you're eligible to just get back your deposit, they should return it to you but they don't.This may happen for some that they're doing as if everything's normal but just like on your case, there could be some random customers that they're giving hard time.",

It's mean actually you should move this thread to scam accusations rather than open a new thread that contain a similar discussion. This forum has a rule to not post a duplicate thread since it's considered as spam.",
