Thus, Dr. Martin Schulze Wessel, a professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, said: “It is difficult to compare the situation in modern Russia and Germany, at least at the beginning of World War II. However, in both cases, we are talking about the fact that political leadership is impossible without the support of people. In Russia, this is support for the army, support for business, and, therefore, this is not Putin's war, this is Russia's war.'' (https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-61720392).     Everything that happens in Russia primarily comes from its people, Putin is only a proper conductor of the innermost aspirations of the Russian people and their mentality.    In 2014, in the article “Great Russian chauvinism and Putin is his Fuhrer” (1), I pointed out that Russia’s aggressiveness lies in the mentality of the Russian people, in its imperial worldview and Great Russian chauvinism. Putin only opened the floodgates to Great Russian chauvinism, the wave of which brought him to power. Going to meet the desire of the Russian people to return Chechnya to the bosom of the empire, Putin started a war with Chechnya. In gratitude, Putin was elected by the people to the role of a leader in line with his imperial worldview. With the tacit consent of the people, Putin returned the former system of power to the country, mysteriously calling it a sovereign democracy, defining himself, one must understand, only as its sovereign (in Russian, - ruler).     The West for a long time refused to understand that democracy in Russia did not take place. The mentality of the Russian people does not accept democracy, because democracy and empire are incompatible things. On the other hand, the Russian people cannot exist outside the empire, without the empire they will be lost. The victory of democracy for the Russian people turned into its complete impoverishment and the final collapse of the Russian Empire. Is the Russian people ready for such a price to pay for their freedom? Do people need freedom at all, carrying the gene of Oblomovism in themselves? Only a dictatorial regime is suitable for a society that does not want to deal with either political or economic problems. So the appearance of Putin is not accidental, but fateful for the Russian people. (2) The vector of Putin’s policy is “back to the empire.” (3) Yes, Putin is implicitly pursuing a policy of restoring the Russian Empire within the borders of the Soviet Union under the pretext of protecting the collapse of the USSR live in the former Soviet republics, or as he says, the \"Russian world\", Russia threatens their security.    “Russian World” and aggression are inseparable concepts.(4) The phrase “Russian World” should be understood as a concept designed to protect the “moral health” of the state-forming people, the core of the empire, with the return of a falsified history that does not cause moral damage to its relic imperial worldview. Not a single people in the world, except for the Russian, calls itself great, and the language of the Great Russian people, respectively, is Great Russian. This self-determination is flawed. Hence the desire of the Great Russians for Great Russia, which, after the fall of the communist regime, somewhat disintegrated, but remained a \"prison of peoples.\" Putin gave the Great Russians hope for the restoration of the empire within its former borders, and in this Putin's revanchist is no different from Hitler's revanchist, with the idea of creating a Third Reich, backed up by fascist ideology. In this regard, Putin is no different from the fascist Hitler. Associations with Hitler are evidenced by indisputable facts. Putin surprisingly follows in Hitler's footsteps, emulating the methods used by the fascist Fuhrer.(5,6) Lies and cunning in achieving goals have become the hallmark of the Russian Fuhrer. These accompanying words have become a hallmark of Russia under Putin. Involuntarily, but Putin once again proved that Evil and Falsehood do not exist one without the other. The Empire of Lies perfectly complements the well-known definition of Russia as the Empire of Evil (7).     Wessel's words point to Putin's Nazism:“Putin, in his speech back in July last year, made it clear that he does not want the existence of Ukraine as an independent nation. He started a war against the Ukrainian nation, and any war against a nation has the dimension of genocide.”         Putin's Nazism is clearly expressed in his \"historical discovery\" that there is no Ukrainian people as such, that they are Russian people. The Russian Fuhrer, without concealing his intentions, defined the goal of the war he started - denazification, in other words, the extermination of Ukrainians. If this plan is implemented, there will be neither the Ukrainian people, nor the country with the name Ukraine. (Somewhat digressing from the topic, in imitation of Putin the historian, I wrote an article “Jews and Russians are one people” (. I believe that my research is no less worthy of a historical digression. So the Jews, respectively, have the right to claim Russia and annex it to Israel.)    Interesting remark doc. Wessel about Russian emigrants, who, in his opinion, can change the political situation and, in general, the attitude of Russian society to the war:      “As for the influence of intellectuals, I'm not sure that our voice is heard in Russia. Russia is a totalitarian country with no independent media anymore, Western media have virtually no opportunity to take part in communication and informing [the Russian population]. Therefore, Western intellectuals can hardly influence the opinion of Russians.Perhaps this can be done by Russian emigrants who do not agree with the actions of the authorities, but are still connected with the Russians [within the country]. Russian political emigration may play a role in the future.”     However, the hope for Russian emigrants is very doubtful. The fact is that most of them see all the blame in Putin, and not in the Russian people. Many emigrants, including Jews, who are usually anti-Putin, believe that Crimea is Russian, and it is enough to throw Putin and his criminal gang out of the Kremlin and Russia will return to the path of democracy. By the way, quite a few Russian emigrants, living abroad, support Putin and the war with Ukraine. Thus, this is reflected in detail in the decision of Latvia to close the broadcasting of the Dozhd TV channel, in whose programs Russian propaganda was found that violated Latvian law.     Martin Schulze Wessel believes: \"Ukraine's victory will certainly mean the end of Putin, because he will not be able to remain a political leader after Ukraine regains its territories.\"     Further, he correctly understands that there is no guarantee of a fundamental change in the Russian public in the event of a change in the master of the Kremlin:   “But this will not necessarily lead to a revolution in Russia. Although it may lead to another form of authoritarian government. In this case, the realization of the experience of this war will be very slow.”      Finally, the role of the Russian people in the confrontation between Russia and democracy began to reach Western liberals. There is no doubt that if in the 90s, at the time of the collapse of the USSR, the West had not provided assistance to Russia, then the Empire of Evil would have finally collapsed, and today there was no war in Ukraine and “friend Putin” would not blackmail the World with a nuclear war.1.

The acoustic signature of Borei is significantly stealthier than that of the previous generations of Russian SSBNs, but it has been reported that their hydraulic pumps become noisier after a relatively short period of operation, reducing the stealth capabilities of the submarine.The Borei submarines are approximately 170 meters (560 ft) long, 13 meters (43 ft) in diameter, and have a maximum submerged speed of at least 46 kilometers per hour (25 kn; 29 mph). They are equipped with a floating rescue chamber designed to fit in the whole crew. Smaller than the Typhoon class, the Boreis were initially reported to carry 12 missiles but are able to carry four more due to the decrease in mass of the 36-ton Bulava SLBM (a modified version of the Topol-M ICBM) over the originally proposed R-39UTTH Bark. Cost was estimated in 2010 at some ?23 billion (USD$734 million, equivalent to US$863 million in 2020 terms.  In comparison the cost of an Ohio-class SSBN was around US$2 billion per boat (1997 prices, equivalent to over US$3 billion in 2020 terms....",

The topic here is not about submarines and missiles with their technical data, but about the fact that the war in Ukraine is not Putin's war, but the war of the Russian people. As I see it, this is not the first time you have taken the topic in a completely different direction, which is typical for Putin's trolls.",
