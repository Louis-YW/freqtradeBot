Many investors are skeptical about the new chain, especially when Do Kwon is facing scrutiny by the South Korean government. If the Terra team was unable to restore the original project (now Terra Classic) back to its former glory, what makes you think the new version will be a huge success? There are many other alternatives on the market which don't have a tainted reputation like Terra. If people were disappointed with what happened with the LUNA/UST collapse, then it's likely they will choose another alternative instead of going all in on the new chain.What do you think? Will LUNA 2.0 be a complete failure or a huge success in the future? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

      "body": "Tera Luna unexpectedly crashed investors funds, despite the market volatility some weeks past, others coins and token did not create a noticable down fall just like Luna did. It was really a shock that Luna dropped from $100+ to $0.0001, I think I should call the situation unprofessionalism by team of the terra Luna. Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB and TRC did not fall to the bottom just like terra did. And now Terra has developed (launched) the terra 2.0, the team have shown their incapability and lack of professionalism that they couldn't restore the original project, their is no doubt they will not fail again in future when their is market volatility..Thanks sir.",

Thank you very much. I think it cant never go back to the top like it was used too. Its not because it has no investors, but people's trust loses a lot on this project. I am just thinking that it was listed by some exchange due to their losses and care for the people who wishes to get back their money since when it fully declared end then theres no chance to get your money at all. Even CZ loss a lot here, so I am thinking they want to earned it back through trading or hoping for another big pump.",

Giving the hardfork coin as a way for people to recover some of their lose didn't meant if this wil; make people feel satisfied again in the long term. I just remind you what about those who have bought UST since the reward was not 1;1 with their UST. People are loosing a lot of their money. They do know that if this is a bad project but yeah the hardfork coin has become a way to convince the investor in short term.",

There's no way that they'll get back those billions because it's already spent somewhere by whoever benefited from it. And the Terra owner, Do Kwon, and his team cannot do anything with it. Instead of making some admission of their fault, they didn't do it yet formed a false hope to their investors instead of focusing on getting back the wealth that has been slashed to them. And even if they admit it, they'll never get it back and there's something they know that they don't want to tell to everybody.",

As far as i know if so many people are against the proposal but do kwon was still executing what he was thinkin if that was true. This project didn't even hear the community's response. The founder keep creating the new token to avoid his fault. Creating the token was free but he has been making billions of money gone for nothing. This project was so garbage as fuck. There's no hope for the new version of terra luna. This will be dumped so hard in the future.",

I still believe that hype and blind followers will still trust this project since it already prove themselves before the failure occur. There path is same with Ethereum which fork Ethereum and leave Ethereum Classic after the attack on there smart contract last 2016 which result to huge funds loss. The price of the Ethereum that time went down to the bottom and stay there for a long time. Vitalik just slowly build it again and gain trust of the investors to buy back again. There's a chance that this instance will be the same to Luna 2.0 since there's still huge volume on the exchange right now for this token. But let's see if the hype will sustain for more than a month.",

Depend on the situation if Devs and their whales will keep supporting the project then maybe we can see them succeed back in future, but if their whales already done with them and the one who's reviving the project are the small investors well we can say that they might fail in future. For now they will struggle since the issue hit them very hard but once the issue fades and the confidence of the people cameback again maybe we can see them get a good revival in future.",

Looking at the state of the Luna 2.0 market, I can say that it has completely failed. By investing in it long term you will fall into more losses.Those who have invested in Luna coins for a long time and who have lost by investing will never recover. There will be no investors to invest in and it will probably never pump up again.So I say don't make any long term investment with these Luna coins.",
