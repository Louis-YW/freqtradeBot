Crypto gives the ability of self custody, I always wonder why people still prefer to use custododial ways to keep their cryptocurrencies in a way they can never have complete control of their coins.",

But the whole thing about allowing users to get their coins so they are no longer paypalcoins but real bitcoins is indeed a step further, I'm so damn curious how much bitcoins Paypal users have in their wallets, and I have a feeling it's quite a large number, judging by the fact that they had to raise the upper limit twice last year up to $100k. Quite unexpected, I would have never thought they would allow this.",

They are also taking actions based on the market requirements. Because I know many people did not use Pypal's crypto service because they were not allowed to move their bitcoins outside. Paypal's executive team seen that demand and has implemented the change. Good for people who have purchased bitcoin through a centralized entity like Paypal. It will be interesting to see how many holders actually use this facility to move their bitcoins.",

Also if I remember there are many banks in my country that banned the exchange of Bitcoins and thereby my accounts were frozen I just withdrew and choose to go to some other international bank for trading, it's just business and the need of the hour is cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins.",

It actually makes sense from two different angles - they probably don't want a potential headache from customers saying they were missold since the price has started to fall and they're also probably more interested in getting more customers to use their Bitcoin rather than just sit on it as an asset. If there are more people moving money in and out, then there is more opportunity to charge fees rather than the relatively static deposits-only setup. Maybe they are starting to see it as less of a threat and more of a money maker, but they're probably also more confident in the underlying exchange system that they have established as well.",
