I have no guts unlike this guy to invest $1k in meme coins. He probably has this money as spare and willing to lose. Who's going to invest in unknown meme coins? Well, anyway this season is like whatever you buy seems goin' to make you money even with random meme coins. Still, I'd play safe and won't do this.",

I’ll be honest though, I think that some people only deal with it because based on historical events with “Memecoins”, people have turned millionaires overnight. So they are trying their luck to know if their story will change too. Just like you mentioned, someone made 100x from a meme coin I’ve never even heard the name before. What do you think people will do? They’ll want to invest and be like not just the other guys, but like this guy too.",

They will now start investing in meme coins not realizing that only a few can make such gains, after losing their investment they will go out and talk negatively about cryptocurrencies. It is a never-ending cycle of deceit and scammers are the first to utilize this opportunity. They would create fake smart contracts of the trending meme coin to which a few intellectuals would invest and lose their money.",

They always have a massive circulating supply which makes them very cheap for speculators to acquire. It will be possible to make a good profit early on when they are really volatile but very few will have lasting power. The majority die off quickly but you will never see Coindesk write about the countless people who lose money investing in these risky tokens.",

      "body": "Yep, this is not the first time, but we all understand the risk of participating in memecoin, someone can gain x100, and conversely someone can lose their money completely.The way many people only like to talk about profits in an unbalanced way is part of the reason it can be easy to attract, because we can't avoid greed and are easily swayed by FOMO about things we like. It obscures our sanity. I also went through many different levels of emotions with memecoin, what I concluded was that I was only willing to spend money that I was willing to lose completely like gambling. It doesn't need complicated analysis. Colorful doesn't mean much, because it's a memecoin itself and doesn't have much applicability, so don't get too complicated about your expertise in the field.",

Because if not, he can never expect such a trend to come back, not anymore. Hype project just rises in no specific time but they drop forever. If we miss selling them during its peak, we can no longer expect to rally back anymore, it was a normal condition on altcoins. Meme coin price manipulation remains but the question is if people are still buying them. Or they ignored it because of the risk and huge possible losses. Now, we can see the investors are getting smarter, they've learned already, and no matter how these meme coin creators do, that won't change their market insights, still they are shitcoins.",

I'm sincerely happy for him, he removed fear and took the risk and it did pay off. I'm sure he had enough before investing that amount because it was a 50/50 chance. So, it is advisable to watch what you have and make investment on what you can bear the pain of loosingAfter this kind of wave this memecoin has made, you see more people going to invest in it and it becomes where the project team will decide to rug the project very hard for this memecoin to last in the market.",
