      "body": "For me, ever since I started to manage the amount of money I put into my gambling account there have indeed been some changes. In terms of debt, even when I go to my account to gamble without having a budget I have never been in debt, although I can be online and spend so much more than an average gamble would spend on his/her gambling account b it since I started to manage funds and stopped going above my allocated amount I have been able to make good use of those money that was supposed to have been wasted trying to win a slot game or mines.For the mental health, I’m no gambling addict but I do get the fact when you go online to gamble and later find out that all through your section you were only able to win a few games and the rest were kissing streaks you’d get depressed to some extent and some might even decide to gamble more thinking they would be able to win back what they have lost without them realising that they are chasing their losses and since I learnt the risk of one chasing losses and how to avoid it I have become better than before.Right now, all I do is to go to my account i.e when I have a spare cash that I can afford to lose place some bets on  some games have fun and leave I don’t really have any other motive towards gambling as at now so whenever I’m lucky to come out at the end of my section with some profit I just spend it on other things.",

Of course when you do things in moderation and responsibly, you wouldn't have problems with yourself or other people because you have balanced it out. You can only be a responsible gambler if you are not an addict, which means you will have control of yourself, your activities and relationship. You will also have a budget for gambling and you will keep to it. For example I get satisfied with my budget even if I exhausted it without winning and I move on very well with myself and people around also until the next time I decide to. It is fun to gamble responsibly because you wouldn't have to start chasing your loses which is a major reason for addiction.",

I get to enjoy playing without stressing that much because of losses unlike before when I wast too hyped and thrilled of winning bigtime. It also helped me managing my mood 'coz before  whenever I am losing my temper also shortens that I'm most of the time irritated. I get to do my job as well because I am able to cope up with my gambling habits. These could be small things to some but for sure these things are worse especially if addiction take over. Gambling should be an activity to entertain us and not for us to stress about.",

The only benefits I can get on being in total contral to my gambling activities was not being too upset whenever I lose my bankroll since I’m on,y using the money that I allocated for gambling.Other people having trouble to cope with their losses because they are using money that is not supposed to be wasted on gambling.

Gambling shouldn't be taken as a way of making passive income,  but to be seen as a means to getting entertained and if your luck shines on one or two occasions to have made a win it should be taken as a bonus rather than being taken as a job which is a risky mentality in the long run.",

Most of the losses I have recorded in recent time comes as a result of not withholding myself from continuing gambling when I have already reached my limit in the week.",

Let's discuss.I'm not sure if you use this banking apps like Opay and Palmpay, that's the app I used in funding sport bets especially Opay, they have lightening payment.That's the best place I put my gambling funds, I don't combine it with my main account because I know myself that I will go beyond my budget if I live everything on the app, this is how I am able to control way of gambling and it's has always help me responsibly without been in debt.I don't have number a particular number of time to bet but I do have a budget, once I cross that amount for that day(Saturday, Sundays and sometimes Monday), I don't bet again, this has help me and I don't get addicted to gambling no matter the outcome. I sometimes take break when I win something good for that week to cool off because I have noticed that when I win and I don't take break, the joy of the win makes me take wrong decisions in my next bets and usually, all lead to losses.Concerning relationship, I'm single and I don't stay with anyone, my decisions, my calls and my girlfriend don't have time about gambling. She doesn't even like sports no casino games, and I don't bet in her presence, so she hardly notice any gambling activity around me.",

Not only did my responsibility and choice saved me money, but it also prevented me from causing any impact to my relationship with my family and peers.From what I have gathered, gambling is an act which can cause potential damage if a person becomes addicted to it. By being addicted, the person loses their rational ability to decide and to think clearly, which ultimately leads to poor decision making and management of funds. Like what most have mentioned also, gambling may result to a strained relationship with your colleagues and even your family.I am lucky enough to have avoided the pitfalls of what have experienced and it is mainly due to threads such as these where people continuously share their horrific experiences.",
