  "content": "I have tried to be as detailed as possible.I setup a BTCpay store.  When setting up the wallet I used a xPub key, that I own the private keys to.  These private keys are attached to my blockchain.com wallet.  Previously, when I received payments through BTCpay the payments would appear in my blockchain.com wallet, because that is where the xPub key originated.  The problem:  The BTCpay payments are not appearing in my blockchain.com wallet, but only on the BTCpay wallet page.  The solution: I either need to be able to send my bitcoin out from BTCpay or access it via my private keys through a wallet, like Electrum.When I try to send out the bitcoin from the BTCpay wallet it states that I am using the wrong derivation path, but I have tried the following-•   m/84'/0'/0'•   m/44'/0'/0'•   m/44'/0'I was told that the reason the payments don’t show in my blockchain.com wallet is because of a Gap Limit problem, basically my blockchain.com wallet stopped fetching the payments from BTCpay.  Blockchain.com wallets don’t allow changing the Gap Limit. Two wallets were suggested that allow the Gap Limit to be raised, Wasabi and Electrum.  When I entered my private keys into Wasabi, my balance showed zero and no transaction history.  When I entered my private keys into Electrum (native segwit) my balance is zero, but a transaction history shows up until May 2023.  In my blockchain.com wallet I do currently have a balance and many transactions since May 2023.  In my Electrum wallet I increased the Gap Limit to 500, but still shows zero balance.Can anyone assist me with sending out my balance from BTCpay?",

Yes, it is derivation path problem.  I have tried dozens of derivation paths in Electrum, but none pull up the right pathway that is identical to my blockchain.com wallet balance.  Walletrecovery.org states that the derivation path for blockchain.com is m/44'/0'/n', but this path is not accepted by Electrum for any wallet type. I've sent blockchain.com a couple of messages, hoping to get them to fix the gap limit on their end but any other suggestions is welcomed.  Thanks",

Once you've done setup and installed this tool you need to provide xPub and let the tool scan all addresses derived from your wallet. The result should be the right derivation path and the correct balance of your wallet.After you find the right derivation path for those addresses you can start using the Iancoleman tool and point it to the right derivation path and then take the private key and import them to Electrum.",
