I have a question!Can a well set up electrum wallet on an air gapped device be considered to be as secured as a hardware wallet? Hello, congratulations for your decision.How would you set up electrum wallet on an airgapped device? Technically you could create a wallet using electrum offline. You could also sign transactions, but there are 2 things to consider:1. you still need another wallet to broadcast the transactions2. you have to make sure the device is truly air gapped. You should remove the hardware that is suspicious and in general, you should make sure that the device cannot connect to the internet.I don't like this idea very much however. A user here has asked if they could do the same using bluewallet on a smartphone that is totally offline. The answer is that you could do this, but I suppose it is not highly recommended.In fact, @o_e_l_e_o answers your question perfectly (in my opinion) here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441664.20",

Yes, like the above said creating an Electrum wallet offline should be considered secured but even if it's an offline since you want to use it as an airgap wallet a normal OS like Windows is still vulnerable to any attack via USB transfer(like flash drive transferring signed and unsigned psbt file that includes virus/malware from the online device).So if you want a secure way then installing tails OS and install Electrum should be the best option to protect your wallet. You can check the guide below on how to install Tails and Electrum.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5228801.0",

I have a question!Can a well set up electrum wallet on an air gapped device be considered to be as secured as a hardware wallet? Yes, you're correct and it's possible that storing your bitcoins on an air-gapped device would be even more secure. I've recently come across news about Ledger sending users' encrypted recovery phrases to third-party entities and to be honest it's quite scary. This is really concerning and it's difficult to trust hardware devices like this after such an incident imo. As a result, I think relying on an air-gapped device for storing your funds may be a more reliable option.Setting up an Electrum wallet on an air-gapped device is not overly difficult. If you're using Linux you can follow this guide[1] for step-by-step instructions. For Windows users, there is a comprehensive tutorial[2] available on YouTube that will guide you on how to set it up safely and correctly.[1]: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQumISxkJsQ&t=1s&ab_channel=FasterTutorialsCom",

I would have agreed due to some convincing reasons they gave, just that it will involve my credit cards and so. I declined the request even when the process was close to complete. Few weeks or months later, I was greatly surprised to see the project I declined to promote on the first page of google ranking and it was a cloned website. It was there my idea of google changedÂ  and taking everything from google search serious stopped.Quote from: Pmalek on May 20, 2023, 06:30:42 AMYou should also never trust recommendations given by random people on social media or follow links from unknown users on Telegram.

There's no need pretending when there are people to help. As a good learn, I am not even ashamed to ask even if the simplest question.

I remember the last Ponzi scam I investigated for someone was an app listed on playstore. I was forced to think why google will simply and easily list a scam app without any kind of investigations about the project. Talking about harvesting our data. Recently I moved from my location to a new location where I have to spend about 120 days. Not conversant with the area I relied on a taxi that used google map services. I was going everywhere with the aid of google map. But one night as I was checking my phone, I opened the app and clicked my travel history and discovered that everywhere I moved in that city was recorded and they were accurate. I honestly became afraid, what if one person at the backend of the google maps works with kidnappers? I feel unsafe now and I have limited my movement. But the reality is that many and including me are unioned with google activities, can I succefully do without them?",
