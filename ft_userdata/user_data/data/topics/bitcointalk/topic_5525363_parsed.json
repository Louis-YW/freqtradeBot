      "body": ". What an amazing 16th year of Bitcoin existence. In first quarter of the year price was still dangling. In the second quarter there was a massive push in price no one expected the sudden spike where it retested the previous ATH and surpassed it, moving the price above $70k and in the third quarter it was looking like the market was becoming indecisive and boom the last quarter gave good bread to the patient holders. Indeed a massive breakpoint. The best price for 2024 was 108,319.87",

I think he meant that due to the abundance of low quality post, it was hard to navigate and locate the gems. While on user growth, I think he's pointing out the fact that the growth on Bitcointalk is diminishing by the year And despite the popularity of Bitcoin last year The percent of registered members was lackluster. Thanks @Cygan for sharing. Gained alot. It was fun seeing Bitcoin growth through statistical comparison.",

I'm just glad seeing the achievements of Bitcoin and where it is right now.I love these predictions, highlighting the Lightning Network where this is the main solution of the common problems that we are experiencing in Bitcoin networks especially those retails.Plus fiat currencies vs Bitcoin - well, this is aged already but I am always expecting this to happen.",

The only difference is that the forum is one of the few forums on the Internet that pays for posts, which means an increase in spam, and thus these developers moved to more specialized technical forums.",

It's good to see amount of WBTC fell by 16%, although it's probably partially due to existence of other pegged Bitcoin.Although after looking at all charts, i believe he should use log scaling for few charts.",
