  "content": "In the course of me posting on this forum, I've had many deleted posts, I never questioned since I don't really care that much.I will though be appealing the deletion of this message just to show an example of what often happens :Quote from: PaperWalletQuote from: Coyster on July 21, 2022, 05:59:26 PMwhat benefit would it be to any of my family member to keep this account when i'm no longer around, a bitcointalk account isn't a 'property', it is just an online account on a platform for discussing Bitcoin and other whatnots.They'll continue getting the dirty FortuneJack money. Just be honest.This message has been posted here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406723.msg60606086#msg60606086@Coyster posted immediately after my first participation in that thread, so I happened to read his message. I was simply pointing out to that person, contrary to what he is saying, that his account is not \"just an online account on a platform for discussing Bitcoin\", but also an account that is useful for its holder to get a regular pay, in this case dirty money from FortuneJack.Is this against forum rules? Or am I not allowed to answer some questions? Or, just maybe, criticising the scammer FortuneJack is moderated to some extent.Message back or not, no problem, let the mods do what they want, I am just trying to understand why my message got deleted.",

If you used campaigns instead of FortuneJack, your post wouldn't have been deleted.Just a question. FortuneJack scammed you? Or you posted like that because Coyster is one of the people that is wearing ForjuneJack signature and avatar? No scam case linked to FortuneJack that I have seen before on this forum, so I believe it is the later reason. So, is your post not worth to be deleted?",

They reported it and mod agreed with the report. There are no other case involved.You need to move on from whatever happened between FortuneJack and you. Constantly attacking FJ is not helping you. One of the reason I also see among others is this was an off-topic response, I do not see it has anything to do with the point you are making. I am wondering the topic should me on the meta board.",

I just answered that question. It wasn't off-topic.I think what has been said is enough. I will lock this topic to avoid unnecessary further comments.",
