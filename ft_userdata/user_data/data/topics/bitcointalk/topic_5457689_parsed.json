Because according to a thread here by stone man, all addresses were on wallet .dat which was a single file and after losing it he couldn’t recover because there wasn’t recovery phrases then.If he had a seed phrase then it was from beyond that 2013 and the tips from The Sceptical Chymist should work, because someone had asked similar question and the same tip was used to recover it",

It is easier if you follow the guide on this threadQuoteThat's impressive, and after reading it, it makes me wonder just exactly how much bitcoin has been lost forever (I think there is data on that, but in any case I find it amazing that 9000BTC were apparently gone for good just in that thread alone).Seriously a lot of bitcoin has been lost in the past a look around this thread here alone where bitcoin lost by members and so where calculated (although I don’t know how accurate they were) was around 2759.42507135 BTC, just imagine the amount it’s worth now. But nothing to worry because satoshi himself said here that all lost coins make it worth slightly more (that’s if they were not stolen and had been spent)",

How come your seed phrase was generated in 2010.FWIW the Electrum project was released on 4 November 2011 and as far as I can tell the seed phrase algorithm was present from first releases (nothing in 2010 though).Basically the first version seems to be using some sort of \"brainwallet\" using the password used as seed[1] to generate addresses (double SHA256 of index|pass). Then the mnemonic algorithm was introduced in later versions[2] (2012 I think) where random words were selected out of a 1626 word long word-list and improved in later versions[3] which is what we use today.[1] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/6db1a31e58ee15c448448139e7d3a9e72b14268f/client/electrum#L258[2] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/electrum/old_mnemonic.py[3] https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/electrum/mnemonic.py",

As other members have explained above, in 2010 people were using private keys. Seeds were invented much later.Besides, at that time, Electrum didn't exist.
