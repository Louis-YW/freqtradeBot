  "content": "I am currently in Hong Kong and saw A LOT of shops that offer a big variety of altcoins as well as bitcoin of course.Does anybody have any experience with using these exchanges to buy bitcoin?I found some information but not too much.Wonder which one has the best rates and if they accept other currency other than HK$. I want to buy with USD preferably but of course I could also just exchange it before.What I also want to know if they require KYC.Before somebody says, just go to all the shops and check it yourself.Â   I will, if I have to. But since my time here is limited I thought it's easier to ask here, maybe we have some member from HK.",
