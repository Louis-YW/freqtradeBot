You started well by doing that. I don't know if you stumbled on this forum like I did or you were directed here by a friend or loved one. If the latter was your case; then I believe they must've told you that this forum sticks to its rules. It's a strict place to be if you're someone who doesn't like keeping to rules. All the same, just feel free to make concise and constructive contributions to issues here. By that you will be adding to the growth of this forum.QuoteI would also need some advice here on how to go about it which I believe there are some good Samaritan here that can guide me through to achieving it and making my stay here  meaningful in contributing my quota of existence on this platform.I will appreciate your opinions, directions and lots more politely.Thank you.While I ain't a fan of people asking to be mentored here, l want to tell you to avoid anyone sending you pms asking you to subscribe to their channels or whatever. Most often such leads to scam. Beware.",

Well just as the OGs have opined, constant(meaningful) contribution to the forum would help you grow and since you cannot give what you don't have, it's best to have an in-depth knowledge of Bitcoin; not just here alone but also from personal researches as that too will help you better enjoy the forum.

The forum is not only about the rule and regulations, as you recently learned. There is so much exposure to crypto that this forum offers. In case you don't know, bitcoin investment and the forum policies are two completely distinct things.If all you can think of when you don't have the necessary knowledge of bitcoin is investing and raising awareness of it, you're off to the incorrect start.Take your time to comprehend what bitcoin is all about before investing in it if you are unfamiliar with how the crypto market functions.",
