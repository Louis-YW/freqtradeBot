  "content": "Greetings, BitcoinTalk community,I hope this message finds you well. Recently, I acquired vistomail.com, including the email alias satoshi@vistomail.com, enabling me to dive deep into the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the visionary behind Bitcoin.After months of dedicated research and exploration, I'm thrilled to announce that my findings are now complete. This journey has been both captivating and challenging, marked by numerous discoveries.To involve the community in this pivotal moment, I've initiated a vote. It's up to you whether I should disclose the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto based on the evidence I've gathered. Your participation and input are essential as we chart the course forward.I firmly believe that transparency and collaboration within our community will advance our understanding of Bitcoin's origins and motivations. Your insights and perspectives are invaluable as we engage in this crucial discussion.Please take a moment to vote and share your thoughts on whether we should unveil Satoshi Nakamoto's identity. I eagerly anticipate your feedback and look forward to meaningful discussions that enrich our collective knowledge.Thank you for your attention and active participation in this endeavor. Together, we can continue unraveling the mysteries surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto and his profound impact on the cryptocurrency landscape.Best regards,Alex Elbanna@alexelbanna-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Comment: F8E5 5B14 73DC FF83 5CCE  599E 8920 0D87 A42D 1483Comment: satoshi@vistomail.com <satoshi@vistomail.com>xjMEZfxm2BYJKwYBBAHaRw8BAQdA1ml8ltnJwC04b12D8ZZ6rVE8pBVG14Z57r7BhNWcEYvNLXNhdG9zaGlAdmlzdG9tYWlsLmNvbSA8c2F0b3NoaUB2aXN0b21haWwuY29tPsKMBBAWCgA+BYJl/GbYBAsJBwgJkIkgDYekLRSDAxUICgQWAAIBAhkBApsDAh4BFiEE+OVbFHPc/4NczlmeiSANh6QtFIMAAAmZAP472o4je5A7dHAbCTpmRQtvGyFP1JVtZPhOelRSKRu4qwEAyw78DGKf90pr5O5oJUAP8C2bkxENRzoIF7vz3XKdawnOOARl/GbYEgorBgEEAZdVAQUBAQdAlMeXeRiUQzGiaBecg7RpnGpnyS3iuept7M1FbhyL6SYDAQgHwngEGBYKACoFgmX8ZtgJkIkgDYekLRSDApsMFiEE+OVbFHPc/4NczlmeiSANh6QtFIMAAGzSAQDPjAhfZLixRpk1m1tmPaPC5mDjtwdJRDRk4rierm9V4gEAtC2BkMvtiEGjv0MFqduWpJt/zJ9O/Y4B3xQzpFmgkg8==N6/l-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----",

I've read what you wrote more than 100 times since I've been on the forum, and of all those posts revealing the secrets and mysteries of the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, in the end there was one big nothing. I would personally respect the right to privacy of every person who has made it clear that they want it, especially those whose lives could be in danger if their true identity is known. If you hadn't asked for a tip, I might have thought that there was at least a 1% chance that you got something, and this way I think you're just fishing in murky water.",

Together, we can continue unraveling the mysteries surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto and his profound impact on the cryptocurrency landscape.There is no need for voting because you engaged in fruitless research. I am still wondering what will be the positive effect of unveiling Satoshi to the community. Satoshi has done his part in creating Bitcoin and he can contribute to the system from anywhere if he wants, so there is no need to know him. I think his anonymity is better for the community than exposing his identity. There are more challenges facing the Bitcoin space and I think you should do more research on that than wasting your time on something that is not beneficial. I will not be surprised if you start asking members for money if they want to access information about the identity of Satoshi.",

My opinion is that Satoshi died a long time ago. If he had been alive, he would have presented himself many years ago. at that time when he created bitcoin, it was a time when if he had presented himself, he would have had problems with governments, he would have been persecuted. But today things are different, no government would persecute youif you want people to believe in you, then try harder, record a video with satoshi signing a message, you can also give us his instagram, so we know everything about his life, because nowadays we don't even need to interact with other people live, they post everything they do on Instagram   But stop joking, bring concrete proof. I've been on this forum since 2016 and I've seen a lot of news about a lot of guys claiming to be satoshi and at the end of the day they're faketoshis",

I can even buy iamsatoshinakamoto.com, and when asked for a receipt, tell them to write that it belongs to \"Satoshi Nakamoto\".

We spoke; he prefers to remain anonymous, as has always been his wish. On the other hand, I have ambitious plans and enjoy conversing with brilliant minds. I am fortunate enough to have been mentored by Satoshi Nakamoto of this era, though I prefer to be called Alex. He has guided me through launching and maintaining blockchain projects. Please refer to my GitHub at https://github.com/X1COIN/X1COINI. I have many plans but didn't know much until I was contacted and mentored by Satoshi. Whether you believe me or not, it's going to happen. Satoshi will advise me on how to prove to you that I am in communication on this thread or if the moderator would like me to create a new thread I will.Please advise,Alex ElbannaLet me ask you this, why the hell would Satoshi, who chose to remain anonymous forever after creating Bitcoin, contact and mentor a random person out of nowhere and let them know his identity? We know he isn't a fool, so maybe you think we are a bunch of fools because there is no f***ing way he has done something like that even if he is alive and kicking.I'm pretty sure that if he is alive and has ever wanted to reveal his identity, he would have a thousand different and much better ways to do that instead of doing this. So please, stop with all this BS.What receipts are you talking about anyway? We live in an advanced world, anyone can make edits or do things that would make viewers feel what's seen is real, but I'm not going to believe any of what you may show no matter how realistic it may seem.",
