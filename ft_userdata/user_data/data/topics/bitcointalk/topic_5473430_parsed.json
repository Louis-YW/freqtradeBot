Quote from: rockem5 on November 09, 2023, 03:42:29 AMAny airdrops you guys are farming?Yes, I have done MarginFi, and few others found through this Twitter thread [1]. If it's true that solana airdrop season is just starting, we might see other projects taking interactions done here for their airdrop if these themselves don't do drop like we have previously seen in ethereum. If you have been eligible for some other airdrops, you can take part of it and farm others, so you lose nothing from your own pocket. [1] https://twitter.com/MetisCharter/status/1731841754972753940",
