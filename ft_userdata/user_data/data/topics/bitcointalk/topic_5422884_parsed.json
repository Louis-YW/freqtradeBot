ThanksMake sure the address you are sending Bitcoins to is correct.Also, the amount of BTC you send is not too small (check the units you use in Electrum). https://bitcoinelectrum.com/frequently-asked-questions/#why-am-i-getting-the-error-message-dust-outputs.Or try changing the electrum server (Tools-Network).Or if it still doesn't work, try looking at the error details in the debug logs (https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-docs/blob/master/faq.rst#how-to-enable-debug-logging).",
