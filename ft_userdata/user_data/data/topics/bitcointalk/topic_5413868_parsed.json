  "content": "On sportbooks, I have noticed some odds lower than 1.1. I definitely know that if people are not going for such low odds, bookmakers would stop adding such low odds. Even 1.08 is still better (understand me correctly, I am not saying it is better), I have noticed odds like 1.02 and 1.01. On in-play (live matches), I have even noticed 1.001 up to 1.005 to be included. Why are people going for these kinds of low odds?Assuming I have $10 to bet with this week, going for 1.02 odd, the profit is $0.2. That means I have to bet 50 times of the same 1.02 odds to get $10 in return. But my $10 betting fund which I could lose in just a single bet. Is it worth it? I am thinking it does not worth it at all. Why are some people going for non valued bet of such low odds? It would only encourage them to increase the amount of money they stake on a bet and yet losing it at once is possible. Not a good strategy at all. What is your opinion?",

His point was he is not looking to the number odds but rather to the probability of the pick to actually win regardless of what odds it is. This is true if you are a real sports bettor. You are not betting for the odds but rather to let your pick win because players usually support the players that’s why they are placing there bets on it that’s why there are still players that still betting on small odds on the fight.Eg Mayweather vs Mediocre boxer. Odds will obviously small for Mayweather but still people choose him over pther player even with insane odds because people knew that Mayweather will win.",

I don't look the odds but in this case I am evaluating the event. And I'll try always to place a bet in a event that I am confident it will happens or If I think there is a good chance to \"exchange\" the odds after I bet on this event. Directly from my topic about betting advice:Quote9° Play ONLY when you are sure to win! But REMEMBER: there is not an easy betting [RULE 7] (at least for the 99.99% of the case), because, everything it's possible, and when a bet it's really to simple to win... is not quoted!!!!Don't trust (again) tipster, likewise some one on facebook that sell H/F time bet of rigged match... ( I don't believe in this user, because if you play by yourself you can become rich with only one bet!)of course this not means I am always trying to find bet with such lower odds, but just that also these bets have \"some value\" even for small amount.",

What is your opinion?Low odds and high odds are just a thing of choice. The gamblers that taste both sides knows what strategy to bet with depending on what works for them. Particularly for me when I want to bet I search for possible high odd games to bet and not low odds because it is a game of luck, whether high odd or low odds. And you have answered the question for low odd players. They boost the odds with additional money to be a reasonable winning potential and that is what works for them, we don't have to be surprised why they do that.",

Maybe they don't want to go for the higher odds to reduce tension i.e, if you wanna stake with $30 or $100 and you ended up select 4 matches at average of 1.5 or 2 odds each which would gives us 8 odds or thereof then Staking with $100 will give you a good value, therefore consider those staking with $1k would not be as those who stakes with $10. I think the higher your stake the high profit you gain, so despite 1.03 odds or 1.4 with good amount to stake you also have good pay out.",

No odd is staked as sure win in gambling. In a ticket you will be surprised that the lowest odd is the one that will cause you the loss. Usually teams that are given such odds are big teams when they are playing against small team but sometimes there are upsets in such games. However I know some bettors that prefer such ridiculous odds but they push the odds up with extra money so that the potential winning can increase.",

If knowing when not to bet is as important as knowing what bets are worth making, then the concern for reasons why people make their ridiculous bet shouldn't bother one. Just as well put by @Queentoshi, most people derive joy from the satisfaction of just winning. Perhaps one can call it a healthy gambling life style, or playing it safe, or fear of loss syndrome or evenn sheer ignorance on techniques of betting. Whatever be the reasons why persons use such odds is justified by the satisfaction they derive. I would further  like to attribute such joy to that gotten when someone's favorite team wins. Though one doesn't get paid for cheering for his favorite club, but the joy of being a part of a winning team is exhilarating.",

Odds like this on sports don't really attract much attention since the return is too small. However, people usually bet on these odds as the matchmaking isn't balanced which can be interpreted as a sure-win match. But still, it's hard to interpret a sports match as a sure win even with unfair matchmaking since the underdog usually gets underestimated.",
