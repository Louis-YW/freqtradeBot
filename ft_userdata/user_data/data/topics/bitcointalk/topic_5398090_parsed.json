  "content": "The Biggest Loser Raffle...The first \"Biggest Loser Raffle\" (& second) seemed to be enjoyed by all so I thought it might be a good time to do another one.There is no fee to enter, but if you are selected as the biggest loser you are required to pay for the prize.  Due to shipping variances, this raffle will be restricted to continental US shipping addresses only.  If you would like to enter, please have a trading history with positive feedback and be ready to spend BTC and get nothing if you lose.  If you're unsure about participating, drop me a PM and say hi.  2 blocks will be selected to determine the outcome.  The first block selecting the loser and the second block selecting the winner. The winner cannot also be the loser.  The winner will supply a US address and receive their prize once the loser has paid for it.  Payment will be made to: 168WXhArv7Fasqvi2xm5MQMfLhG18jifMeThe cost to enter is a promise to pay $42 in BTC upon completion of the raffle.  You may select as many spots as you'd like.  Please select an open character or characters below to particpate.Participants:0- sweeteye1- FFrankie2- Bullion-n-BTC3- Suzuki Matt4- Cryptogreatdane5- Cryptogreatdane6- PreciousMetapsICT7- Cryptogreatdane8- FFrankie9- Bullion-n-BTCa- PreciousMetapsICTb- bill gatorc- 2stoutd- Cryptogreatdanee- Cryptogreatdanef- Bullion-n-BTC",

I may need to rethink the name of these raffles in the future though.  It feels so much better to give to others than to receive yourself.  There really are no losers here except for those who don't participate.",

Ya, if I lose it's no problem.  It's if I win that would create a weird situation.  I'd basically be taking other people's money through some crypto wizardry, but it's really no different then anyone else winning as far as odds go, so I don't think there's a real issue.  I like to keep these moving, so if we don't fill the last two spots tomorrow I'll come up with some sort of magic to fill them.  Hopefully I wake up to the last 2 spots being taken.  With the price of our beloved cryptos plummeting to middle earth levels, it's nice to have a little fun around here.  EDIT: I can't post on this thread again until someone else does or this post hits 24 hours.  So maybe my \"tomorrow\" comment is more of a guideline than an actual rule.",
