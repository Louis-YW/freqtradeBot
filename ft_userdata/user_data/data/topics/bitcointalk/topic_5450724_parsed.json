But I will like to ask some few questions which goes as follows; 1. Are you the owner of the casino or its representative here on the forum?2. What benefits do people stand to gain using your casino which is quite different from others.3. How long have your casino been in the business?4. Does your casino restrict some regions? Because I tried clicking the link provided above and wasn't granted access",

It doesn't look like a normal domain name. But what I can say that might make me to believe that you are serious is the copper member account. Yes as NeuroticFish said, the company information is not clear for me as well.Because you are not the first person to come here and a project but your project need more explanation in the forum. As it is I don't think anyone will go there and deposit money and start gambling.",

I just don't understand how this would be advantageous for your casinoin your casino there is an esport option but it does not work, from what I see you launched an incomplete casino, this is a bad move in the business world, it reveals that you are in a great hurry to make profits, and this is also a big red flag in my opinion, a person when in a hurry easily becomes a scam",
