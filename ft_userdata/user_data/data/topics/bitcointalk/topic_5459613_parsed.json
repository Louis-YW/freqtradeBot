And what they do in this forum  Dear OP, what do you mean by top 10 most online accounts, i did not know there is anything like top online accounts. well, if you have mentioned it then i think i have to agree with you. And on checking, i found most of the accounts are not actives since 2020 then how can you distinguish them as the most online accounts and most of the accounts has not posted a single post. Comin to the point of why they are here and why they are made. I think until they didn't post we can not find out but most likely they are made to book that specific timeframe. Because from what i have experienced on BTT that, older accounts have most respect by other (maybe i am wrong here). So, that could be the reason of the OP here to book the accounts in the timeframe of 2018.

So, how can you come up with the discussion of twitter and Elon Musk, instead you could also come up with the discussion of Facebook. Because Facebook also not bearing any bot or inactive accounts they consistently banning new and inactive accounts. Well, maybe i am wrong here.",

Have you at least read the replies to this thread? Or at least verified a user on that list?These users never made a single post, it's almost impossible that they did something wrong in the forum.  When bots have a human behind them, I wouldn't say 90%, I would say 100% probability. There is no bot if there is no human to configure it to work.  These users are clearly bots, information scrapers, they log in and collect the data for which they are programmed. The question now that can be raised is what data they collect. But, that might be harder to say.",

Op is talking about Bitcoin Forum - Statistics Center where you can see the list of members with most online time and lot other stats but as far as I know the stats were old and it never updated for years. Someone register on the forum doesn't necessarily need to post but in that case all of them were bots cause look at their online time which is 63+ years but it is not really possible since this forum is just 10+ years old.",

Moreover, only one of the 10 accounts that you describe here is active, because 9 of them have been inactive since August 14, 2020 .So it would be better if you don't spend your time on things that might not be so important to them, because basically they still haven't done anything wrong here",

Maybe that's what Op is thinking.No one was surprised by this finding, especially since they haven't had a single post since signing up.
