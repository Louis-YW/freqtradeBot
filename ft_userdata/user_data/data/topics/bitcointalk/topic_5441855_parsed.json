  "content": "Every day of development is guided by one underlying value: safety. Sure, it can slow down development. But to us, guaranteeing a secure experience and winning your trust is infinitely more important.Internal Tests and AuditIn a nutshell, Ridotto’s development process can be simplified to development, testing, re-testing, tweaking, more re-testing, and finally, an internal audit. It’s rigorous and, yes, mostly comprised of testing. While it may seem extreme, when multiple millions of dollars hang in the balance, there’s no leaving anything to chance.As far as technically possible, we’re here to guarantee complete security. This is why we push testing to the limit and then continue to push with third-party audits like SolidProof.SolidProof Audit: ZERO critical or high issuesSolidProof is one of the most efficient auditing companies in all of blockchain. With a reputation that precedes them, they offer custom, thorough, and transparent reports that classify all manner of security vulnerabilities.We’re happy to announce SolidProof cleared us with zero critical or high issues. This means you can rest assured the lottery is completely random and funds are completely safe.",
