  "content": "I know you must be wondering what's up with my topic right? I too was having a thought over this and I  felt I should bring it here for discussion so we all can share our own various opinions. For quite sometime now all I have been seeing is statements and topics of bitcoin being an investment and it bothered me to look into it and I as well stand to be corrected logically and with facts with respect to this conversation.The sole reason why bitcoin was invented was to serve the purpose of digital money for which it was clearly stated on the white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto as captured below by quote;QuoteBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.    Bitcoin White PaperIf you look at the top page of the while paper, it is clearly written there and there was no captions like investment  attached to it or being mentioned by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. Now I ask how come it deviated to being an investment?. I have read all through the white paper and never saw anything like investment but rather \" an electronic peer 2 peer cash payment system\" which means bitcoin is money but in a digital way of making payments. So how come it became an investment?I believe in the course of adding more value to it's existence, whales bought large volume by market manipulation at the early stage of bitcoin inception and those who couldn't stand the market wave sold out giving way for the whales to take over the market and since then along with other occurrence and scenarios,  bitcoin became an investment and store of value aka digital gold as per say as it worked out for the whales according to their schemes. Would it be that easy to correct that notion of bitcoin being called an investment other than money. When it is used for payment of goods and services on daily basis and we having full custody of our funds in a digital way would it be necessary we calling it an investment aside the price increase which is fluctuating and barely stable for a long time.? I believe Satoshi Nakamoto the sole originator of the bitcoin knows much better than everyone why he invented the bitcoin and I also would be looking forward to his reappearance be it pseudo anonymous or otherwise to making some notable observations on the bitcoin journey so far.",

So how come it became an investment?Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin isn't a digital payment system but also a store of value. It is a virtual currency as well as an asset but we can say it a Virtual asset where gold is a physical asset. So Bitcoin becomes too much popular as an investment because of its price volatility. You can say every asset who has price volatility or a potential chances to climb up it can be called as an investment. But the problem is Bitcoin isn't Physical asset that's why you are discussing here. In short Volatility makes Bitcoin as an investment.Although I don't think without volatility or potential growth we can't say any asset as a investment like stable coins USDT, BUSD. But there also have a little price fluctuation so they aren't a perfect investment.",

So how come it became an investment?This happened because money is no longer a store of value, when commodity currencies were first created one of the problems a great deal of them had is that you could not use them for long before the material from which they were made deteriorated, precious metals solved that issue as they can last forever, and once they were minted into coins of the same weight we finally got money as we know it.However fiat currencies do not store value, as such bitcoin was created in a world in which our money no longer performs perhaps its most important function, so while bitcoin can be used as a currency and you can buy whatever you want with it, it makes more sense to keep it, as what you can buy with fiat goes down while what you can buy with bitcoin goes up, making bitcoin not only a currency but an investment as well.",

There is a quote from Satoshi, which is that during the next 20 years, Bitcoin will have either many transactions or zero effect.I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume -- Satoshi NakamotoIn other words, there will be a high demand for Bitcoin, and since the supply is only limited, we can say that the price will rise, so can we consider this as a sign from Satoshi because the price of Bitcoin will rise?All possibilities are now available, but the end result is that Bitcoin is a high-risk investment and can lead to zero.",

This is very true with real estate but can also be true with anything like art object and yes even luxurious bags and other properties. Now, of course, the same is true with Bitcoin. Now, this is a very basic concept with investing and as a BTC enthusiast it would be good if you can familiarize yourself with the term and the concept.",

Satoshi must have known altogether that Bitcoin will have this tendency. It's money. It's scarce. It has a growing demand. As a result, it will have an increasing value unlike fiat which is decreasing because it is unlimited. Therefore, many people will probably keep it more than spend it. Satoshi was certainly mindful of the ratio of 21 million coins to several billion people. He/she/they knew that some coins will be lost for good and it will have an effect on the value of the ones that remain in circulation.

Satoshi has definitely mentioned that it is a peer-to-peer digital currency system, but in reality, Bitcoin worked well as an investment that outperformed multiple billion-dollar enterprises. So I see no issues in looking at it as an investment, but rather a great investment. In the free market rule, an asset usually finds its own way based on usage and demand. So Bitcoin worked well in that category. Also, I personally believe, Bitcoin will never be considered as a currency unless its price stabilizes. People usually do not like to let go of an opportunity. Bitcoin is an opportunity.",

Just like Gold which is rarely used by common people to trade and after finding out about its value they decide to hold the little they have just to beat the devaluation of the fiat is why bitcoin is used too. Currently it is more of an investment than a currency it was intended for because this, should nations begin to relax laws against it and it is used more freely for buying and selling of goods then it would be treated as a currency. But investment purpose of it would never be eliminated because of its value and scarcity.",
