Usually there is always someone crazy to pay these prices for a ASIC.this one came out July this year it was not around when doge was at 50-70 centsAs for having 1 million doge our four team partner ship had 2 million doge.We cashed too much too soonWe then held the rest too long.Still our 2 million doge was acquired for about 0.002 cents or 4000we did make good money on it close to 100k and we have about 400000 leftbut 2 million x 70 cents = 1.4 million usdso 100 k vs 1.4 million is tough to look at.",

      "body": "We all sold doge way too early. I remember I bought a bunch at like 20 sats because if you load DogeBTC on Poloniex you will see that whenever doge hits 15-25 sat area it always has a crazy rally. Poloniex chart is the only one that shows this because it’s like the oldest exchange for doge.Anyways so I bought a bunch at 20 sats and set some limit orders at 50 sats and 99 sats and would just forget about it. Well shortly after I got that fill at 20 sats Elon started to pump it and it immediately filed at both limit sells.Then it went to like 1000 sats along with BTC pumping and I sold long ago. Not the only one feeling like an idiot.",

I'm sure you knew they exists.If you wish to discuss this do not do it here I have a thread about my signature.The entire point of this thread is goldshell ltc lite miner.this is the thread on my signaturehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5411661.0as for kadena also off topic i do not mine it.I do mine grin with two ipollo mini miners and have a thread on that.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414241.0note i quoted your post so all info is on it.and your question is legit. but I would like to answer it on the other thread.",
