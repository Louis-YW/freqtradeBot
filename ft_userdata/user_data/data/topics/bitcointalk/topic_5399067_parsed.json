      "body": "If using bollinga band and the lower line is reached with red candle stick, with relative strength index of 30%, that indicates oversold market already, someone can buy, but that does not mean when it hits 30% RSI, it can hit 40% RSI and the market can go up back, it can go below 30%, like going 20% before the market can start going on back, the more it goes below, the better time to buy. Also that is how is it for overbought market when the green candle stick hit the upper line of the band, it means overbought market, if the RSI is at around 70%, 80% or higher, it is better to sell at the time.But use the money you can afford to lose because you can buy in oversold market and the price still go down further, you can also short (sell) in overbought market and the market price continue to increase, these happen especially during high volatile market. Trade with the amount you can afford to lose and use very low leverage, I prefer 1x margin ratio.",

Is this something i can actually catch during the day, or is this just what it looks like after it already happened?",

I will advice you to go back and comprehend the rudiments of trading and most especially the understanding of movement of candle sticks.",

Look at the market right now it's very stable unlike a few days ago when the price of BTC hits $26k and all other coins are affected you should notice many candlesticks hits lower of BB at that time. So I suggest don't rush because your strategy is not for daily trading if you want to trade daily then I suggest you switch to another strategy and try to look for Williams fractal which is mostly used for a minute or daily trading.",

Bollinga band and RSI work for both long term and short term trading, but I am not that sure about long term because I have preferred to use long term prediction for that, which means if the price of bitcoin has decreased to a price very low, I can buy, wait for the price to rise very well and sell. But for short term, I have used these two indicators and both works well with bollinga band bringing effective result. It works for 15 minutes and 1 hour candle sticks very well, but the shorter the time the shorter the best time to leave the market by closing the position opened.",

So waiting for the right time is a good trading skill and don't allow your emotion to always control you.To BB you mentioned, it also have different time frame and you didn't mention the time you use. Bollinger band is an indicator that goes after the market so it is not reliable. Using RSI and MA that indicate overbought or oversold are still not certain for a reversal immediately but it only prepares you ahead that trend can change soon.",

Over time, you will realize that those indicators repaint and aren't reliable on their own. I used \"repaint\" in the sense that those indis adjust to price and aren't firm in relating with price. For a better prediction, add a line indicator of support and resistance to those two you mentioned. Again, bear in mind that there's nothing like bottom and top in the real sense of trading. So, waiting or aiming for a top or bottom is a wrong move.",
