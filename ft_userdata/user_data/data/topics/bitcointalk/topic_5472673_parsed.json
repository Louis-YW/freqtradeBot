  "content": "Hello Bitcoiners, so today, i thought i should share an information i found online, which i thought to be very insightful and might bring a sigh of relieve to anyone and everyone that have always had the thought of quantum computers being a threat to the long-term existence of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network at large. Over the years, there have been some serious discussions around the coming of quantum computers and how it will completely destroy Bitcoin due to its speed in processing data and information, some even believed that quantum computers can reveal the private key to a wallet just by using the public key, and this it can achieve in a matter of days, something normal computers cannot do even if given one million years.So, while doing some research on this sometime last week, I came across this post on X (formally known as twitter), which completely changed my perspective on this subject, I will repost here the tweet, and in quote.QuoteNot even Quantum computers will be able to defeat Bitcoin and the literal BTC networkhear me out, Quantum computing represents a fundamental leap from traditional computing,Unlike classical computers, which process information in bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits, Through the principles of superposition and entanglement, can hold and process a vast amount of information more efficiently than classical bits. This efficiency makes quantum computers particularly adept at solving certain types of problems much faster than classical computers.Now, relating this to Bitcoin,BTC's security largely hinges on cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256 for hashing and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for wallet security. Classical computers, even the most powerful, would require impractical amounts of time to break these algorithms. But, a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could, in theory, solve these problems much more \"rapidly.\"in theory. Particularly, \"Shor's algorithm\" in quantum computing poses a theoretical threat to ECDSA, potentially enabling the derivation of private keys from public keys.I fundamentally disagree with the overstated fears around quantum computing's threat to Bitcoin. There are several key arguments to consider:Practicality and Timeframe,The current state of quantum computing is far from being able to threaten Bitcoin. The largest quantum computers today are still experimental and nowhere near the number of qubits required to break Bitcoin's cryptography. This development is likely decades away, giving the Bitcoin community ample time to implement post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.Network Consensus and Adaptation,Any changes to Bitcoin's cryptographic algorithms would require network consensus, which is a cornerstone of Bitcoin's decentralized ethos. This consensus-driven approach means the community is unlikely to let Bitcoin become vulnerable to quantum attacks.Misplaced Priorities,The worry about quantum computing breaking Bitcoin's cryptography often misses a larger point. If quantum computing reaches such an advanced stage, Bitcoin will not be the only technology at risk. The entire fabric of digital security, including banking, national security, and internet privacy, would be in jeopardy. In such a scenario, Bitcoin's vulnerability would be part of a much larger crisis.For every measure there is a countermeasure taking place, always remember this. Bitcoin has substantial economic backing and community. This support system provides strong incentives to maintain the network's security against all types of threats, including quantum computing.The narrative that quantum computing will \"break\" Bitcoin fails to account for the dynamic and resilient nature of Bitcoin's technology and community.https://x.com/MDBitcoin/status/1720088832660713888?s=20I personally believe everything he said to be true, though i am less knowledgeable in the technical side of bitcoin, but i trust we have users on this board who are highly Knowledgeable in this aspect, what do you guys think? i will love to further broaden my knowledge on this subject.",

Although for now, there are definitely other higher priority than choose and implement QC-resistant cryptography.You are right, should we be faced with the possibility of this happen where a quantum computer is created to break the hash then, there is definitely going to be a transfer of addresses to a better and more secure cryptography. Nobody is actually ruling out this possibility but the only thing is it wouldn’t come so sudden and at such there will be more time for a switch away from the current algorithm. Satoshi himself is looking at that possibility as he clearly stated here Quote from: satoshi on June 14, 2010, 08:39:50 PMSHA-256 is very strong.  It's not like the incremental step from MD5 to SHA1.  It can last several decades unless there's some massive breakthrough attack.If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash in an orderly way.  The software would be programmed to start using a new hash after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade by that time.  The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash can't be used.",

Let me use time and space.With current technology, you can not achieve anything remotely close to 1% of the speed of light, so you can't even think about the possibility of time travel.But guess what? You can time travel by a different way, for example, whenever you look at the sun (hopefully indirectly) you are seeing around 8 minutes in the past, looking at stars will give you thousands and millions of years view of the past, now imagine that all the knowledge and information already exist, we can't just access them all at once. If you don't believe me, do some research on dejavu, something we all have experienced in our lives.Now how did humanity invent computer? How did humanity invent quantum computer? I'm sure they were all humans working hard to obtain the necessary knowledge to invent such technologies. Whether it is more likely to have a strong QC or a simple math formula, that's debatable.",

Quantum computers are likely never going to do any useful cryptography related stuff. And Shor's algorithm is yet to be implemented, it exists just on paper, and very small and truncated versions happened. With current hardware, to even have a theoretical chance at ECDLP, one needs more than 28*1015 qubits - this is 28 Peta qubits. Even with ideal, zero noise QC, one needs 126*109 Toffoli gates.And something more about the all-hyped Shor's algorithm:Quote from: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10072We consider Shor's quantum factoring algorithm in the setting of noisy quantum gates. Under a generic model of random noise for (controlled) rotation gates, we prove that the algorithm does not factor integers of the form pq when the noise exceeds a vanishingly small level in terms of n - the number of bits of the integer to be factored, where p and q are from a well-defined set of primes of positive density. We further prove that with probability 1−o(1) over random prime pairs (p,q), Shor's factoring algorithm does not factor numbers of the form pq, with the same level of random noise present.Well, looks like even quantum error correction wouldn't help with ECDLP. All quantum hope is gone.",

The thing is: there is no point to talking about \"reversal\", because it is undefined. Hash functions are simply one-way. There may be an algorithm some day that takes as input a hash and produces as output one pre-image. But, there are theoretically more than that. It is the same as talking about \"reversal\" to a modulus operation.

The thing is, since these mofos solve and compute stuff exponentially compared to the conventional computers, there's a great propensity that even if it weren't able to crack the SHA-256 encryption system from the get-go, it's only going to be time, time that you can even count on your fingers before it could crack the code. So yeah, we can stay deluded and happy that the bitcoin network would be safe against Quantum Computers once these things get commercially available, or we can ready ourselves and prepare harder layer 2 solutions or security systems that would fend off hack attacks that would come from these new-gen tech pieces.",

Moreover, he stated that there are already some discussions about moving to more quantum-resistant cryptography. “I often hear what it really is, and I think, quantum computing is more of a threat to the banking system than Bitcoin,” he added.While for Padilla, quantum computing will be a security threat to Bitcoin, “but in the same manner that it will be a threat to all existing encryption technologies.”“Therefore, lahat (everything) will be affected. Nevertheless, there are already some designs that are being introduced to make the encryption resistant,” he stated.Padilla also stressed that due to Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, the community can implement proposals to incorporate quantum-resistant technologies to protect the Bitcoin Network if they deem it necessary and urgent.",

      "body": "From the little bit of research I've done into the topic, the main threat to Bitcoin from quantum computing, once it becomes mature, is that there's roughly 2 million bitcoin (including Satoshi's ~1 million btc) that I guess were mostly from coinbase txs (miner rewards) that haven't moved since way back in the early days and are still held in the original pay-to-public-key format that exposed the public key of the receiver.Eventually quantum computing is supposed to be able to break the public key to find the associated private key in bitcoin's non-quantum-resistant cryptography in a reasonable amount of time. So there's around 2 million bitcoin, most of which are likely \"lost\" bitcoin, which WILL eventually be stolen by whoever first targets bitcoin once quantum computing is sufficiently powerful. All other bitcoin aren't at risk because we pay to the hashed address which apparently quantum computing isn't supposed to be able to break, but those really old never-moved bitcoin are just waiting to be stolen by quantum computers.Some of those old ~2 million bitcoin are likely not lost and can be moved before a quantum threat materializes, but probably the vast majority of that amount if up for grabs. Only way I see that threat being nullified is a hard fork that breaks backwards compatibility - something that so far has essentially been seen by devs and the community as never going to happen because it breaks the concept of Bitcoin being immutability. I think you'd need a hard fork to cut those old at-threat bitcoin off and excise them from the supply, leaving bitcoin with roughly 19 million total supply instead of 21 million.I'm no expert but from the research I've done this is what I understand is the case. So if this is all true then at some point, perhaps as soon as sometime next decade, we are going to have a quantum threat that likely results in a hard fork likely not done by the main bitcoin devs, with bitcoin-core devs and some of the community sticking with original bitcoin and allowing 2 million bitcoin to get stolen and hit the market, and some of the community going with an immutability-broken Bitcoin fork that blacklists those at-threat bitcoin and stays safe from the quantum attack. Will be very interesting to see how the quantum threat and the bitcoin response plays out over the next decade or two. Could be very dangerous, and needless to say the price ramifications would be unimaginable if 2 million lost bitcoin are over a short time stolen and dumped on the market (and whoever did that would be one of the wealthiest entities on earth).But we've likely got a bunch of years before this happens. And yes as the OP mentioned quantum computing puts at risk basically all our internet security of course, bitcoin is just one small thing in that. But the future of Bitcoin will likely eventually rest on the decisions (perhaps very controversial) made on what to do, if anything, about the quantum threat.",
