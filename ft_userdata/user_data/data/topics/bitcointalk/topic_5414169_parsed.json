  "content": "I've been noticing this particular aspect in this forum since I joined in February of this year. Many legendary members do not receive more merits than lower rank members, in my opinion. This led me to believe that they had attained the highest rank and didn't require merit to move up. They can contribute whenever they want or not, and even provide detailed answers to questions that deserve to be answered. They only comment when they feel it is necessary and add to their post count, which is especially important for signature campaigns. What I’m curious about is that only a few legendary guys are always active in the forum and providing lasting solutions to questions posed in the forum. Others that are active only post to complete their signature posts. Does that imply that after getting to legendary rank, making posts or comments to be merited is not necessary again? Kudos to those legendary guys that are always active and provide solutions to questions even when they’re not on any campaign. They’re amongst the real heroes here. Many people used to come here to shitpost before the merit system was implemented. Merits were airdropped for users back then; is this why they don't understand the value of being a legendary because they didn't earn it through their knowledge contributions to the forum, but rather by simply posting whatever they wanted?I recall a thread from this forum when a newbie asked a question about this:  “Is there any specific Boards for newbies to Make Posts/Comments?This particular reply baffled me and was prompt to ask this question on this topic today.Quote from: NeuroticFish on July 14, 2022, 01:09:24 PMYou should not be scared by any ranks. Some have earned their ranks for knowledge, some only by simply being very old here (but not necessarily knowledgeable). Even newbies can ask or tell smart things, even legendary members can ask or tell stupid things and make mistakes.Can we conclude that not all legendaries are knowledgeable in the forum? I myself was scared to answer or quote legendaries when I initially joined the forum. This post is not to disregard any legendary rank member in this forum. I only came up with this topic out of curiosity",

Does that imply that after getting to legendary rank, making posts or comments to be merited is not necessary again?Some Legendary might care about the amount of merit they get, it's some kind of race or just fun. But honestly, I don't think they will post for merit even though some of them want to get it [non-merit source] to distribute to other users. However, they also need to maintain the quality of their posts even if they've rank up to Legendary. I've reported a lot of bad quality Legendary posts, that means even Legendary should still care about post quality.Quote from: Hyphen(-) on September 19, 2022, 09:11:50 PMCan we conclude that not all legendaries are knowledgeable in the forum?

So making quality posts is still a must if you want to get Merits.why do they (Legend) need Merit?because they must have a limit of sMerit that can be distributed. While they also definitely want to help beginners or motivate beginners to make quality posts. sometimes sending Merit makes the beginner more motivated to make his writing better.the contributions of the legends are indispensable. Even I saw many useful threads written by Legendaries.and feel free to give them Merit. because They also need Merit to be sent back to the members under them they want to encourage so they can be more excited in this forum.I also don't deny that there are some Legendary members who only make posts to fulfill their obligations in the signature Campaign they participate in. but that's their right. and I hope that if one day we become Legendary, then we should continue to be useful to the people in this forum.Don't care about Rank, if the member makes a post that is useful and deserves Merit then just give it, no matter what the Rank.because even Legendary Ranks (who are not Merit Sourch) need Merit so that they can contribute to meriting the Members with Ranks below them as well.Even a Merit Sourch deserves a Merit if they make a post that is useful and deserves an award. because that's one of the Merit Functions in my mind.but it's up to everyone to make a post useful or not and it doesn't matter what rank it is.",

I've noticed that legendary members still acquire a ton of merit, despite not practically needing it in order to rank up, but because they're worthy members of this community. I think there's even a thread here showing how merit has been distributed.Although it may suck for newcomers, I didn't find it too hard to rank up. I was here before the introduction of the merit system and had managed to rank up to Sr Member. In approximately 2017 or 2018, the merit system was introduced. I a little after Bitcoin's crash, which took away all my interest in Bitcoin. I quit shortly after, not because of the merit system, but because I completely lost my faith in Bitcoin. Signature campaigns were much more popular back then and finding one wouldn't be that much of a hassle, but most of them were paying in terms of BTC and not USD. Thus, the rewards were minimal due to Bitcoin's value. At least in the campaigns I participated in.I returned in early 2021, during the Covid-19 quarantine and after Bitcoin had skyrocketed once again. I didn't have any merit except the 250 I was distributed due to being a Sr Member. Within approximately 1.5 years, I earned more than 250 merits without acknowledging too much of Bitcoin's technicalities in order to further assist the community. I didn't have too much available time between university and a full-time job, but I managed to rank up by trying to make worthwhile discussions and posts and being patient enough.",

A lot of \"manuals\" created by beginners are subsequently challenged by more senior ranks. What does it say? Don't try to be cooler than you are.

You become content with it and the quality of your contributions decreases because you know there is nothing higher/better. 2. You don't let the rank affect what you do on the forum and you continue with your quality contributions.Since you mentioned signature campaigns, campaign managers will check the post quality of applicants. Low quality posting won't land you a place in a good campaign no matter your rank. Your chance of being accepted is greater if you are of a lower rank with many merits than a legendary with just a couple of them. Not that long ago, ChipMixer accepted a member who couldn't even wear the signature because his rank didn't allow it yet. He still got accepted despite dozens of Legendary members applying for a spot.  Merits and rank are not always a sign of superior knowledge.

I understand why theymos is being quiet about addressing these questions. It's never going to stop. If theymos were to add one more rank for let's say +5.000 merits, someone would come along and say what about those who have 10.000 merits? Can't they be in their own club? And what about when someone reaches 50 or 100k merits, can we do something special for them now?",
