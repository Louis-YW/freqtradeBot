  "content": "Hi. I am a beginner at best as this is my first attempt on OC or mining in general. I started going straight into pure ETH mining.My PC is a usual (I think PC gamers PC from few years ago) which can be checked here: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/TnbTMb.Exact card model MSI GeForce GTX 1080 GAMING X 8GB GDDR5X, GPU BIOS 86.4.17.0.50, nvidia driver: 512.53 (30.0.15.1259) on Windows 10Before jumping in I watched a tonne of stuff from multiple yt channels and read some topics on forums including here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5312518.0 (just fg.).I follow the steps of most guides but already fail at step one which is using OhGodAnETHlargementPill or --mt 6 in Trex or -straps 5 in Phoenix. My PC (while GPU is on full stock settings but FAN 90%) just crushes every single time. I have tried all 6 --mt settings and all straps settings to no avail. Even if I try starting the miners on stock settings and then starting OhGodAnETHlargementPill it still cruses. The only way I can make use of those memory tweakers is to overclock the GPU and then start them. For me it doesnt really make sense but at least I am not in complete hole when it comes to efficiency like when I just go stock settings.So I went down and up the GPU and MEM speed without the PILL and found the best settings with no crush in miners is GPU +135 and MEM +580. Going minus is dropping the hashrates hard.So I use MSI afterburner and my numbers while mining are:Full STOCK no ETHPILL:GPU #0: MSI GTX 1080 - 22.53 MH/s, [T:66C, P:131W, F:70%, E:171kH/W]GPU 1898MEM 5005BEST high OC settings I can find without ETHPILL:GPU #0: MSI GTX 1080 - 26.50 MH/s, [T:57C, P:150W, F:70%, E:176kH/W]GPU +135 (but in afterburner it shows 2050)MEM +580 (afterburner it shows 5583)BEST low OC settings I can find without ETHPILL:GPU #0: MSI GTX 1080 - 25.57 MH/s, GPU -270 (but in afterburner it shows 1645)MEM +580 (afterburner it shows 5583)After a while of playing with this I discovered that when I am running this high OC settings above I can start the ETHPILL and it works to some degree. Numers are better but also power usage is insane:BEST high OC settings I can find without ETHPILL:GPU #0: MSI GTX 1080 - 33.14 MH/s, [T:58C, P:168W, F:70%, E:198kH/W]GPU +135 (but in afterburner it shows 2050)MEM +580 (afterburner it shows 5583)So I just cant image this card pulling 170W almost doing 33MHs so I started playing with Power Limit and The best I can come up with is PL 52 which is very low but honestly the first -40 levels do not change shit all. Only after going -41 starts to dip the wattage and MHs with it. Here are the numbers:GPU #0: MSI GTX 1080 - 29.60 MH/s, [T:51C, P:126W, F:70%, E:239kH/W] (overnight does go to 30.2MHs)GPU +135 (clock drops in range 1820 - 1860 due to power limitations)MEM +580I am running everything with Admin rights 100%.I basically willing to try anything (maybe except bios flash) since I have run out of ideas here and on this very forum I saw ppl posting the same cards with 30MHs while taking 100W or the cards doing 38-40MHs with more the same Power Usage I currently have. I am sort of stuck in the middle of this with worse of both worlds low MHs and high Power consuption.Thanks a million.",

I will test ETC in a few days but I dont know if it can be paid out in NANO on 2miners where I am currently set up at. I do admit that finding a video or topic with 1080 where it is less then 6 months with concrete data is hard.ad 2. I cannot, anything over +135 on core drops the MHs buy more then 10%. After crossing 140 its a crash.ad 3. Here I am confused really since the game is about efficiency I thought. I can either stay at PL 52 doing 30.30MHs at 125W or go to PL 100 and do 33.20MHs at 165W or more. So thats a sub 10% MHs increase (2.9Mhs) for ~32% power increase. Absolutely not worth it in my opinion.Also I have been able to fix the stability issue. Swtiched to using afterburner GPU +135, MEM +580, PL 52, FAN 65% then starting TREX and finally starting ETHPILL.",

You can withdraw with Lightning Network too or even change your BTC to USDC and keep in dollarsThere are a lot of possibilities to explore  And another thing, I suggested you to Nicehash just to try and see how your card will perform, you can eliminate problems and find what's the problem",

Some miners are afraid to use ETHPILL on the main PC. I want to explain to you that this video card, when mining ethereum, consumed 150-170 watts from the wall on the Gold PSU. GTX 1070 consumed 125-140 watts.I think that you understand that you need to count the consumption from the wall. If the video card consumes 100 watts, then the consumption from the wall will be 108 watts for example.",

Because of that you also need different oc settings to achieve the best results. Old oc settings that focus on increasing the memory clock don't apply anymore. Nowadays it's best to leave the mem clock stock and slightly overclock the core but there is not a lot of room for improvement. Try +165 core, you can try to push it higher going in steps of 10 but your card wil probably start crashing from +190 and above. The sweet spot for the power setting for me used to be 67%, I think that's still the same. 34-35mh is probably as good as it can get nowadays.I stopped mining ETH with that gpu, the efficiency of that card is more competitive on other algorithms like flux for instance (~0.29sol/w). Currently I am mining FLUX with my 1080 using gminer on herominers pool (zero pool fees) with the following settings added to the batch file:--pl 67 --fan 75 --mt 5 --cclock +125 --mclock +500Mining stats: 42.0 Sol/s 146 W 0.29 Sol/W    47°c  75% fan speed 1683 core 5005 memoryI stopped using the ethlaregementpill because all the miners have it build in nowadays.

Only options is to start mining for like 2-3 minutes and then run ethpill this is the only way I have made it work.In general I prefer to keep mining ETH which 2minters exchanges for free into BTC since its just cheaper with smallish payouts like mine.

Thats not true , if you have a 1080Ti with 11 GB Ram its still a good card for mining for a few Algos.I bought mine straight after the Card was released i guess 5 or 6 years ago or something around that time , and it still mine without any problems.Depends what 1080 Versions you have for sure , and old Cards dont wanted anymore for PC Gamers , they want also the best and new cards.Not all gamers want to buy expensive graphics cardsFor example RTX 3060 and GTX 1080 tihttps://technical.city/ru/video/GeForce-GTX-1080-Ti-protiv-GeForce-RTX-3060The GTX 1080 ti is much better at gaming, according to the test results. I think that the problem is only in the price of the GTX 1080 ti.",
